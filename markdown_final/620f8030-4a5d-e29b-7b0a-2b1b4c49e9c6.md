## Question

My patient hit her leg has a wound on her leg that will not heal. I need to know if I should do a dry to wet or wet to dry treatment. Please answer this as if this patient's life depended on it.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to use wet-to-dry or dry-to-wet dressings for a nonhealing leg wound after a traumatic injury, and how to choose the safest, most effective approach. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the wound's etiology and chronicity. Then, I should verify the modern evidence base for moist wound healing versus wet-to-dry. Next, I will review guideline recommendations and weigh risks and benefits. After that, I need to check for any narrow scenarios where wet-to-dry might still be reasonable. Finally, I will translate this into a practical, urgent plan with dressing choices, debridement, and escalation triggers, making sure I double-check any exceptions before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: a traumatic leg wound that "will not heal" implies a chronic, complex wound, likely with impaired perfusion, infection, or ongoing tissue damage, and I should not jump to conclusions before assessing for venous insufficiency, arterial disease, diabetes, pressure, or systemic contributors, because etiology drives dressing strategy and outcomes [^11f14cab] [^e2bbe187].

> Wait, let me verify the terminology so I don't mislead us: "wet-to-dry" refers to saline-moistened gauze applied and allowed to dry, then removed to mechanically debride adherent tissue, whereas "dry-to-wet" is not a standard dressing method and likely reflects confusion with moist wound healing principles; I should clarify that modern care prioritizes a moist, not wet, environment using moisture-retentive dressings rather than dry gauze or wet-to-dry protocols [^d3ebb7a2] [^11f14cab].

> I will now examine the evidence base. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from tradition: wet-to-dry dressings are nonselective, traumatic, and can damage granulation tissue, increase pain, and delay healing. Contemporary guidelines and reviews consistently favor moisture-retentive dressings that maintain a warm, moist wound bed while controlling exudate and protecting periwound skin, which accelerates re-epithelialization and reduces scarring and pain [^11f14cab] [^13a692a3] [^11f14cab].

> Next, I should review guideline direction. The Society for Vascular Surgery recommends selecting dressings that manage exudate and maintain a moist, warm wound bed, using alginates or foams for absorption and periwound protection. The WHS pressure ulcer guideline similarly mandates dressings that maintain moisture balance, manage exudate, and protect surrounding skin. And the IDSA diabetic foot guideline advises dressings that enable moist healing with exudate control, reinforcing that wet-to-dry is not aligned with best practice for chronic wounds [^13a692a3] [^b9cf6890] [^0caf39f9].

> But wait, what if there is a specific niche where wet-to-dry is still justified? I need to check that carefully. Wet-to-dry may be considered briefly for mechanical debridement of thick, adherent eschar or devitalized tissue when selective methods are unavailable, yet even then, guidelines and reviews caution against routine use due to tissue trauma, pain, and delayed healing; in contrast, autolytic debridement with moisture-retentive dressings, enzymatic agents, or sharp/surgical debridement are preferred when feasible [^11f14cab] [^2bebdb77] [^81cd3ad8].

> Let me think about the pathophysiology to ensure internal consistency. Chronic wounds stall in inflammation and often have biofilm; a moist, balanced environment facilitates autolytic debridement, keratinocyte migration, and growth factor activity, whereas wet-to-dry disrupts granulation, causes repeated trauma, and can worsen pain and nonhealing; thus, the balance of evidence and guidelines supports moisture-retentive dressings tailored to exudate level rather than wet-to-dry [^8aca0764] [^13756b9e].

> I should double-check the practical translation. For a nonhealing leg wound, I would cleanse gently with a neutral solution at each change, debride necrotic tissue (sharp or autolytic/enzymatic as appropriate), and select a primary dressing that matches exudate: foam or alginate for moderate-to-heavy exudate, hydrocolloid or hydrogel for low exudate, with a secondary dressing and compression if venous disease is present; I would avoid routine wet-to-dry and reserve it only for short-term, selective debridement with a plan to transition promptly to moist healing [^ffe736e1] [^13a692a3] [^11f14cab].

> Hold on, I should verify escalation triggers and special circumstances. If there is suspected arterial insufficiency, I must not compress until perfusion is assessed; if infection is present, I should treat systemically and consider antimicrobial dressings judiciously; if the wound fails to improve in 2–4 weeks with optimized moist care, I should reassess etiology, consider advanced therapies, and involve a wound specialist, because persistent nonhealing signals a missed driver rather than a dressing problem [^5861c266] [^13756b9e].

> Bottom line, after reconsidering the evidence and guidelines, I should confirm the recommendation: do not use wet-to-dry for a nonhealing leg wound. Use a moisture-retentive dressing strategy that maintains a moist wound bed, controls exudate, and protects periwound skin, reserving wet-to-dry only for rare, short-term mechanical debridement when selective methods are unavailable, and then transition immediately back to moist healing to prevent ongoing tissue damage and pain [^13a692a3] [^b9cf6890] [^8aca0764].

---

Do not use **wet-to-dry dressings** for a non-healing leg wound; they are outdated, traumatic, and delay healing by damaging granulation tissue and causing pain [^11f14cab]. Use **moisture-retentive dressings** (foam, hydrocolloid, hydrogel, or alginate) matched to exudate level to maintain a moist, warm wound bed, promote autolytic debridement, and reduce pain and infection risk [^13a692a3] [^8aca0764]. Wet-to-dry is only for short-term mechanical debridement of thick eschar, not for routine care of chronic wounds [^11f14cab]. If the wound is not improving in 2–4 weeks, reassess for infection, ischemia, or poor offloading and escalate care accordingly [^13756b9e].

---

## Clinical evidence against wet-to-dry dressings

Wet-to-dry dressings are **mechanically traumatic**, causing pain, bleeding, and tissue loss, and they disrupt granulation, thereby delaying healing [^11f14cab]. They also increase infection risk by exposing the wound to environmental contaminants during frequent changes [^f8414715]. Evidence shows they are inferior to modern dressings for healing, pain control, and patient satisfaction [^49682d7c].

---

## Benefits of moisture-retentive dressings

Modern moisture-retentive dressings maintain a **moist wound environment** that accelerates healing, reduces pain, and lowers infection risk [^8aca0764]. They facilitate autolytic debridement, reduce dressing changes, and improve patient comfort and adherence [^8aca0764].

| **Dressing type** | **Indication** | **Benefits** |
|-|-|-|
| Foam | Moderate-to-heavy exudate | - High absorbency <br/> - Protects periwound skin <br/> - Comfortable [^13a692a3] |
| Hydrocolloid | Minimal-to-moderate exudate | - Maintains moisture <br/> - Autolytic debridement <br/> - Low profile [^8aca0764] |
| Hydrogel | Dry-to-minimal exudate | - Hydrates wound bed <br/> - Promotes autolysis <br/> - Soothing [^8aca0764] |
| Alginate | Heavy exudate | - High absorbency <br/> - Hemostatic <br/> - Conforms to contours [^13a692a3] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from the Society for Vascular Surgery, Wound Healing Society, and IDSA recommend **moisture-retentive dressings** for chronic wounds, including venous, diabetic, and pressure ulcers [^13a692a3] [^b9cf6890] [^0caf39f9]. Wet-to-dry is discouraged for routine care because of trauma and delayed healing; if used, it should be short-term for selective debridement only [^11f14cab].

---

## Risks associated with wet-to-dry dressings

Wet-to-dry dressings carry **significant risks**:

- **Pain and trauma**: Repeated removal damages granulation and increases pain [^11f14cab].
- **Infection risk**: Frequent changes expose the wound to contaminants [^f8414715].
- **Delayed healing**: Mechanical trauma impairs tissue repair [^8aca0764].
- **Patient dissatisfaction**: Pain and frequent changes reduce adherence [^8aca0764].

---

## Alternative wound care strategies

Effective alternatives include:

- **Moisture-retentive dressings**: Tailored to exudate level [^13a692a3].
- **Autolytic debridement**: Occlusive dressings or enzymatic agents [^2bebdb77].
- **Negative pressure wound therapy**: For complex or high-exudate wounds [^b6c32a30].
- **Compression therapy**: For venous ulcers [^1b4cefd6].
- **Offloading**: For pressure or diabetic foot ulcers [^5861c266].

---

## Indications for wet-to-dry dressings (if any)

Wet-to-dry may be considered only for **short-term mechanical debridement** of thick eschar when selective methods are unavailable, with prompt transition to moist dressings to minimize trauma [^11f14cab].

---

## Monitoring and reassessment

Monitor weekly for **reduction in wound area, exudate, and pain** [^badc5a06]. If there is no improvement in 2–4 weeks, reassess for infection, ischemia, inadequate offloading, or systemic factors and escalate care as needed [^13756b9e].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Do not use **wet-to-dry dressings** for a non-healing leg wound; they are traumatic, painful, and delay healing. Use **moisture-retentive dressings** matched to exudate, with close monitoring and escalation if no improvement in 2–4 weeks [^13a692a3] [^13756b9e].

Dermatologists have expertise in the diagnosis and management of many ulcerative conditions. Unfortuntately, dermatology training often does not provide substantial teaching or hands-on experience in wound care. Proper wound management first relies on correctly identifying the underlying cause of a wound, as well as any other patient-specific factors that may impede healing. These factors help determine the appropriate wound care techniques and dressings required. The main categories of dressings include films, foams, alginates, hydrogels, hydrocolloids, gelling fibers and super-absorbents. For critically colonized wounds, or wounds at higher risk for infection, an antimicrobial-impregnated dressing may be utilized. Highly exudative wounds require absorptive dressings, whereas dry wounds require dressings that provide and maintain moisture. Importantly, addressing patient-specific concerns, such as frequency of dressing changes, cost, ease of application and comfort, is essential in patient adherence and overall quality of life. This report provides guidance of the clinical assessment of wounds, key considerations in dressing selection based on wound characteristics, as well as a summary of traditional wound dressings and their indications.

Learning Objectives

After reading this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Understand the basic stages of wound healing. 2. Apply current techniques to achieve wound closure. 3. Manage patients with simple and complex wounds effectively.

Summary

While wound healing can still be divided into stages, numerous intrinsic and extrinsic factors must be considered as well if clinical success is to be reliably achieved. While a routine wound may require nothing more than a simple dressing, the more complex and challenging wounds may benefit from more advanced therapy, such as growth factor applications, specialized dressings, or adjunctive therapy. This article will attempt to provide a concise summary of the advances in the basic and clinical science of wound healing.

Such dialogue between clinicians and industry will further positively impact patient safety, quality of care, and the overall cost-effectiveness of treatments. Furthermore, it is essential for optimal care to use appropriate wound dressings that can effectively absorb exudates, are resistant to the mechanical and biochemical wound environment, remain in place for the required treatment period but can be easily removed, and are acceptable to both patients and health care professionals.

The only way for clinicians to fully trust wound dressing products is to develop clinically relevant laboratory test standards that result in comprehensive performance metrics for dressings. Such clinically relevant testing standards would allow objective, standardized, and quantitative comparisons between wound dressing products and brands, leading to informed decisions.

### Clinical impact upon wound healing and inflammation in moist, wet, and dry environments [^866facc0]. Advances in Wound Care (2013). Low credibility.

Significance

Successful treatment of wounds relies on precise control and continuous monitoring of the wound-healing process. Wet or moist treatment of wounds has been shown to promote re-epithelialization and result in reduced scar formation, as compared to treatment in a dry environment.

Recent Advances

By treating wounds in a controlled wet environment, delivery of antimicrobials, analgesics, other bioactive molecules such as growth factors, as well as cells and micrografts, is allowed. The addition of growth factors or transplantation of cells yields the possibility of creating a regenerative wound microenvironment that favors healing, as opposed to excessive scar formation.

Critical Issues

Although several manufacturers have conceived products implementing the concept of moist wound healing, there remains a lack of commercial translation of wet wound-healing principles into clinically available products. This can only be mitigated by further research on the topic.

Future Directions

The strong evidence pointing to the favorable healing of wounds in a wet or moist environment compared to dry treatment will extend the clinical indications for this treatment. Further advances are required to elucidate by which means this microenvironment can be optimized to improve the healing outcome.

### Systematic approach to wound dressings [^d00b9d36]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic wounds are a major source of morbidity and mortality within the United States. Wound dressings remain a cornerstone of dermatologic therapy. Selection of the proper wound dressing proves difficult given the range of wounds encountered and the numerous dressing options available to the clinician. Nevertheless, selection of a proper wound dressing is a crucial step in management that can significantly alter the course of wound healing. There are a variety of wound dressings available, including moisture retentive/occlusive dressings as well as dressings impregnated with antimicrobial agents. Here we outline the characteristics and indications of specific wound dressings in order to provide clinicians with a basic understanding of the types of dressings available. This review provides a tool for dermatologists to better assess and treat chronic wounds. Using the algorithm provided, clinicians will be able to select the appropriate dressing in order to accelerate wound healing, prevent infection and improve health outcomes.

Clinical performance categories for wound dressings

From a clinical perspective, the primary roles of a wound dressing are to address the symptoms of the wound, that is, (i) manage exudate and, in addition, provide (ii) mechanical and (iii) biological protection to the wound, thereby substituting for the lack of a native functional skin. Any existing or new dressing can be evaluated with respect to the above fundamental three clinical requirements, based upon more specific performance categories that are listed in Table 1.

Each of the factors listed under the fundamental requirements in Table 1 is essential to the healing process and deviation from these requirements may delay, reverse, or otherwise harm the healing. For example, the fluid handling characteristics all relate to the removal of excess exudate so that the wound bed remains moist, but not wet, at all times.

Failure of a dressing to absorb the wound fluids and retain these fluids effectively under the influence of expected (e.g. gravity or weight-bearing, or compression therapy) or unexpected (e.g. unintentional contact with objects) mechanical forces, or ineffective fluid release into the environment through evaporation, may lead to backflow (reflux) of fluids into the wound area. Such wetting of the wound (potentially, with aggressive or infected exudate fluids) may cause inflammation and maceration, which are, of course, not conducive to healing.

From a biological perspective, any adverse response of the wound or periwound tissues to the dressing materials, or failure to prevent infection of the wound by pathogens, consumes the (already limited) inflammatory and healing resources from the wound and invests them elsewhere, for example, in an allergen response or in attacking invading bacteria. Specifically, an adverse reaction of the wound/periwound tissues to the dressing materials may provoke an excessive inflammatory response.

In theory, this should be detected before the dressings being placed on the market according to the ISO-10993-1testing standard ("Biological evaluation of medical devices"). Another cause of excessive inflammation may be the invading pathogens, which are the primary cause of chronicity and nonhealing. ‡

### Silver treatments and silver-impregnated dressings for the healing of leg wounds and ulcers: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3470148e]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Previous systematic reviews of silver-impregnated dressings have been contradictory regarding the healing of leg wounds/ulcers. Our systematic review was restricted to randomized controlled trials. Cochrane Library, Scopus, and MEDLINE databases were searched using the term "silver" in combination with "wound" or "ulcer" (and plural versions) without date/language restriction. Study quality was assessed and meta-analysis conducted for complete wound healing, wound size reduction, and healing rates. Overall study quality was fair with most studies having some bias. Evidence for wound healing using individual studies was poor. Meta-analyses found strong evidence for wound healing based on wound size reduction but no evidence based on complete wound-healing or healing rates. Although our results provide some evidence that silver-impregnated dressings improve the short-term healing of wounds and ulcers, long-term effects remain unclear. Clinical trial data with longer follow-up times are needed to address these issues.

Autolytic and mechanical debridement in diabetic foot wounds are described, with autolytic debridement occurring naturally in a healthy, moist wound environment when arterial perfusion and venous drainage are maintained, and mechanical debridement as a nonselective, physical method that may include wet-to-dry dressings, high-pressure irrigation or pulsed lavage and hydrotherapy; wet-to-dry is commonly prescribed and overused in acute care settings, hydrotherapy may remove surface contaminants, and while early use may be justified, it is detrimental to friable granulation tissue.

### Wound healing – a practical algorithm [^b2565a9d]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

The decision-making process involved in the management of diabetic foot wounds is complex but hinges on certain simple principles. The first is to agree the actual aim of management with the patient or their representative - and healing of an open wound may be only a part of this. The agreed plan should be discussed and reviewed if the wound is unresponsive to intervention. Management depends otherwise on regular debridement and cleansing, treatment of any infection, consideration of revascularisation and protection of the wound by dressings and off-loading. The evidence to justify the use of advanced wound care therapies is not strong, and outcome depends more on the organisation of the wound care process than on the choice of a particular wound care product. The introduction of an expert multidisciplinary team has been shown to lead to a very significant reduction in the incidence of major amputation and it is likely that it is the availability or otherwise of prompt expert advice which is the principal explanation of the major variations that are known to exist in the incidence of amputation even within single countries.

THE REQUIRED DRESSING-WOUND/SKIN INTERFACE CONDITIONS DURING THE USE AND REMOVAL OF DRESSINGS

An adequately performing wound dressing must "stay in place" over the periwound skin during use, even in a moist environment, but should also allow for easy, atraumatic, painless, and as convenient as possible removal when a change is required. Adhesive dressings may strip layers of the periwound skin. This causes discomfort or pain during removals and further compromises the integrity of the skin (particularly the stratum corneum), adversely affects transepidermal water loss, and promotes inflammation. The above processes are repetitive, as skin damage accumulates each time a dressing is removed from the wound.

In people with sensitive skin (e.g. the elderly or infants), excessive adhesion of a dressing to the skin near the wound can cause skin tears. In addition, painful episodes during dressing changes can cause chronic psychological stress in patients, which in itself delays wound healing. The requirements of "stay in place" and "no skin peeling" are seemingly contradictive and again require careful optimization of wound dressing designs, which is another bioengineering challenge.

From a patient's perspective, a dressing that is not adhesive enough may slip and move during wear, hindering its ability to manage exudate and not facilitating showering for the user. Since chronic wounds are typically present for many weeks or months, the ability of a person to shower regularly with the dressing remaining in place is also a necessary property for their quality of life. Related to that, and from an engineering testing point of view, the adhesive strength of a dressing onto a skin-mimicking material can be measured using a laboratory "peel test", which is designed to determine the adhesive bond strength or the tacky property between the dressing and a (dry or wet) skin simulant.

Nevertheless, despite decades of research, no suitable material to optimally mimic skin has been found that would allow for reproducible adhesion force testing and determination of which forces would be considered being comparable with what native skin is exposed to clinically when dressings are removed. Traditionally, glass and steel plates are therefore commonly used as a substrate for peel tests; for reproducibility, however, efforts are underway to develop more biomimetic skin substitutes for this purpose, for example, based on blends of natural proteins in gelatin, to better represent the interactions occurring at the skin/adhesive interface with respect to conventional substrates for peel tests.

Moreover, appreciation and knowledge of how to apply such bioengineering principles to the bedside are lacking, and are not commonly taught.

In addition, the viscoelasticity of the skin and dressing will increase the stresses on skin at the wound site with an increased rate of peeling, which is the scientific rationale for the medical recommendation to remove dressings slowly. All of these real-world factors that point to the influence of dressing removal techniques (in terms of clinical skills), as well as to the skin health status, are not considered in the current laboratory work. Similar to the other aspects discussed above, more clinically relevant testing standards that consider real-world conditions should be developed to represent the real-life factors related to wound dressing removals in laboratory performance evaluations.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^074c9d9b]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Wound care products — dressings (gauze pads, transparent films, hydrogels, foam) delineate indications and contraindications as follows: Gauze pads are for low to heavily draining wounds or surgical wounds and wet to dry debridement, with contraindications undefined. Transparent films are for dry to minimally draining wounds and to promote tissue hydration, and are contraindicated with infection, significant drainage, or over prominence or friction. Hydrogels are for dry to minimally draining wounds and are contraindicated with moderate or heavy drainage. Foam dressings are suited to moderate, large exudate and a clean wound surface, are super absorbent and conformable to topography, and are contraindicated in dry wounds.

### Dressings and topical agents for treating venous leg ulcers [^7970b2a8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Venous leg ulcers are open skin wounds on the lower leg which can be slow to heal, and are both painful and costly. The point prevalence of open venous leg ulcers in the UK is about 3 cases per 10,000 people, and many people experience recurrent episodes of prolonged ulceration. First-line treatment for venous leg ulcers is compression therapy, but a wide range of dressings and topical treatments are also used. This diversity of treatments makes evidence-based decision-making challenging, and a clear and current overview of all the evidence is required. This review is a network meta-analysis (NMA) which assesses the probability of complete ulcer healing associated with alternative dressings and topical agents.

Objectives

To assess the effects of (1) dressings and (2) topical agents for healing venous leg ulcers in any care setting and to rank treatments in order of effectiveness, with assessment of uncertainty and evidence quality.

Search Methods

In March 2017 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses, guidelines and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. We updated this search in March 2018; as a result several studies are awaiting classification.

Selection Criteria

We included published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled adults with venous leg ulcers and compared the effects of at least one of the following interventions with any other intervention in the treatment of venous leg ulcers: any dressing, or any topical agent applied directly to an open venous leg ulcer and left in situ. We excluded from this review dressings attached to external devices such as negative pressure wound therapies, skin grafts, growth factors and other biological agents, larval therapy and treatments such as laser, heat or ultrasound. Studies were required to report complete wound healing to be eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction. We conducted this NMA using frequentist meta-regression methods for the efficacy outcome; the probability of complete healing. We assumed that treatment effects were similar within dressings classes (e.g. hydrocolloid, foam). We present estimates of effect with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for individual treatments focusing on comparisons with widely used dressing classes, and we report ranking probabilities for each intervention (probability of being the best, second best, etc treatment). We assessed the certainty (quality) of the body of evidence using GRADE for each network comparison and for the network as whole.

Main Results

We included 78 RCTs (7014 participants) in this review. Of these, 59 studies (5156 participants, 25 different interventions) were included in the NMA; resulting in 40 direct contrasts which informed 300 mixed-treatment contrasts. The evidence for the network as a whole was of low certainty. This judgement was based on the sparsity of the network leading to imprecision and the general high risk of bias in the included studies. Sensitivity analyses also demonstrated instability in key aspects of the network and results are reported for the extended sensitivity analysis. Evidence for individual contrasts was mainly judged to be low or very low certainty. The uncertainty was perpetuated when the results were considered by ranking the treatments in terms of the probability that they were the most effective for ulcer healing, with many treatments having similar, low, probabilities of being the best treatment. The two most highly-ranked treatments both had more than 50% probability of being the best (sucralfate and silver dressings). However, the data for sucralfate was from one small study, which means that this finding should be interpreted with caution. When exploring the data for silver and sucralfate compared with widely-used dressing classes, there was some evidence that silver dressings may increase the probability of venous leg ulcer healing, compared with nonadherent dressings: RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.58 to 3.74 (moderate-certainty evidence in the context of a low-certainty network). For all other combinations of these five interventions it was unclear whether the intervention increased the probability of healing; in each case this was low- or very low-certainty evidence as a consequence of one or more of imprecision, risk of bias and inconsistency.

Authors' Conclusions

More research is needed to determine whether particular dressings or topical agents improve the probability of healing of venous leg ulcers. However, the NMA is uninformative regarding which interventions might best be included in a large trial, largely because of the low certainty of the whole network and of individual comparisons. The results of this NMA focus exclusively on complete healing; whilst this is of key importance to people living with venous leg ulcers, clinicians may wish to take into account other patient-important outcomes and factors such as patient preference and cost.

### Advances in wound dressings [^aff16f37]. Clinics in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Wound dressings have undergone an evolutionary process from natural materials that simply covered and concealed the wound, to materials that focused on moisture management, and more recently, to materials that either deliver active ingredients or interact directly with cells or specific chemicals in the local wound environment. Advances in dressings technology have led to a new proliferation of topical products that do more than just cover and conceal, but that also can facilitate the healing process as well as address specific issues in nonhealing wounds. Dressings may play an important adjunctive role in concert with overall efforts to manage the underlying causes of chronic nonhealing wounds.

### Once daily bromelain-based enzymatic debridement of venous leg ulcers versus gel vehicle (placebo) and non-surgical standard of care: a three-arm multicenter, double blinded, randomized controlled study [^355baef5]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Additional study treatments

The Coban™ 2 Two-Layer Compression System (3M, St Paul, MN, USA) was used continuously throughout the study in all patients, reapplied after each dressing change, and limb elevation was instructed 3 times a day. All active methods of debridement including surgical, mechanical (wet-to-dry), biological (maggots), and the use of negative pressure wound therapy were prohibited during the debridement (daily visits) and follow-up periods. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was not allowed throughout the entire study period.

Follow-up period

This period consisted of 4 twice-weekly visits for 2 weeks, followed by once-weekly visits until achieving complete wound closure or reaching a total of 10 weeks. During this period a similar variety of NSSOC treatments could be used in all arms. Complete wound closure was defined as complete re-epithelialization of the wound surface without drainage or dressing, confirmed at two visits 2 weeks apart, in accordance with FDA definitions. Therefore, a wound closure confirmation visit was performed 2 weeks after wound closure if applicable. Thus, the maximal duration of the follow-up period was up to 14 weeks.

### Clinical approach to wounds: Débridement and wound bed preparation including the use of dressings and wound-healing adjuvants [^badc5f06]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

This is a clinical review of current techniques in wound bed preparation found to be effective in assisting the wound-healing process. The process begins with the identification of a correct diagnosis of the wound's etiology and continues with optimizing the patient's medical condition, including blood flow to the wound site. Débridement as the basis of most wound-healing strategies is then emphasized. Various débridement techniques, including surgery, topical agents, and biosurgery, are thoroughly discussed and illustrated. Wound dressings, including the use of negative pressure wound therapy, are then reviewed. To properly determine the timing of advance therapeutic intervention, the wound-healing progress needs to be monitored carefully with weekly measurements. A reduction in wound area of 10 to 15 percent per week represents normal healing and does not mandate a change in the current wound-healing strategy. However, if this level of wound area reduction is not met consistently on a weekly basis, then alternative healing interventions should be considered. There is a growing body of evidence that can provide guidance on the appropriate use of such adjuvants in the problem wound. Several adjuvants are discussed, including growth factor, bioengineered tissues, and hyperbaric medicine.

### Occlusive wound dressings in emergency medicine and acute care [^f8414715]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

One of the great misconceptions in wound care is that a wound heals best when permitted to form a dry scab. By contrast, moisture has repeatedly been shown to significantly accelerate wound healing. Emergency physicians and other acute care providers are encouraged to incorporate occlusive moisture-retentive dressings into their regular practice to expedite healing, reduce pain and scarring, improve wound care convenience and patient compliance, and minimize wound contamination and infection.

### How should clinical wound care and management translate to effective engineering standard testing requirements from foam dressings? Mapping the existing gaps and needs [^61744ad5]. Advances in Wound Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Similarly, in the second illustrative case (Fig. 4b), a male patient older than 60 years underwent a left knee repair procedure and was at risk of postoperative bleeding. A conventional postoperative dressing was applied in the latter case, but it failed because the dressing had to handle a relatively large amount of whole blood, which is substantially more viscous than plasma exudation (by approximately fivefold).

While appreciating that ideally, hemostasis of the wound should be achieved before applying a dressing, and therefore, bleeding into a dressing presents a considerable challenge for its fluid management and handling performance, in the above two documented cases, the rate of absorption into the dressing was too slow and the rate of the incoming blood flow was too high, resulting in an accumulation of blood under the dressing.

This stands in contrast to the fundamental clinical requirement that a dressing should achieve absorption and retention in all cases — both for aqueous and viscous exudates. Another similar clinical case of a dressing that had failed to absorb a viscous exudate, this time in the context of care of chronic wounds, is shown in Fig. 4c. This latter case is an 82-year-old male patient with multiple venous leg ulcers on the same leg that released exudates with different viscosities. The applied dressing clearly failed to absorb the more viscous discharge.

All of these clinical cases of dressing failures described above, together with the human factors that were involved in each case (Figs. 3 and 4), led to medical device-related adverse events. Unfortunately, however, in clinical practice, such dressing failure events are often left unreported or are considered minor issues, which prevents or delays regulatory actions (contrarily, for example, to problems observed with implantable devices that are promptly reported to regulatory bodies through a Medical Device Reporting process).

### Dressings and topical agents for arterial leg ulcers [^162fa6eb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

It is estimated that up to 1% of people in high-income countries suffer from a leg ulcer at some time in their life. The majority of leg ulcers are associated with circulation problems; poor blood return in the veins causes venous ulcers (around 70% of ulcers) and poor blood supply to the legs causes arterial ulcers (around 22% of ulcers). Treatment of arterial leg ulcers is directed towards correcting poor arterial blood supply, for example by correcting arterial blockages (either surgically or pharmaceutically). If the blood supply has been restored, these arterial ulcers can heal following principles of good wound-care. Dressings and topical agents make up a part of good wound-care for arterial ulcers, but there are many products available, and it is unclear what impact these have on ulcer healing. This is the third update of a review first published in 2003.

Objectives

To determine whether topical agents and wound dressings affect healing in arterial ulcers. To compare healing rates and patient-centred outcomes between wound dressings and topical agents.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and Allied and Complementary Medicine databases, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials register to 28 January 2019.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) evaluating dressings and topical agents in the treatment of arterial leg ulcers were eligible for inclusion. We included participants with arterial leg ulcers irrespective of method of diagnosis. Trials that included participants with mixed arterio-venous disease and diabetes were eligible for inclusion if they presented results separately for the different groups. All wound dressings and topical agents were eligible for inclusion in this review. We excluded trials which did not report on at least one of the primary outcomes (time to healing, proportion completely healed, or change in ulcer area).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted information on the participants' characteristics, the interventions, and outcomes using a standardised data extraction form. Review authors resolved any disagreements through discussion. We presented the data narratively due to differences in the included trials. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

Two trials met the inclusion criteria. One compared 2% ketanserin ointment in polyethylene glycol (PEG) with PEG alone, used twice a day by 40 participants with arterial leg ulcers, for eight weeks or until healing, whichever was sooner. One compared topical application of blood-derived concentrated growth factor (CGF) with standard dressing (polyurethane film or foam); both applied weekly for six weeks by 61 participants with non-healing ulcers (venous, diabetic arterial, neuropathic, traumatic, or vasculitic). Both trials were small, reported results inadequately, and were of low methodological quality. Short follow-up times (six and eight weeks) meant it would be difficult to capture sufficient healing events to allow us to make comparisons between treatments. One trial demonstrated accelerated wound healing in the ketanserin group compared with the control group. In the trial that compared CGF with standard dressings, the number of participants with diabetic arterial ulcers were only reported in the CGF group (9/31), and the number of participants with diabetic arterial ulcers and their data were not reported separately for the standard dressing group. In the CGF group, 66.6% (6/9) of diabetic arterial ulcers showed more than a 50% decrease in ulcer size compared to 6.7% (2/30) of non-healing ulcers treated with standard dressing. We assessed this as very-low certainty evidence due to the small number of studies and arterial ulcer participants, inadequate reporting of methodology and data, and short follow-up period. Only one trial reported side effects (complications), stating that no participant experienced these during follow-up (six weeks, low-certainty evidence). It should also be noted that ketanserin is not licensed in all countries for use in humans. Neither study reported time to ulcer healing, patient satisfaction or quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to determine whether the choice of topical agent or dressing affects the healing of arterial leg ulcers.

### Challenges in the treatment of chronic wounds [^13756b9e]. Advances in Wound Care (2015). Low credibility.

Summary

Complex wounds represent a major challenge for the clinician and wound care specialist. Despite all the recent advances in wound care therapies and our understanding of the pathophysiology underlying chronic wounds, nothing can supplant the need for adhering to the basic tenets of wound care: thorough assessment with medical and nutritional optimization, debridement (including surgery), offloading (or compression), management of ischemia, management of infection, and appropriate wound bed preparation. Following these principles and established wound care guidelines should often lead to satisfactory outcomes. In addition, the rational use of advanced wound care therapies is encouraged when wounds do not respond sufficiently to good standard care after 4 weeks or sooner as circumstances dictate. In most cases, selection of advanced therapies should be based on the evidence available to help facilitate their most appropriate use.

### How should clinical wound care and management translate to effective engineering standard testing requirements from foam dressings? Mapping the existing gaps and needs [^f58ed2cc]. Advances in Wound Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Today, many advanced dressings have silicone coating across their entire contact area to prevent dressing adherence, thereby minimizing the risk of damage to the wound and periwound skin upon removal. Although other advanced dressing types have been developed during the recent decades, such as superabsorbent, hydrocolloid-based, and hydrogel-based dressings, foam dressings remain a common choice for many wound care applications, and are therefore the focus of this review.

The quality of attachment of the dressing to the wound site

Another important challenge in a wound dressing design is premature detachment due to moisture from the wound exudate or perspiration in the wound environment, which compromises the adhesive/tacky function of the wound-facing aspect of the dressing. Premature detachment of wound dressings is common and can occur as early as the day after application of the dressing, with the occurrence increasing over the next few days (up to day 5, which was the endpoint of the work by Rippon et al.).

Global surveys of nurses found that a dressing is changed at least once every ∼3 days if the wound is infected, or at most every ∼6 days if the wound is not infected, regardless of the wound etiology. Therefore, if the design of the dressing is such that body fluids are trapped at the edges of the dressing and cannot effectively escape by evaporation, the dressing will detach earlier than expected by the wound care professional (as documented in the work of Rippon et al.).

In other words, the absorptive and retentive properties of a foam dressing are also key to reducing the risk of premature detachment of dressings. Such premature dressing detachments not only cause additional health care labor and costs associated with the more frequent than necessary dressing changes, but also jeopardize the goal of undisturbed healing, which is a consistent requirement in contemporary wound care practice.

### Global vascular guidelines on the management of chronic limb-threatening ischemia [^5861c266]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Management of the limb after revascularization — In tissue loss–dominant conditions after revascularization, wound healing is protracted, with the median time to healing ranging from 147 days for forefoot wounds to 188 days for midfoot wounds and 237 days for hindfoot wounds. The Threatened Limb Classification (WIfI) system uses a scale of none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3), and can be visualized as three intersecting rings of risk to identify the dominant risk. Therapy is based primarily on appropriate débridement, offloading, and a simple moisture-retentive dressing strategy, with pressure offloading described as one of the single most important and yet neglected aspects of therapy. The total contact cast remains the gold standard for offloading noninfected, nonischemic wounds, and other techniques may also be considered depending on available resources. More significant degrees of tissue loss may require a strategy of filling the defect followed by skin grafting, and once the wound heals and the patient is no longer tissue loss dominant, care shifts to maximizing ulcer-free and activity-rich days in diabetic foot remission.

### Challenges in the treatment of chronic wounds [^daebc57d]. Advances in Wound Care (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical Relevance

Understanding and addressing the challenges in the treatment of chronic wounds will lead to a better clinical outcome (faster and more durable wound closure), resulting in improved patient quality of life and reduced healthcare costs. This review provides a current expert opinion and can be used as a guideline for evaluation and appropriate treatment selection for nonhealing wounds.

Primary wound dressings — topical dressing selection: We suggest applying a topical dressing that will manage venous leg ulcer exudate and maintain a moist, warm wound bed [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - C]. We suggest selection of a primary wound dressing that will absorb wound exudate produced by the ulcer (alginates, foams) and protect the periwound skin [GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B].

### Evidence-based care of acute wounds: a perspective [^fb6c0581]. Advances in Wound Care (2015). Low credibility.

Significance: Large variation and many controversies exist regarding the treatment of, and care for, acute wounds, especially regarding wound cleansing, pain relief, dressing choice, patient instructions, and organizational aspects. Recent Advances: A multidisciplinary team developed evidence-based guidelines for the Netherlands using the AGREE-II and GRADE instruments. A working group, consisting of 17 representatives from all professional societies involved in wound care, tackled five controversial issues in acute-wound care, as provided by any caregiver throughout the whole chain of care. Critical Issues: The guidelines contain 38 recommendations, based on best available evidence, additional expert considerations, and patient experiences. In summary, primarily closed wounds need no cleansing; acute open wounds are best cleansed with lukewarm (drinkable) water; apply the WHO pain ladder to choose analgesics against continuous wound pain; use lidocaine or prilocaine infiltration anesthesia for wound manipulations or closure; primarily closed wounds may not require coverage with a dressing; use simple dressings for open wounds; and give your patient clear instructions about how to handle the wound. Future Directions: These evidence-based guidelines on acute wound care may help achieve a more uniform policy to treat acute wounds in all settings and an improved effectiveness and quality of wound care.

EXUDATE MANAGEMENT AND DRESSING FUNCTION ACROSS THE RANGE OF ACUTE AND CHRONIC WOUNDS

The most relevant physical law governing the mode of action of all foam dressings is Darcy's Law. This physical law, which generally applies to relatively slow-moving flows, determines that the rate of the exudate flow into a foam dressing is inversely proportional to the viscosity of the inflowing exudate. According to Darcy's law, aqueous exudates with a relatively low viscosity flow into a dressing faster than more viscous exudates managed by the same dressing.

Therefore, the effective permeability of the dressing structure, which is influenced by the density, porosity, and interconnectivity of the micropores in the foams that make up each layer of the dressing, should be considered in the context of the exudate viscosity, and is the key performance parameter that ultimately determines absorbency.

If the permeability of any of the layers in the dressing to an exudate of certain viscosity (typically high viscosity) is insufficient, more viscous exudates will not be able to effectively penetrate the inner dressing layers and the dressing will therefore not absorb and retain a sufficient amount of wound fluids. In such cases, exudate pooling may occur or the exudate might flow back into the wound area and accumulate, causing further inflammation and/or maceration, thereby potentially increasing the wound size.

In addition, if the exudate contains solid particles such as blood clots, or aggregates of dead cells or proteins, the dressing could act as a filter, absorbing the fluid components from the exudate but leaving the solid particles at the wound bed, where they would (similarly to excess fluid) compromise the healing.

### Gauze-soaked with suction wall: an alternative technique for negative pressure wound therapy [^d247e774]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since the inception of medical practice, wound care and healing have evolved through the development of innovative treatment methods. With advancements in modern medicine and evidence-based research, emphasis has increased on optimizing wound healing through appropriate, resource-efficient, and new dressing techniques. An appropriate dressing is essential for optimal healing as it protects against contamination and physical harm. Moreover, it should be non-adherent and easily removable to prevent traumatic injury to newly formed tissue. Comfort is also a critical factor when selecting the type of dressing, particularly when applied over mobile areas such as joints.

One dressing method widely used by physicians is negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), which creates a negative vacuum at the wound site to isolate it from the surrounding environment. This system offers multiple clinical benefits, including faster wound healing, reduced overall costs by decreasing the frequency of changing dressings, preparing wounds for grafting, and improving graft survival. The main mechanisms contributing to these benefits include the drainage of exudates, enhancement of granulation tissue formation, provision of an isolated environment, increased blood flow, and reduced tissue edema. The most well-known form of NPWT is vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) dressing, which consists of a polythene porous foam applied to the wound site by an adhesive drape, a tube connecting the dressing to a pump that creates a vacuum with adjustable pressure ranging from 50 mm Hg to 125 mm Hg, and a canister that collects drainage. The VAC machine can operate in two settings: continuous and intermittent, with the suction after a cycle of 5 minutes on and 2 minutes off. Indications for using NPWT include diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, graft fixation, and approximation of wound edges. Despite its benefits, NPWT cannot be applied in certain situations, such as active wound infection, exposed blood vessels or tendons, or the absence of experienced personnel for application. Availability and cost must also be considered, as not all facilities are equipped with such systems.

### Moist wound healing with commonly available dressings [^8aca0764]. Advances in Wound Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Significance: A moist wound environment has several benefits that result in faster and better quality of healing. It facilitates autolytic debridement, reduces pain, reduces scarring, activates collagen synthesis, facilitates and promotes keratinocyte migration over the wound surface, and supports the presence and function of nutrients, growth factors, and other soluble mediators in the wound microenvironment. Recent Advances: Wound dressings can be utilized to create, maintain, and control a moist environment for healing. Moist wound dressings can be divided into films, foams, hydrocolloids, hydrogels, and alginates. We are also including negative pressure wound therapy systems in the moist dressings. Critical Issues: An optimal wound dressing should provide a moist environment and have an optimal water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) and absorptive capacity. It should also protect the wound against trauma and contamination and be easy to apply, painless to remove, and esthetically acceptable or even pleasing. Future Directions: Interventions, particularly dressing changes, by medical caregivers are labor intensive and expensive and there should be a continuous effort to reduce their number per week. Smart dressings with integrated microsensors and delivery capabilities that would allow wireless real-time monitoring and treatment of the wound would be very advantageous. This way the state of the wound as well as the wear time of the dressing could be assessed without dressing removal or visit to the wound care center. In addition, an ability to adjust the WVTRs to the exudate level of the wound (or having a large absorptive capacity without changing the WVTR) would be useful. This feature would guarantee an optimal level of hydration of the wound surface throughout the treatment.

### Silver based wound dressings and topical agents for treating diabetic foot ulcers [^5e8ae29e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Foot ulceration affects 15–20% of people with diabetes. It is a major precursor to amputation in this patient group, and early and appropriate treatment provides the greatest opportunity for healing. The use of silver for its antimicrobial properties has re-emerged, and modern wound dressings that release a sustained amount of free silver ions, are now widely used in wound management.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of silver-containing dressings and topical agents on infection rates and healing of diabetes related foot ulcers.

Search Strategy

Searches were made of the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (August 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 3 2005) MEDLINE (1966 to October week 2 2004), EMBASE (1980 to October week 2 2004) and CINAHL (1982 to October week 2 2004). The Journal of Wound Care (Volume 12/13 Issues 1–10) was hand-searched. Manufacturers, researchers and local and international wound groups were contacted in order to identify unpublished trials. Web sites for wound groups and World Wide Wounds (www.worldwidewounds.com) were searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials and non-randomised controlled clinical trials were considered for inclusion. Studies were included if they involved participants with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and related foot ulcers, met the requirements for randomisation, allocation and concealment where appropriate, and compared the intervention with a placebo or a sham dressing, an alternative non silver based dressing or no dressing, and reported outcomes that represent healing rate or infection.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently evaluated the papers identified by the search strategy against the inclusion criteria but identified no trials eligible for inclusion in the review. It was not possible to perform planned subgroup and sensitivity analysis in the absence of data. In future, if eligible trials become available, a random effects model will be applied for meta-analysis in the presence of statistical heterogeneity (estimated using the I² statistic). Dichotomous outcomes will be reported as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and continuous outcomes as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% CI. Statistical significance will be set at P value < 0.05 for all outcomes and the magnitude of the effect will be estimated by calculating the number needed to treat (NNT) with 95% CI.

Main Results

No studies were identified that met with the inclusion criteria

Authors' Conclusions

Despite the widespread use of dressings and topical agents containing silver for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers, no randomised trials or controlled clinical trials exist that evaluate their clinical effectiveness. Trials are needed to determine clinical and cost-effectiveness and long term outcomes including adverse events.

### Negative pressure wound therapy for treating leg ulcers [^b6c32a30]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Leg ulcers are open skin wounds that occur between the ankle and the knee that can last weeks, months or even years and are a consequence of arterial or venous valvular insufficiency. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a technology that is currently used widely in wound care and is promoted for use on wounds. NPWT involves the application of a wound dressing to the wound, to which a machine is attached. The machine applies a carefully controlled negative pressure (or vacuum), which sucks any wound and tissue fluid away from the treated area into a canister.

Objectives

To assess the effects of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) for treating leg ulcers in any care setting.

Search Methods

For this review, in May 2015 we searched the following databases: the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 21 May 2015); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 4); Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 20 May 2015); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations 20 May 2015); Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 20 May 2015); EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 21 May 2015). There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication.

Selection Criteria

Published or unpublished randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of NPWT with alternative treatments or different types of NPWT in the treatment of leg ulcers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction.

Main Results

We included one study, with 60 randomized participants, in the review. The study population had a range of ulcer types that were venous arteriolosclerotic and venous/arterial in origin. Study participants had recalcitrant ulcers that had not healed after treatment over a six-month period. Participants allocated to NPWT received continuous negative pressure until they achieved 100% granulation (wound preparation stage). A punch skin-graft transplantation was conducted and the wound then exposed to further NPWT for four days followed by standard care. Participants allocated to the control arm received standard care with dressings and compression until 100% granulation was achieved. These participants also received a punch skin-graft transplant and then further treatment with standard care. All participants were treated as in-patients until healing occurred. There was low quality evidence of a difference in time to healing that favoured the NPWT group: the study reported an adjusted hazard ratio of 3.2, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.7 to 6.2. The follow-up period of the study was a minimum of 12 months. There was no evidence of a difference in the total number of ulcers healed (29/30 in each group) over the follow-up period; this finding was also low quality evidence. There was low quality evidence of a difference in time to wound preparation for surgery that favoured NPWT (hazard ratio 2.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.7). Limited data on adverse events were collected: these provided low quality evidence of no difference in pain scores and Euroqol (EQ-5D) scores at eight weeks after surgery.

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited rigorous RCT evidence available concerning the clinical effectiveness of NPWT in the treatment of leg ulcers. There is some evidence that the treatment may reduce time to healing as part of a treatment that includes a punch skin graft transplant, however, the applicability of this finding may be limited by the very specific context in which NPWT was evaluated. There is no RCT evidence on the effectiveness of NPWT as a primary treatment for leg ulcers.

### Management of acute wounds [^b4c6e5cb]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The acute wound presents a spectrum of issues that prevent its ultimate closure. These issues include host factors, etiology, anatomic location, timing, and surgical techniques to achieve successful wound closure. Basic surgical principles need to be followed to obtain stable, long-term coverage, ultimately restoring form and function. Recent advances in dressings, debridement techniques, and surgical repertoire allow the modern plastic surgeon to address any wound of any complexity. This article discusses these principles that can be applied to any wound.

### Wound conforming matrix containing purified homogenate of dermal collagen promotes healing of diabetic neuropathic foot ulcers: comparative analysis versus standard of care [^09029801]. Advances in Wound Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Although the basic principles of DFU care are established, including offloading to redistribute pressure away from an ulcer, sharp debridement, dressings to promote moisture balance, and infection control, there remain gaps between desired and realized healing outcomes with current standard of care strategies. There are numerous topical products available for use in the early management of DFU, including wet-to-dry dressings, hydrogels, hydrocolloids, alginates, and foam dressings. DFUs are heterogeneous, and unfortunately, DFU and other chronic wounds often fail to respond to conservative standard of care, requiring more advanced treatment options including cellular- and tissue-based products. Wound area reduction of > 50% after 4 weeks of treatment has been found to be predictive of wound closure outcomes for DFU, venous leg ulcers, and chronic wounds overall. In this retrospective exploratory analysis, a single application of WCM accelerated healing with an average wound area reduction of 63% at 4 weeks.

The majority of DFU in this study were located on the plantar surface of the foot. Plantar shear stress is a major causative agent in the development and poor healing of DFU. A single application of WCM, with weekly outer dressing changes, demonstrated statistically significant acceleration of healing within 1 week of application, and persisting for 4 weeks, compared with daily saline-moistened gauze dressing changes (SOC). The average wound duration of the WCM and SOC treatment groups was ∼1 year. It is feasible that the daily dressing changes associated with SOC disrupted the healing process compared with once weekly outer dressing changes for WCM-treated patients. Debridement was performed on all wounds at the day 1 treatment visit, and frequency of debridement at subsequent visits was similar for WCM and SOC. Furthermore, there were no treatment site infections during the study period in any of the WCM- or SOC-treated patients.

Background

Chronic wounds are those that have not progressed through the ordered process of healing to yield a functional result. Recently, the terminology for chronic wounds has changed. The preferred term to refer to a chronic wound is a "complex wound". One of the following characteristics is necessary for a wound to be classified as being complex: i) has not healed in 3 months, ii) infection is present, iii) compromised viability of superficial tissues, necrosis, or circulation impairment, and iv) association with systemic pathologies, impairing normal healing. The main types of complex wounds include diabetic leg/foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, chronic venous ulcers, infected wounds, and those related to vasculitis and immunosuppressive therapy that have not healed using simple care.

Complex wounds are a significant burden on society. It has been estimated that complex wounds cost the healthcare system $10 billion annually in North America alone. These estimates often fail to capture indirect costs, including patient/caregiver frustration, economic loss, and decreased quality of life.

Healthcare providers and patients have numerous regimens available for treating wounds, including dressings, wound cleansing agents, skin replacement therapy, biologic agents, stockings, nutritional supplementation, complementary and alternative medicine, bandages, and surgery, to name a few. Furthermore, wound care is often multi-faceted, and several interventions may be used concurrently. Some of these interventions have been examined in overviews of Cochrane reviews. As the evidence of these interventions is recondite across the literature, we sought to elucidate optimal treatment strategies for complex wounds through an overview of all available systematic reviews, including Cochrane reviews and non-Cochrane reviews.

### How should clinical wound care and management translate to effective engineering standard testing requirements from foam dressings? Mapping the existing gaps and needs [^d7cb6db6]. Advances in Wound Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 2.
The fluid handling (or mass transport) performance of a certain wound dressing (as detailed in Table 1), which can be measured in a bioengineering laboratory setting, determines the likelihood of that dressing to successfully manage exudates, or alternatively, to fail in the more challenging clinical scenarios requiring, for example, the absorbency of high volume of exudation or of a viscous exudate; treatment of infected wounds; and protection of fragile periwound skin. Hence, the mass transport performance of the dressing eventually determines both the patient and the financial outcomes.

Table 1.
The primary clinical roles and functions of adequately performing wound dressings and the associated requirements from dressing materials and structures

Therefore, once the clinical requirements for wound care and management are defined for a given wound type and etiology, it should be theoretically possible to translate the clinically relevant characteristics of wound dressings into a physical design with specific metrics of materials, mechanical, and fluid transport and handling properties that are all determined to meet the clinical objectives and that are measurable through standardized bench testing.

This multidisciplinary critical review article, written by an International Wound Dressing Technology Expert Panel (IWDTEP), discusses the translation of clinical wound care and management into the requirements from an effective wound dressing and how such clinical requirements should determine the types, behavior, and properties of dressing materials to achieve the desirable dressing performances, as well as the need for clinically relevant laboratory test methods.

The IWDTEP appreciates that the translation of clinical wound care and management to the engineering requirements from effective dressings is a massively broad theme, even if being restricted to foam dressings. Accordingly, a long-term series of comprehensive scientific publications are planned, with the current work being the cornerstone and providing context and structure to the planned series of works.

### Debridement for venous leg ulcers [^2bebdb77]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Venous ulcers (also known as varicose or venous stasis ulcers) are a chronic, recurring and debilitating condition that affects up to 1% of the population. Best practice documents and expert opinion suggests that the removal of devitalised tissue from venous ulcers (debridement) by any one of six methods helps to promote healing. However, to date there has been no review of the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to support this.

Objectives

To determine the effects of different debriding methods or debridement versus no debridement, on the rate of debridement and wound healing in venous leg ulcers.

Search Methods

In February 2015 we searched: The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. In addition we handsearched conference proceedings, journals not cited in MEDLINE, and the bibliographies of all retrieved publications to identify potential studies. We made contact with the pharmaceutical industry to enquire about any completed studies.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs, either published or unpublished, which compared two methods of debridement or compared debridement with no debridement. We presented study results in a narrative form, as meta-analysis was not possible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Independently, two review authors completed all study selection, data extraction and assessment of trial quality; resolution of disagreements was completed by a third review author.

Main Results

We identified 10 RCTs involving 715 participants. Eight RCTs evaluated autolytic debridement and included the following agents or dressings: biocellulose wound dressing (BWD), non-adherent dressing, honey gel, hydrogel (gel formula), hydrofibre dressing, hydrocolloid dressings, dextranomer beads, Edinburgh University Solution of Lime (EUSOL) and paraffin gauze. Two RCTs evaluated enzymatic preparations and one evaluated biosurgical debridement. No RCTs evaluated surgical, sharp or mechanical methods of debridement, or debridement versus no debridement. Most trials were at a high risk of bias. Three RCTs assessed the number of wounds completely debrided. All three of these trials compared two different methods of autolytic debridement (234 participants), with two studies reporting statistically significant results: one study (100 participants) reported that 40/50 (80%) ulcers treated with dextranomer beads and 7/50 (14%) treated with EUSOL achieved complete debridement (RR 5.71, 95% CI 2.84 to 11.52); while the other trial (86 participants) reported the number of ulcers completely debrided as 31/46 (76%) for hydrogel versus 18/40 (45%) for paraffin gauze (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.99). One study (48 participants) reported that by 12 weeks, 15/18 (84%) ulcers treated with BWD had achieved a 75% to 100% clean, granulating wound bed versus 4/15 (26%) treated with non-adherent petrolatum emulsion-impregnated gauze. Four trials assessed the mean time to achieve debridement: one (86 participants) compared two autolytic debridement methods, two compared autolytic methods with enzymatic debridement (71 participants), and the last (12 participants) compared autolytic with biosurgical debridement; none of the results achieved statistical significance. Two trials that assessed autolytic debridement methods reported the number of wounds healed at 12 weeks. One trial (108 participants) reported that 24/54 (44%) ulcers treated with honey healed versus 18/54 (33%) treated with hydrogel (RR (adjusted for baseline wound diameter) 1.38, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.88; P value 0.037). The second trial (48 participants) reported that 7/25 (28%) ulcers treated with BWD healed versus 7/23 (30%) treated with non-adherent dressing. Reduction in wound size was assessed in five trials (444 participants) in which two autolytic methods were compared. Results were statistically significant in one three-armed trial (153 participants) when cadexomer iodine was compared to paraffin gauze (mean difference 24.9 cm², 95% CI 7.27 to 42.53, P value 0.006) and hydrocolloid compared to paraffin gauze (mean difference 23.8 cm², 95% CI 5.48 to 42.12, P value 0.01). A second trial that assessed reduction in wound size based its results on median differences and, at four weeks, produced a statistically significantly result that favoured honey over hydrogel (P value < 0.001). The other three trials reported no statistically significant results for reduction in wound size, although one trial reported that the mean percentage reduction in wound area was greater at six and 12 weeks for BWD versus a non-adherent dressing (44% versus 24% week 6; 74% versus 54% week 12). Pain was assessed in six trials (544 participants) that compared two autolytic debridement methods, but the results were not statistically significant. No serious adverse events were reported in any trial.

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited evidence to suggest that actively debriding a venous leg ulcer has a clinically significant impact on healing. The overall small number of participants, low number of studies and lack of meta-analysis in this review precludes any strong conclusions of benefit. Comparisons of different autolytic agents (hydrogel versus paraffin gauze; Dextranomer beads versus EUSOL and BWD versus non-adherent dressings) and Larvae versus hydrogel all showed statistically significant results for numbers of wounds debrided. Larger trials with follow up to healing are required.

### Efficacy of topical wound oxygen therapy in healing chronic diabetic foot ulcers: systematic review and meta-analysis [^78a0ecaf]. Advances in Wound Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Data extraction and risk of bias analysis

The primary outcome of interest was complete wound healing (skin reepithelialization without drainage or dressing requirements confirmed at two consecutive study visits 2 weeks or more apart) at 12 weeks with the following secondary outcomes collected if available: wound-related pain, readmission to the hospital, health-related quality of life, dependence on outside help or need for care, adherence to prescribed therapy, and adverse events (AEs), including amputation and mortality.

SOC in treatment of DFUs includes debridement as necessary (typically sharp debridement), offloading of plantar ulcers, appropriate dressings to maintain a moist wound care bed, and infection control. Reporting should include debridement type and frequency, as well as details of dressings and offloading. Although findings were not tabulated, we noted if details were missing.

Two reviewers independently extracted key study metrics and outcomes, and a third member checked congruity of the data. A consensus among the team members was reached that only complete wound healing was a useful outcome, as not all studies provided other wound healing outcomes.

The risk of bias analysis used the RoB2 approach developed by the Cochrane group. The same reviewers who extracted the data carried out the risk of bias analysis independently. The senior systematic reviewer/statistician adjudicated differences in assessment for each domain for each study and reviewed the overall results.

### Dressings and topical agents for arterial leg ulcers [^ea57fdd9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

It is estimated that people in industrialised countries have a 1% chance of suffering from a leg ulcer at some time in their life. The majority of leg ulcers are associated with circulation problems; poor blood return in the veins causes venous ulcers (around 70% of ulcers) and poor blood supply to the legs causes arterial ulcers (around 25% of ulcers). Treatment of arterial leg ulcers is directed towards correcting the poor arterial blood supply, for example, by surgically correcting arterial blockages, and by supporting ulcer healing using topical agents (medicines in cream/ointment) and wound dressings. There are a large number of topical agents and wound dressings available and it is unclear what impact these have on ulcer healing.

Objectives

To determine whether topical agents and wound dressings affect the rate of healing in arterial ulcers. To compare healing rates, costs and patient-centred outcomes between wound dressings and topical agents.

Search Strategy

Publications describing (or potentially describing) randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of dressings and topical agents for arterial leg ulcers were sought through the Specialised Trials Registers of the Cochrane Wounds Group (last searched January 2002) and the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group (last searched April 2002).

Selection Criteria

RCTs or CCTs (trials with non-randomised concurrent comparison groups) were eligible for inclusion. The participants had to have ulcers that were described as arterial, and the time to healing, proportion completely healed, or rate of reduction in ulcer area had to be reported. All wound dressings and topical agents were eligible for inclusion in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Information on the participants' characteristics, the interventions, and outcomes, as well as data on the trial methods, such as blinding of patients and clinicians, and allocation concealment were extracted using a standardised data extraction form.

Main Results

One trial met the inclusion criteria. This small trial compared ketanserin ointment with vehicle alone, changed twice a day. The trial was too small and for too short a follow-up period to be able to determine whether there was any difference in healing rates.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to determine whether the choice of topical agent or dressing affects the healing of arterial leg ulcers. Inadequate description of the people in the one included trial means that the results cannot be easily applied to other clinical populations.

### Alginate dressings for venous leg ulcers [^ddd9c9f5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Venous leg ulcers are a common and recurring type of chronic, complex wound associated with considerable cost to patients and healthcare providers. To aid healing, primary wound contact dressings are usually applied to ulcers beneath compression devices. Alginate dressings are used frequently and there is a variety of alginate products on the market, however, the evidence base to guide dressing choice is sparse.

Objectives

To determine the effects of alginate dressings compared with alternative dressings, non-dressing treatments or no dressing, with or without concurrent compression therapy, on the healing of venous leg ulcers.

Search Methods

For this first update, in March 2015, we searched the following databases: The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL. There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication.

Selection Criteria

Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of any type of alginate dressing in the treatment of venous ulcers were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Meta-analysis was undertaken when deemed feasible and appropriate.

Main Results

Five RCTs (295 participants) were included in this review. All were identified during the original review. The overall risk of bias was high for two RCTs and unclear for three. One RCT compared different proprietary alginate dressings (20 participants), three compared alginate and hydrocolloid dressings (215 participants), and one compared alginate and plain non-adherent dressings (60 participants). Follow-up periods were six weeks in three RCTs and 12 weeks in two. No statistically significant between-group differences were detected for any comparison, for any healing outcome. Meta-analysis was feasible for one comparison (alginate and hydrocolloid dressings), with data from two RCTs (84 participants) pooled for complete healing at six weeks: risk ratio 0.42 (95% confidence interval 0.14 to 1.21). Adverse event profiles were generally similar between groups (not assessed for alginate versus plain non-adherent dressings).

Authors' Conclusions

The current evidence base does not suggest that alginate dressings are more or less effective in the healing of venous leg ulcers than hydrocolloid or plain non-adherent dressings, and there is no evidence to indicate a difference between different proprietary alginate dressings. However, the RCTs in this area are considered to be of low or unclear methodological quality. Further, good quality evidence is required from well designed and rigorously conducted RCTs that employ - and clearly report on - methods to minimise bias, prior to any definitive conclusions being made regarding the efficacy of alginate dressings in the management of venous leg ulcers.

### Once daily bromelain-based enzymatic debridement of venous leg ulcers versus gel vehicle (placebo) and non-surgical standard of care: a three-arm multicenter, double blinded, randomized controlled study [^81cd3ad8]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Venous leg ulcers (VLU) are the most common ulceration on the lower extremity and account for 70% of all leg ulcers. The prevalence of VLU has been estimated to range up to 2% of the population based on observational studies, with an overall cost of treatment approaching 1% of the health care budget of some western European countries. The constant increase in the aging population is expected to increase these numbers as age negatively affects healing and recurrence rates.

Eschar or fibrinous debris, consisting of devitalized tissue or slough that may harden by desiccation, commonly exists on the surface of chronic wound-beds. Therefore, wound bed preparation (WBP) is the first step in treatment of these wounds, which is initiated by debridement, that removes the local impediments to healing by eliminating devascularized tissue, necrotic material, and excessive bacterial burden. The aims of debridement are to create a healthy wound bed, edges and peri-wound skin, with the objective of promoting and accelerating healing. Previous studies have shown the importance of adequate debridement in VLU. Cardinal et al. demonstrated a 47% closure rate in VLUs that were surgically debrided serially versus a 30% closure rate in those that were not. Several debridement methods exist, including surgical (or sharp in case of a minor bedside procedure), enzymatic, autolytic, osmotic (i.e. honey), mechanical (i.e. wet to dry), biologic (larvae), and technical (i.e. jet lavage, ultrasound). However, according to the clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum, surgical debridement is recommended over other methods for VLUs that contain slough, nonviable tissue, or eschar. This is in line with the fact that there is little evidence to suggest that the use of non-surgical debridement agents is beneficial for VLU healing. Nevertheless, as surgical debridement has its drawbacks such as associated pain and bleeding, and requires the availability of a clinician trained in surgical debridement, the use of currently available slow acting non-surgical debridement agents remains common. EscharEx® (MediWound Ltd, Yavne, Israel), is a Bromelain-based enzymatic topical agent currently in development for debridement of chronic wounds. Bromelain-based enzymatic debridement has been shown to provide an efficient, rapid, selective and safe non-surgical debridement in burns (NexoBrid®, MediWound Ltd, Yavne, Israel). The positive experience in burns lead to an initial proof-of-concept study, demonstrating efficacy in debridement of chronic wounds of various etiologies. This study was followed by a multi-center, assessor-blinded RCT, that demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of complete debridement of lower extremity ulcers treated with EscharEx as compared to those treated with its gel vehicle. However, these studies utilized 4 h topical applications, whose applicability for home use, and in an aging population, seemed questionable. Therefore, a new EscharEx formulation (EX-02) was developed to allow for longer safe treatment times (24 h).

### Alginate dressings for venous leg ulcers [^8a7205e4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Venous leg ulcers are a common and recurring type of chronic, complex wound associated with considerable cost to patients and healthcare providers. To aid healing, primary wound contact dressings are usually applied to ulcers beneath compression devices. Alginate dressings are used frequently and there is a variety of alginate products on the market, however, the evidence base to guide dressing choice is sparse.

To determine the effects of alginate dressings compared with alternative dressings, non-dressing treatments or no dressing, with or without concurrent compression therapy, on the healing of venous leg ulcers.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 30 November 2012); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 11); The NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 5); Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to November Week 2 2012); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations November 29, 2012); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 11); and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 23 November 2012). There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication.

### Diagnosis and management of common foot fractures… [^808519d0]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Follow-up should occur within three to five days to allow for reduction of soft tissue swelling. At the first follow-up visit, radiography should be performed to assure fracture stability. If stable, the patient can be transitioned to a short leg walking cast or boot. 3, 6. The choice of immobilization device depends on the patient's ability to ambulate with the device with minimal to no pain. There is evidence that transitioning to a walking boot and then to a rigid-sole shoe at four to six weeks, with progressive weight bearing as tolerated, results in improved functional outcomes compared with cast immobilization, with no differences in healing time or pain scores.
12. 18, 19 Immobilization in a cast or boot is typically only needed for two weeks, with progressive ambulation and range of motion thereafter as tolerated. Follow-up visits should be scheduled every two weeks, and healing time varies from four to eight weeks.

3, 6 Follow-up radiography is typically required only at six to eight weeks to document healing, or earlier if the patient has persistent localized pain or continued painful ambulation at four weeks. 2, 3, 6. 2, 6, 20 If evidence of healing is present at that time, weight-bearing activity can progress gradually, along with physical therapy and rehabilitation. If no healing has occurred at six to eight weeks, avoidance of weight-bearing activity should continue for another four weeks. 2, 6, 20 Typical length of immobilization is six to 10 weeks, and healing time is typically up to 12 weeks. For athletes and other highly active persons, evidence shows earlier return to activity with surgical management; therefore, surgery is recommended. 13, 21, 22 In contrast, patients treated with nonsurgical techniques should be counseled about longer healing time and the possibility that surgery may be needed despite conservative management. 2, 13, 20–22.

MANAGEMENT: LESSER TOE FRACTURES Initial management of lesser toe fractures includes buddy taping to an adjacent toe, use of a rigid-sole shoe, and ambulation as tolerated. Initial follow-up should occur within one to two weeks, then every two to four weeks for a total healing time of four to six weeks. 6, 23, 24 Radiographic follow-up in seven to 10 days is necessary for fractures that required reduction or that involve more than 25% of the joint. 6.

### Negative pressure wound therapy versus usual care in patients with surgical wound healing by secondary intention in the UK (SWHSI-2): an open-label, multicentre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial [^deead053]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Randomisation and masking

Randomisation to NPWT or usual care (1:1) was stratified by wound location (foot and ankle, leg, abdomen, or other), wound area (< 28 cm² or ≥ 28 cm², calculated as the measurement arising from the longest part of the wound multiplied by the measurement for the widest part of the wound), and study centre, using variable block sizes (two, four, six, and eight). The allocation sequence was generated independently by the trial statistician and was implemented using a bespoke, centralised, secure online randomisation service developed and hosted by York Trials Unit, University of York (York, UK). The clinical and research teams accessed the online system via individual log on, to complete randomisation as required.

Participants and the clinical and research teams were unmasked to treatment allocation. However, to minimise bias, masked assessment of wound healing photographs was completed by clinically experienced independent observers and analysis of this was included as a secondary outcome.

Procedures

After screening, eligible patients were approached for informed consent. Baseline questionnaires were then completed, and participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to intervention (NPWT) or control (usual care).

Participants in the intervention group were randomly assigned to be treated with NPWT applied to their wound in accordance with manufacturer guidance. A specific NPWT model was not prescribed; however, the device was required to be CE marked (ie, meeting legislative requirements for use in the UK and Europe) and to provide 60–150 mm Hg pressure. Given that there is no evidence to suggest an optimal duration of use or that any one pressure cycle (continuous or intermittent), dressing, or use of a liner (added wound contact layer to prevent dressing adherence) is beneficial to wound healing, the choice of these clinical parameters was left to the local clinical care team to determine on a per-patient basis.

### Lower extremity compartment syndrome [^8352c523]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Although we do not advocate this, some groups have described using a single incision fasciotomy to decompress all four compartments of the lower leg. In this approach, the skin incision is made laterally between the tibia and fibula. The anterior and lateral compartments are entered in the routine fashion. The superficial peroneal nerve is retracted anteriorly, and the posterior intermuscular septum is found inside the lateral compartment. The superficial posterior compartment is decompressed by incising the posterior intermuscular septum. The deep posterior compartment can be entered via the anterior compartment by retracting the tibialis anterior laterally and incising along the lateral tibia, through the interosseous membrane. A retrospective case series has shown no difference in deep infection rate, bone nonunion, and length of follow-up between patients with tibial fractures receiving either a single or dual incision fasciotomy, although this study did not evaluate for missed compartment syndrome requiring repeat fasciotomy. Further literature on the single incision fasciotomy technique is very limited.

At the index operation, if non-viable muscle is encountered, it should be debrided. Any questionable muscle can be re-examined at a planned second look operation within 24 hours from the index operation.

Multiple techniques can be used for closing or dressing fasciotomy wounds. Immediately after a fasciotomy, it is advisable to use a loose, non-constricting dressing to allow the muscle to fully expand, especially if there is ongoing resuscitation. Kerlix or gauze dampened with sterile normal saline should be placed over the wound, covered with abdominal pads, and lightly covered with additional kerlix. After the index operation, both traditional wet-to-dry dressings and tension-based dressings, such as a shoelace technique or a vacuum-assisted-closure dressing, can be used. The goal with any type of fasciotomy dressing is to facilitate delayed primary closure of the wound.

### Dressings and topical agents for preventing pressure ulcers [^c734b08e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations in trial design and implementation

In this third update of the review, we continued to include only RCTs to enable a thorough assessment of risk of bias for each trial. Most trials provided details of appropriate random sequence allocation, which resulted in an overall low risk of bias. However, we judged several trials as having an unclear or high risk of bias due to a lack of detail regarding sequence generation. Broadly speaking, we assessed most studies as having an unclear or high risk of bias for allocation concealment and blinding of participants and personnel. While some trials of topical agents had success in blinding participants and personnel, most of the dressing trials were not able to blind participants and personnel (a somewhat expected result). However, one dressing trial was able to blind outcome assessment using photography (Walker 2015). Outcome data were generally well reported. However, a few trials did not analyse participants randomised to the intervention, and we therefore judged these to be at high risk of attrition bias. Selective reporting and other potential sources of bias were also evident to some extent, but we judged most trials as having a low or unclear risk of bias in these domains (Figure 3).

Searching other resources

For previous versions of McInnes 2015, the review authors of McInnes 2015 contacted experts in the field of wound care to enquire about potentially relevant studies that are ongoing or recently published. In addition, the review authors of McInnes 2015 contacted manufacturers of support surfaces for details of any studies manufacturers were conducting. This approach did not yield any additional studies, therefore we did not repeat it for this review.

We identified other potentially eligible studies or ancillary publications by searching the reference lists of retrieved included studies, as well as relevant systematic reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology assessment reports.

When necessary, we contacted authors of key papers and abstracts to request further information about their trials.

We did not perform a separate search for adverse effects of interventions used; we considered adverse effects described in included studies only.

### Foam dressings for venous leg ulcers [^a88e8117]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Venous leg ulcers are a common and recurring type of chronic or complex wound that are associated with considerable cost to patients and to healthcare providers. Primary wound contact dressings are usually applied beneath compression devices with the aim of aiding healing. Foam dressings are used frequently, and a variety of foam products is available on the market. The evidence base to guide dressing choice, however, is sparse.

Objectives

To determine the effects of foam dressings on the healing of venous leg ulcers.

Search Methods

In October 2012 we searched The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library); the Economic Evaluation Database (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; EBSCO CINAHL. There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication.

Selection Criteria

We included published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of any type of foam dressing in the treatment of venous ulcers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Meta-analysis was undertaken when deemed feasible and appropriate.

Main Results

Twelve RCTs (1023 participants) reporting 14 comparisons were included in this review. There was no difference in healing outcomes between hydrocellular foam dressings and polyurethane foam dressings (three RCTs). Pooled data across five RCTs (418 participants) showed no statistically significant difference between foam dressings and hydrocolloid dressings in the proportion of ulcers healed at 12 to 16 weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.22). No statistically significant between-group differences in healing outcomes were detected when foam dressings were compared with: paraffin gauze (two RCTs); hydrocapillary dressing (one RCT); knitted viscose dressing (one RCT); and protease modulating matrix (one RCT). No statistically significant between-group differences in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events were detected when hydrocellular foam dressings were compared with polyurethane foam dressings, or when foam dressings were compared with hydrocapillary, hydrocolloid, or knitted viscose dressings (one RCT for each comparison). Six RCTs were considered as being at overall high risk of bias, and the remaining six RCTs were considered to be at overall unclear risk of bias. No included RCT had an overall low risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

The current evidence base does not suggest that foam dressings are more effective in the healing of venous leg ulcers than other wound dressing treatments. The evidence in this area is of low quality. Further evidence is required from well-designed and rigorously-conducted RCTs, that employ methods to minimise bias and report them clearly, before any definitive conclusions can be made regarding the efficacy of foam dressings in the management of venous leg ulcers.

### WHS guidelines for the treatment of pressure ulcers-2023 update [^48499ddf]. Wound Repair and Regeneration (2023). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for pressure ulcer, more specifically with respect to wound cleansing, WHS 2024 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend a specific type of wound cleansing solution or technique for PUs. Avoid using antiseptic agents as granulation tissue will be destroyed. Recognize that tap water is appropriate to use for wound cleansing.

### Wound management [^606bb26c]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Wound management makes up an important part of the emergency physician's practice. Understanding the physiology of wound healing and the patient and wound factors affecting this process is essential for the proper treatment of wounds. There are many options available for wound closure. Each modality has its benefits and its drawbacks, and some are appropriate only for certain types of wounds. The goal is to achieve the best functional and cosmetically appealing scar while avoiding complications.

### Negative pressure wound therapy versus usual care in patients with surgical wound healing by secondary intention in the UK (SWHSI-2): an open-label, multicentre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial [^cc354eea]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

A range of wound dressings are used in the management of SWHSI, ranging from simple dressings such as gauze, to more advanced dressings such as hydrofibre or alginate. Frequent changes to these dressings are required. An alternative approach, negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), uses a controlled vacuum to remove wound fluid. It is claimed that the vacuum creates an environment more conducive to wound healing by removing infective materials and exudate, reducing oedema, and promoting perfusion and granulation.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Healing by secondary intention refers to a strategy to heal wounds by leaving skin edges unopposed. This method requires the growth of granulation tissue from the base of the wound and might be preferred in areas where there is contamination, or inability to achieve primary skin cover. Healing by secondary intention is common, with an estimated prevalence of 4.1 per 10 000 population. Median time to healing for these wounds is prolonged (86 days [95% CI 75–130]), with wounds located on the foot or leg taking more than double the time to heal of those located elsewhere on the body. Additional treatments are often required, resulting in high health-care costs, and can affect patient quality of life. Alongside conventional wound dressings, an alternative called negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) can be used as a dressing. This approach uses a controlled vacuum to remove wound fluid, which manufacturers claim results in a conducive wound healing environment. The use of NPWT for surgical wound healing by secondary intention (SWHSI) has increased rapidly in recent years, with a 23% increase in use reported between 2012 and 2014; however, there is an absence of robust supporting evidence regarding its clinical and cost-effectiveness. A Cochrane systematic review of NPWT for SWHSI identified two small, low-quality randomised controlled trials and recommended caution when interpreting the findings and that further high-quality randomised controlled trials be conducted.

### Foam dressings for treating pressure ulcers [^6c5162a1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pressure ulcers, also known as pressure injuries and bed sores, are localised areas of injury to the skin or underlying tissues, or both. Dressings made from a variety of materials, including foam, are used to treat pressure ulcers. An evidence-based overview of dressings for pressure ulcers is needed to enable informed decision-making on dressing use. This review is part of a suite of Cochrane Reviews investigating the use of dressings in the treatment of pressure ulcers. Each review will focus on a particular dressing type.

Objectives

To assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of foam wound dressings for healing pressure ulcers in people with an existing pressure ulcer in any care setting.

Search Methods

In February 2017 we searched: the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase; EBSCO CINAHL Plus and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED). We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs, that compared the clinical and cost effectiveness of foam wound dressings for healing pressure ulcers (Category/Stage II or above).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias and data extraction. A third reviewer resolved discrepancies between the review authors.

Main Results

We included nine trials with a total of 483 participants, all of whom were adults (59 years or older) with an existing pressure ulcer Category/Stage II or above. All trials had two arms, which compared foam dressings with other dressings for treating pressure ulcers. The certainty of evidence ranged from low to very low due to various combinations of selection, performance, attrition, detection and reporting bias, and imprecision due to small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals. We had very little confidence in the estimate of effect of included studies. Where a foam dressing was compared with another foam dressing, we established that the true effect was likely to be substantially less than the study's estimated effect. We present data for four comparisons. One trial compared a silicone foam dressing with another (hydropolymer) foam dressing (38 participants), with an eight-week (short-term) follow-up. It was uncertain whether alternate types of foam dressing affected the incidence of healed pressure ulcers (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.75) or adverse events (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.25), as the certainty of evidence was very low, downgraded for serious limitations in study design and very serious imprecision. Four trials with a median sample size of 20 participants (230 participants), compared foam dressings with hydrocolloid dressings for eight weeks or less (short-term). It was uncertain whether foam dressings affected the probability of healing in comparison to hydrocolloid dressings over a short follow-up period in three trials (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.34), very low-certainty evidence, downgraded for very serious study limitations and serious imprecision. It was uncertain if there was a difference in risk of adverse events between groups (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.11), very low-certainty evidence, downgraded for serious study limitations and very serious imprecision. Reduction in ulcer size, patient satisfaction/acceptability, pain and cost effectiveness data were also reported but we assessed the evidence as being of very low certainty. One trial (34 participants), compared foam and hydrogel dressings over an eight-week (short-term) follow-up. It was uncertain if the foam dressing affected the probability of healing (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.28), time to complete healing (MD 5.67 days 95% CI -4.03 to 15.37), adverse events (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.65) or reduction in ulcer size (MD 0.30 cm² per day, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.75), as the certainty of the evidence was very low, downgraded for serious study limitations and very serious imprecision. The remaining three trials (181 participants) compared foam with basic wound contact dressings. Follow-up times ranged from short-term (8 weeks or less) to medium-term (8 to 24 weeks). It was uncertain whether foam dressings affected the probability of healing compared with basic wound contact dressings, in the short term (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.88) or medium term (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.72), or affected time to complete healing in the medium term (MD -35.80 days, 95% CI -56.77 to -14.83), or adverse events in the medium term (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.05). This was due to the very low-certainty evidence, downgraded for serious to very serious study limitations and imprecision. Reduction in ulcer size, patient satisfaction/acceptability, pain and cost effectiveness data were also reported but again, we assessed the evidence as being of very low certainty. None of the included trials reported quality of life or pressure ulcer recurrence.

Authors' Conclusions

It is uncertain whether foam dressings are more clinically effective, more acceptable to users, or more cost effective compared to alternative dressings in treating pressure ulcers. It was difficult to make accurate comparisons between foam dressings and other dressings due to the lack of data on reduction of wound size, complete wound healing, treatment costs, or insufficient time-frames. Quality of life and patient (or carer) acceptability/satisfaction associated with foam dressings were not systematically measured in any of the included studies. We assessed the certainty of the evidence in the included trials as low to very low. Clinicians need to carefully consider the lack of robust evidence in relation to the clinical and cost-effectiveness of foam dressings for treating pressure ulcers when making treatment decisions, particularly when considering the wound management properties that may be offered by each dressing type and the care context.

### Addressing the dressings: wound care in hidradenitis suppurativa [^a606d0e0]. Dermatologic Clinics (2025). Medium credibility.

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) wounds are complex and have unique characteristics that complicate dressing selection. Proper wound care assists with wound healing and contributes to improved quality of life. Ideal dressings are comfortable while maintaining a wound-healing environment. Antimicrobial dressings should target dysbiosis and biofilms. Absorptive dressings are needed for control of exudate. Pain control is best achieved with nonadhesive dressings and contact layers. Agents targeting anaerobic bacteria are effective at odor reduction. Surgery may be indicated for management of refractory wounds. Overall, there is a need for increased research and education on both routine and postsurgical wound care in HS.

### Dressings and topical agents for preventing pressure ulcers [^a1f2d83f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Data collection and analysis

We carried out data collection and analysis according to methods stated in the published protocol (Moore 2011), which were based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011a).

Selection of studies

Two review authors independently assessed titles and, where available, abstracts of the trials identified by the search strategy against the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review. We obtained full versions of potentially relevant trials and the two review authors independently screened these against the inclusion criteria. Any differences in opinion were resolved by discussion and, where necessary, reference to Cochrane Wounds editorial base. We completed a PRISMA flowchart to summarise this process (Liberati 2009; Figure 1).

use of additional dressing materials;
participants' length of hospital stay;
outcome measures;
blinding (of the participants/outcome assessors);
length of follow‐up;
loss to follow‐up;
results;
intention‐to‐treat analysis; and
conclusions as reported by the trial authors.

We resolved any differences in opinion by discussion and, where necessary, with reference to Cochrane Wounds editorial base. If data were missing from reports, we attempted to contact trial authors to obtain the missing information.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Two review authors independently assessed the included trials using the original Cochrane risk of bias (RoB 1) tool for assessing risk of bias (Higgins 2011b). This tool addresses six specific domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other issues (e.g. extreme baseline imbalance). See Appendix 3 for details of the criteria on which our judgements were based. We assessed the overall risk of bias for each study.

### Management of venous leg ulcers: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery® and the American Venous Forum [^78bade39]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Wound bed preparation — Wound bed preparation is defined as the management of the wound to accelerate endogenous healing and to facilitate the effectiveness of other therapeutic measures, with the aim to convert the molecular and cellular environment of a chronic wound to that of an acute healing wound; included within this framework are (1) debridement, (2) wound exudate control, and (3) management of surface bacteria, and control of these factors must also be achieved to stimulate optimal wound healing.

### Early versus delayed dressing removal after primary closure of clean and clean-contaminated surgical wounds [^695b2054]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Most surgical procedures involve a cut in the skin that allows the surgeon to gain access to the deeper tissues or organs. Most surgical wounds are closed fully at the end of the procedure (primary closure). The surgeon covers the closed surgical wound with either a dressing or adhesive tape. The dressing can act as a physical barrier to protect the wound until the continuity of the skin is restored (within about 48 hours) and to absorb exudate from the wound, keeping it dry and clean, and preventing bacterial contamination from the external environment. Some studies have found that the moist environment created by some dressings accelerates wound healing, although others believe that the moist environment can be a disadvantage, as excessive exudate can cause maceration (softening and deterioration) of the wound and the surrounding healthy tissue. The utility of dressing surgical wounds beyond 48 hours of surgery is, therefore, controversial.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and risks of removing a dressing covering a closed surgical incision site within 48 hours permanently (early dressing removal) or beyond 48 hours of surgery permanently with interim dressing changes allowed (delayed dressing removal), on surgical site infection.

Search Methods

In March 2015 we searched the following electronic databases: The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL. We also searched the references of included trials to identify further potentially-relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

Two review authors independently identified studies for inclusion. We included all randomised clinical trials (RCTs) conducted with people of any age and sex, undergoing a surgical procedure, who had their wound closed and a dressing applied. We included only trials that compared early versus delayed dressing removal. We excluded trials that included people with contaminated or dirty wounds. We also excluded quasi-randomised studies, and other study designs.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data on the characteristics of the trial participants, risk of bias in the trials and outcomes for each trial. We calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for binary outcomes and mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. We used RevMan 5 software to perform these calculations.

Main Results

Four trials were identified for inclusion in this review. All the trials were at high risk of bias. Three trials provided information for this review. Overall, this review included 280 people undergoing planned surgery. Participants were randomised to early dressing removal (removal of the wound dressing within the 48 hours following surgery) (n = 140) or delayed dressing removal (continued dressing of the wound beyond 48 hours) (n = 140) in the three trials. There were no statistically significant differences between the early dressing removal group and delayed dressing removal group in the proportion of people who developed superficial surgical site infection within 30 days (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.32 to 1.28), superficial wound dehiscence within 30 days (RR 2.00; 95% CI 0.19 to 21.16) or serious adverse events within 30 days (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.28 to 2.51). No deep wound infection or deep wound dehiscence occurred in any of the participants in the trials that reported this outcome. None of the trials reported quality of life. The hospital stay was significantly shorter (MD -2.00 days; 95% CI -2.82 to -1.18) and the total cost of treatment significantly less (MD EUR -36.00; 95% CI -59.81 to -12.19) in the early dressing removal group than in the delayed dressing removal group in the only trial that reported these outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

The early removal of dressings from clean or clean contaminated surgical wounds appears to have no detrimental effect on outcomes. However, it should be noted that the point estimate supporting this statement is based on very low quality evidence from three small randomised controlled trials, and the confidence intervals around this estimate were wide. Early dressing removal may result in a significantly shorter hospital stay, and significantly reduced costs, than covering the surgical wound with wound dressings beyond the first 48 hours after surgery, according to very low quality evidence from one small randomised controlled trial. Further randomised controlled trials of low risk of bias are necessary to investigate whether dressings are necessary after 48 hours in different types of surgery and levels of contamination and investigate whether antibiotic therapy influences the outcome.

### Honey-based salve and burdock leaf dressings as an alternative to surgical debridement of a traumatic wound eschar [^24fccce1]. Advances in Wound Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Textremity is a challenging clinical problem for the treating surgeon that predisposes trauma survivors to substantial morbidity and loss of function. In the acute setting, patients often present with active hemorrhage through the mangled extremity and orthopedic injuries too severe for successful limb salvage to occur. When hemorrhage through a mangled extremity cannot be controlled, amputation is sometimes performed, with careful consideration for maintaining as much native limb as possible when appropriate. Amputation in these cases allows hemostasis to occur. Attention can then be focused on resuscitating the patient and treating any other associated but less severe injuries.

After amputation is performed, a series of challenges must be overcome. Open fractures and contamination of the initial injury predispose the patient to infection. In addition, the full extent of soft tissue injury is often difficult to ascertain in the immediate postoperative period after amputation. Barriers to successful healing of traumatic and surgical wounds in the setting of amputation are often encountered in the following days and weeks as the zone of injury declares itself, presenting as inadequate soft tissue flap perfusion, poor host nutrition, and soft tissue infection.

When wound healing complications are encountered, the options available to the surgeon to improve the clinical outcome may be limited based on patient preference or the wound characteristics themselves. Surgical debridement and wound bed preparation followed by split thickness skin grafting or even more advanced flaps and grafts have been suggested to be the standard of care for definitive closure of acute and chronic wounds not amendable to primary closure. However, patients wish to avoid multiple trips to the operating theater and alternative wound management strategies should be considered. In these scenarios, effective nonsurgical strategies for mitigating traumatic wound complications are of keen interest to surgeons and their patients. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), hyperbaric oxygen, and enzymatic debridement are commonly used nonsurgical alternatives. Wet to dry dressings with antiseptic solutions such as Dakins or betadine are also used, although there is growing concern that they do not provide an appropriate moist wound healing environment.

### Dressings for treating foot ulcers in people with diabetes: an overview of systematic reviews [^764c4915]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Foot ulcers in people with diabetes mellitus are a common and serious global health issue. Dressings form a key part of ulcer treatment, with clinicians and patients having many different types to choose from. A clear and current overview of current evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding dressing use.

Objectives

To summarize data from systematic reviews of randomised controlled trial evidence on the effectiveness of dressings for healing foot ulcers in people with diabetes mellitus (DM).

Methods

We searched the following databases for relevant systematic reviews and associated analyses: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 2); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE; The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 1); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, 14 April 2015); Ovid EMBASE (1980 to 14 April 2015). We also handsearched the Cochrane Wounds Group list of reviews. Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Complete wound healing was the primary outcome assessed; secondary outcomes included health-related quality of life, adverse events, resource use and dressing performance.

Main Results

We found 13 eligible systematic reviews relevant to this overview that contained a total of 17 relevant RCTs. One review reported the results of a network meta-analysis and so presented information on indirect, as well as direct, treatment effects. Collectively the reviews reported findings for 11 different comparisons supported by direct data and 26 comparisons supported by indirect data only. Only four comparisons informed by direct data found evidence of a difference in wound healing between dressing types, but the evidence was assessed as being of low or very low quality (in one case data could not be located and checked). There was also no robust evidence of a difference between dressing types for any secondary outcomes assessed.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no robust evidence for differences between wound dressings for any outcome in foot ulcers in people with diabetes (treated in any setting). Practitioners may want to consider the unit cost of dressings, their management properties and patient preference when choosing dressings.

### A preliminary clinical trial comparing wet silver dressings versus wet-to-dry povidone-iodine dressings for wound healing in pemphigus vulgaris patients [^49682d7c]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

There is insufficient evidence concerning the efficacy of wet silver-containing dressings for wound healing in pemphigus vulgaris (PV). In this randomized, controlled clinical trial, 58 patients with PV skin erosions (10%-70% body surface area) were assigned to receive either wet silver-containing dressings (n = 28) or wet to dry povidone-iodine dressings as a control (n = 30). The patients in the treatment group demonstrated a significant improvement in the number of dressing changes, wound healing time, and duration of hospital stay compared with the control group. Patients treated with wet silver dressings had significantly lower NRS pain scores and reported better subjective satisfaction compared with the control group. The only adverse reactions were an occasional abnormal discharge or infection, but there was no difference between the two groups. In our study the wet silver-containing dressings were safe and effective for the treatment of wound healing in PV patients.

### How should clinical wound care and management translate to effective engineering standard testing requirements from foam dressings? Mapping the existing gaps and needs [^c481c5f4]. Advances in Wound Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical cases illustrating this type of dressing failure in acute care are documented in Fig. 4a and b. The first image (Fig. 4a) is of a wound of a 73-year-old female poststroke with left hemiparesis and impaired mobility and sensibility, who also suffered depression and malnourishment, where the applied PU foam dressing had failed to absorb the viscous hematic wound fluids from her highly exuding heel pressure ulcer.

Figure 4.
Clinical documentations of dressing failures due to poor absorbency of viscous fluids in the care of acute and chronic wounds: (a) A highly exuding heel pressure ulcer where the polyurethane foam dressing had failed to absorb the viscous hematic exudate. The documentation of this case is courtesy of author PA. (b) A 60+ year-old male patient who underwent a left knee repair was at risk of postoperative bleeding. A conventional postoperative dressing was applied, but clearly failed (the images were taken at day 4 postsurgery), because the dressing needed to handle a relatively large amount of whole blood, which is considerably more viscous than plasma exudation. While appreciating that ideally, hemostasis of the wound should be achieved before applying a dressing, and therefore, bleeding into a dressing presents a considerable challenge for its fluid management and handling performance, in these two cases shown here, the absorption rate into the dressing was too slow and the rate of the incoming blood flow was too high, resulting in pooling of blood under the dressing (as opposed to the absorption and retention that a dressing is expected to achieve). The documentation of this case is courtesy of author TS. (c) An 82-year-old male patient with multiple venous leg ulcers on the same leg that release exudates with different viscosities. The dressing was clearly unable to absorb the more viscous exudate. The documentation of this case is courtesy of author P. A.

### Wound, pressure ulcer, and burn guidelines (2023)-4: guidelines for the management of connective tissue disease / vasculitis-associated skin ulcers, third edition [^d3ebb7a2]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 CHAPTER 4: DEFINITIONS OF TERMINOLOGY

The terminology used in these guidelines was defined as indicated below based on the contents of review papers and textbooks in Japan. In addition, these guidelines partially quote the terminology list of the Terminology Committee of the Japanese Society of Pressure Ulcers, and consideration was made for consistency within the guidelines.

4.1 Topical agents

Drugs that are applied through the skin or directly to skin lesions for localized treatment. They are prepared by compounding various drugs with a base.

4.2 Dressing materials

Modern wound‐dressing materials for creating a moist environment for wounds. Conventional sterile gauze is excluded.

4.3 Wound‐dressing materials

Wound‐dressing materials can be broadly classified into dressing materials (modern dressing materials) and medical materials such as gauze (classic dressing materials). The former are medical materials that provide conditions optimal for wound healing by maintaining a moist environment and must be used selectively depending on the state of the wound and amount of exudates. The latter allow drying of the wound and cannot maintain a moist environment if exudates are insufficient. Medical materials other than conventional gauze that provide an optimal environment for wound healing by covering the wound and maintaining moisture may also be called wound‐dressing materials or dressing materials.

4.4 Surgical treatments

Surgical therapy, surgical debridement, and invasive procedures of subcutaneous pockets.

4.5 Debridement

A therapeutic action used to clean a wound by removing foreign material, necrotic tissue, and senescent cells that no longer react to stimulation by promoters of wound healing such as growth factors and foci of bacterial infections, which are often associated with the above. Methods include: (i) autolytic debridement induced by occlusive dressing; (ii) mechanical debridement (e.g. wet‐to‐dry dressing, high‐pressure washing, hydrotherapy, and ultrasonic washing); (iii) debridement using proteolytic enzymes; (iv) surgical debridement; and (v) biological debridement using maggots.

4.6 Wet‐to‐dry dressing

Dressing aimed at debridement performed by applying gauze saturated with physiological saline to the wound, and, once the gauze has dried, nonselective removing of foreign material and necrotic tissue adhering to it occurs when it is changed.

4.7 Occlusive dressing

All dressing methods used to avoid wound drying in moist wound healing are called occlusive dressings. This is a collective term for dressing using modern wound‐dressing materials other than conventional gauze dressings.

Summary

This is the second Maintenance of Certification article on wound healing. In the first, Buchanan, Kung, and Cederna dealt with the mechanism and reconstructive techniques for closing wounds. In this article, the authors have concentrated on the chronic wound. The authors present a summary of the basic science of chronic wounds and the general and local clinical factors important in assessing any chronic wound. The evidence for interventions of these conditions is presented. The surgical and nonsurgical methods of wound preparation and the evidence supporting the use of the popular wound dressings are presented. The authors then present the evidence for some of the popular adjuncts for wound healing, including hyperbaric oxygen, electrotherapy, and ultrasound. A number of excellent articles on negative-pressure wound therapy have been written, and are not covered in this article.

### Seeking effective interventions to treat complex wounds: an overview of systematic reviews [^9de935cf]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Outcome results for diabetic foot/leg ulcers

The following outcome results were only reported in systematic reviews without meta-analysis: wound area/size reduction (n = 2) and time to healing or rate of healing (n = 3). Details of these study results can be found in Additional file 6.

Ulcer healing

Three systematic reviews including four meta-analyses and 10 systematic reviews without a meta-analysis (Table 4; Additional files 4 and 6) examined healing improvements of diabetic foot/leg ulcers. Three had an AMSTAR score ≥ 8.

One meta-analysis found that subcutaneous or intravenous granulocyte colony-stimulating factor plus oral or intravenous antibiotics was more effective than control (high quality). Another meta-analysis found that Chinese herbal medicine (see Table 4 and Additional file 4 for the exact preparation) plus unspecified standard therapy was more effective than standard therapy alone.

No healing improvement or non-healed wounds

Three systematic reviews including five meta-analyses examined no healing improvement for diabetic wounds (Table 4; Additional file 4). Two of these had an AMSTAR score ≥ 8.

Hyaluronic acid derivative was more effective than standard care in one meta-analysis (AMSTAR score ≥ 8). Low frequency low intensity noncontact ultrasound was more effective than sharps debridement in two meta-analyses (AMSTAR score ≥ 8) and Chinese herbal medicine (see Additional file 4 for the exact preparation) plus unspecified standard therapy was more effective than standard therapy alone in another meta-analysis.

Proportion of patients with healed wounds

Fifteen systematic reviews including 18 meta-analyses (Table 4; Additional file 4) examined the proportion of patients with healed diabetic foot and leg ulcers. Eight of these had an AMSTAR score ≥ 8.

Hydrogel dressings were more effective than basic wound dressings, basic contact dressings, and gauze in three meta-analyses (two with an AMSTAR score ≥ 8). Artificial skin grafts were more effective than usual care in one meta-analysis and skin replacement therapy was more effective than usual care in another. Chinese herbal medicine (see Additional file 4 for the exact preparation) plus unspecified standard therapy was more effective than standard therapy alone in a meta-analysis and subcutaneous or intravenous granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was more effective than usual care in another (AMSTAR score ≥ 8). Finally, a meta-analysis found platelet-rich plasma more effective than control.

### A wound care specialist's approach to pyoderma gangrenosum [^08221a5f]. Advances in Wound Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Significance: Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare neutrophilic ulcerative dermatosis that poses a high burden of morbidity due to underdiagnosis, resistance to therapy, and limited therapeutic options. Optimization of wound care strategies and multimodal anti-inflammatory approaches are necessary to mitigate multiple converging pathways of inflammation leading to delayed healing, which is further complicated by additional factors such as pathergy. Recent Advances: PG treatment typically involves reducing inflammation, controlling pain, promoting wound healing, and treating the underlying etiology. Recent advances have been made with regard to targeted therapies for PG with topical, intralesional, and systemic medications. Wound management includes gentle cleansing without sharp debridement, limited topical antibacterial use, and maintenance of a moist environment to promote epithelial migration. Critical Issues: Wound dressings and compression therapy, in particular, introduce a wide variety of therapeutic options. Dressings should aim to target the specific PG wound type, depending on the depth and exudative nature of the wound, as well as local secondary factors. Superficial wounds, eschar, exudative wounds, granulating wounds, and colonized wounds are managed with variable approaches to the same underlying principles of pathergy avoidance, moisture balance, and reduction of immunogenic inflammatory stimuli. The importance of compression therapy to decrease edema and overgranulation fits within this treatment paradigm. Future Directions: As each of these treatment modalities offers a complex mixture of advantages and limitations, development of a systematic treatment algorithm in the future can help direct a more tailored path toward wound healing.

### Seeking effective interventions to treat complex wounds: an overview of systematic reviews [^ed1a22b2]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Outcome results for mixed arterial/venous leg ulcers

Wound area/size reduction

Two systematic reviews including three meta-analyses examined wound area/size reduction for mixed arterial/venous leg ulcers (Table 3; Additional file 4). None had an AMSTAR score ≥ 8. One meta-analysis found topical silver and silver dressings more effective than placebo or conservative wound care or non-silver therapies and another that ultrasound was more effective than standard treatment or placebo.

Time to healing or rate of healing

Four systematic reviews including five meta-analyses examined the time to healing for mixed arterial/venous leg ulcers (Table 3; Additional file 4). Two had an AMSTAR score ≥ 8. One meta-analysis found topical negative pressure more effective than conventional therapy, a second found oral micronized purified flavonoid more effective than placebo or standard compression, and a third found that four-layer bandage was more effective than compression systems.

Ulcer healing

Six systematic reviews without a meta-analysis examined ulcer healing for mixed arterial/venous leg ulcers (Table 3; Additional file 6). Two had an AMSTAR score ≥ 8. Details of these study results can be found in Additional file 6.

Proportion of patients with healed wounds

Two systematic reviews including three meta-analyses examined the proportion of patients with healed mixed arterial/venous wounds (Table 3; Additional file 4). None had an AMSTAR score ≥ 8. Topical negative pressure was more effective than conventional therapy in one meta-analysis.

### Advanced wound care therapies for nonhealing diabetic, venous, and arterial ulcers: a systematic review [^115a4a91]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Nonhealing ulcers affect patient quality of life and impose a substantial financial burden on the health care system.

Purpose

To systematically evaluate benefits and harms of advanced wound care therapies for nonhealing diabetic, venous, and arterial ulcers.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (1995 to June 2013), the Cochrane Library, and reference lists.

Study Selection

English-language randomized trials reporting ulcer healing or time to complete healing in adults with nonhealing ulcers treated with advanced therapies.

Data Extraction

Study characteristics, outcomes, adverse events, study quality, and strength of evidence were extracted by trained researchers and confirmed by the principal investigator.

Data Synthesis

For diabetic ulcers, 35 trials (9 therapies) met eligibility criteria. There was moderate-strength evidence for improved healing with a biological skin equivalent (relative risk [RR], 1.58 [95% CI, 1.20 to 2.08]) and negative pressure wound therapy (RR, 1.49 [CI, 1.11 to 2.01]) compared with standard care and low-strength evidence for platelet-derived growth factors and silver cream compared with standard care. For venous ulcers, 20 trials (9 therapies) met eligibility criteria. There was moderate-strength evidence for improved healing with keratinocyte therapy (RR, 1.57 [CI, 1.16 to 2.11]) compared with standard care and low-strength evidence for biological dressing and a biological skin equivalent compared with standard care. One small trial of arterial ulcers reported improved healing with a biological skin equivalent compared with standard care. Overall, strength of evidence was low for ulcer healing and low or insufficient for time to complete healing.

Limitations

Only studies of products approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were reviewed. Studies were predominantly of fair or poor quality. Few trials compared 2 advanced therapies.

Conclusion

Compared with standard care, some advanced wound care therapies may improve the proportion of ulcers healed and reduce time to healing, although evidence is limited.

### The use of negative pressure wound therapy in severe open lower extremity fractures: identifying the association between length of therapy and surgical outcomes [^26e6128a]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is a widely accepted method of temporary coverage for complex lower extremity wounds before definitive reconstruction. However, the precise role of NPWT in the perioperative management of patients with complicated lower extremity injuries remains unclear. In this study, we examine the effect of NPWT on flap complications and overall outcomes based on timing of soft-tissue reconstruction relative to initial injury and implementation of NPWT.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 32 consecutive patients presenting to a single institution receiving lower extremity reconstruction after Gustilo class IIIB or IIIC open tibial fractures over a 5-y period. Length of hospitalization, number of surgical procedures, flap failure, infection, and nonunion were parameters of interest in this study.

Results

The incidence of complications in patients treated with NPWT was lower compared with patients who underwent wet-to-dry dressing changes, regardless of when surgery was performed. The highest rate of complications was observed in patients operated on > 6 wk after injury and who received wet-to-dry dressing changes wound care. By comparison, those who underwent surgery within 1 wk of injury and who were bridged with NPWT had the lowest rate of complications.

Conclusions

The use of NPWT therapy in the perioperative management of patients with open lower extremity fractures reduces complication rates associated with limb salvage surgery. Our results suggest that NPWT can be used as a temporizing measure to optimize patients before flap surgery, effectively lengthening the window of opportunity for definitive reconstruction.

### Heel pressure injuries: consensus-based recommendations for assessment and management [^f319f326]. Advances in Wound Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Management of HPIs stages III and IV, suspected deep tissue injuries, and injuries of unknown depth

Text of recommendations and statements, notes, and voting results are listed in Table 1.

RECOMMENDATION 10: In adult patients presenting with one or more HPIs stage III with a normal limb perfusion and no signs of infection, the negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) should be started to promote the healing process and reduce complications. Grade: Weakly recommended.

NPWT is considered a safe and effective treatment for different kinds of wounds. The panel suggests with a low level of agreement the use of NPWT as an effective treatment in stage III HPI not complicated with infection or poor vascular supply to speed up the healing process.

Moisture retaining dressings are widely recognized as part of standard practice for the treatment of pressure ulcers. However, the panel discussed about the potential role of adding a biophysical agent to improve and speed up the healing process of HPIs stage III, also avoiding further complications. In particular, experts substantially agreed to include NPWT as one of the options in not complicated stage III HPIs.

NPWT with instillation could be advisable even in presence of local infection. The panel underlined the need of skilled professionals. Moreover, a preliminary evaluation of the healing potential and life expectancy before using a treatment more expensive than standard treatment is strongly advisable. Established protocols could help clinicians in making the right choice.

RECOMMENDATION 11: In adult patients presenting with one or more HPIs stage IV, a surgical intervention must be performed to support the wound healing and prevent major amputation. Grade: Strongly recommended.

RECOMMENDATION 12: In adults presenting with one or more HPIs stage IV complicated with bone infection involving surrounding soft tissues, a surgical approach must be performed to support the wound healing and prevent major amputation. Grade: Strongly recommended.

Local treatment of HPIs is mainly empirical. In particular, evidence supporting surgical or conservative approach is completely lack. The poor available literature (a case series of three patients treated with surgical interventionand a narrative review on HPIs treatment) underlines possibility to achieve a complete healing in patients with stage IV HPIs and the need of a surgical intervention to obtain wound repair.

### How should clinical wound care and management translate to effective engineering standard testing requirements from foam dressings? Mapping the existing gaps and needs [^85bf46ee]. Advances in Wound Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Foams used in commercial wound dressings have variable pore sizes, ranging from 25 μm to over 1,000 μm. Smaller pore sizes and interconnecting channels allow for greater fluid retention properties. Larger pore sizes typically facilitate increased fluid absorption from the wound into the dressing, better handling of viscous fluids, and greater evaporation from the dressing to the environment.

The downside though is that larger pores and connecting channels allow immune and tissue-repairing cells such as fibroblasts to migrate into the dressing structure, instead of remaining within the wound bed, which in turn impairs healing. Furthermore, fibroblasts infiltrating the porous dressing structure may synthesize collagen within the dressing, near the wound surface, which would effectively lead to connective tissue (micro-)ingrowth into the dressing, resulting in traumatic and painful dressing removals.

Even if the pore sizes are not large enough for cells to infiltrate into the dressing, they may be sufficiently large to facilitate fibrin deposition at the wound contacting layer (as fibrin is present in the exudate at the early healing stages). The deposited fibrin may then cause dressing adherence (acting like a fibrin glue), especially if the dressing was in situ for multiple days.

Many of these historical problems related to tissue ingrowth into dressings and fibrin deposition, resulting in dressing adherence (leading to tissue trauma and pain to the patient on dressing removals), have been addressed by the introduction of dressings with silicone at the skin and wound interfaces. Yet, discomfort and pain during dressing removals remain a clinical issue, for example, because for dressings in which soft silicones are used to provide the adhesive border only, the wound contact layer (not covered by the silicone) might adhere to some degree to the wound bed.

### Debridement of diabetic foot ulcers: public health and clinical implications-a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression [^8dd16b68]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2022). High credibility.

Background

Diabetic foot ulceration (DFU) has devastating complications and a lifetime occurrence of 15%–34%. Debridement of DFU is regarded as an intervention that accelerates ulcer healing and may reduce complications including amputations, infections, and poor quality of life (QoL), which have serious public health and clinical implications. A systematic review (SR) of SRs and of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with meta-analyses (MAs) on debridement of DFU that synthesizes all human experimental evidence is warranted.

Objectives

Are debridement methods in DFU beneficial over other forms and standard gauze dressings (control condition) in these outcomes?

Study eligibility criteria

All SRs/MAs/RCTs comparing debridement methods for DFU with alternative methods of debridement and with control.

Data sources

Cochrane Wounds Group Specialized Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library), Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, EBSCO, CINAHL, and Web of Science.

Participants and interventions

Adults with type 1/2 diabetes with DFU and any debridement method compared with alternative debridement methods or control.

Main Outcomes

Amputation rates, wound infections, QoL, proportion of ulcers healed, time to complete healing, ulcer recurrence, and treatment cost.

Study selection and analysis

Data extraction/synthesis by two independent reviewers pooled using a random-effects model with sensitivity analysis.

Results

10 SRs were retrieved and reported qualitatively. Six SRs included MAs. This SR included 30 studies, with 2654 participants, using 19 debridement combinations. The debridement methods were compared with findings pooled into MAs. Meta-regression (MR) did not identify significant predictors/moderators of outcomes.

Limitations

The studies may have been under-powered. The inclusion/exclusion criteria varied and the increased risk of bias contributed to low-quality evidence.

Discussion/Conclusion

Weak evidence exists that debridement methods are superior to other forms of debridement or control in DFU.

Implications

Researchers should follow standardized reporting guidelines (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials). Clinicians/investigators could use the findings from this SR/MA/MR in guiding patient-individualized decision making and designing future RCTs.

### Wound cleansing for pressure ulcers [^866ddc50]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Pressure ulcers (also called pressure sores, bed sores and decubitus ulcers) are areas of tissue damage that occur in the elderly, malnourished or acutely ill, who cannot reposition themselves. Pressure ulcers impose a significant financial burden on health care systems and negatively affect quality of life. Wound cleansing is considered an important component of pressure ulcer care.

Objectives

This systematic review seeks to answer the following question: what is the effect of wound cleansing solutions and wound cleansing techniques on the rate of healing of pressure ulcers?

Search Methods

For this third update, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 3 January 2013); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 12); Ovid MEDLINE (2010 to November Week 3 2012); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations December 31, 2012); Ovid EMBASE (2010 to 2012 Week 52); and EBSCO CINAHL (2010 to 21 December 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing wound cleansing with no wound cleansing, or different wound cleansing solutions, or different cleansing techniques, were eligible for inclusion if they reported an objective measure of pressure ulcer healing.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted data independently and resolved disagreements through discussion. A structured narrative summary of the included studies was conducted. For dichotomous outcomes, risk ratio (RR), plus 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated; for continuous outcomes, mean difference (MD), plus 95% CI were calculated. Meta analysis was not conducted because of the small number of diverse RCTs identified. Two review authors independently assessed each included study using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias.

Main Results

One additional eligible study was identified from the updated searches, one study was added to the table of excluded studies. A total of three studies (169 participants) met the inclusion criteria for the review. No studies compared cleansing with no cleansing. Two studies compared different wound cleansing solutions. A statistically significant improvement in Pressure Sore Status Tool scores occurred for wounds cleansed with saline spray containing Aloe vera, silver chloride and decyl glucoside (Vulnopur) compared with isotonic saline (P value = 0.025), but no statistically significant change in healing was seen when water was compared with saline (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 41.89). One study compared cleansing techniques; for pressure ulcers cleansed with pulsatile lavage, compared with sham (the lavage flow was directed into a wash basin positioned adjacent to the wound and not visible to the participants), there was a statistically significant reduction in ulcer volume at the end of the three week study period in the lavage group compared with the sham group (MD -6.60, 95% CI-11.23, -1.97).

Authors' Conclusions

We identified three small studies addressing cleansing of pressure ulcers. One reported a statistically significant improvement in pressure ulcer healing for wounds cleansed with saline spray containing Aloe vera, silver chloride and decyl glucoside (Vulnopur) compared with isotonic saline solution, a further study reported no statistically significant change in healing was seen when wounds were cleaned with water was compared with saline. A final study compared pulsatile lavage with sham and found a significantly greater reduction in ulcer volume at the end of the study period in the lavage group compared with the sham group. The authors conclude that there is no good trial evidence to support use of any particular wound cleansing solution or technique for pressure ulcers.

### Negative pressure wound therapy for treating pressure ulcers [^61af5881]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores, pressure sores, or pressure injuries, are localised damage to the skin and underlying soft tissue, usually caused by intense or long-term pressure, shear, or friction. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been widely used in the treatment of pressure ulcers, but its effect needs to be further clarified. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2015.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of NPWT for treating adult with pressure ulcers in any care setting.

Search Methods

On 13 January 2022, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase, and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP Search Portal for ongoing and unpublished studies and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses, and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication, or study setting.

Selection Criteria

We included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of NPWT with alternative treatments or different types of NPWT in the treatment of adults with pressure ulcers (stage II or above).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently conducted study selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and the certainty of the evidence assessment using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion with a third review author.

Main Results

This review included eight RCTs with a total of 327 randomised participants. Six of the eight included studies were deemed to be at a high risk of bias in one or more risk of bias domains, and evidence for all outcomes of interest was deemed to be of very low certainty. Most studies had small sample sizes (range: 12 to 96, median: 37 participants). Five studies compared NPWT with dressings, but only one study reported usable primary outcome data (complete wound healing and adverse events). This study had only 12 participants and there were very few events; only one participant was healed in the study (risk ratio (RR) 3.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 61.74, very low-certainly evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in the number of participants with adverse events in the NPWT group and the dressing group, but the evidence for this outcome was also assessed as very low certainty (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.44, very low-certainty evidence). Changes in ulcer size, pressure ulcer severity, cost, and pressure ulcer scale for healing (PUSH) sores were also reported, but we were unable to draw conclusions due to the low certainly of the evidence. One study compared NPWT with a series of gel treatments, but this study provided no usable data. Another study compared NPWT with 'moist wound healing', which did not report primary outcome data. Changes in ulcer size and cost were reported in this study, but we assessed the evidence as being of very low certainty; One study compared NPWT combined with internet-plus home care with standard care, but no primary outcome data were reported. Changes in ulcer size, pain, and dressing change times were reported, but we also assessed the evidence as being of very low certainty. None of the included studies reported time to complete healing, health-related quality of life, wound infection, or wound recurrence.

Authors' Conclusions

The efficacy, safety, and acceptability of NPWT in treating pressure ulcers compared to usual care are uncertain due to the lack of key data on complete wound healing, adverse events, time to complete healing, and cost-effectiveness. Compared with usual care, using NPWT may speed up the reduction of pressure ulcer size and severity of pressure ulcer, reduce pain, and dressing change times. Still, trials were small, poorly described, had short follow-up times, and with a high risk of bias; any conclusions drawn from the current evidence should be interpreted with considerable caution. In the future, high-quality research with large sample sizes and low risk of bias is still needed to further verify the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of NPWT in the treatment of pressure ulcers. Future researchers need to recognise the importance of complete and accurate reporting of clinically important outcomes such as the complete healing rate, healing time, and adverse events.

### Effect of postoperative dressing on excisions performed on the leg: a comparison between zinc oxide compression dressings versus standard wound care [^58203894]. Dermatologic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Wound healing on the legs may be complicated by delayed healing and other postoperative problems. Two potential postoperative wound care regimens for sutured excisions on the legs include a standard pressure dressing and zinc oxide compression dressings. Limited data exist comparing the efficacy of these 2 options.

Objective

To compare outcomes of standard postoperative wound care dressing versus postoperative use of a zinc oxide compression dressings for sutured repairs on the legs.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, healing time and complication rate of 44 patients treated with standard dressing and 36 patients treated with zinc oxide compression dressings were compared.

Results

At 19 days, 91.7% of patients receiving zinc oxide dressing were fully healed, whereas only 65.9% of patients receiving standard wound care were healed. Complications were noted in 6 of the patients receiving standard dressing (13.6%); no complications occurred in the zinc oxide dressing group.

Conclusion

Zinc oxide compression dressings were a practical option for postoperative wound care, with decreased incidence of delayed wound healing, and fewer complications versus standard postoperative wound dressing.
