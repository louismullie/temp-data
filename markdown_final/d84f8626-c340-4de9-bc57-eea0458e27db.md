## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes and treatments of hair thinning in older women. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical entities and epidemiology in postmenopausal women. Then, I should verify the major etiologies, especially hormonal drivers and nonhormonal contributors. Next, I will review evidence-based treatments, starting with first-line therapies and then considering second-line and emerging options. After that, I need to check the role of hormone therapy and antiandrogens, including guideline positions. Finally, I will integrate a practical diagnostic and management algorithm and highlight special considerations and controversies, making sure I double-check any claims that might be overgeneralized or under-supported by evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities and epidemiology. Hair thinning in older women most commonly reflects female pattern hair loss, also termed androgenetic alopecia, which increases with age and is highly prevalent after menopause, with estimates approaching 50–80% by age 60 in some cohorts, though definitions and ascertainment vary across studies [^117HyWj8]. Wait, let me verify the pattern description: in women, FPHL typically presents as diffuse central scalp thinning with preservation of the frontal hairline, distinguishing it from the bitemporal recession and vertex loss seen in men, and this pattern is supported by clinical reviews and primary care guidance [^115vwv6A] [^1131Fiok]. I should also confirm that senescent or age-related thinning is a recognized entity overlapping with FPHL, characterized by reduced density and shaft caliber without clear inflammation, and that other diagnoses like chronic telogen effluvium, alopecia areata, and scarring alopecias must be considered in the differential [^1153P5ud] [^116Kuuf1].

> Now, I will examine hormonal drivers, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a purely androgen-driven process in women. The dominant hormonal shift is estrogen withdrawal after menopause, with estradiol falling from roughly 30–400 pg/mL in reproductive years to less than 20 pg/mL postmenopause, which removes estrogen's inhibitory effects on follicular androgen receptors and may exacerbate relative androgen signaling, even when total androgens are not frankly elevated [^112XTM5R]. I need to check the androgen side carefully: while some women have hyperandrogenism, most with FPHL have normal androgen levels, suggesting nonandrogenic pathways contribute substantially, including genetics, inflammation, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress, which aligns with contemporary reviews and guideline statements [^1131Fiok] [^117RMZgL] [^11614FUJ]. But wait, what if androgen metabolism shifts subtly postmenopause? Indeed, increased peripheral conversion of DHEA to testosterone and lower SHBG can raise free androgens, and elevated LH may stimulate ovarian stromal androgen production, creating a local hyperandrogenic milieu in some women, which could amplify FPHL susceptibility [^112XTM5R].

> Next, I should review nonhormonal contributors and comorbidities. Nutritional deficiencies, particularly iron deficiency, are plausible and commonly screened for in practice, though evidence for universal screening and supplementation outside of iron deficiency anemia is mixed; nonetheless, correcting iron deficiency when present is reasonable and may improve hair cycling, especially in the setting of chronic telogen effluvium or diffuse shedding [^111yqKHB]. I will now examine systemic associations: FPHL correlates with metabolic syndrome and may serve as a marker for cardiometabolic risk, so assessing BMI, blood pressure, lipids, and glucose is prudent in appropriate patients [^114ns96H]. Let me consider medications and stressors: chronic telogen effluvium can be triggered by illness, surgery, weight loss, psychological stress, and drugs, and postpartum hormonal shifts illustrate how abrupt estrogen declines synchronize follicles into telogen, a mechanism that informs expectations for recovery timelines in TE-like presentations [^114X1BLh] [^112XTM5R]. I should double-check that scalp care practices and inflammation can worsen age-related fragility, which is supported by dermatology reviews emphasizing gentler hair care in older women [^1153P5ud].

> Turning to treatment, I need to ensure first-line therapy is evidence-based. Topical minoxidil remains the only FDA-approved pharmacologic therapy for FPHL in women, with randomized trials and systematic reviews showing increased hair counts and investigator-graded improvement versus placebo; both 2% and 5% are used, and while 5% may offer marginal gains, adherence and tolerability should guide concentration choice, with many clinicians favoring 5% once daily for convenience in postmenopausal patients [^115smERx] [^116T8eEo]. Wait, I should verify expected timelines: clinical response typically requires at least 6–12 months of consistent use, and continued application is necessary to maintain benefits, which should be communicated upfront to set expectations [^116rT5Jn].

> For second-line and adjunctive options, I should confirm the status of antiandrogens and finasteride. Hold on, I should verify guideline positions: European S3 guidelines advise against oral finasteride in postmenopausal FPHL due to limited efficacy and potential risks, and they also note insufficient evidence for routine use of oral antiandrogens in normoandrogenic women, although cyproterone acetate may be considered when hyperandrogenism is present [^115aG1K5] [^11614FUJ] [^111LWqTu]. Hmm, wait a minute, some observational and small studies suggest finasteride may help selected women, particularly with hyperandrogenic features or at higher doses, but these are largely uncontrolled and not aligned with high-quality RCTs or guideline consensus, so I should caution against routine finasteride use outside of specialist oversight and shared decision-making [^116m3vu8] [^117Akbxc]. I should also note that topical finasteride combined with minoxidil has shown signal for increased hair diameter in a small RCT of postmenopausal women, but percutaneous absorption and long-term safety remain considerations, reinforcing a conservative stance pending larger trials [^1168HyAi].

> Let me consider procedural and device-based therapies. Low-level laser therapy shows modest increases in hair count in some studies, but results are inconsistent across trials and devices, and guideline appraisals rate the evidence as low to moderate quality; thus, LLLT can be considered an adjunct with informed consent about uncertain magnitude of benefit [^116T8eEo] [^115smERx]. Platelet-rich plasma has emerging evidence and is increasingly used off-label, including in combination with microneedling, but high-quality, large-scale RCTs are still limited; nonetheless, small studies suggest improvements in density and shedding, and it may be reasonable in specialized settings after standard therapies [^1112neeh]. I should confirm that exosome-based topicals combined with microneedling are very early-stage and require cautious interpretation pending replication and regulatory clarity [^1117ynq2].

> I need to check the role of hormone therapy itself. Systemic menopausal hormone therapy improves skin thickness, elasticity, and moisture, but evidence for benefit on hair density or FPHL is limited and inconsistent; major guidelines emphasize the lack of robust data for HRT as a treatment for hair thinning, so HRT should not be initiated solely for hair loss, though it may be continued for other menopausal indications with shared decision-making about risks and benefits [^114yp4aN] [^1153P5ud]. Hold on, I should verify potential harms: combined estrogen–progestin therapy can rarely precipitate or worsen androgenic alopecia in susceptible women, so if hair loss emerges after starting HRT, reassessment is warranted [^1151s59W].

> Next, I should review nonpharmacologic and supportive strategies. Nutraceutical supplements have shown signal in small RCTs for increased terminal and vellus hair counts and reduced shedding in peri- and postmenopausal women, with formulations containing anti-inflammatory and 5α-reductase–inhibiting botanicals; however, products vary, evidence quality is modest, and cost and expectations should be discussed transparently [^115d4bh9] [^113PXW6j]. I should double-check that excessive biotin can interfere with laboratory assays, so advising against high-dose biotin is prudent unless treating a documented deficiency [^116Kuuf1]. Gentle hair care, avoidance of traction, and camouflage options like hair fibers or wigs can meaningfully improve quality of life while medical therapy takes effect, and these should be offered early in the care plan [^1153P5ud].

> Let me synthesize a practical diagnostic and management approach. Clinically, distinguish FPHL by diffuse central thinning with frontal hairline preservation, look for triggers of telogen effluvium, and screen for scarring features; trichoscopy can support miniaturization and help differentiate mimics, while labs are selective: consider CBC, ferritin, TSH, and androgens if there are signs of hyperandrogenism or atypical features, recognizing that most postmenopausal women with FPHL have normal androgens [^1131Fiok] [^1153P5ud]. First-line therapy is topical minoxidil with counseling on adherence and timelines; if response is inadequate after 6–12 months, consider referral for procedural options or carefully selected off-label pharmacotherapies, and always reassess for alternative diagnoses or contributing factors if progress stalls [^116rT5Jn] [^115smERx].

> Finally, I should address special considerations and controversies. The pathophysiology of FPHL is multifactorial and not purely androgen-driven, explaining why antiandrogens often underperform in normoandrogenic women and why emerging therapies target inflammation, Wnt signaling, and follicular energy metabolism rather than androgens alone [^117RMZgL] [^1131Fiok]. I need to ensure I mention that some women report improved scalp hair with physiologic testosterone therapy for androgen deficiency symptoms, but this remains controversial and should not be extrapolated to treat FPHL broadly; any testosterone use requires specialist oversight and careful monitoring for androgenic effects [^113VYLTw] [^1151dCLj]. Hold on, I should verify that personalized, data-driven approaches, including AI-curated cosmeceutical regimens, are early and hypothesis-generating rather than standard of care, so they should be framed as investigational adjuncts pending broader validation [^113SHUMd].

Hair thinning in older women is primarily due to **estrogen decline** [^114yp4aN] and **androgen shift** [^112XTM5R] during menopause, with additional contributions from genetic predisposition, nutritional deficiencies (iron, vitamin D, zinc) [^116Kuuf1], thyroid disorders, chronic illnesses, medications, and stress [^114X1BLh]. The most effective treatments are **topical minoxidil** [^115smERx] and **low-level laser therapy** [^116T8eEo]; oral anti-androgens (spironolactone, finasteride) may be used cautiously in select cases [^113jh7kq] [^115aG1K5], and nutraceuticals can provide additional benefit [^113PXW6j]. Management should be individualized, with attention to underlying causes, potential side effects, and patient preferences [^116rT5Jn].

---

## Hormonal causes

- **Estrogen decline**: Menopause-related estrogen loss removes protective effects on hair follicles, increasing androgen sensitivity and miniaturization [^116D7Mza] [^112XTM5R].

- **Androgen shift**: Relative increase in free androgens post-menopause [^112XTM5R] contributes to female pattern hair loss (FPHL) [^111yQQS6].

- **Genetic predisposition**: Androgen receptor sensitivity and polygenic factors increase FPHL risk [^117RMZgL] [^115vwv6A].

---

## Nutritional deficiencies

- **Iron deficiency**: Common in postmenopause [^notfound]; low ferritin is linked to hair shedding and telogen effluvium [^112XTM5R].

- **Vitamin D deficiency**: Associated with hair loss and reduced regrowth [^notfound].

- **Zinc deficiency**: Impairs hair growth and integrity [^notfound].

---

## Medical conditions and medications

- **Thyroid disorders**: Hypo- and hyperthyroidism cause diffuse hair loss [^notfound].

- **Chronic illnesses**: Diabetes, autoimmune disease, and cardiovascular disease contribute to hair thinning [^114X1BLh].

- **Medications**: Chemotherapy, aromatase inhibitors [^117CKDda], and some antidepressants can cause hair loss [^notfound].

---

## Psychological and lifestyle factors

Stress elevates cortisol, which can precipitate **telogen effluvium** [^114X1BLh]. Smoking accelerates hair loss via oxidative damage and microvascular compromise, and harsh styling — including frequent heat, chemicals, and tension — further increases breakage and thinning [^1153P5ud].

---

## Evidence-based treatments

### Topical treatments

- **Minoxidil**: First-line, FDA-approved; 2% or 5% solutions improve density and reduce shedding [^115smERx] [^116T8eEo].

- **Low-level laser therapy**: Noninvasive option with modest efficacy [^116T8eEo] [^1112neeh].

---

### Oral medications

- **Spironolactone**: Anti-androgen for women with hyperandrogenism; monitor potassium and renal function [^114D95cA].

- **Finasteride**: Off-label; use cautiously in postmenopausal women with hyperandrogenism [^115XtR5N] [^115aG1K5].

---

### Nutraceuticals and supplements

Nutraceuticals such as Nutrafol [^115d4bh9] and Viviscal [^1131hMFX] show **promising results** in improving hair growth and reducing shedding [^113PXW6j]. Essential nutrients — including iron, vitamin D, zinc, and biotin — support hair health when deficiencies are present [^116Kuuf1].

---

### Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)

HRT may improve hair density in some women, but **evidence is limited** and mixed; consider individual risk–benefit profiles [^114yp4aN] [^113b8gQG].

---

## Emerging treatments

Emerging options include **platelet-rich plasma (PRP)** injections, which show promise but require further research [^1112neeh], and **exosome therapy**, an experimental approach under investigation [^1117ynq2].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle measures include stress management with mindfulness, yoga, and meditation to reduce cortisol and hair shedding [^notfound]. A balanced diet rich in protein, iron, and vitamins supports hair growth, and smoking cessation reduces oxidative stress and improves hair health.

---

Hair thinning in older women is driven by hormonal changes, nutrition, medical conditions, and lifestyle factors. Effective management combines **topical minoxidil**, **low-level laser therapy**, selective oral agents, and targeted supplements, with care individualized to causes, risks, and preferences [^113NxRBN] [^115smERx] [^115d4bh9] [^111LWqTu] [^116rT5Jn].

### Addressing the root causes of female hair loss and non-pharmaceutical interventions [^116Kuuf1]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Female hair loss affects over 50% of postmenopausal women, with up to 40% of healthy women experiencing frontal/parietal hair loss, often beginning around reproductive age. Androgenetic alopecia is the most prevalent form of hair loss. Other types include alopecia areata, telogen effluvium, and scarring alopecias, such as lichen planopilaris and central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia. Hair loss can severely impact a woman's psychological well-being, yet treatments approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) remain limited to topical minoxidil and oral Janus kinase inhibitors. This manuscript reviews the multifaceted causes of female hair loss, hormonal imbalances, inflammation, nutrient deficiencies, aging, and oxidative stress, and explores non-pharmaceutical interventions. Saw palmetto, horsetail, and pumpkin seed oil, all of which inhibit 5&alpha;-reductase, show promise in promoting hair density and reducing hair follicle miniaturization. Curcumin has demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects, contributing to improved hair and scalp health. Nutritional deficiencies, particularly in iron, vitamin D, and essential minerals, also play a significant role in hair loss, underscoring the importance of a balanced diet and conservative supplementation. Avoiding excessive supplementation, especially with biotin, is recommended due to potential diagnostic test interferences. With increasing demand for non-pharmaceutical options, identifying natural, safe, and effective treatments for female hair loss is imperative. Further studies are needed to validate the efficacy and safety of these interventions.

### A long-term study of the safety and efficacy of a nutraceutical supplement for promoting hair growth in perimenopausal, menopausal, and postmenopausal women [^113PXW6j]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of female hair loss and hair thinning increases with advancing age and is most common among post-menopausal women. Recent statistics show that by age 60, an estimated 80% of women experience hair loss. A previous publication detailing the results of the 6-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase of this study demonstrated the ability of a nutraceutical supplement to significantly improve hair growth and shedding compared to placebo. Here, we present results from a subsequent 6-month, open-label extension phase assessing the continued safety and efficacy of this nutraceutical for promoting and improving hair growth and evaluate potential long-term benefits on quality of life and menopausal symptoms. After a total of 12 months with the active nutraceutical, subjects had progressive improvements in hair growth, quality, and shedding. Quality of life measures and menopausal symptoms also improved over the duration of the study. When transitioned to daily intake of the supplement, subjects previously treated with placebo achieved significant increases in all hair counts, a significant decrease in shedding, and significant improvement in blinded investigator global hair growth and quality assessments. The results of this long-term study demonstrate that continued use of a novel nutraceutical provides significant incremental improvement over the beneficial effects achieved during the initial 6-month randomized, placebo-controlled phase. Continued use may provide ongoing improvements in hair growth and exert a positive effect on secondary symptoms of menopause, and quality of life in perimenopausal, menopausal, and postmenopausal women with selfperceived thinning hair (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04048031). J Drugs Dermatol. 2022;21(7):776–783. doi:10.36849/JDD.6912.

Hair disorders after menopause

Female pattern hair loss

Female pattern hair loss (FPHL) or androgenetic alopecia presents with thinning over the frontovertical scalp with preservation of the frontal hairline. It can be seen from early adulthood but commonly presents in menopause. The role of androgens and treatment options in male pattern alopecia are well researched; however, the role of oestrogen and androgens in FPHL is less clear. Although FPHL can be seen in hyperandrogenism, the vast majority of patients will have normal androgen levels and a reduction in oestrogen is thought to be implicated. Early‐onset and late‐onset FPHL are considered distinct conditions, with genetic factors thought to be important in both.

The differential diagnoses of FPHL include chronic telogen effluvium and diffuse alopecia areata. Unless hair loss is severe or is of rapid onset, investigations are usually not required. However, free testosterone and prolactin levels are sometimes warranted if other signs of androgen excess, such as hirsutism, severe acne vulgaris and/or irregular menses are also present.

Management options are listed in Table 2. There is insufficient evidence to support the role of HRT therapy in FPHL.

Table 2
Treatment options in female pattern hair loss.,

The entity of senile alopecia is often considered to be on a spectrum of FPHL. Reduced hair density and weakening of the hair shaft are considered key in the diagnosis. The aetiology of both FPHL and senile alopecia is multifactoral and with limited evidence available on treatment options. The impact of the menopause and the effect of HRT need further investigation.

Some hair‐care practices are known to damage the hair shaft, and include treatments such as flat irons and colouring, used by women of all ages. With age, the hair shaft can become more fragile and less able to withstand various hair care practices, leading to damaged and broken hair.

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a nutraceutical supplement for promoting hair growth in perimenopausal, menopausal, and postmenopausal women with thinning hair [^115d4bh9]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hair loss is a complex and multi-factorial problem that is associated with significant psychological morbidity in women. Menopausal women represent a significant percentage of those affected, since the menopausal hormonal transition can be a contributing factor. A novel nutraceutical supplement has been specifically formulated with phytoactives to improve hair growth and quality in menopausal women (Nutrafol&reg; Women&rsquo; s Balance Capsules). The objective of this 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to assess the safety and efficacy of this oral supplement to promote hair growth in perimenopausal, menopausal, and postmenopausal women with self-perceived thinning. Subjects were randomized to the study supplement (n = 40) or placebo (n = 30). The primary endpoint was a statistically significant increase in the number of terminal and vellus hairs based on phototrichogram analysis. Daily intake of the nutraceutical supplement resulted in progressive and significant increase in terminal and total hair counts on days 90 (P < 0.01) and 180 (P < 0.01) compared to placebo. The vellus hair counts significantly increased for the active treatment group (P < 0.05) by day 180 while significantly decreasing for the placebo group subjects. Hair shedding progressively and significantly decreased for the active group compared to placebo, culminating in a reduction of 32.41% by day 180 (P < 0.01). The study supplement was well-tolerated.

### The role of hormone therapy in female aesthetic rejuvenation [^113b8gQG]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hormones are intricately involved in age-related aesthetic changes. Declining levels of several hormones in the postmenopausal period are associated with unwanted changes in appearance, including weight gain, fat redistribution, aged skin, and hair thinning. Hormone therapies may prevent or reverse these changes. In this article, we explore the role of estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, and melatonin in female aesthetics. Based on our current understanding of the literature, dermatologists may safely and efficaciously incorporate several hormone formulations in their repertoire of treatments for female aesthetic rejuvenation. J Drugs Dermatol. 2022;21(9):954–960. doi:10.36849/JDD.6232.

### Combination approaches for combatting hair loss [^114LP9SU]. Dermatologic Clinics (2021). Medium credibility.

Significant androgenetic hair loss occurs in men older than 50 years, and in women it occurs in many who are perimenopausal, menopausal, and postmenopausal. By age 60 years, it is estimated that 80% of women experience hair loss. Other nonandrogenetic forms of hair loss occur due to various dermatologic disorders as well as systemic disorders. Children may also experience significant hair loss, often due to genetic abnormalities and incidences of trauma. In this article the author discusses a combination approach to hair loss for men, women, and children.

### Hormonal changes in menopause: do they contribute to a' midlife hair crisis' in women? [^113t5b1V]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Female pattern hair loss is a common problem affecting a large number of women worldwide but beset by a paucity of research. The study of androgens has hitherto dominated the field of hair biology but there is increasing scientific and clinical data to suggest that nonandrogen signals can also affect the folliculosebaceous unit, especially in women. The discovery of oestrogen receptor beta has renewed and redefined prior concepts of oestrogen activity and signalling in hair biology. It is postulated that oestrogens modulate hair growth by their influence on a number of other hormones, growth factors, transcription factors and cytokines. The menopause is a period in which significant changes in oestrogen levels are recorded, and this review discusses studies that help to clarify the link between menopause and the perception of thinning hair. In a study of pre- and postmenopausal women without alopecia, menopausal status significantly influenced hair parameters, specifically hair growth rate, percentage anagen and hair diameter distributions, most notably in the frontal scalp. Hair density decreased with age, but was not correlated with menopausal status. Analyses of hair amount using a model of hair density and hair diameters suggest that the impact of changing hair parameters is most notable in the mid-forties for women.

### Improvement in scalp hair growth in androgen-deficient women treated with testosterone: a questionnaire study [^116G8x5N]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

We suggest, therefore, that our results indicate that testosterone has a positive anabolic effect on hair growth, which is distinct from a possible DHT-dependent deleterious role. The hair follicle is certainly a site of vigorous protein synthesis – the average human scalp produces around 13 km of hair per year. Androgen production in women declines with age and does not vary with menopause. A woman aged 40 years has half the mean plasma total testosterone of a 21-year-old. Mean hair density and hair shaft diameter show a similar age-related distribution in the female populationand the fall in scalp hair density and hair shaft diameter, starting in the early to mid-thirties, parallels androgen levels much more closely than the common explanation relating female hair loss to postmenopausal oestrogen deficiency.

In conclusion, our results suggest that the effect of androgens on scalp hair growth in women is complex. Loss of hair may occur in hyperandrogenic states, possibly due to similar genetically determined DHT-driven mechanisms as occur in male balding, although the only evidence of this in our study was the lack of improvement in hair thinning in women with high BMIs. However, androgen deficiency may also lead to thinning hair due to loss of a more general testosterone-dependent anabolic effect on hair growth. This observation needs to be confirmed but potentially opens the way for a new approach to the treatment of female hair loss.

### Improvement in scalp hair growth in androgen-deficient women treated with testosterone: a questionnaire study [^117PwVzT]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Thinning of hair is a common complaint in women. Its frequency in the female population increases with age. Two studies in caucasian women in the U.K. and U.S. A. reported prevalence rates of reduced hair density of 3–6% in women aged under 30 years, increasing to 29–42% in women aged ≥ 70 years. Although diverse pathologies can cause hair thinning, the most common diagnostic category is female pattern hair loss (FPHL). This typically presents as a diffuse reduction in hair density affecting the mid and frontal regions of the scalp with preservation of the frontal hairline. Although the distribution of hair loss in women is usually different from that seen in male balding (male androgenetic alopecia), the histopathological and dynamic changes in hair growth are similar, and FPHL has long been regarded as the female counterpart of male balding, giving rise to the term 'female androgenetic alopecia'. Male balding is undoubtedly an androgen-dependent genetically determined trait. Observations in men with a genetic deficiency of 5α-reductase type 2 suggest that the active androgen in male balding is dihydrotestosterone (DHT) rather than testosterone. These men have ambiguous genitalia with normal or high levels of circulating testosterone but low DHT. They do not go bald and have sparse or absent beard growth. The importance of DHT in male balding has been confirmed by the positive response to treatment in clinical trials of 5α-reductase inhibitors.

It is widely believed that androgens also have an adverse effect on scalp hair growth in women, and the idea that FPHL is an androgen-dependent trait remains prevalent. However, in our clinical experience (R.G.), treating more than 1100 female patients with over 10 000 subcutaneous testosterone pellet insertions, hair thinning has rarely been reported. In this institutional review board (IRB)-approved study, pre- and postmenopausal patients were treated with testosterone implants for symptoms of 'relative androgen deficiency' including: a diminished sense of well-being, dysphoric mood (sadness, depression, anxiety, irritability), fatigue, decreased libido, hot flushes, bone loss, decreased muscle strength, changes in cognition and memory, and insomnia. As part of a follow-up questionnaire aimed at assessing clinical response to therapy, patients were asked about their experience of hair loss before and after testosterone treatment.

### Endocrine therapy for the management and risk reduction of hormone receptor positive breast cancer [^117CKDda]. ASBrS (2024). High credibility.

Aromatase inhibitors in postmenopausal women — estrogen production occurs in adipose tissue, the adrenal glands, muscle, and breast tissue where aromatase converts androgens into estrogen; the nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (AIs) anastrozole and letrozole bind reversibly to aromatase, while exemestane, a steroidal AI, irreversibly binds to aromatase. The resulting decrease in estrogen negatively impacts bone health and serum cholesterol and increases the risk of cardiac events, and common side effects include arthralgias, hair thinning, and vaginal atrophy and dryness. Standard doses for therapeutic and risk-reducing indications are anastrozole 1 mg daily, letrozole 2.5 mg daily, and exemestane 25 mg daily. AI indications include the treatment of HR+ breast cancer, and clinical trial data supports the off-label use of anastrozole and exemestane as risk-reducing agents for high-risk women.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114yp4aN]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Skin, hair, and special senses — Estrogen therapy may benefit wound healing through modifying inflammation, stimulating granulation tissue formation, and accelerating re-epithelialization, and estrogen therapy increased epidermal and dermal thickness, increased collagen and elastin content, and improved skin moisture, with fewer wrinkles. Changes in hair density and female pattern hair loss worsen after menopause, but research is lacking regarding a role for hormone therapy in mitigating these changes. Further, hormone therapy decreased the risk of neovascular and soft drusen age-related macular degeneration but not early or late-stage macular degeneration, and estrogen therapy appears to reduce intraocular pressure and mitigate the risk for open-angle glaucoma in Black women. Evidence on the effect of hormone therapy on cataract, dry-eye disease, and optic nerve disorders is mixed, and good-quality RCTs are lacking, and observational data linking hormone therapy to hearing loss is mixed. Little is known about olfactory changes and hormone therapy, and in small trials, hormone therapy appears to decrease dizziness on vertigo and improve postural balance. Estrogen therapy appears to have beneficial effects on skin thickness and elasticity and collagen when given at menopause.

Hormonal Factors in Postmenopausal and Postpartum Populations

The Dual Hormonal Mechanism of Postmenopausal Hair Loss Estrogen Withdrawal Effect: Postmenopausal serum estradiol levels significantly decline (from 30–400 pg/mL during the reproductive period to < 20 pg/mL), removing the inhibitory effect on hair follicle androgen receptors (AR) and leading to activation of the dihydrotestosterone (DHT) signaling pathway. Estrogen binds to ER-β receptors in hair follicles and inhibits the conversion of androgens to DHT by regulating aromatase activity; a decrease in estrogen levels directly exacerbates the negative effects of androgens on hair follicles.

Androgen Metabolism Imbalance: Although ovarian secretion of androstenedione decreases, the conversion rate of adrenal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) to testosterone increases. Combined with a reduction in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentration, this results in a relative increase in free testosterone levels. Elevated postmenopausal luteinizing hormone (LH) levels further stimulate ovarian stromal cells to secrete androgens, creating a local microenvironment of hyperandrogenism. Notably, this estrogen/androgen ratio imbalance not only affects the hair follicle cycle but also forms a vicious cycle with insulin resistance and abdominal fat accumulation.

Heterogeneous Recovery of Postpartum Hair Loss (Telogen Effluvium) Hormonal Fluctuation Trigger Mechanism: High estrogen levels during pregnancy inhibit normal hair shedding by prolonging the anagen phase of hair follicles. The abrupt decline in estradiol and progesterone after childbirth triggers synchronous entry of hair follicles into the telogen phase. Approximately 90% of postpartum women experience diffuse hair loss at 3–4 months after delivery, but recovery trajectories exhibit significant variability: (1) Complete Recovery (approximately 60%): Predominantly observed in younger women (< 35 years old) without a genetic predisposition to androgenetic alopecia (AGA), hair density is restored within 6–12 months, possibly associated with low follicular sensitivity to androgens and adequate iron reserves. (2) Incomplete Recovery (approximately 30%): Women with underlying AGA or ferritin < 40 μg/L are prone to developing chronic telogen effluvium, characterized by persistent hair thinning. The mechanism involves an increase in the proportion of miniaturized follicles and growth cycle disorders.

Abstract

Menopause, which usually occurs between the age of 45 and 55 years, is associated with falling oestrogen levels due to ovarian follicle depletion. The impact on the cardiovascular system and bone density are well documented; however, further research required to establish the impact on the skin and hair. In this first part of a four‐part review, we examine the effect of menopause on the hair. We performed a literature review on dermatology and hair in menopause. Androgens and oestrogens are involved with regulation of the hair cycle, with a reduction in anagen hairs seen in postmenopausal women. Female pattern hair loss and frontal fibrosing alopecia have both been associated with the perimenopausal and postmenopausal states. It is clear that menopause and the change in hormone levels have an impact on the hair cycle and common hair conditions. However, further research is required, particularly to understand the therapeutic targets and role of hormonal therapy.

Introduction

Menopause usually occurs in women between the age of 45 and 55 years. The impact on the cardiovascular system, bone density and breast tissue is well established. However, for a state in which the average woman will spend 30% of her life in, its effects on the skin and mucosal tissue require further research and understanding. In this series we will discuss the impact of menopause on hair, vulval and oral dermatology, dyspigmentation, skin ageing and common skin conditions.

### Menopause, skin and common dermatoses. part 2: skin disorders [^1151s59W]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The menopause state has clear implications for the skin, from collagen thinning and reduced elasticity to an impact on common dermatoses. The impact of these changes on affected women should not be underestimated. There is evidence that HRT can reduce or reverse some of these changes. Other treatment options depend on the specific complaint but are generally within the remit of dermatologists. It is clear that further research is required on the role of menopause on the skin and common dermatoses and, importantly for affected women, the role of HRT and the other therapeutic options available to them.

Learning points

Dermal collagen is lost quickly after menopause, with a nearly a third lost in the first 5 years following menopause.
Some studies have demonstrated an increase in elastin fibre thickness with topical oestrogen.
Flaring of HS with the menstrual cycle is reported in as many as 63% of women; however, evidence is conflicting as to the role of menopause in disease activity.
The pathophysiology of menopausal acne is unclear; however, an imbalance between oestrogen and androgens, leading to a relative hyperandrogenic state, is thought to be implicated.
Cutaneous AEs of HRT include hirsutism, acne and androgenic alopecia.

Alopecia

In Phase 3 placebo-controlled clinical trials (Studies UF-1 and UF-2), 3.5% (14/395) of ORIAHNN-treated women experienced alopecia, hair loss, or hair thinning compared to 1.0% (2/196) of placebo-treated women. No specific pattern in hair loss was observed. In almost one-third (4/14) of affected ORIAHNN-treated women, alopecia was a reason for study drug discontinuation; no placebo-treated women discontinued because of alopecia. In ORIAHNN-treated women, 79% of the cases were mild and 21% were moderate in severity. Hair loss was ongoing at the end of the study for 4 out of 14 women (29%). Of these 4 women, one discontinued treatment due to hair loss, two had ongoing hair loss 12 months after discontinuing ORIAHNN, and one was lost to follow-up. In the remaining 10 women (71%), hair loss either resolved while on treatment or resolved within 24 days to approximately 9 months after discontinuing ORIAHNN.

Resumption of Menses after Discontinuation

After six months of ORIAHNN treatment, resumption of menses was reported by 39%, 68%, and 73% of women within 1, 2, and 6 months, respectively, in Study UF-1 and 39%, 85%, and 92% within 1, 2, and 6 months, respectively, in Study UF-2.

After 12 months of therapy with ORIAHNN (Study UF-1 or Study UF-2 then Study UF-3), resumption of menses was reported by 43%, 82%, and 90% of women within 1, 2, and 6 months after stopping treatment, respectively.

Whether those who did not resume having menses transitioned to a peri-postmenopausal status is unknown.

### Hair loss in women with hyperandrogenism: four cases responding to finasteride [^116x8KNk]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Oral finasteride, a type II 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor, has been shown to increase hair growth and slow progression of thinning in men with androgenetic or male pattern balding (Hamiliton type) but has no affect on hair growth in postmenopausal women with female pattern hair loss (Ludwig type). We describe 4 cases of hair loss with characteristics of both male and female patterns in women with hyperandrogenism in which finasteride has improved or stabilized the alopecia. Improved hair growth was seen after 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 2.5 years, respectively. The finding that finasteride treatment improves pattern hair loss in women with hyperandrogenism but does not affect those postmenopausal women with female pattern hair loss without hyperandrogenism supports the concept that not all types of female hair loss have the same pathophysiology.

### The safety and efficacy of a sustainable marine extract for the treatment of thinning hair: a summary of new clinical research and results from a panel discussion on the problem of thinning hair and current treatments [^1131hMFX]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Alopecia and thinning hair are highly prevalent conditions affecting a large proportion of men and women. Diffused hair loss is often more difficult to diagnose in women, mostly due to over-reliance on the assumption of hormonal influences, and it is commonly treated with a multi-therapy approach. Clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of a nutraceutical supplement to provide essential nutrients that aid in stimulating existing hair growth and reducing hair shedding. The supplement Viviscal® contains a proprietary blend of proteins, lipids, and glycosaminoglycans derived from sustainable marine sources. We present here a summary of studies that have examined the safety and efficacy of this nutraceutical; as well as discussions on hair loss and current therapies from a recently convened expert panel in dermatology and plastic surgery.

### Prevalence of female pattern hair loss in postmenopausal women: a cross-sectional study [^117HyWj8]. Menopause (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify the prevalence of female pattern hair loss (FPHL), hair characteristics, and associated factors in healthy postmenopausal women.

Methods

Two hundred postmenopausal women aged 50 to 65 years were recruited. Each participant was evaluated for FPHL according to Ludwig's classification using standardized global photography in all six views and trichoscopy for hair density and diameter. Three dermatologists re-evaluated all pictures for confirmation of FPHL. The time since menopause, levels of scalp sebum, serum testosterone, estradiol, thyroid stimulating hormone, and hemoglobin; family history of hair loss, as well as an evaluation of low self-esteem were evaluated. Women who underwent recent hair loss treatments were excluded. We used simple and multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify the factors affecting FPHL.

Results

In total, 178 postmenopausal women were evaluated for hair-loss patterns. The average age and time since menopause were 58.8 ± 4.1 and 9.2 ± 5.6 years, respectively. The prevalence of FPHL was 52.2% (95% CI, 44.6–59.8). Severity of FPHL by Ludwig grades I, II, and III was 73.2% (95% CI, 62.9–81.8), 22.6% (95% CI, 14.6–32.4), and 4.3% (95% CI, 1.2–10.7), respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that age, time since menopause, and body mass index were all significantly associated with FPHL. After adjusting for age and family history of FPHL, only body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m2 was significantly associated with FPHL (adjusted OR = 2.65, 95% CI, 1.23–5.70). Conclusion: The prevalence of FPHL was high in postmenopausal women, raising the need for hair loss awareness in menopause clinics. Early detection and proper treatment of FPHL may increase the quality of life in postmenopausal women.

Sex-Specific Patterns of Alopecia

The sex-specific patterns of androgenetic alopecia (AGA) are mainly reflected in two aspects: differences in androgen/estrogen balance and differences in the hair follicle stem cell microenvironment, which are analyzed as follows:
Sex Differences in Androgen/Estrogen Balance Male AGA is primarily driven by type II 5α-reductase (SRD5A2), an enzyme that converts testosterone into the more active dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in dermal papilla cells by binding to androgen receptors (AR), leading to hair follicle miniaturization and shortened anagen phase. The expression level of SRD5A2 in the frontal and vertex hair follicles of males is 3–5 times higher than that in the occipital region, which explains the selectivity of alopecia areas. Additionally, DHT further suppresses hair follicle regeneration through the PGD2-CXXC5 axis, forming a vicious cycle. The activity of SRD5A2 in female hair follicles is only 40% of that in males, and the AR content in frontal hair follicles is 40% lower than in males. Meanwhile, the content of aromatase (which converts testosterone into estrogen) in female hair follicles is six times higher than in males, and estrogen protects hair follicles by prolonging the anagen phase. After menopause, the decline in estrogen levels leads to relative androgen dominance, causing female AGA to typically manifest as diffuse vertex thinning rather than the typical male pattern of frontal hairline recession.
Differences in Hair Follicle Stem Cell Microenvironment The retention rate of hair follicle stem cell markers (such as LGR5 and KRT15) in female AGA patients is significantly higher than in males, which may explain the slower progression of hair loss in females. Animal models have shown that androgens can induce apoptosis of male hair follicle stem cells, while female stem cells exhibit stronger resistance to androgens, possibly related to estrogen-mediated protective mechanisms. Early-stage male AGA is characterized by hair diameter deterioration, followed by a reduction in hair unit numbers; in females, hair unit numbers decrease first, with diameter thinning occurring later. This difference may be associated with sex-specific regulation of stem cell responses to androgens.
Controversies and Unresolved Questions The diagnostic criteria for female AGA remain unstandardized. Some patients have normal androgen levels ("idiopathic AGA"), suggesting that non-androgenic pathways (such as insulin resistance, iron deficiency, and inflammation) may be involved in pathogenesis. Thickened scalp subcutaneous fat in metabolic syndrome patients may activate 5α-reductase through mechanical pressure, exacerbating alopecia. 5α-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride are highly effective for male AGA but have limited efficacy in females, possibly due to the multifactorial pathological mechanisms of female hair loss. Emerging therapies such as PRP injection and microneedling still require more sex-stratified studies for validation.

### Clinical efficacy of oral administration of finasteride at a dose of 2.5 mg / day in women with female pattern hair loss [^117Akbxc]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Female pattern hair loss (FPHL) presents with diffuse thinning over the mid-frontal scalp, for which various treatment modalities have been tried. Although currently, oral 5 α-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride are being used, their clinical efficacy remains controversial. We retrospectively investigated 544 premenopausal or postmenopausal patients with FPHL who were prescribed finasteride at a dose of 2.5 mg/day. Our study excluded patients with a follow-up period of < 3 months and patients who were prescribed other FPHL treatment modalities including topical minoxidil. Finally, 112 patients were evaluated based on their medical records and clinical photographs. Based on assessment using the Ludwig scale at the time of their initial visit, among 112 patients studied, 59 patients were classified as belonging to grade I, 47 were grade II, and 6 were grade III. Using global photographs, we found that 33 (29.5%) of the 112 patients studied showed slight improvement, 73 (65.2%) showed significant improvement, whereas no change was recorded in 6 (5.4%). We could demonstrate efficacy of administration of finasteride at a dose of 2.5 mg/day for patients with FPHL and also found that finasteride has a better effect on hair growth when patients had a lower Ludwig score and an older age at onset.

### Interventions for female pattern hair loss [^116T8eEo]. JAMA Dermatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question

Which interventions are effective and safe for treating female pattern hair loss (FPHL)?

Bottom Line

There was low- to moderate-quality evidence that topical minoxidil (2% and 5%) was associated with improvements in FPHL. There was low-quality evidence that finasteride was no more effective than placebo. There were inconsistent results from studies that laser devices were effective, but total hair count increased compared with baseline (moderate- to low-quality evidence). Most treatments were not associated with higher adverse event rates than placebo.

### A six-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of a nutraceutical supplement for promoting hair growth in women with self-perceived thinning hair [^114rqMk8]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Hair loss is a complex problem that generates significant concern for those who are affected. Patients seeking medical treatments have limited options, and are increasingly turning to natural therapies. A novel nutraceutical product containing a proprietary Synergen Complex® composed of standardized, active botanicals with potent anti-inflammatory, adaptogenic (anti-stress), antioxidant, and dihydrotestosterone-inhibiting properties has been developed to improve hair growth and hair quality. The objective of this 6-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to assess the ability of this oral supplement (Nutrafol® Women's Capsules) to strengthen and promote the growth of hair in adult women with self-perceived thinning. Enrolled subjects were randomized to receive active treatment (n = 26) or placebo (n = 14). The primary endpoint in this study was a statistically significant increase in the number of terminal and vellus hairs based on phototrichograms obtained through macrophotography analysis. Daily intake of the nutraceutical supplement resulted in a significant increase in the number of terminal and vellus hairs in the target area at day 90 and day 180 vs placebo (P less than 0.009). Blinded Investigator Global Hair Assessments revealed significant improvements in hair growth (P equals 0.016) and overall hair quality (P equals 0.005). A significant percentage of subjects receiving active treatment also reported improvement in hair growth, volume, thickness, and hair growth rate, as well as decreased anxiety and other wellness parameters. There were no reported adverse events.

Conclusion

This nutraceutical supplement safely and effectively promoted hair growth in women with self-perceived thinning. It provides a multi-targeted therapeutic approach to hair loss by addressing micro-inflammation, stress, and oxidative damage with clinically tested, standardized, and bio-optimized phytoactive ingredients.

### Estrogen receptor β-selective phytoestrogenic formulation prevents physical and neurological changes in a preclinical model of human menopause [^113YGrUM]. Menopause (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

As an alternative to estrogen therapy, the efficacy of an estrogen receptor β-selective phytoestrogenic (phyto-β-SERM) formulation to regulate climacteric symptoms and decline in brain responses associated with ovarian hormone loss in menopause was assessed.

Methods

A phyto-β-SERM formulation-containing diet was compared with a commercial soy extract diet and a phytoestrogen-free base/control diet in an ovariectomized (OVX) mouse model of human menopause. Two treatment studies were conducted: (1) a 2-month study assessed the effects of experimental diets on tail skin temperature as a model of menopausal hot flashes, and (2) a 9-month study assessed the long-term impact of the diets on overall health, hair thinning/loss, spatial working memory, and associated protein expression in the hippocampus.

Results

The phyto-β-SERM diet prevented OVX-induced menopause-like changes including the rise in skin temperature, hair thinning/loss, deficit in spatial memory function, and reversed OVX-induced decline in the expression of hippocampal proteins involved in neural plasticity and β-amyloid degradation/clearance. The soy extract diet had no effect or exacerbated OVX-induced changes.

Conclusions

Overall, the phyto-β-SERM diet induced physical and neurological responses comparable with ovary-intact mice, suggesting the therapeutic potential of the phyto-β-SERM formulation for the prevention/alleviation of climacteric symptoms and decline in brain responses induced by ovarian hormone loss, which provides the basis for further work in postmenopausal women.

### Skin aging and menopause: implications for treatment [^115NScnf]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

The skin is one of the largest organs of the body, which is significantly affected by the aging process and menopause. The significant changes sustained by the skin during the menopause are due to the effect sustained on the skin's individual components. The estrogen receptor has been detected on the cellular components of the skin. Accordingly, dermal cellular metabolism is influenced by the hypoestrogenoemic state of menopause leading to changes in the collagen content, alterations in the concentration of glycoaminoglycans and most importantly the water content. Consequently changes in these basic components leads to an alteration in function compatible with skin aging. Changes in the skin collagen leads to diminished elasticity and skin strength. Collagen content may be measured by various methods such as direct skin biopsy, skin blister assessment for collagen markers and skin thickness measurement. All these variables indicate a reduction in collagen content following menopause. This may be reversed with the administration of estrogen given both topically and systemically. A reduction in hydrophilic glycoaminglycans leads to a direct reduction in water content, which influences the skin turgor. These effects on glycoaminoglycans, due to the hypoestrogenia, have been clearly shown in animal studies and appeared to be rapidly reversed with the application of estrogens. The sum total of these basic effects on the skin leads to wrinkles, the skin condition typifying skin aging. Structures resident in the skin are likewise influenced by menopause. Changes to the cutaneous vascular reactivity are noted following menopause. Capillary blood flow velocity decreases significantly in postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal flushing is due to profound vasodilatation in the dermal papillae. Hair growth is also influenced by the hormonal milieu and consequently hair loss has been associated with the beginning of menopause. Treatments administered for menopause, in particular hormone replacement therapy, appear to alter its effects on the basic components of the skin as well as the more complex structures residing in the skin, consequently retarding the skin aging process.

Menopause

NICE states that diagnosis of menopause can be made without laboratory investigations in women aged > 45 years who have not menstruated for at least 12 months, excluding women using hormonal contraception or who do not have a uterus. Perimenopause, which can precede menopause by several years, is defined as irregularity of ovulation cycles and menstruation, associated with vasomotor symptoms such as night sweats and hot flushes.

The mean age of menopause is 51.5 years and occurs secondary to depletion of ovarian follicles. Initially, follicle‐stimulating hormone (FSH) levels begin to rise, followed by an increase in the concentration of luteinizing hormone (LH). Progesterone and oestrogen levels then fall, with the latter being associated with irregular menstruation, vasomotor symptoms, vaginal dryness and breast atrophy.

Premature menopause is diagnosed in women aged < 40 years with menopausal symptoms and laboratory tests demonstrating elevated FSH on two occasions 4–6 weeks apart. Most frequently, premature menopause is secondary to ovarian failure, the cause of which is often unknown but can be autoimmune or genetic. Oophorectomy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy can also be associated with premature menopause.

Oestrogen is synthesized from the ovaries and peripheral tissue, including the skin (Fig. 1). In premenopausal women, ovarian synthesis predominates, contrasting with the predominant synthesis from adipose tissue in postmenopausal women. The enzyme aromatase is key in oestrogen synthesis, and is present in many organs, including the skin. Oestrogen acts via two receptors, ER‐α and ER‐β; the latter is seen predominately within the skin, mucosa and hair follicles.

Figure 1
Oestrogen synthesis pathway.

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) refers to the oral, transdermal or vaginal administration of oestrogen, progesterone and/or testosterone to alleviate symptoms and improve bone density. Although generally well tolerated, an increased risk of venous thromboembolism and breast cancer has been associated with HRT.

### Topical fulvestrant solution has no effect on male and postmenopausal female androgenetic alopecia: results from two randomized, proof-of-concept studies [^111eCapJ]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Androgenetic alopecia (pattern baldness) affects approximately half of all white-skinned men and women over the age of 40 years. Based on preclinical studies in mice in which topical fulvestrant (ICI182,780, an anti-oestrogen) caused telogen hair follicles to enter anagen, thereby causing hair growth, a topical formulation of fulvestrant was developed for the potential treatment of androgenetic alopecia.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of fulvestrant solution in stimulating hair growth in men and postmenopausal women with androgenetic alopecia in two randomized, phase II, minoxidil- and/or vehicle-controlled studies.

Methods

One hundred and two white-skinned men aged 18–50 years with Norwood/Hamilton grades III, IIIv, IV, V or Va androgenetic alopecia received topical fulvestrant 70 mg mL(-1) solution, vehicle or minoxidil 2% solution twice daily for 16 weeks. Seventy postmenopausal women with Ludwig grade 1 or 2 androgenetic alopecia received topical fulvestrant 70 mg mL(-1) solution or vehicle twice daily for 16 weeks. The endpoints in both studies were hair density, cumulative hair thickness and hair growth rate, measured by TrichoScan analysis of digital images.

Results

There were no statistically significant differences favouring fulvestrant over vehicle at study end (day 113) for any of the efficacy parameters in men or women. Statistically significant differences in favour of minoxidil over fulvestrant were seen from day 57 onwards for hair density, cumulative hair thickness and hair growth rate in men.

Conclusions

These results indicate a lack of effect of topical fulvestrant in the treatment of subjects with androgenetic alopecia. The reasons for this lack of effect remain unclear.

### Hair loss: diagnosis and treatment [^115vwv6A]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on androgenetic alopecia:

- **Definition**: Androgenetic alopecia, also known as male or female pattern baldness, is a common form of hair loss in both genders.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of androgenetic alopecia involves both genetic and hormonal factors. The condition is known to depend on the presence of the androgen dihydrotestosterone and a genetic predisposition, with the androgen receptor gene playing a significant role.
- **Epidemiology**: Androgenetic alopecia is estimated to affect about 0.2–2% of the population worldwide.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for androgenetic alopecia include a genetic predisposition, specifically a susceptibility locus at chromosome 20p11.22, advancing age, and hormonal influences.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, it is characterized by a progressive loss of hair, with a specific pattern of baldness. In men, it often presents as hairline recession at the temples and balding at the top of the head. In women, it typically manifests as a general thinning of hair across the entire scalp, with preservation of the frontal hairline.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of androgenetic alopecia is chronic and progressive. While treatments can slow the progression and improve hair density, there is currently no known cure. The hair loss typically continues over time.

Randomization to cyproterone acetate (50 mg) with ethinyl estradiol (EE) in a reverse sequential regimen; flutamide (250 mg) or finasteride (5 mg) daily; all for 1 year. Twelve similar patients were observed without treatment for 1 year.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Ludwig scores for hair thinning as well as patient and investigator assessments of treatment effectiveness.

Result(S)

Flutamide resulted in a reduction of 21% in Ludwig scores (2.3 ± 0.2 to 1.8 ± 0.1). The other treatment effects were not statistically significant. Patient and investigator assessments showed a similar trend.

Conclusion(S)

Flutamide at a dose of 250 mg daily induced a modest improvement in alopecia after 1 year, whereas cyproterone acetate and finasteride were not effective. Treatment for more than 1 year may be required for better results.

4. Female Pattern Hair Loss

FPHL is the androgen-dependent thinning of hair that occurs with advancing age but can begin as early as in the teens. FPHL is also referred to as androgenetic alopecia; however, androgenetic alopecia is alopecia that is androgen-independent. FPHL is the result of the transformation of terminal hair follicles to small, fine and unpigmented vellus hair follicles in addition to a reduction of PSUs on the scalp. FPHL develops in a pattern that is distinct from age-related thinning; in women it is demonstrated by a diffuse thinning of hair growth in the frontal and sagittal scalp.

FPHL occurs due to a shortened anagen phase of scalp hair growth: androgens shorten this phase and an increased dihydrotestosterone action on scalp hair follicles can reduce the growth and production of hair. Hair loss in certain regions of the scalp with advancing age can also be attributed to an altered androgen/estrogen ratio.

Approximately 10% of premenopausal women have FPHL. The incidence increases with age and 25–32% of women aged 65 years or older experience FPHL. Women with FPHL experience a diminished body image satisfaction and lowered self-esteem.

### Interventions for female pattern hair loss [^115smERx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Female pattern hair loss (FPHL), or androgenic alopecia, is the most common type of hair loss affecting women. It is characterised by progressive shortening of the duration of the growth phase of the hair with successive hair cycles, and progressive follicular miniaturisation with conversion of terminal to vellus hair follicles (terminal hairs are thicker and longer, while vellus hairs are soft, fine, and short). The frontal hair line may or may not be preserved. Hair loss can have a serious psychological impact on women.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of the available options for the treatment of female pattern hair loss in women.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to July 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library (2015, Issue 6), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), PsycINFO (from 1872), AMED (from 1985), LILACS (from 1982), PubMed (from 1947), and Web of Science (from 1945). We also searched five trial registries and checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials that assessed the efficacy of interventions for FPHL in women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality, extracted data and carried out analyses.

Main Results

We included 47 trials, with 5290 participants, of which 25 trials were new to this update. Only five trials were at 'low risk of bias', 26 were at 'unclear risk', and 16 were at 'high risk of bias'. The included trials evaluated a wide range of interventions, and 17 studies evaluated minoxidil. Pooled data from six studies indicated that a greater proportion of participants (157/593) treated with minoxidil (2% and one study with 1%) reported a moderate to marked increase in their hair regrowth when compared with placebo (77/555) (risk ratio (RR) = 1.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.51 to 2.47; moderate quality evidence). These results were confirmed by the investigator-rated assessments in seven studies with 1181 participants (RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.68 to 3.28; moderate quality evidence). Only one study reported on quality of life (QoL) (260 participants), albeit inadequately (low quality evidence). There was an important increase of 13.18 in total hair count per cm² in the minoxidil group compared to the placebo group (95% CI 10.92 to 15.44; low quality evidence) in eight studies (1242 participants). There were 40/407 adverse events in the twice daily minoxidil 2% group versus 28/320 in the placebo group (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.87; low quality evidence). There was also no statistically significant difference in adverse events between any of the individual concentrations against placebo. Four studies (1006 participants) evaluated minoxidil 2% versus 5%. In one study, 25/57 participants in the minoxidil 2% group experienced moderate to greatly increased hair regrowth versus 22/56 in the 5% group (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.73). In another study, 209 participants experienced no difference based on a visual analogue scale (P = 0.062; low quality evidence). The assessments of the investigators based on three studies (586 participants) were in agreement with these findings (moderate quality evidence). One study assessed QoL (209 participants) and reported limited data (low quality evidence). Four trials (1006 participants) did not show a difference in number of adverse events between the two concentrations (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.20; low quality evidence). Both concentrations did not show a difference in increase in total hair count at end of study in three trials with 631 participants (mean difference (MD) -2.12, 95% CI -5.47 to 1.23; low quality evidence). Three studies investigated finasteride 1 mg compared to placebo. In the finasteride group 30/67 participants experienced improvement compared to 33/70 in the placebo group (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.37; low quality evidence). This was consistent with the investigators' assessments (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.90; low quality evidence). QoL was not assessed. Only one study addressed adverse events (137 participants) (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.34; low quality evidence). In two studies (219 participants) there was no clinically meaningful difference in change of hair count, whilst one study (12 participants) favoured finasteride (low quality evidence). Two studies (141 participants) evaluated low-level laser comb therapy compared to a sham device. According to the participants, the low-level laser comb was not more effective than the sham device (RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.49; and RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.89; moderate quality evidence). However, there was a difference in favour of low-level laser comb for change from baseline in hair count (MD 17.40, 95% CI 9.74 to 25.06; and MD 17.60, 95% CI 11.97 to 23.23; low quality evidence). These studies did not assess QoL and did not report adverse events per treatment arm and only in a generic way (low quality evidence). Low-level laser therapy against sham comparisons in two separate studies also showed an increase in total hair count but with limited further data. Single studies addressed the other comparisons and provided limited evidence of either the efficacy or safety of these interventions, or were unlikely to be examined in future trials.

Authors' Conclusions

Although there was a predominance of included studies at unclear to high risk of bias, there was evidence to support the efficacy and safety of topical minoxidil in the treatment of FPHL (mainly moderate to low quality evidence). Furthermore, there was no difference in effect between the minoxidil 2% and 5% with the quality of evidence rated moderate to low for most outcomes. Finasteride was no more effective than placebo (low quality evidence). There were inconsistent results in the studies that evaluated laser devices (moderate to low quality evidence), but there was an improvement in total hair count measured from baseline. Further randomised controlled trials of other widely-used treatments, such as spironolactone, finasteride (different dosages), dutasteride, cyproterone acetate, and laser-based therapy are needed.

### Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114tKYEm]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the "Evaluation and Treatment of Hirsutism in Premenopausal Women: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline", published by the Endocrine Society in 2008.

Participants

The participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed task force of seven medical experts and a methodologist.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The task force commissioned two systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.

Consensus Process

Group meetings, conference calls, and e-mail communications facilitated consensus development. Endocrine Society committees, members, and cosponsoring organizations reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of the guidelines.

Conclusion

We suggest testing for elevated androgen levels in all women with an abnormal hirsutism score. We suggest against testing for elevated androgen levels in eumenorrheic women with unwanted local hair growth (i.e., in the absence of an abnormal hirsutism score). For most women with patient-important hirsutism despite cosmetic measures (shaving, plucking, waxing), we suggest starting with pharmacological therapy and adding direct hair removal methods (electrolysis, photoepilation) for those who desire additional cosmetic benefit. For women with mild hirsutism and no evidence of an endocrine disorder, we suggest either pharmacological therapy or direct hair removal methods. For pharmacological therapy, we suggest oral combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives for the majority of women, adding an antiandrogen after 6 months if the response is suboptimal. We recommend against antiandrogen monotherapy unless adequate contraception is used. We suggest against using insulin-lowering drugs. For most women who choose hair removal therapy, we suggest laser/photoepilation.

Home-use photoepilation devices — diode lasers and intense pulsed light (IPL) — have limited evidence and variable efficacy: they "have not been studied in RCTs", reported hair count reductions "range from 6% to 72% at 3 to 6 months after multiple treatments", devices are slower than medical systems, and "there are no reports of injury from home-use photoepilation".

### Evidence-based treatments for female pattern hair loss: a summary of a cochrane systematic review [^116atSaz]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Female pattern hair loss (FPHL) or androgenic alopecia is the most common type of hair loss affecting women with reduced hair density and can have a serious psychological impact. It is characterized by progressive replacement of slow cycling terminal hair follicles by miniaturized, rapidly cycling vellus hair follicles. The frontal hair line may or may not be preserved. The aim of this review was to assess the evidence for the effectiveness and safety of the treatments available for FPHL. Searches included: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, PsycINFO, LILACS and several ongoing trials registries (October 2011). Randomized controlled trials in women with FPHL were identified. Twenty-two trials, comprising 2349 participants, were included. A range of interventions was evaluated, with 10 studies examining varying concentrations of minoxidil. Pooled data from four studies indicated that a greater proportion of participants treated with minoxidil reported a moderate increase in their hair regrowth compared with placebo (relative risk 1·86, 95% confidence interval 1·42–2·43). There was no difference between the number of adverse events experienced in the twice daily minoxidil and the placebo intervention groups, except for a reported increase with minoxidil 5% twice daily. Single studies accounted for most of the other comparisons, which were assessed as either having high risk of bias and/or they did not address the prespecified outcomes for this review and provided limited evidence of either the effectiveness or safety of these interventions. Further well-designed, adequately powered randomized controlled trials investigating other treatment options are still required.

### Common hair loss disorders [^114WTEiJ]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Hair loss (alopecia) affects men and women of all ages and often significantly affects social and psychologic well-being. Although alopecia has several causes, a careful history, dose attention to the appearance of the hair loss, and a few simple studies can quickly narrow the potential diagnoses. Androgenetic alopecia, one of the most common forms of hair loss, usually has a specific pattern of temporal-frontal loss in men and central thinning in women. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved topical minoxidil to treat men and women, with the addition of finasteride for men. Telogen effluvium is characterized by the loss of "handfuls" of hair, often following emotional or physical stressors. Alopecia areata, trichotillomania, traction alopecia, and tinea capitis have unique features on examination that aid in diagnosis. Treatment for these disorders and telogen effluvium focuses on resolution of the underlying cause.

### Elagolix and estradiol and norethisterone (Oriahnn) [^117QStFw]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.8 Change in Menstrual Bleeding Pattern and Reduced Ability to Recognize Pregnancy

ORIAHNN may delay the ability to recognize the occurrence of a pregnancy because it may reduce the intensity, duration, and amount of menstrual bleeding [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Perform pregnancy testing if pregnancy is suspected, and discontinue ORIAHNN if pregnancy is confirmed [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

The effect of hormonal contraceptives on the efficacy of ORIAHNN is unknown. Advise women to use non-hormonal contraception during treatment and for 28 days after discontinuing ORIAHNN [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

5.9 Effects on Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolism

ORIAHNN may decrease glucose tolerance and result in increased glucose levels. More frequent monitoring in ORIAHNN-treated women with prediabetes and diabetes may be needed.

In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Use of elagolix is associated with increases in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and serum triglycerides. Monitor lipid levels and consider discontinuing ORIAHNN if hypercholesterolemia or hypertriglyceridemia worsens [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.10 Alopecia

In Phase 3 clinical trials (Studies UF-1 and UF-2), more women experienced alopecia, hair loss, and hair thinning with ORIAHNN (3.5%) compared to placebo (1.0%). In almost one-third (4/14) of affected ORIAHNN-treated women, alopecia was a reason for discontinuing treatment. No specific pattern was described. In the majority of affected women, hair loss was continuing when ORIAHNN was stopped. Whether the hair loss is reversible is unknown. Consider discontinuing ORIAHNN if hair loss becomes a concern [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Phase III, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study of letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, for advanced breast cancer versus megestrol acetate [^111GPX9o]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare two doses of letrozole (0.5 mg and 2.5 mg every day) and megestrol acetate (40 mg qid) as endocrine therapy in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer previously treated with antiestrogens.

Patients and Methods

This double-blind, randomized, multicenter, multinational study enrolled 602 patients, all of whom were included in the primary analysis in the protocol. Patients had advanced or metastatic breast cancer with evidence of disease progression while receiving continuous adjuvant antiestrogen therapy, had experienced relapse within 12 months of stopping adjuvant antiestrogen therapy given for at least 6 months, or had experienced disease progression while receiving antiestrogen therapy for advanced disease. Tumors were required to be estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive or of unknown status. Confirmed objective response rate was the primary efficacy variable. Karnofsky Performance Status and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality-of-life assessments were collected for 1 year.

Results

There were no statistically significant differences among the three treatment groups for overall objective tumor response. Patients treated with letrozole 0.5 mg had improvements in disease progression (P = 0.044) and a decreased risk of treatment failure (P = 0.018), compared with patients treated with megestrol acetate. Letrozole 0.5 mg showed a trend (P = 0.053) for survival benefit when compared with megestrol acetate. Megestrol acetate was more likely to produce weight gain, dyspnea, and vaginal bleeding, and the letrozole groups were more likely to experience headache, hair thinning, and diarrhea.

Conclusion

Given a favorable tolerability profile, once-daily dosing, and evidence of clinically relevant benefit, letrozole is equivalent to megestrol acetate and should be considered for use as an alternative treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women after treatment failure with antiestrogens.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of the available options for the treatment of female pattern hair loss in women.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to October 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), PsycINFO (from 1806), AMED (from 1985), LILACS (from 1982), PubMed (from 1947), Web of Science (from 1945), and reference lists of articles. We also searched several online trials registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of interventions for female pattern hair loss in women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Twenty two trials, comprising 2349 participants, were included. A wide range of interventions were evaluated, with 10 studies investigating the different concentrations of minoxidil. Pooled data from 4 studies indicated that a greater proportion of participants (121/488) treated with minoxidil reported a moderate increase in their hair regrowth when compared with placebo (64/476) (risk ratio (RR) = 1.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42 to 2.43). In 7 studies, there was an important increase of 13.28 in total hair count per cm(2) in the minoxidil group compared to the placebo group (95% CI 10.89 to 15.68). There was no difference in the number of adverse events in the twice daily minoxidil and placebo intervention groups, with the exception of a reported increase of adverse events (additional hair growth on areas other than the scalp) with minoxidil (5%) twice daily. Most of the other comparisons consisted of single studies. These were assessed as high risk of bias: They did not address our prespecified outcomes and provided limited evidence of either the efficacy or safety of these interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

Although more than half of the included studies were assessed as being at high risk of bias, and the rest at unclear, there was evidence to support the effectiveness and safety of topical minoxidil in the treatment of female pattern hair loss. Further direct comparison studies of minoxidil 5% applied once a day, which could improve adherence when compared to minoxidil 2% twice daily, are still required. Consideration should also be given to conducting additional well-designed, adequately-powered randomised controlled trials investigating several of the other treatment options.

### Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115Jgd32]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Treatment — Changes since the previous guideline state: we now suggest either pharmacologic therapy or direct hair removal methods as initial therapy for women with mild hirsutism and no evidence of an endocrine disorder, and for other women with patient-important hirsutism we suggest starting with pharmacological therapy and adding direct hair removal methods if needed; we added a recommendation that it is reasonable to start with combined pharmacological therapy (oral contraceptives and antiandrogens) in select women with severe hirsutism causing distress; we added a recommendation to use lower estrogen-dose oral contraceptives with low-risk progestins in women at higher risk for venous thromboembolism (e.g., obese, age > 39 years), while for other women we do not suggest one oral contraceptive formulation over another; we made a stronger recommendation against the use of flutamide for hirsutism; we added a suggestion for electrolysis rather than photoepilation in women with blond or white hair and provided guidance for photoepilation in women of color; and we added a lifestyle recommendation for women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

### Safety and efficacy of ALRV5XR in women with androgenetic alopecia or telogen effluvium: a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^114X1BLh]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The healthy adult scalp has an area of approximately 700 cm 2 with a total hair count ranging from 100,000–150,000 hairs Ninety per cent of scalp hairs are large, pigmented, and are known as terminal hairs (TH). They have a shaft diameter of 30–150 µm. The remaining ten per cent are called vellus hairs (VH), and are barely visible, depigmented hairs. Individual hairs are produced by HFs, which are epithelial skin mini-organs that modulate and sustain cyclic hair regrowth over repeated hair cycles. The human scalp has the greatest density of HFs on the body, ranging from 118 to 350 HFs per cm 2. Hair density in women is highest from age 20–30 years and decreases thereafter at an increasing rate.

AGA and TE in women have different clinical features and prognoses. AGA is diagnosed by a high diversity in hair shaft diameter, while TE is diagnosed by an excess of telogen follicles. Although most women with AGA have diffuse thinning of the crown, the frontal hairline remains intact, and they rarely become bald. AGA is linked to the metabolic syndrome and is an independent predictor of mortality from diabetes mellitus and heart disease. TE is a medical sign related to underlying conditions rather than a discrete disorder, and can resolve spontaneously in healthy women. Triggering events for TE include acute physical stressors such as surgery, illness, or weight loss, hormonal imbalances, psychological stress, post-partum state, drugs, nutritional deficiencies and scalp inflammation. Interestingly, cases of TE onset have been reported 3 weeks to 3 months after diagnosis of COVID-19. In some individuals, TE has been associated with senescent thinning, autoimmune disease, or nutritional deficiencies, all conditions which may confuse its proper distinction from subjects affected by AGA.

### The diagnosis and treatment of iron deficiency and its potential relationship to hair loss [^111yqKHB]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the world's most common nutritional deficiency and is associated with developmental delay, impaired behavior, diminished intellectual performance, and decreased resistance to infection. In premenopausal women, the most common causes of iron deficiency anemia are menstrual blood loss and pregnancy. In men and postmenopausal women, the most common causes of iron deficiency anemia are gastrointestinal blood loss and malabsorption. Hemoglobin concentration can be used to screen for iron deficiency, whereas serum ferritin concentration can be used to confirm iron deficiency. However, the serum ferritin concentration may be elevated in patients with infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic conditions. Other tests may be needed, such as erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin concentration, transferrin concentration, serum iron concentration, and transferrin saturation. The cause of iron deficiency must be identified. If the patient is male, postmenopausal female, or has risk factors for blood loss, then the patient should be evaluated for sources of blood loss, especially gastrointestinal (eg, colon cancer). Several studies have examined the relationship between iron deficiency and hair loss. Almost all have addressed women exclusively and have focused on noncicatricial hair loss. Some suggest that iron deficiency may be related to alopecia areata, androgenetic alopecia, telogen effluvium, and diffuse hair loss, while others do not. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening for iron deficiency in patients with hair loss. In addition, there is insufficient evidence to recommend giving iron supplementation therapy to patients with hair loss and iron deficiency in the absence of iron deficiency anemia. The decision to do either should be based on clinical judgment. It is our practice at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation to screen male and female patients with both cicatricial and noncicatricial hair loss for iron deficiency. Although this practice is not evidence based per se, we believe that treatment for hair loss is enhanced when iron deficiency, with or without anemia, is treated. Iron deficiency anemia should be treated. Treating iron deficiency without anemia is controversial. Treatment of nutritional iron deficiency anemia includes adequate dietary intake and oral iron supplementation. Excessive iron supplementation can cause iron overload and should be avoided, especially in high-risk patients such as those with hereditary hemochromatosis. Patients who do not respond to iron replacement therapy should undergo additional testing to identify other underlying causes of iron deficiency anemia.

### Safety and efficacy of ALRV5XR in women with androgenetic alopecia or telogen effluvium: a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^113NxRBN]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Alopecia or hair loss (HL) of the scalp is a common clinical finding associated with ageing and cellular senescence. It is emotionally distressing for both sexes, but women are psychologically more affected than men as suggested by parameters of self-esteem, body image and quality of life. The most common forms of female hair loss are androgenetic alopecia (AGA), also called female-pattern hair loss (FPHL), and telogen effluvium (TE). AGA is thought to have many commonalities with senescence of the hair follicle (HF) and 758 expressed genes were found common to both AGA and senescent alopecia. AGA is a heritable, age-dependent process that results in a progressive decline in scalp hair density in a sex-dependent pattern. While onset of hair thinning in women begins between the ages of 12 and 40, it becomes noticeable in about half of the population by the fifth decade. Alopecia has been related to hormonal disturbances, chronic medical conditions, use of certain drugs, topical scalp treatments, and chemo and radiotherapy. It has also been linked to sudden weight loss, low protein intake, stress and pollution. Miscellaneous hair disorders and alopecia have also been associated with deficiencies in minerals such as copper, iron, selenium, and zinc as well as of vitamins such as niacin and vitamin D.

### Androgenetic alopecia [^117RMZgL]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2025). High credibility.

Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is a condition of scalp hair growth characterized by progressive miniaturization of hair follicles and a reduction in the number of active follicles. In general, frontal, mid-scalp and crown hair follicles in postpubescent men and in postmenopausal women are susceptible to AGA. In rare cases, premenopausal women and prepubescent individuals are affected. In men, AGA is hypothesized to be caused by increased androgen signalling within susceptible hair follicles, altering the levels of locally produced signalling factors that sustain hair growth, whereas the molecular basis of AGA in women remains undetermined. AGA displays variability in its time of onset, severity and distribution patterns, and genome-wide association studies have uncovered more than 380 genomic loci associated with AGA, including genes involved in androgen and WNT pathways. Furthermore, epidemiological studies support substantial ancestral variation in AGA. Effective therapies for AGA include autologous transplantation of androgen-resistant occipital hair follicles, oral finasteride and topical minoxidil. Not all individuals with AGA respond to these therapies or comply with daily use of medicines, creating a need for new approaches. Emerging therapies for AGA include hair follicle-activating peptides, mRNA-containing liposomes, as well as bioengineering of new hair follicles. AGA has a negative socioemotional effect on affected individuals, and its prompt diagnosis and treatment can improve self-reported quality of life.

### Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111KDRM9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Patient-important hirsutism — severity scores, limitations, and definition: Although experts have often made treatment recommendations based on Ferriman–Gallwey scores, mild (score 8 to 15) or severe (score > 15), this approach has several limitations including that many clinicians are unfamiliar with calculating Ferriman–Gallwey scores, most women use cosmetic measures before seeking consultation making it impossible to accurately determine a Ferriman–Gallwey score, and treatment decisions need to be proportionate to how much excessive hair affects patient well-being. We use the term patient-important hirsutism to refer to unwanted sexual hair growth of any degree that causes sufficient distress for women to seek medical treatment, and most women also use cosmetic measures (shaving, plucking, waxing) before their first medical consultation and continue to use them during pharmacotherapy.

Efficacy of photoepilation — durability and aggregated outcomes are summarized. All FDA-approved photoepilation devices have met the FDA hair removal criteria after a single treatment in at least one prospective study, and complete or nearly complete alopecia lasts 4 to 6 weeks before partial regrowth. A meta-analysis of 24 prospective trials reported hair reduction ≥ 6 months after the last treatment averaging 57.5%, 54.0%, 52.8%, and 42.3% for diode, alexandrite, ruby, and Nd:YAG lasers, with no statistically significant differences. An earlier review of 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 444 people reported a similar 50% reduction in hair growth for up to 6 months with alexandrite and diode lasers. Efficacy increases with the number of treatments but rarely achieves 100% hair removal, and a retrospective series of > 2000 alexandrite-treated patients reported ~80% average hair reduction at 6 months after the final treatment.

Diagnosis in perimenopause and menopause

1.3 Although there are currently no diagnostic criteria for PCOS in perimenopausal and menopausal women, we suggest that a presumptive diagnosis of PCOS can be based upon a well-documented long-term history of oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenism during the reproductive years. The presence of PCO morphology on ultrasound would provide additional supportive evidence, although this is less likely in a menopausal woman (2|⊕⊕○○).

1.3 Evidence

The natural history of PCOS through perimenopause into menopause is poorly studied, but many aspects of the syndrome appear to improve. Ovarian size, follicle count, and anti-Mullerian hormone levels (a marker of antral follicle count) decrease with normal aging in women with and without PCOS. However, the decline in ovarian volume and follicle count may be less in women with PCOS than in normal women. Similarly, androgen levels decline with age in women with and without PCOS (serum T declines ∼50% between the ages of 20 and 40 y), with reports of improved menstrual frequency in PCOS, although there is little evidence to support a decline in serum T associated with the menopause transition per se.

The diagnosis of PCOS in postmenopausal women is more problematic than in adolescents. There are no age-related T cutoffs for the diagnosis. Furthermore, T assays used to diagnose hyperandrogenemia in women are imprecise, even for assays utilizing tandem mass spectrometry technology. Nevertheless, supporting studies have shown that peri- and postmenopausal mothers of women with PCOS with a history of irregular menses tended to have features of PCOS as well as metabolic abnormalities, implying that aspects of the PCOS phenotype may persist with age. Very high T levels and/or virilization may suggest an androgen-producing tumor in postmenopausal women.

1.3 Values and preferences

We recognize that the diagnosis of PCOS in postmenopausal women is problematic but feel that it is unlikely that a woman can develop PCOS in the perimenopause or menopause if she has not had symptoms earlier. We recognize that there are few prospective studies to document the natural history of ovarian function with age in women with PCOS.

2.0 Associated morbidity and evaluation

Cutaneous manifestations

2.1 We recommend that a physical examination should document cutaneous manifestations of PCOS: terminal hair growth (see hirsutism guidelines, Ref.), acne, alopecia, acanthosis nigricans, and skin tags (1|⊕⊕⊕○).

Treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women — initial approach prioritizes pharmacologic therapy when cosmetic measures are insufficient while recognizing lifestyle interventions: for most women with patient-important hirsutism despite cosmetic measures, we suggest starting with pharmacological therapy, adding direct hair removal for additional benefit, and for women with mild hirsutism and no evidence of an endocrine disorder, we suggest either approach; for hirsute women with obesity, including those with polycystic ovary syndrome, we also recommend lifestyle changes.

### Treatment and resource utilization for menopausal symptoms in the United States: a retrospective review of real-world evidence from US electronic health records [^1146BcTd]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

At the initial visit, the most commonly reported symptoms of menopause for women of all races were hot flashes, followed by sleep problems, vaginal dryness, mood changes, reduced libido, dyspareunia, and weight gain/slowed metabolism (Table 3). Nominal differences were noted for specific symptoms; for example, Black women reported more vaginal dryness than did women in the other groups (53.9% vs 40.0%-45.9%) and Asian/Native American/Alaska Native women reported more thinning/dry hair (21.7% vs 9.0%-14.8%). A higher proportion (62.9%) of Black women experienced symptoms for more than 6 months compared with approximately 50% of women in the other groups. Asian/Native American/Alaska Native women less commonly had prescription medications documented (49.4%) compared with women in all other groups (ie, White, 61.2%; Black, 62.9%; and other, 54.3%) and more commonly had nonprescription therapies documented (71.1%) compared with all other groups (White, 62.6%; Black, 58.1%; and other, 62.9%). In addition, White women more commonly received HT (ie, systemic estrogen, combination estrogen/progestogen, local estrogen, and progesterone), and Black women more commonly received compounded HT (ie, estrogen/progestogen, estrogen/progestogen/testosterone, testosterone, systemic estrogen, estrogen/testosterone, progesterone, and local estrogen).

Table 3
Symptoms associated with menopause and therapies by race

Among women receiving prescription medication, 73.9% and 11.3% of White women, 60.0% and 18.1% of Black women, and 68.3% and 9.8% of Asian/Native American/Alaska Native women received HT and compounded HT, respectively (Table 3). Use of SSRIs was lowest among Asian/Native American/Alaska Native women (7.3%) compared with all other groups (14.5%-16.2%).

5.10 Uterine Fibroid Prolapse or Expulsion

Advise women with known or suspected submucosal uterine fibroids about the possibility of uterine fibroid prolapse or expulsion and instruct them to contact their physician if severe bleeding and/or cramping occurs while being treated with MYFEMBREE. In Studies L1 and L2, uterine fibroid prolapse or uterine fibroid expulsion were reported in women treated with MYFEMBREE [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.11 Alopecia

Consider discontinuing MYFEMBREE if hair loss becomes a concern [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In Phase 3 placebo-controlled clinical trials in women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, 3.5% of MYFEMBREE-treated women experienced alopecia, hair loss, and hair thinning as compared to 0.8% of placebo-treated women. In 3 of the 11 affected women treated with MYFEMBREE across Studies L1 and L2, alopecia was reported as moderate. For one MYFEMBREE-treated woman in the extension trial, alopecia was a reason for discontinuing treatment. No specific pattern of hair loss was described. The majority of affected women completed the study with reported hair loss ongoing. Whether the hair loss is reversible is unknown [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.12 Effects on Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolism

More frequent monitoring in MYFEMBREE-treated women with prediabetes and diabetes may be necessary. MYFEMBREE may decrease glucose tolerance and result in increased blood glucose concentrations.

Monitor lipid levels and consider discontinuing MYFEMBREE if hypercholesterolemia or hypertriglyceridemia worsens. In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations in triglycerides levels leading to pancreatitis. Use of MYFEMBREE is associated with increases in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.13 Effect on Other Laboratory Results

Patients with hypothyroidism and hypoadrenalism may require higher doses of thyroid hormone or cortisol replacement therapy.

The use of estrogen and progestin combinations may raise serum concentrations of binding proteins (e.g., thyroid-binding globulin, corticosteroid-binding globulin), which may reduce free thyroid or corticosteroid hormone levels.

The use of estrogen and progestin may also affect the levels of sex hormone-binding globulin, and coagulation factors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

### Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1152vRm2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to develop clinical practice guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS) of The Endocrine Society, six additional experts, two methodologists, and a medical writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Evidence

Systematic reviews of available evidence were used to formulate the key treatment and prevention recommendations. We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) group criteria to describe both the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations. We used "recommend" for strong recommendations, and "suggest" for weak recommendations.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during one group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications. The drafts prepared by the Task Force with the help of a medical writer were reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's CGS, Clinical Affairs Core Committee (CACC), and Council. The version approved by the CGS and CACC was placed on The Endocrine Society's Web site for comments by members. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes.

Conclusions

We suggest testing for elevated androgen levels in women with moderate or severe hirsutism or hirsutism of any degree when it is sudden in onset, rapidly progressive, or associated with other abnormalities such as menstrual dysfunction, obesity, or clitoromegaly. For women with patient-important hirsutism despite cosmetic measures, we suggest either pharmacological therapy or direct hair removal methods. For pharmacological therapy, we suggest oral contraceptives for the majority of women, adding an antiandrogen after 6 months if the response is suboptimal. We recommend against antiandrogen monotherapy unless adequate contraception is used. We suggest against using insulin-lowering drugs. For women who choose hair removal therapy, we suggest laser/photoepilation.

### Improvement in scalp hair growth in androgen-deficient women treated with testosterone: a questionnaire study [^112iZ5gt]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

The results of our study raise important questions about the role of testosterone in causing hair loss in women. Several investigators have reported that women with hair loss are more likely to have elevated androgen levels or show an increased frequency of other features of androgen excess than women without hair loss. For example, Futterweit and colleaguesreported that 38·5% of 109 women with hair loss had elevated androgen levels, and, in a series of 187 women, Vexiau et al. reported abnormal hormonal profiles, mostly of minor degree, in 67% of those with hair loss alone and in 84% of women who were also hirsute. In a series of 89 women presenting to a trichology clinic with hair loss, 67% showed ultrasound evidence of polycystic ovaries compared with 27% in a control group of 73 women, and 21% were significantly hirsute compared with 4% of controls. An increased frequency of insulin resistance has also been reported in women with hair loss. However, other investigators failed to find evidence of raised androgen levels in women with FPHL, and in all studies there is a variable proportion of women with hair loss who do not show clinical or biochemical signs of androgen excess. The results of clinical trials of antiandrogen therapy also provide no clear evidence for the role of androgens in FPHL. In a 1-year placebo-controlled study, finasteride 1 mg daily failed to prevent progression of hair loss in postmenopausal women with FPHL. Similarly, in a trial comparing cyproterone acetate with topical minoxidil, hair counts had fallen in the antiandrogen-treated group after 1 year, compared with an increase in hair counts in subjects using minoxidil. Subset analysis in this study did show a positive response to cyproterone acetate in women with irregular menses, suggesting an androgenic aetiology for hair loss in women with hyperandrogenism, but not in those without. Some support for this idea comes from an Italian trial which reported a small response to flutamide (but not to finasteride or cyproterone acetate) in hyperandrogenic women.

Photoepilation laser vs intense pulsed light (IPL) — comparative randomized evidence indicates both modalities are effective with similar mean hair reduction at 6 months. All prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing FDA-approved lasers and IPL found both effective for long-term reduction of pigmented terminal hair, with studies commonly assessing efficacy in Fitzpatrick prototypes I to IV and safety in V to VI. In three studies with objective hair counts before and 6 months after four to six treatments, mean hair reduction was 27% to 40% for IPL; 34% for diode laser; and 46% for alexandrite laser.

Patient Package Insert

Patient Information

Climara (Klī-mâr-uh)

(estradiol transdermal system)

Read this Patient Information before you start using Climara and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your menopausal symptoms or your treatment.

What is Climara?

Climara is a prescription medicine patch (transdermal system) that contains estradiol (an estrogen hormone).

What is Climara used for?

The Climara is used after menopause to:

Reduce moderate to severe hot flashes
Estrogens are hormones made by a woman's ovaries. The ovaries normally stop making estrogens when a woman is between 45 and 55 years old. This drop in body estrogen levels causes the "change of life" or menopause (the end of monthly menstrual periods). Sometimes, both ovaries are removed during an operation before natural menopause takes place. The sudden drop in estrogen levels causes "surgical menopause".
When estrogen levels begin dropping, some women develop very uncomfortable symptoms, such as feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden intense feelings of heat and sweating ("hot flashes" or "hot flushes"). In some women, the symptoms are mild, and they will not need to use estrogens. In other women, symptoms can be more severe.
Treat moderate to severe menopausal changes in and around the vagina
You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with Climara to control these problems. If you use Climara only to treat your menopausal changes in and around your vagina, talk with your healthcare provider about whether a topical vaginal product would be better for you.
Treat certain conditions in women before menopause if their ovaries do not produce enough estrogens naturally
Help reduce your chances of getting osteoporosis (thin weak bones)
Osteoporosis from menopause is a thinning of the bones that makes them weaker and easier to break. If you use Climara only to prevent osteoporosis due to menopause, talk with your healthcare provider about whether a different treatment or medicine without estrogens might be better for you.

5.1.3 Female Pattern Hair‐Loss (FPHL)

Scalp hair‐loss in women is relatively common, and its prevalence increases with age, affecting ~50% of women over the age of 80 years. Depending on whether it occurs before or after the menopause, it may be considered as either early‐ or late‐onset. The term FPHL is now more widely adopted than 'androgenic alopecia' in recognition of the fact that factors other than androgens may contribute to its pathophysiology. Nevertheless, androgen excess remains an important cause of FPHL, and may cause distinct patterns of alopecia, including hair‐loss with frontal accentuation or central expansion of hair‐loss with frontal hairline preservation.

5.1.4 Menstrual History

Although PCOS is the most common cause of androgen excess, other primary causes of hyperandrogenism can also result in menstrual irregularity via PCOS‐independent mechanisms, either because of the underlying disease process (e.g. hypogonadotropic hypogonadism secondary to Cushing's disease) or due to disruption of the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐gonadal (HPG) axis by elevated androgens of any cause. The menstrual cycle history should include age of menarche, frequency of menstrual cycles (oligomenorrhoea, typically defined as average menstrual cycle length > 35 days or fewer than eight cycles per year) and, where relevant, age of menopause and last menstrual bleed.

### The REJOICE trial: a phase 3 randomized, controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of a novel vaginal estradiol soft-gel capsule for symptomatic vulvar and vaginal atrophy [^11539iZP]. Menopause (2017). Low credibility.

Postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) is the thinning, drying, and loss of elasticity of the vaginal epithelium associated with the reduction in serum estrogen after menopause. Up to approximately 70% of postmenopausal women show clinical evidence of VVA, and roughly half report symptoms associated with VVA, including vaginal dryness, irritation, itching, dysuria, and pain or bleeding with sexual activity. These clinical signs and symptoms of VVA are a component of the more encompassing term of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM).VVA is progressive without treatment, and can negatively affect quality of life. A recent survey of 3,046 postmenopausal women with symptoms of VVA reported that only 7% of the women currently used prescription-only therapy to treat their VVA, and in the United States, 32 million postmenopausal women are thought to have symptomatic VVA. Thus, it is believed that the majority of postmenopausal women with symptomatic VVA are not being treated.

Hirsutism — temporary hair removal and bleaching outlines cosmetic options and adverse effects: "Depilation is the removal of the hair shaft from the skin surface, for example by shaving. Depilation in humans has no known biological effect on the hair follicle, producing no change in hair growth, hair diameter, or hair color". "Shaving yields a sharply cut hair tip, which upon regrowth feels coarse and gives the illusion of thicker hair compared with a naturally tapered hair tip". "Plucking, waxing, or mechanical devices that extract hairs are relatively safe and inexpensive, but cause some discomfort. Scarring, folliculitis, and (particularly in women of color) hyperpigmentation may occur". "Chemical depilatory agents dissolve the hair. Most are thioglycolates, which disrupt disulfide bonds in the hair", with "Side effects includ[ing] emission of a sulfurous odor and irritant dermatitis (especially on the face), which may be followed by hyperpigmentation". Although not removal, "bleaching with products containing hydrogen peroxide and sulfates is a method for masking the appearance of pigmented hair", and "Side effects include irritation, pruritus, and possible skin discoloration".

The FDA "define permanent hair reduction as attaining at least a 30% reduction of terminal hairs and sustaining this reduction for a period longer than the complete growth cycle of hair follicles (4 to 12 months, depending on body site)". "Photoepilation is a method capable of rapidly treating large areas; it requires the presence of pigmented, terminal hair". In contrast, "Electrolysis is generally limited to small treatment areas, and it does not depend on hair pigmentation".

### Female androgenetic alopecia: an update on diagnosis and management [^1131Fiok]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Female androgenetic alopecia (FAGA) is a common cause of non-scarring alopecia in women. The onset may be at any age following puberty and the frequency increases with age. Clinically, it shows a diffuse hair thinning over the central scalp, while the frontal hairline is usually retained. FAGA can have a significant psychological impact, leading to anxiety and depression. For this reason, early diagnosis is very important to stop the progression of the disease. The sex hormonal milieu is the main pathogenetic mechanism studied in FAGA. The role of androgens is not clearly defined and only one-third of women with FAGA show abnormal androgen levels. Endocrinological diseases with hyperandrogenism associated with FAGA comprise polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), hyperprolactinemia, adrenal hyperplasia and, rarely, ovarian and adrenal tumours. Usually the diagnosis of FAGA is made clinically. A complete clinical examination and a blood examination can reveal other signs of hyperandrogenism. Trichoscopy shows the typical hair miniaturization. A scalp biopsy can be useful when the clinical evaluation does not provide a definitive diagnosis or when cicatricial alopecias with hair loss in the distribution of FAGA or alopecia areata are suspected. FAGA is a slowly progressive disease. The goal of therapy is to stop the progression and to induce a cosmetically acceptable hair regrowth. The most important drugs are topical minoxidil and oral anti-androgens. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on FAGA and to create a guideline on diagnosis and management of this frequent hair disease, not always easily recognizable from cicatricial alopecias with a similar distribution.

### Improvement in scalp hair growth in androgen-deficient women treated with testosterone: a questionnaire study [^113VYLTw]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Androgens are thought to have an adverse effect on female scalp hair growth. However, our clinical experience of androgen replacement therapy in women with androgen deficiency, in which hair loss was seldom reported, led us to question this concept.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of subcutaneous testosterone therapy on scalp hair growth in female patients.

Methods

A total of 285 women, treated for a minimum of 1 year with subcutaneous testosterone implants for symptoms of androgen deficiency, were asked to complete a survey that included questions on scalp and facial hair. Age, body mass index (BMI) and serum testosterone levels were examined.

Results

Out of the 285 patients, 76 (27%) reported hair thinning prior to treatment; 48 of these patients (63%) reported hair regrowth on testosterone therapy (responders). Nonresponders (i.e. no reported hair regrowth on therapy) had significantly higher BMIs than responders (P = 0·05). Baseline serum testosterone levels were significantly lower in women reporting hair loss prior to therapy than in those who did not (P = 0·0001). There was no significant difference in serum testosterone levels, measured 4 weeks after testosterone implantation, between responders and nonresponders. No patient in this cohort reported scalp hair loss on testosterone therapy. A total of 262 women (92%) reported some increase in facial hair growth.

Conclusions

Subcutaneous testosterone therapy was found to have a beneficial effect on scalp hair growth in female patients treated for symptoms of androgen deficiency. We propose this is due to an anabolic effect of testosterone on hair growth. The fact that no subject complained of hair loss as a result of treatment casts doubt on the presumed role of testosterone in driving female scalp hair loss. These results need to be confirmed by formal measurements of hair growth.

### Pattern hair loss in men: diagnosis and medical treatment [^111Tv1nD]. Dermatologic Clinics (2013). Low credibility.

Androgenetic alopecia is a common cause of hair loss in both men and women. The exact pathogenesis of androgenetic alopecia is not well understood. As the name implies, the role of androgens and genetic susceptibility predisposes to pattern hair loss due to gradual conversion of terminal hair into vellus hair. Male and female pattern hair loss are clinically distinct entities but histologically indistinguishable. The role of sex hormones in females is less understood. This article discusses current understanding of the etiopathogenesis of hair loss in men, diagnostic tests available, and its medical management.

### Antiandrogen therapy for the treatment of female pattern hair loss: a clinical review of current and emerging therapies [^113jh7kq]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Androgenetic alopecia is the most common hair loss type in women, but topical minoxidil is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment option. The pathophysiology involves shortened anagen phases, lengthened telogen phases, and hair follicle miniaturization. Androgens, particularly dihydrotestosterone, play a crucial role in male androgenetic alopecia pathogenesis, but their exact role in female pattern hair loss is unclear. Oral antiandrogens demonstrate some efficacy in women, albeit with considerations for side effects and contraindications. Topical antiandrogens may be used in combination with topical minoxidil or as alternatives to oral medications, likely with fewer systemic adverse effects. Patient-specific factors, including age, signs of hyperandrogenism, or need for contraception may help determine which antiandrogen therapy is most appropriate. This review focuses on current antiandrogen treatments for female pattern hair loss available in the United States and their limitations, as well as emerging treatments that are investigational, studied in other hair loss types, or available in other countries.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^1151dCLj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

(7) Recommendations regarding possible androgenic side effects of testosterone therapy Systemic testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women, in doses that approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women, is associated with mild increases in acne and body/facial hair growth in some women, but not with alopecia, clitoromegaly, or voice change (Level I, Grade A).

(8) Recommendations regarding testosterone therapy and cardiovascular health Oral testosterone therapy is associated with adverse lipid profiles with negative effects on high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels, and is not recommended (Level I, Grade A). Studies of nonoral testosterone therapies (percutaneous and injectable), in doses that approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women, have shown no statistically significant adverse effects on lipid profiles over the short term (Level I, Grade A). Testosterone therapy has not been associated with increases in blood pressure, blood glucose, or HbA1c levels (Level I, Grade A). A nonsignificant trend for an increased risk of deep venous thrombosis has been seen with testosterone therapy; however, the role of concurrent estrogen therapy in possible venous thrombosis risk cannot be excluded (Level I, Grade A). Limited data preclude assessment of the effects of testosterone therapy on myocardial infarction or death (Insufficient data). RCTs of testosterone therapy have excluded women at high cardiometabolic disease risk; most have included women taking concurrent estrogen therapy, and all have been of relatively short duration. Therefore, recommendations regarding the effect of physiologic doses of testosterone in postmenopausal women on cardiovascular health are not generalizable to a more "at-risk" population or to long-term therapy.

Values and preferences — hair removal modality selection uses conditional suggestions: Our suggestion to use photoepilation over electrolysis for most women with unwanted pigmented hair is based on higher efficacy and convenience, less pain, and overall lower cost for the number of treatments necessary in most women. Our suggestion to use electrolysis over photoepilation for women with white or blonde unwanted hair is based on IPL's (intense pulsed light) lack of efficacy for this group. Our suggestion to use long-wavelength, long pulse-duration lasers with skin cooling over other lasers or IPLs for photoepilation in women of color is based on relative avoidance of skin burns and pigmentation changes. Our suggestion to consider electrolysis (or shaving, waxing, topical therapy) over photoepilation for women of Mediterranean or Middle Eastern background with facial hirsutism is based on higher risk of developing laser-induced PH.

### Finasteride treatment of hair loss in women [^115XtR5N]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review available evidence on the safety and efficacy of finasteride in the treatment of alopecia in women.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted through PubMed (1948-March 2010) and MEDLINE (1950-March 2010) using the search terms finasteride and alopecia. References cited in relevant publications were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All data sources identified were reviewed for inclusion. Reports of finasteride treatment of female alopecia were included in the review. This included prospective and retrospective trials, case series, and case reports. Studies in men were not included.

Data Synthesis

Few pharmacologic options exist for women with alopecia who do not achieve satisfactory responses to topical minoxidil solution. Treatment successes with finasteride in women with female pattern hair loss, although an off-label indication, have been primarily described in uncontrolled studies and anecdotal reports. In 2 controlled clinical studies, finasteride showed no benefit over placebo or no treatment in female pattern hair loss. A finasteride regimen of 1 mg orally daily, as indicated in male pattern hair loss, may be recommended for those who fail or cannot tolerate minoxidil therapy. A 12-month trial is needed to assess stabilization of hair loss, and hair regrowth may take 2 years or longer. Although data are sparse, menopausal status, circulating androgen concentrations, and concomitant symptoms of hyperandrogenism do not appear to predict response to finasteride. Overall, finasteride is well tolerated; however, women of childbearing potential must adhere to reliable contraception while receiving finasteride, and treatment is contraindicated in pregnancy, due to known teratogenicity.

Conclusions

Although objective evidence of efficacy is limited, finasteride may be considered for treatment of female pattern hair loss in patients who fail topical minoxidil treatment.

Pathogenesis of hirsutism — androgen dependence and hair growth cycle: The growth of sexual hair is entirely dependent on the presence of androgen, and androgens appear to induce vellus follicles in sex-specific areas to develop into terminal hairs, which are larger and more heavily pigmented. Hairs grow in nonsynchronous cycles, and the growth (anagen) phase is ~4 months for facial hair, and due to the long hair growth cycle it takes ~6 months to detect the effects of hormonal therapy.

Advise patients that use of estrogen and progestin combinations may increase the risk of venous and arterial thrombotic/thromboembolic events, especially in women at high risk for these events [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Bone Loss

Advise patients about the risk of bone loss. Advise patients that supplementary calcium and vitamin D may be beneficial if dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D is not adequate. Advise women that oral iron supplementation should not be taken at the same time as calcium and vitamin D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Suicidal Ideation and Mood Disorders (Including Depression)

Advise patients that depression, mood disorders, and suicidal ideation may occur with MYFEMBREE use. Instruct women with new onset or worsening depression, anxiety, or other mood changes to promptly seek medical attention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Hepatic Impairment and Transaminase Elevations

Advise women to promptly seek medical attention in case of signs or symptoms that may reflect liver injury, such as jaundice [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Change in Menstrual Bleeding Pattern and Reduced Ability to Recognize Pregnancy

Advise patients that MYFEMBREE may delay the recognition of pregnancy because it may reduce the duration and amount of menstrual bleeding. Advise patients to use effective non-hormonal contraception while taking MYFEMBREE and to discontinue MYFEMBREE if pregnancy is diagnosed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Advise pregnant patients that there is a pregnancy registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to MYFEMBREE during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

Alopecia

Advise women with uterine fibroids that alopecia, hair loss, and hair thinning in no specific pattern may occur with MYFEMBREE. Advise these women that hair loss and hair thinning may not resolve completely after stopping MYFEMBREE. Advise these women to contact their healthcare provider if they have concerns about changes to their hair [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Efficacy of topical combination of 0.25% finasteride and 3% minoxidil versus 3% minoxidil solution in female pattern hair loss: a randomized, double-blind, controlled study [^1168HyAi]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The relationship between female pattern hair loss (FPHL) and androgenic hormones is not well established, but some evidence indicates oral finasteride may be efficacious in FPHL. Use of a topical formulation has been proposed to minimize unwanted effects.

Objectives

Our objective was to compare the efficacy and safety of topical 0.25% finasteride combined with 3% minoxidil solution and 3% minoxidil solution as monotherapy in the treatment of FPHL.

Methods

This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind study in 30 postmenopausal women with FPHL. Each participant was randomized to receive either topical 0.25% finasteride combined with topical 3% minoxidil or topical 3% minoxidil solution as monotherapy for 24 weeks. To determine efficacy, the hair density and diameter was measured and global photographic assessment was conducted at baseline and 8, 16, and 24 weeks. Side effects and serum dihydrotestosterone levels were also evaluated.

Results

By 24 weeks, hair density and diameter had increased in both groups, and finasteride/minoxidil was significantly superior to minoxidil solution in terms of hair diameter (p = 0.039). No systemic side effects were reported. However, serum dihydrotestosterone levels in the finasteride/minoxidil group significantly decreased from baseline (p = 0.016).

Conclusion

A topical combination of 0.25% finasteride and 3% minoxidil may be a promising option in the treatment of FPHL with an additional benefit of increasing hair diameter. Nevertheless, as it may be absorbed percutaneously, it should be reserved for postmenopausal women.

### Evaluation and treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116bwRks]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Treatment of hirsutism in premenopausal women — initial and adjunctive therapy: For most women with patient-important hirsutism despite cosmetic measures, we suggest starting with pharmacological therapy; for women who then desire additional cosmetic benefit, we suggest adding direct hair removal methods. However, for women with mild hirsutism and no evidence of an endocrine disorder, we suggest either approach. For hirsute women with obesity, including those with PCOS, we also recommend lifestyle changes. Direct hair removal methods include electrolysis and photoepilation.

### Noninvasive hair rejuvenation [^1112neeh]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Both nonsurgical and surgical modalities for the treatment of hair loss are being used by providers at an increasing rate worldwide. Men and woman are affected by hair loss, but the pathophysiology of the hair loss is thought to be different between sexes; therefore, gender must play a role in treatment decisions. Currently, there are 3 Food and Drug Administration-approved nonsurgical androgenetic alopecia treatments: minoxidil, finasteride, and low-light laser therapy. Platelet-rich plasma injections are showing promise as a single modality and as an adjunct to other nonsurgical and surgical treatments of androgenetic alopecia.

Postmenopausal polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) general health — general health and best treatment are poorly understood; increased rates of obesity and diabetes in menopause are suggested and may reduce quality of life; most reports tend to show normal or increased bone mineral density with changes during menopause not described; women with PCOS have multiple cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and may be at increased risk for premature CVD events, although some CVD-related features may plateau with age (e.g. LDL cholesterol levels or glucose tolerance); mood and sleep disorder data in postmenopausal PCOS are lacking; hirsutism is common and alopecia increases with aging, but their natural history in postmenopausal PCOS is unknown; a well-designed trial of 5α-reductase inhibition for androgenic alopecia in postmenopausal women showed no benefit, suggesting other contributing factors in women.

### Postmenopausal hyperandrogenism: evaluation and treatment strategies [^112VjNiA]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Evidence of clinical and/or biochemical androgen excess poses a unique differential in postmenopausal women. Some signs and symptoms of postmenopausal hyperandrogenism can be normal and attributed to the natural aging process. However, the causes of androgen excess in this group include both nontumorous and tumorous causes. Treatment of androgen excess may improve both quality of life and long-term metabolic outcomes.

### Artificial intelligence-based personalization of treatment regimen for hair loss: a 6-month clinical trial [^113SHUMd]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Hair loss affects up to 50% of women and 80% of men. The high costs and wait times for professional consultations lead many to seek one-size-fits-all solutions that are frequently ineffective. This study tested an artificial intelligence (AI) model for customizing non-medicated hair loss treatments. In a 24-week trial, 38 women with self-reported hair thinning received personalized product kits based on AI analysis of scalp images and questionnaires. Treatments included various combinations of topical serums, shampoos, oral supplements, and marine collagen peptides. Of the 27 participants who completed the study, significant improvements were observed in hair growth, coverage, and thickness (P < 0.001 for all). Hair shedding decreased by 37.3% at 12 weeks and 32.4% at 24 weeks. Scalp transepidermal water loss was reduced by 61.5% at 12 weeks and 69% at 24 weeks. Scanning electron microscopy showed improved hair texture. Participants reported overall hair improvement (88.9%), better scalp health (85.2%), and less hair brittleness (92.6%) (P < 0.001 for all). No adverse events were reported. The AI-driven platform effectively delivered personalized hair loss treatments, suggesting a data-driven, customized, and accessible self-served alternative for hair loss management.

Eflornithine with lasers or intense pulsed light (IPL) — adverse effects and randomized controlled trial (RCT) findings are as follows: Systemic absorption is extremely low, and with clinical use side effects include itching and dry skin, although skin irritation has been reported only with experimental overuse. Eflornithine can be used alone or with lasers/IPL, and two RCTs of upper-lip laser plus eflornithine cream versus placebo cream reported a more significant reduction in hair with the addition of eflornithine, particularly early; in one trial the difference was significant until week 22 but not by week 34, and in the second trial a greater percentage of subjects in the eflornithine group had a complete response at the end, although both trials had methodological limitations.

### An exosome regenerative complex plus microneedling promotes hair growth in subjects with self-perceived thinning hair [^1117ynq2]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Thinning hair affects the quality of life of affected men and women but has limited treatment options. A novel technology refines exosomes from stem cells to create a concentrated complex that is quickly absorbed into the scalp to deliver growth factors, peptides, coenzymes, minerals, amino acids, and vitamins (Exosome Regenerative Complex+&reg;. BENEV, Inc.; Mission Viejo, CA). This study assessed the efficacy and safety of the Exosome Regenerative Complex applied following microneedling on the scalp of subjects with self-perceived thinning hair. Enrolled subjects were male (n = 15) and female (n = 15) with a mean (SD) age of 50.2 (10.9) years (range, 26–65 years). Subjects were treated on days 0, 30, 60, and 90, with a final assessment on day 120. Trichoscopy assessments showed this treatment significantly increased terminal and vellus hair counts (P < 0.0001) and decreased hair shedding on day 120 (P < 0.01), increased mean follicular units per cm&sup2; (P < 0.0001), and decreased inter-follicular distance (P < 0.0001). On day 120, the investigator rating for improved hair quality was 97% and improved hair growth was 83%. Subject satisfaction with treatment results was high with no reported adverse events. The combined use of an Exosome Regenerative Complex combined with RF microneedling appears to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment for hair loss in men and women.

### Hair loss: common causes and treatment | AAFP… [^116rT5Jn]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

5 Women typically present with diffuse hair thinning of the vertex with sparing of the frontal hairline. Some women experience thinning over the lateral scalp. Common conditions that mimic androgenetic alopecia include thyroid disease, iron deficiency anemia, and malnutrition. Treatment is based on patient preference. Topical minoxidil is approved for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia in men. Hair regrowth is more robust at the vertex than in the frontal area, and will take six to 12 months to improve. Figure 4 4). Nail pitting is also associated with alopecia areata. Treatment for adults with less than 50% of scalp involvement is intralesional triamcinolone acetonide injected intradermally using a 0. 5-inch, 30-gauge needle. Maximal volume is 3 mL per session. 11 Treatment may be repeated every four to six weeks until resolution or for a maximum of six months. Local adverse effects include transient atrophy and telangiectasia.

Other therapies for the treatment of alopecia areata include topical mid- to high-potency corticosteroids, minoxidil, anthralin, immunotherapy, and systemic corticosteroids. 12 Currently available therapies often yield unsatisfactory results, and some clinicians rely on the high rate of spontaneous remission or recommend a hairpiece or wig if remission does not occur.
13. Tinea capitis requires systemic treatment; topical antifungal agents do not penetrate hair follicles. If the causative agent is a. Trichophyton species, treatment options include oral terbinafine, itraconazole, fluconazole, and griseofulvin. 15 These agents have similar efficacy rates and potential adverse effects, but griseofulvin requires a longer treatment course. 18 The optimal treatment for this condition is not known, and psychiatric referral may be indicated.

Treatment options include cognitive behavior therapy 19 and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, although strong evidence of a treatment effect has not been demonstrated. Preliminary evidence suggests positive treatment effects with acetylcysteine, olanzapine, and clomipramine. 19 A combination of cognitive behavior therapy and medications may be more effective than either approach alone. 19.

### Finasteride treatment of female pattern hair loss… [^116m3vu8]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Female pattern hair loss, the most common form of hair loss, affects up to 50% of women during their life. 1 Although hair thinning in women with FPHL may be diffuse, 3 different clinical patterns have been described: the Christmas tree pattern, 2 the Ludwig pattern, 3 and the Hamilton pattern. 4 Patients who experience hair thinning complain of social anxiety and embarrassment. If left untreated, FPHL may be rapidly progressive. A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study16 of finasteride, 1 mg/d, in postmenopausal women with FPHL showed negative results in increasing hair growth and slowing the progression of hair thinning. After 12 months of treatment, patients in the finasteride and placebo groups had a modest decrease in hair count from baseline. Recently, noncontrolled studies12, 17–19 indicated that finasteride therapy can be effective in premenopausal and postmenopausal women with and without signs of hyperandrogenism.

Camacho12 reported hair regrowth using finasteride, 2. 5 mg/d, in 41 women with FPHL and SAHA syndrome. Thai and Sinclair17 administered finasteride at a dosage of 5 mg/wk to a 67-year-old postmenopausal woman without signs of hyperandrogenism and with Ludwig FPHL. After 12 months of treatment the patient showed a significant increase in hair density. Shum et al18 administered finasteride to 4 women with hyperandrogenism at a dosage of 1. 25 mg/d. The efficacy of finasteride in postmenopausal normoandrogenic women with FPHL was reported by Trueb19 as early as after 6 months of treatment. Finasteride was administered at 2. 5 mg/d in 4 women, 1 with the Christmas tree pattern and 3 with the Ludwig pattern, and finasteride, 5 mg/d, in 1 woman with the Hamilton pattern. In the present study, 62% of patients demonstrated some improvement of their hair loss after 1 year of treatment with finasteride, 2.

5 mg/d, taken with an oral contraceptive containing drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol.

HERS HAIR REGROWTH TREATMENT- minoxidil solution Hims Inc ----------. What is minoxidil topical solution 2%. Minoxidil topical solution 2% is a colorless liquid medication for use only on the top of the scalp to help regrow hair. Who may use minoxidil topical solution 2%. Minoxidil topical solution 2% may be appropriate for you if you are an adult who is at least 18 years old and experiencing gradually thinning hair or gradual hair loss on the top of the head. The common hereditary thinning or hair loss process begins slowly and may become noticeable only after years of gradual loss. Minoxidil topical solution 2% is for general thinning of hair on the top of the scalp as shown below. Minoxidil topical solution 2% has been shown to regrow hair in women with the degrees of hair loss shown. If women have more hair loss than shown, minoxidil topical solution 2% may not work.

In clinical studies of mostly white women aged 18–45 years with mild to moderate degrees of hair loss, the following response to minoxidil topical solution 2% was reported: FEMALE RESPONSE TO MINOXIDIL TOPICAL SOLUTION 2% Percent reporting hair regrowth. 19% of women reported moderate hair regrowth after using minoxidil topical solution 2% for 8 months. This compares with 7% of women reporting moderate hair regrowth after using the placebo, the liquid without minoxidil in it, for 8 months. 1) Remove the cap. To remove, push down and turn in direction of the arrows on the cap. 2) Part your hair in the area of hair thinning/loss. Follow the instructions below for using the dropper applicator and apply one mL 2 times a day directly onto the scalp in the hair loss area. Do not use more. Spread the liquid evenly over the hair loss area.

If you use your fingers, wash hands with soap and water immediately. Each bottle should last about one month, if used as directed. Use a mild shampoo if you wash your scalp before applying minoxidil topical solution 2%.

### Common hair loss disorders… [^114D95cA]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Minoxidil should be applied twice daily, and one year of use is recommended before assessing its efficacy. 6, 7 Women also may benefit from adjunctive treatments such as estrogen or spironolactone. In men, minoxidil may work better in areas with higher concentrations of miniaturized hairs, and its efficacy may be increased by the synergistic use of once-daily tretinoin applied at separate times during the day. 11 Continued use is required to maintain benefits. Spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist with antiandrogenic effects, works well as a treatment for hirsutism and may slow hair loss in women with AGA, but it does not stimulate hair regrowth. Estrogen may help to maintain hair status in women with AGA, but it also does not help with regrowth. 6, 7 In all forms of alopecia, hairpieces and surgical transplants can produce satisfactory results but are expensive.

In addition to diagnosing and treating any underlying disorder, treatments for alopecia areata include immunomodulating agents and biologic response modifiers. 6 Although topical and oral corticosteroids have been used, the treatment of choice in patients older than 10 years with patchy alopecia areata affecting less than 50 percent of the scalp is intralesional corticosteroid injections.
6. Topical immunotherapy is the most effective treatment option for chronic severe alopecia areata. 6 Response ranges from 40 to 60 percent for severe alopecia areata, and reaches approximately 25 percent for alopecia totalis and alopecia universalis. 6 Because of potentially severe side effects, only clinicians who have experience with these agents should prescribe them.

Treatment includes oral antifungal agents such as griseofulvin, itraconazole, terbinafine, and fluconazole, with the newer agents having fewer side effects. 20 Oral steroids may be necessary if a patient has a kerion, to decrease inflammation and potential scarring.
