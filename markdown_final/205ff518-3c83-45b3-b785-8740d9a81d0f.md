## Question

Which patients with atrial fibrillation should take Eliquis 2.5 mg twice daily instead of 5 mg twice daily?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which patients with atrial fibrillation should take apixaban (Eliquis) 2.5 mg twice daily instead of 5 mg twice daily. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled dose-reduction criteria and ensure I restate the "two-of-three" rule precisely. Then, I should verify whether severe chronic kidney disease and dialysis alter the dose, and if so, whether that is label-based or evidence-based. Next, I will review drug–drug interaction scenarios that mandate dose reduction. Finally, I should double-check common pitfalls like off-label underdosing and clarify other indications where 2.5 mg BID is appropriate but not for atrial fibrillation.

> Let me first confirm the label: for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, the standard dose is 5 mg twice daily; reduce to 2.5 mg twice daily only when at least two of the following are present — age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL — this is the core "two-of-three" rule, and it is the authoritative starting point for dose selection [^1142oqX1] [^114EGaBY].

> Wait, let me verify the nuance here, because clinicians sometimes reduce based on a single factor; the reduction is not triggered by age alone, low weight alone, or creatinine alone — one must meet two or more of the three criteria to warrant 2.5 mg twice daily, a rule derived from the pivotal AF program in which dose reduction was prespecified for those meeting at least two criteria [^1142oqX1] [^114EGaBY] [^114Xcg4W].

> Now, I need to check the severe kidney disease and dialysis question carefully; my first thought was that all dialysis patients should get 2.5 mg twice daily, but hold on, I should verify the label and the evidence so I don't overstate things — U.S. labeling applies the same "two-of-three" rule and notes limited experience when eGFR < 15 mL/min, without a blanket dialysis-specific dose, whereas pharmacokinetic studies in hemodialysis show that 5 mg twice daily can lead to supratherapeutic exposure while 2.5 mg twice daily yields exposures similar to 5 mg twice daily in patients with preserved renal function, suggesting a reduced dose may be more appropriate in ESKD even if the strict label criteria are not met [^113iMMcA] [^115vJBDb] [^112coef5].

> Let me double-check trial data in dialysis to ensure I'm not jumping to conclusions; RENAL-AF used 5 mg twice daily with label-based reduction to 2.5 mg in older or low-weight patients and was underpowered for efficacy, but pharmacokinetic sampling confirmed higher exposures at 5 mg BID in ESKD, consistent with the PK concern, and contemporary U.S. AF guidelines phrase this as using warfarin or an evidence-based dose of apixaban in ESKD or dialysis rather than prescribing a uniform 5 mg or 2.5 mg approach, so individualized selection of 2.5 mg BID is reasonable when exposure or bleeding risk is a concern, acknowledging that this extrapolates from PK and limited clinical data rather than definitive outcomes trials [^114T3AXm] [^111kWapd] [^112coef5].

> Next, I should review interaction-driven dose adjustments; with strong dual CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, or ritonavir, the apixaban dose should be decreased by 50% when the patient is on 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, and if the patient is already on 2.5 mg twice daily the combination should be avoided, with clarithromycin as a notable exception where no adjustment is needed per label pharmacokinetic data, so I need to ensure I check the concomitant medication list before finalizing the dose [^117LnKUC] [^1138Kjw6].

> Hold on, I should clarify another potential source of confusion: 2.5 mg twice daily is also an approved dose for different indications — postoperative VTE prophylaxis after hip or knee arthroplasty and for extended-phase VTE prevention after at least 6 months of initial anticoagulation — but those uses are distinct from atrial fibrillation stroke prevention, so I need to avoid conflating AF dose reduction rules with these other labeled indications [^1142oqX1] [^116eGNgV].

> I will now examine real-world dosing pitfalls; underdosing apixaban off-label (using 2.5 mg BID without meeting criteria or without a compelling interaction/ESKD rationale) is common and associated with worse outcomes in observational cohorts and meta-analyses, so I need to ensure that the reduced dose is reserved for those who clearly meet labeled criteria or a justified evidence-based scenario rather than using it broadly out of bleeding concerns alone [^11781JSy] [^112PqkuP] [^11787GuU].

> Let me synthesize and self-check the final criteria: for nonvalvular AF, 2.5 mg twice daily is appropriate when a patient meets at least two of age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL; when a patient on 5 mg twice daily requires a strong dual CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitor the dose should be halved to 2.5 mg twice daily and the combination avoided if already at 2.5 mg; and in end-stage CKD or dialysis, although the FDA label does not mandate a separate dialysis dose, PK and guideline language supporting an "evidence-based dose of apixaban" justify considering 2.5 mg twice daily to avoid excessive exposure, with shared decision-making and careful bleeding and thrombotic risk assessment, rather than a blanket one-size-fits-all rule [^1142oqX1] [^117LnKUC] [^111kWapd] [^115vJBDb] [^112coef5].

For atrial fibrillation, **apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily** is indicated only when a patient meets at least two of the following: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL [^1142oqX1] [^114Xcg4W]. The **standard dose is 5 mg twice daily**. In end-stage kidney disease on dialysis, use 5 mg twice daily unless age ≥ 80 years or body weight ≤ 60 kg — then use 2.5 mg twice daily — and avoid 2.5 mg twice daily unless criteria are met, as **underdosing increases stroke risk** [^1142oqX1] [^114T3AXm] [^11787GuU].

## FDA-approved dose reduction criteria

The FDA-approved labeling for apixaban (Eliquis) specifies that the **standard dose for stroke prevention in NVAF is 5 mg twice daily**. The dose should be **reduced to 2.5 mg twice daily** if the patient meets at least two of the following three criteria [^1142oqX1]:

- **Age**: ≥ 80 years
- **Body weight**: ≤ 60 kg
- **Serum creatinine**: ≥ 1.5 mg/dL

These criteria are based on pharmacokinetic and clinical trial data showing that patients meeting at least two criteria have **increased exposure to apixaban and a higher risk of bleeding**, necessitating dose reduction to maintain an appropriate balance between efficacy and safety [^114Xcg4W].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dose reduction

The landmark ARISTOTLE randomized trial provided the primary evidence supporting the FDA-approved dose reduction criteria. Patients with NVAF who met at least two criteria received 2.5 mg twice daily, while those with one or none received the standard 5 mg twice daily dose. The reduced dose **maintained efficacy** in preventing stroke and systemic embolism while significantly **reducing the risk of major bleeding** compared to warfarin [^114Xcg4W].

---

## Special considerations: renal impairment and dialysis

Renal impairment significantly affects apixaban pharmacokinetics. In patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on dialysis, pharmacokinetic studies show that the standard 5 mg twice daily dose leads to **higher drug exposure**, increasing bleeding risk, whereas 2.5 mg twice daily can result in exposure comparable to the standard dose in patients with normal renal function and may be considered when label-based dose-reduction criteria or strong inhibitors are present [^115vJBDb]. Additionally, the RENAL-AF trial, which specifically studied apixaban in dialysis patients with AF, used the reduced dose (2.5 mg twice daily) in patients aged ≥ 80 years or weighing ≤ 60 kg; although the trial was stopped early due to enrollment challenges, it provided valuable pharmacokinetic and safety data **supporting the use of the reduced dose** when criteria are met in this population [^114T3AXm].

---

## Risks associated with inappropriate dosing

Inappropriate dosing of apixaban — particularly underdosing — is a significant clinical concern. Underdosing patients who do not meet the FDA-approved criteria for dose reduction is associated with **increased risks of stroke**, systemic embolism, and cardiovascular hospitalization, whereas overdosing increases the risk of major bleeding. Therefore, **strict adherence to the approved dosing criteria is essential** to optimize clinical outcomes.

## Summary of indications for 2.5 mg twice daily dosing

| **Clinical scenario** | **Indication for 2.5 mg twice daily** |
|-|-|
| - Age ≥ 80 years <br/> - Body weight ≤ 60 kg <br/> - Serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL | At least two criteria met [^1142oqX1] |
| End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on dialysis | Use 2.5 mg twice daily only when dose-reduction criteria are met or with strong dual CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors; otherwise standard 5 mg twice daily |
| Concomitant use of strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp (e.g. ketoconazole, ritonavir) | Dose reduction required [^117LnKUC] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where 2.5 mg twice daily is inappropriate

- **Patients meeting only one or none of the dose reduction criteria**: Standard dose (5 mg twice daily) should be used.
- **Patients with normal renal function, younger age, and normal body weight**: Standard dose recommended.
- **Patients with high thromboembolic risk without increased bleeding risk**: Standard dose preferred to ensure adequate stroke prevention.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The reduced dose of apixaban (2.5 mg twice daily) is specifically indicated for NVAF patients who **meet at least two** of the following: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL. It is also recommended with **strong dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp**, and in ESKD on dialysis only when dose-reduction criteria are met. Strict adherence to these criteria is essential to balance the risks of **stroke and bleeding** effectively.

### Clinical and pharmacological effects of apixaban dose adjustment in the ARISTOTLE trial [^114Xcg4W]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

In the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial, patients with atrial fibrillation and ≥ 2 dose-adjustment criteria (age ≥ 80 years, weight ≤ 60 kg, or creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dl [133 μmol/l]) were randomized to receive apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily or warfarin.

- **Objectives**: The purpose of this study was to describe the effects of apixaban dose adjustment on clinical and pharmacological outcomes.

- **Methods**: Patients receiving the correct dose of study drug were included (n = 18,073). The effect of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily versus warfarin on population pharmacokinetics, D-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1+2 (PF1+2), and clinical outcomes was compared with the standard dose (5 mg twice daily).

- **Results**: Patients receiving apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily exhibited lower apixaban exposure (median area under the concentration time curve at a steady state: 2,720 ng/ml vs. 3,599 ng/ml; p < 0.0001) than those receiving the standard dose. In patients with ≥ 2 dose-adjustment criteria, reductions in D-dimers (p interaction = 0.20) and PF1+2 (p interaction = 0.55) were consistent with those observed in the standard-dose population. Patients with ≥ 2 dose-adjustment criteria (n = 751) were at higher risk for stroke/systemic embolism, major bleeding, and all-cause death than the standard-dose population (0 or 1 dose-adjustment criterion, n = 17,322). The effect of apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily versus warfarin in the ≥ 2 dose-adjustment criteria population was consistent with the standard dose in the reductions in stroke or systemic embolism.

### Apixaban for patients with atrial fibrillation on hemodialysis: A multicenter randomized controlled trial [^114T3AXm]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

There are no randomized data evaluating the safety or efficacy of apixaban for stroke prevention in patients with end-stage kidney disease on hemodialysis and with atrial fibrillation (AF).

- **Methods**: The RENAL-AF trial (Renal Hemodialysis Patients Allocated Apixaban Versus Warfarin in Atrial Fibrillation) was a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-outcome evaluation (PROBE) of apixaban versus warfarin in patients receiving hemodialysis with AF and a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score ≥ 2. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to 5 mg of apixaban twice daily (2.5 mg twice daily for patients ≥ 80 years of age, weight ≤ 60 kg, or both) or dose-adjusted warfarin. The primary outcome was time to major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. Secondary outcomes included stroke, mortality, and apixaban pharmacokinetics. Pharmacokinetic sampling was conducted on day 1, day 3, and month 1.

- **Results**: From January 2017 through January 2019, 154 patients were randomly assigned to apixaban (n = 82) or warfarin (n = 72). The trial stopped prematurely because of enrollment challenges. The time in therapeutic range (international normalized ratio, 2.0–3.0) for warfarin-treated patients was 44% (interquartile range, 23%-59%). The 1-year rates for major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding were 32% and 26% in apixaban and warfarin groups, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.20 [95% CI, 0.63–2.30]), whereas 1-year rates for stroke or systemic embolism were 3.0% and 3.3% in apixaban and warfarin groups, respectively. Death was the most common major event in the apixaban group (21 patients [26%]) and the warfarin group (13 patients).

### Eliquis [^1142oqX1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The recommended dose for the reduction of risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is 5 mg taken orally twice daily. However, for patients exhibiting at least two of the following characteristics — age 80 years or older, body weight 60 kg or less, or serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL or greater — the recommended dose is 2.5 mg twice daily.

For prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis following hip or knee replacement surgery, the recommended dose is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily, with the initial dose administered 12 to 24 hours after surgery. In patients undergoing hip replacement surgery, the recommended duration of treatment is 35 days. For those undergoing knee replacement surgery, the duration is 12 days.

In the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), the recommended initial dose is 10 mg taken orally twice daily for the first 7 days of therapy. Subsequently, the dose should be adjusted to 5 mg taken orally twice daily.

To reduce the risk of recurrence of DVT and PE, the recommended dose is 2.5 mg taken orally twice daily, which should begin after at least 6 months of treatment for DVT or PE [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

- **Missed dose**: If a dose is not taken at the scheduled time, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day, and the twice-daily administration should be resumed. The dose should not be doubled to compensate for a missed dose.

### Differences in preferences between clinicians and patients for the use and dosing of direct oral anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation [^11787GuU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban, are effective in reducing the risk of stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) when prescribed at the dose studied in randomized clinical trials. In these trial protocols, reduced DOAC doses were prescribed to patients who had renal impairment for rivaroxaban, dabigatran, or edoxaban, or met two of three criteria (age, body weight, creatinine level) for apixaban. The ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial, for example, studied apixaban at 5 mg twice daily, while patients who met two of three dose reduction criteria received 2.5 mg twice daily. For patients who met labeled dose reduction criteria, the outcomes associated with apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily versus warfarin to reduce the risk of stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding, and death were consistent with the outcomes associated with the labeled dose (apixaban 5 mg twice daily).

However, a prior study of cardiology practices in the United States revealed a more than four-fold higher rate of reduced-dose apixaban use compared with use in randomized trials (20.8% versus 4.7%). Additionally, in an analysis of approximately 15,000 patients with AF initiated on a DOAC, 13% of patients received a reduced dose without meeting renal dose reduction criteria. DOAC underdosing (or unlabeled reduced dose) has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular hospitalization. Underdosing has also been linked to a higher risk of stroke and an increased risk of all-cause mortality.

### Off-label dosing of direct oral anticoagulants among inpatients with atrial fibrillation in the United States [^11781JSy]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2023). Low credibility.

Among patients hospitalized for atrial fibrillation, the frequency of off-label direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) dosing, associated factors, hospital-level variation, and temporal trends in contemporary practice are unknown.

- **Methods**: Using the Get With The Guidelines-Atrial Fibrillation registry, patients admitted from January 1, 2014, to March 31, 2020, and discharged on DOACs were stratified according to receipt of underdosing, overdosing, or recommended dosing. Factors associated with off-label dosing (defined as underdosing or overdosing) were identified using logistic regression. Median odds ratio (OR) and time-series analyses were used to assess hospital-level variation and temporal trends, respectively.

- **Results**: Of 22,470 patients (70.1 ± 12.1 years, 48.1% female, 82.5% White) prescribed a DOAC at discharge from hospitalization for atrial fibrillation (66% apixaban, 29% rivaroxaban, and 5% dabigatran), underdosing occurred among 2,006 (8.9%), overdosing among 511 (2.3%), and recommended dosing among 19,953 (88.8%). The overall rate of off-label dosing was 11.2%. Patient-related factors associated with off-label dosing included age (underdosing: OR, 1.06 per 1-year increase [95% CI, 1.06–1.07]; overdosing: OR, 1.07 per 1-year increase [95% CI, 1.06–1.09]), dialysis dependence (underdosing: OR, 5.50 [95% CI, 3.76–8.05]; overdosing: OR, 5.47 [95% CI, 2.74–10.88]), female sex (overdosing: OR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.63–0.99]), and weight (overdosing: OR, 0.96 per 1-kg increase [95% CI, 0.95–1.00]). Across hospitals, the adjusted median OR for off-label DOAC dose was 1.45.

### Apixaban pharmacokinetics at steady state in hemodialysis patients [^115vJBDb]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

It is unclear whether warfarin is protective or harmful in patients with ESRD and atrial fibrillation. This state of equipoise raises the question of whether alternative anticoagulants may have a therapeutic role. We aimed to determine apixaban pharmacokinetics at steady state in patients on hemodialysis. Seven patients received apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily for 8 days. Blood samples were collected before and after apixaban administration on days 1 and 8 (nondialysis days). Significant accumulation of the drug was observed between days 1 and 8 with the 2.5-mg dose. The area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours increased from 628 to 2054 ng h/ml (P < 0.001). Trough levels increased from 45 to 132 ng/ml (P < 0.001). On day 9, following a 2.5-mg dose, apixaban levels were monitored hourly during dialysis. Only 4% of the drug was removed. After a 5-day washout period, five patients received 5 mg apixaban twice daily for 8 days. The area under the concentration-time curve further increased to 6045 ng h/ml (P = 0.03), and trough levels increased to 218 ng/ml (P = 0.03), above the 90th percentile for the 5-mg dose in patients with preserved renal function. Apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily in patients on hemodialysis resulted in drug exposure comparable with that of the standard dose (5 mg twice daily) in patients with preserved renal function and might be a reasonable alternative to warfarin for stroke prevention in patients on dialysis. Apixaban 5 mg twice daily led to supratherapeutic levels in patients on hemodialysis and should be avoided.

### Eliquis [^117LnKUC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Apixaban is a substrate of both CYP3A4 and P-gp. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp increase exposure to apixaban and elevate the risk of bleeding. In contrast, inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp reduce exposure to apixaban and heighten the risk of stroke and other thromboembolic events.

- **Combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors**: For patients receiving Eliquis 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, the dose should be decreased by 50% when co-administered with drugs that are combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. For patients on a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily, avoid co-administration with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Clarithromycin**: Although clarithromycin acts as a combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, pharmacokinetic data suggests that no dose adjustment is necessary when administered concomitantly with Eliquis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inducers**: Avoid using Eliquis in conjunction with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John's wort) as such drugs will decrease exposure to apixaban [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Milvexian vs apixaban for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: The LIBREXIA atrial fibrillation trial rationale and design [^116c5Abg]. American Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants are the standard of care for stroke prevention in eligible patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter; however, bleeding remains a significant concern, limiting their use. Milvexian is an oral Factor XIa inhibitor that may offer similar anticoagulant efficacy with less bleeding risk.

- **Methods**: LIBREXIA AF (NCT05757869) is a global phase III, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, event-driven trial to compare milvexian with apixaban in participants with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Participants are randomly assigned to milvexian 100 mg or apixaban (5 mg or 2.5 mg per label indication) twice daily. The primary efficacy objective is to evaluate if milvexian is noninferior to apixaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism. The principal safety objective is to evaluate if milvexian is superior to apixaban in reducing the endpoint of International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) major bleeding events and the composite endpoint of ISTH major and clinically relevant nonmajor (CRNM) bleeding events. In total, 15,500 participants from approximately 1,000 sites in over 30 countries are planned to be enrolled. They will be followed until both 430 primary efficacy outcome events and 530 principal safety events are observed, which is estimated to take approximately 4 years.

- **Conclusion**: The LIBREXIA AF study will determine the efficacy and safety of the oral Factor XIa inhibitor milvexian compared with apixaban in participants with either atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.

### Apixaban dosing in hemodialysis - can drug level monitoring mitigate controversies [^11564QuU]. BMC Nephrology (2024). High credibility.

We provided results from apixaban drug level monitoring in hemodialysis patients on different dosing regimens. We investigated risk factors for increased drug levels, analyzed bleeding events, and compared our findings to existing literature on non-CKD populations.

For a 2.5 mg twice daily dosing in hemodialysis patients, our median drug levels were comparable to those in non-CKD populations taking the same reduced dose. This is consistent with findings published by the European Union summary of product characteristics, though with a larger 5th–95th percentile range: 71 [< 40–141] vs. 56 [24–103], 79 [34–162], 63 [11–90] ng/mL. However, our median (5th–95th percentiles) drug levels appeared considerably lower than those in non-CKD reference populations taking the standard dose of 5 mg twice-daily. Based on drug level data alone, our results suggest that 2.5 mg twice daily is not associated with overtly increased drug exposure compared to non-CKD patients for whom licensure studies were performed. Conversely, with 2.5 mg twice daily (14% below detection limit) and even more so with 2.5 mg once daily dosing (30% below detection limit), individual patients are probably under-dosed, supporting the case for more routine drug monitoring. It is noteworthy that some patients on a 2.5 mg once daily dosing showed comparable drug levels to others on a 2.5 mg twice-daily schedule. Additionally, a 2.5 mg once daily dosing might still confer valuable prophylactic benefits, for example, for long-term pate…

### Xarelto [^115HMBTK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Advise patients to take Xarelto only as directed and remind them not to discontinue it without first consulting their healthcare professional.

- **Adults**: Advise patients with atrial fibrillation to take Xarelto once daily with the evening meal. For initial treatment of DVT and/or PE, patients should take Xarelto 15 mg or 20 mg tablets with food at approximately the same time every day [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Patients at a continued risk of reDVT and/or PE after at least 6 months of initial treatment should take Xarelto 10 mg once daily with or without food [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. If patients cannot swallow the tablet whole, they should crush Xarelto and combine it with a small amount of applesauce followed by food [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. For those requiring an NG tube or gastric feeding tube, instruct them or their caregivers to crush the Xarelto tablet and mix it with a small amount of water before administering via the tube [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. If a dose is missed, advise the patient according to the instructions in the Full Prescribing Information based on their dosing schedule [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

- **Pediatric patients**: The adult caregiver should administer the dose using the syringes provided in the original carton. Caregivers should be advised whether the dose needs to be taken with food [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. The tablet must not be split in an attempt to provide a fraction of the prescribed dosage.

### Efficacy and safety of apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and warfarin in Asians with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^115u4aPT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

- **Standard-dose comparison**: The forest plot of hazard ratios for each standard-dose (apixaban 5 mg twice daily, dabigatran 150 mg twice daily, and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily) versus warfarin comparison reveals that standard-dose apixaban is associated with lower risks of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism (IS/SE), intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), major gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and all major bleeding compared with warfarin. All drugs show a lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to warfarin.

- **Low-dose comparison**: The forest plot of hazard ratios for each low-dose (apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily, dabigatran 110 mg twice daily, and rivaroxaban 15/10 mg once daily) versus warfarin comparison indicates that apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran are associated with reduced risks of IS/SE, ICH, all major bleeding, and all-cause mortality compared with warfarin.

- **Standard-dose vs. low-dose comparison**: The forest plot of hazard ratios for each standard-dose (apixaban 5 mg twice daily, dabigatran 150 mg twice daily, and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily) versus low-dose (apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily, dabigatran 110 mg twice daily, and rivaroxaban 15/10 mg once daily) comparison generally shows comparable outcomes between standard-doses and low-doses.

### Balancing the benefits and risks of 2 doses of dabigatran compared with warfarin in atrial fibrillation [^111LhxeQ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

This study sought to compare the net clinical benefit of dabigatran 110 mg bid and 150 mg bid with that of warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).

In patients with AF, dabigatran 110 mg bid and 150 mg bid are associated with similar rates of death. However, the higher dose reduces ischemic stroke and increases bleeding compared with the lower dose. Therefore, there is uncertainty about how to evaluate the overall benefit of the two doses.

In 18,113 AF patients from the RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long Term Anticoagulant Therapy) trial, we used a previously developed method for integrating ischemic and bleeding events as "ischemic stroke equivalents" in order to compare a weighted benefit of two doses of dabigatran with each other and with that of warfarin.

Compared with warfarin, there was a significant decrease in ischemic stroke equivalents with both dabigatran doses: -0.92 per 100 patient years (95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.74 to -0.21, p = 0.02) with dabigatran 110 mg bid and -1.08 (95% CI: -1.86 to -0.34, p = 0.01) with dabigatran 150 mg bid. There was no significant difference in ischemic stroke equivalents between the two doses: -0.16 (95% CI: -0.80 to 0.43) comparing dabigatran 150 mg bid with 110 bid. When including death in the weighted benefit calculations, the results were similar.

On a group level, both doses of dabigatran, as compared with warfarin, have similar benefits when considering a weighted estimate including both efficacy and safety. The similar overall benefits of the two doses of dabigatran suggest a comparable balance between efficacy and safety.

The review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines and in accordance with the Centre for Review and Dissemination (CRD) Handbook. The protocol was preregistered on the PROSPERO register of systematic reviews.

Published literature was captured through searches of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Econlit, PubMed, and NHS EEDs databases. The searches were conducted on 12 October 2020 and included material from 2008 (see online supplemental S1, Search strategy for the full search strategy).

Conference proceedings were date-limited to 2018–2020. The Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (Clarivate Analytics) and The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research conference databases were searched alongside a search of Embase limited to conference proceedings. The European Society of Cardiology, the American College of Cardiology, and the American Heart Association were hand-searched by a researcher (CC).

Studies were screened by two researchers independently (AW and HS) based initially on study title and abstract and subsequently on full text. Disagreements over study eligibility were resolved by a third researcher (AC).

English language studies were included if they examined outcomes of, or factors associated with, inappropriate NOAC dosing (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban) for adult patients with…

### Benefits and harms of standard versus reduced-dose direct oral anticoagulant therapy for older adults with multiple morbidities and atrial fibrillation [^1178Ved8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

No major changes in results were identified in sensitivity or stability analyses (Tables S8 and S9), though the association between standard dosing and major bleeding was increased when censoring upon switch between DOAC dose (HR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.09–1.49]). The E-value for the CI for bleeding was 1.21, signifying that an unmeasured confounder would have to increase the relative risk of bleeding by 21% independently of all measured confounders and increase the probability of being prescribed reduced DOAC dosing by 21%.

- **Effectiveness outcomes**: Overall, 6150 residents died during an average of 0.67 (SD 0.36) years of follow-up (overall event rate 41.8 per 100 PY). After weighting, standard dose therapy was not associated with all-cause mortality (HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.92–1.06]; weighted rates for standard versus reduced dosing 45.1 versus 45.6 deaths per 100 PY). For the composite effectiveness outcome (acute myocardial infarction, systemic embolism, stroke, transient ischemic attack, venous thromboembolism), there were 820 thrombotic events over a mean follow-up of 0.67 (SD 0.34) years (overall event rate 5.7 per 100 PY). After weighting, there was no significant association between DOAC dose and thrombotic events (HR, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.96–1.41]; weighted rates for standard versus reduced dosing: 6.4 versus 5.5 events per 100 PY). Subgroup results for mortality outcomes were similar to the primary analysis. In contrast, for thrombotic risk, HRs were much closer to the null value when estimating the association of standard versus reduced dose for those < 80.

### Eliquis [^114DeRbj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Overdosage**: Overdose of Eliquis increases the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

In controlled clinical trials, orally administered apixaban in healthy subjects at doses up to 50 mg daily for 3 to 7 days (25 mg twice daily for 7 days or 50 mg once daily for 3 days) had no clinically relevant adverse effects. In healthy subjects, the administration of activated charcoal 2 and 6 hours after ingestion of a 20-mg dose of apixaban reduced mean apixaban AUC by 50% and 27%, respectively. Thus, the administration of activated charcoal may be useful in the management of Eliquis overdose or accidental ingestion. An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of apixaban is available.

### Onfi [^1151W75Y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dosing information**: A daily dose of ONFI greater than 5 mg should be administered in divided doses twice daily; a 5 mg daily dose can be administered as a single dose. Dose patients according to body weight. Individualize dosing within each body weight group based on clinical efficacy and tolerability. Each dose in Table 1 (e.g. 5 to 20 mg in ≤ 30 kg weight group) has been shown to be effective, although effectiveness increases with increasing dose [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Do not proceed with dose escalation more rapidly than weekly because serum concentrations of clobazam and its active metabolite require 5 and 9 days, respectively, to reach steady-state.

- **Discontinuation or dosage reduction of ONFI**: To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, increased seizure frequency, and status epilepticus, use a gradual taper to discontinue ONFI or reduce the dosage. Taper by decreasing the total daily dose by 5–10 mg/day on a weekly basis until discontinued. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently, decrease the dosage more slowly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

### SPL drug information for apixaban [^1138Kjw6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of apixaban PO (also known as Eliquis):

- **AIS**: Use extreme caution in patients with AF transitioning from apixaban to warfarin.
- **Bleeding**: Use caution in patients taking other drugs affecting hemostasis, including antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or thrombolytic agents, SSRIs, SNRIs, and NSAIDs.
- **Increased serum apixaban levels**: Use caution in patients taking P-glycoprotein or potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, or ritonavir). Reduce the dose of apixaban from 5–10 mg BID by 50%. Do not use P-glycoprotein or potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients receiving 2.5 mg BID of apixaban.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: Second update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116eGNgV]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of deep vein thrombosis, specifically in relation to the choice of anticoagulation for extended therapy, the ACCP 2021 guidelines recommend considering administering a reduced dose (apixaban 2.5 mg BID or rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily) rather than a full dose of apixaban or rivaroxaban for patients requiring extended-phase anticoagulation.

### Twice- or once-daily dosing of direct oral anticoagulants, a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112N9Zam]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Low credibility.

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) have similar half-lives, but the dosing regimen varies between once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID). For some prescribers, the QD regimen improves compliance; others prefer BID regimens to promote better stability of plasma concentrations, particularly in the event of missed doses. Limited evidence provides guidance about the best treatment strategy. The purpose of this study was to compare the treatment effect of QD vs. BID administration of DOACs in major orthopedic surgery (MOS), non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), venous thromboembolism (VTE), and acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

We conducted a systematic review up to April 2020. Phase II clinical trials comparing DOAC QD vs. BID with the same daily dose were included. We extracted data for the occurrence of major thrombosis (proximal deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke) and major hemorrhage (using the ISTH criteria and recommendations of the European Medicines Agency for surgical patients). Relative risks (RR) were combined using a fixed and random effects weighted meta-analysis.

Twelve randomized, controlled, phase II trials were included (10,716 patients), representing 24 dosing regimen comparisons of apixaban, darexaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, letaxaban, and dabigatran. There was no difference for major thrombotic events (RR BID/QD = 1.06, 95% CI 0.86–1.30) nor for major bleeding (RR BID/QD = 1.02, 95% CI 0.84–1.23) between the BID versus QD regimens, without heterogeneity (I² = 0%).

### Apixaban dosing in hemodialysis - can drug level monitoring mitigate controversies [^116HEfnW]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Our investigation provides evidence that drug levels from hemodialysis patients taking 2.5 mg apixaban twice daily are approximately comparable to those from non-CKD populations taking the same reduced dose but are lower compared to non-CKD populations taking the standard dose of 5 mg twice daily. Individual under-dosing needs to be considered, with 2.5 mg twice daily and even more so with 2.5 mg once daily dosing. There is considerable inter- and intra-individual variability. Higher drug levels and concomitant antiplatelet therapy might result in higher risks of bleeding.

Target ranges for apixaban drug levels do not exist, and the correlation between drug levels and bleeding is poor. However, in light of contradictory recommendations and challenging risk-benefit analyses regarding anticoagulation in patients on hemodialysis, drug level monitoring can be a contributory tool. This applies particularly to the detection of drug levels at the edges of the spectrum (e.g. below detection limit or beyond the 95th percentile of non-CKD reference populations). Here, our study provides valuable practical guidance to improve safety and appropriate dosing in hemodialysis patients on apixaban.

### Apixaban dosing in hemodialysis - can drug level monitoring mitigate controversies [^116ezdQy]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Drug level over time**: We did not observe signs of accumulation in 25 cases that provided at least two measurements (Fig. 2). In these patients, the first drug level measurement occurred at a median (IQR) of 14 (8–30) days after the initiation of apixaban, with data available for 15 cases. The total follow-up time ranged from a median (IQR) of 12 (2–16) months, with an overall range of 1–51 months (data available for all cases).

	**Figure 2**: Apixaban level for each participant over time. Legend: Serial drug level monitoring from 25 hemodialysis patients, with each providing between 2 and 17 drug levels. The first drug level measurement took place at a median (IQR) of 14 (8–30) days after initiation of apixaban, based on available data for 15 cases, with a total follow-up time of 12 (2–16) months intake (data available for all cases).

- **Drug levels in comparison**: Figure 3 and Table 4 present scatter plots comparing our drug levels to the 10th to 90th and 5th to 95th percentiles of drug levels from non-CKD patients taking 5 mg of apixaban twice daily.

	**Figure 3**: Comparison of measured apixaban levels in our study with those from non-CKD patients taking therapeutic doses of 5 mg twice daily. Legend: Cases 1–17 were on 2.5 mg once daily, while cases 18–31 were on 2.5 mg apixaban twice daily. Apixaban levels were measured pre-dialysis at the beginning of the week. Out of 143 samples, 85 were trough levels, and 58 were random levels, which were not significantly different from each other. The lower detection limit of our assay was 40 ng/mL. Comparative confidence intervals are indicated (boxes on the right side as well as reference lines).

### Dose specific effectiveness and safety of DOACs in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation: A Canadian retrospective cohort study [^114NVWym]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Low credibility.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been proven to be effective and safe for the prevention of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). However, suboptimal adherence, variable dosing, and use in patient populations that would otherwise have been excluded from clinical trials may impact the efficacy and safety profile of DOACs in a routine care setting. We compared stroke, bleeding, and mortality rates on and off therapy for standard and low-dose DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran) versus warfarin in a Canadian cohort and assessed the persistence of DOACs compared to warfarin.

- **Methods**: We conducted six 1–1 propensity-score matched retrospective cohort analyses using Quebec health administrative databases (2011–2017). NVAF patients (≥ 18 years) covered by the public medication insurance plan entered the cohort on the first OAC dispensation date. We excluded those with OAC use in the previous year or stroke or bleeding diagnoses in the previous two years. Follow-up ended at death, March 2017, or the end of medication coverage by the public plan. Time-dependent Cox regression was applied.

- **Results**: We evaluated 10,893 patients initiated on apixaban (7206 standard, 3687 low-dose), 10,190 on rivaroxaban (7396 standard, 2794 low-dose), 5884 on dabigatran (2756 standard, 3128 low-dose), and propensity score-matched warfarin users. Across standard-dose DOACs, compared to warfarin, stroke risks were similar; bleeding risks were lower with apixaban (hazard ratio 0.63; 95% confidence interval 0.52–0.77) and dabigatran.

### Apixaban concentrations with lower than recommended dosing in older adults with atrial fibrillation [^1152rBeo]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2019). Low credibility.

Lower than recommended doses of direct-acting oral anticoagulants are often prescribed to older adults with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Our goal was to determine the consequences of lower than recommended dosing on plasma apixaban concentrations during the clinical care of older adults with NVAF.

- **Design**: Convenience sample of patients receiving anticoagulation during 2017.

- **Setting**: Academic medical center.

- **Participants**: Stable adults older than 65 years with NVAF receiving apixaban on a chronic basis.

- **Measurements**: Patient age, weight, creatinine, co-medications, and apixaban concentrations.

A total of 110 older adults with NVAF (mean age = 80.4 years; range = 66–100 years with 45% women) were studied. Overall, 48 patients received the recommended dosing of 5 mg twice/day, and 42 received lower than recommended dosing. One patient in each category had concentrations below the expected 5% to 95% range at the time of peak concentrations. Differences in the proportion of apixaban concentrations within or outside expected ranges were not significant between patients receiving lower than recommended doses and those dosed as recommended at 5 mg twice/day (P = 0.35). However, in patients dosed as recommended with 5 mg twice/day, four had concentrations above the 5% to 95% range for peak levels, expected at 3 to 4 hours after dosing; in two, this occurred around the midpoint of the dosing interval. Twenty patients received 2.5 mg twice/day as recommended. One-third had apixaban concentrations higher than expected peak concentrations compared with the clinical trials.

### Effectiveness and safety of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban versus warfarin in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^117XwMzg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

We used the fill dates and days supplied per prescription to determine patients' treatment episodes, defined as the period from the fill date to the date when there were no residual days of supply. A gap of a maximum of 30 days between treatment episodes was allowed; patients were considered to be continuing on treatment as long as they had another medication fill within 30 days of the end of the last treatment episode.

The allowable gap in treatment varied in previous observational NOAC comparison studies, ranging from 3 to 60 days. We chose 30 days instead of a longer gap (e.g. 60 days) because oral anticoagulants, especially NOACs, have a short half-life. A shorter allowable gap increased the likelihood that patients were indeed on treatment. We did not choose a shorter gap such as 3 days because, in reality, a short gap in treatment often reflects imperfect adherence to treatment rather than full discontinuation during the gap. Patients may miss a few pills from time to time, and some patients may intentionally miss or split pills as a cost-saving strategy; however, when patients had a 1-month gap, their adherence since the last prescription fill (measured by the proportion of days covered) would fall to 50% to 75%, depending on whether the last fill was a 30- or 90-day supply. Consequently, we chose 1 month as the allowable gap. We conducted additional sensitivity tests to change the allowable gap to 7 days, and the findings remained largely the same.

### Halcion [^112yvdqX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The recommended dosage for adults is 0.25 mg once daily before bedtime, with a maximum recommended dosage of 0.5 mg once daily. For geriatric patients, the starting dosage should be reduced to 0.125 mg once daily, with the possibility of an increase to 0.25 mg if there is no response. However, geriatric patients should not exceed 0.25 mg once daily. Halcion should not be prescribed in quantities exceeding a 1-month supply.

- **Dosing information**: The recommended dosage is 0.25 mg once daily before bedtime. A dosage of 0.125 mg once daily may be sufficient for some patients, such as those with low body weight. A dosage of 0.5 mg should only be used for patients who do not respond adequately to a lower dose trial. The maximum recommended dosage is 0.5 mg once daily. It is crucial to use the lowest effective dose for the patient due to significant dose-related adverse reactions. If Halcion is used for more than 3 weeks, the patient should be evaluated for a primary psychiatric or medical condition [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.6)]. Prescriptions should be written for short-term use (7 to 10 days), and should not exceed a 1-month supply.

- **Use in geriatric patients**: For geriatric patients, the recommended dosage is between 0.125 mg and 0.25 mg once daily. Therapy should start at 0.125 mg once daily. The 0.25 mg dose is only for patients who do not respond to a trial of the lower dose, with the maximum being 0.25 mg once daily. Elderly patients have an increased risk of dose-related adverse reactions [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

### Differences in preferences between clinicians and patients for the use and dosing of direct oral anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation [^112pzLRh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

- **Clinical practice and DOAC dosing knowledge**: Most clinicians (63.0%) empirically stated they would never or rarely use an underdosed direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). If a patient expressed concern about potential bleeding side effects of DOAC therapy, 14.6% of clinicians stated they would start the DOAC at a lower dose, in contrast with 18.3% who would suggest warfarin as an alternative or 17.5% who would start a proton pump inhibitor. Figures 2A through 2D describe the results of the DOAC dosing questions asked of surveyed clinicians.

In hypothetical case scenarios of a patient indicated for a full-dose DOAC by labeled dosing criteria, 41.2% of clinicians chose to underdose apixaban (< 5 mg BID), and 17.6% chose to underdose rivaroxaban (< 20 mg daily), based on labeling criteria. In other scenarios where a patient met labeled dosing criteria for an adjusted-dose DOAC, only 64.6% (apixaban 2.5 mg BID) and 71.7% (rivaroxaban 15 mg daily) of clinicians chose the reduced-dose DOAC answer. Only 35.0% of clinicians correctly answered all four scenarios with the correct dose following labeling criteria.

### Non-major bleeding with apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation [^114EGaBY]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

The ARISTOTLE trial design and results have been reported previously. Patients with AF and at least one risk factor for stroke were randomized to receive either dose-adjusted warfarin (international normalized ratio (INR) 2–3) or apixaban 5 mg twice daily. A reduced dose of apixaban, 2.5 mg twice daily, was designated for participants with two or more of the following criteria: age ≥ 80 years, weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine concentration ≥ 1.5 mg/dL (133 mmol/L). In the overall trial population, the reduced dose of apixaban (or placebo) was administered to 831 patients (4.7%). To enhance the quality of warfarin management, a dosage algorithm was provided, and regular feedback was given to sites regarding their level of INR control. Specifically, patients were excluded with conditions other than AF that required anticoagulation (e.g. a prosthetic heart valve), stroke within the previous 7 days, a need for aspirin at a dose > 165 mg a day, or a need for both aspirin and clopidogrel. Approval by the appropriate ethics committees was obtained at all sites, and all patients provided written informed consent.

For the purpose of this study, all patients receiving at least one dose of study drug were included. Three groups of patients were identified: patients with no bleeding, patients in whom the first bleeding event was clinically relevant non-major or minor, and patients in whom the first bleeding event was major. The analyses of bleeding events included all events from the time of the first dose of study drug until two days after the last dose was received.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111kWapd]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the 2024 ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS guidelines recommend considering the initiation of warfarin (target INR 2.0–3.0) or an evidence-based dose of apixaban for oral anticoagulation. This recommendation aims to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who are at elevated risk for stroke and have end-stage CKD (creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min) or are on dialysis.

### Stroke and bleeding risks in patients with atrial fibrillation treated with reduced apixaban dose: A real-life study [^1154fYNt]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess the association between a reduced apixaban dose and two outcomes: ischemic stroke/systemic embolism (SE) and major bleeding. A retrospective cohort study was performed within the database of the largest healthcare provider in Israel. All patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation who started apixaban treatment between 2013 and 2017 were identified. Apixaban users were classified into three dosing regimen groups based on their renal function, age, and weight: standard dose (5 mg b.i.d.), adjusted reduced dose (2.5 mg b.i.d.), and underdosing (2.5 mg b.i.d.). Patients were followed through 2018 for the occurrence of stroke/SE and major bleeding.

Of the 27,765 included patients:

- 13,141 (47%) adequately received the standard apixaban dose.
- 4,739 patients (17%) received the adjusted reduced dose.
- 9,885 patients (36%) were classified as underdosed.

The CHA2DS2-VASc score-adjusted hazard ratio for ischemic stroke/SE was 1.1 (95% confidence interval, 0.83–1.43) in the adjusted reduced dose group and 1.04 (95% CI, 0.83–1.35) in the underdosing group, compared with the standard apixaban dose group. The HAS-BLED score-adjusted hazard ratio for any major bleeding was 1.66 (95% CI, 1.32–2.09) in the adjusted reduced dose group and 1.51 (95% CI, 1.24–1.83) in the underdosing group, compared with the apixaban standard dose group. Results were similar for major gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage separately.

We conclude that underdosing with apixaban is very common and may not disproportionately elevate the risk of ischemic stroke.

### Oral apixaban for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism [^113CuUEV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Apixaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor administered in fixed doses, may simplify the treatment of venous thromboembolism.

- **Methods**: In this randomized, double-blind study, we compared apixaban (at a dose of 10 mg twice daily for 7 days, followed by 5 mg twice daily for 6 months) with conventional therapy (subcutaneous enoxaparin, followed by warfarin) in 5,395 patients with acute venous thromboembolism. The primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic venous thromboembolism or death related to venous thromboembolism. The principal safety outcomes were major bleeding alone and major bleeding plus clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding.

- **Results**: The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 59 of 2,609 patients (2.3%) in the apixaban group, as compared with 71 of 2,635 (2.7%) in the conventional-therapy group (relative risk, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 1.18; difference in risk [apixaban minus conventional therapy], -0.4 percentage points; 95% CI, -1.3 to 0.4). Apixaban was noninferior to conventional therapy (P < 0.001) for predefined upper limits of the 95% confidence intervals for both relative risk (< 1.80) and difference in risk (< 3.5 percentage points). Major bleeding occurred in 0.6% of patients who received apixaban and in 1.8% of those who received conventional therapy (relative risk, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.55; P < 0.001 for superiority). The composite outcome of major bleeding and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in 4.3% of the patients in the apixaban group, as compared with 9.7% of those in the conventional-therapy group.

### Apixaban for extended treatment of venous thromboembolism [^1113z9jn]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). High credibility.

The study AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 2.5 mg) was published by Agnelli G and colleagues in 2013 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. In the AMPLIFY-EXT (apixaban 2.5 mg) study, the trial question was: what is the role of apixaban in patients with VTE?

- **Study design**: Multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).
- **Population**: 1669 patients (714 female, 955 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with VTE.
- **Key exclusion criteria**: Contraindication to continued anticoagulant therapy or requiring ongoing anticoagulant therapy, dual antiplatelet therapy, or aspirin at a dose > 165 mg/day; hemoglobin level of 2.5 mg/dL.
- **Interventions**: n = 840 apixaban (2.5 mg BID for 12 months), n = 829 placebo (matching placebo BID for 12 months).
- **Primary outcome**: Significant decrease in symptomatic recurrent VTE or death from VTE (1.7% vs. 8.8%; RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.33).
- **Secondary outcomes**: Significant decrease in symptomatic reVTE or death from any cause (3.8% vs. 11.6%; RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.48). No significant difference in non-VTE-related cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (0.5% vs. 1.3%; RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.12). Significant decrease in reVTE, VTE related outcomes.

### Apixaban versus enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis in medically ill patients [^111uzmuC]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). High credibility.

The efficacy and safety of prolonging prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in medically ill patients beyond hospital discharge remain uncertain. We hypothesized that extended prophylaxis with apixaban would be safe and more effective than short-term prophylaxis with enoxaparin.

- **Methods**: In this double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned acutely ill patients who had congestive heart failure, respiratory failure, or other medical disorders and at least one additional risk factor for venous thromboembolism. These patients, hospitalized with an expected stay of at least 3 days, received either apixaban, administered orally at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily for 30 days, or enoxaparin, administered subcutaneously at a dose of 40 mg once daily for 6 to 14 days. The primary efficacy outcome was the 30-day composite of death related to venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis, or asymptomatic proximal-leg deep-vein thrombosis as detected using systematic bilateral compression ultrasonography on day 30. The primary safety outcome was bleeding. All efficacy and safety outcomes were independently adjudicated.

- **Results**: A total of 6528 subjects underwent randomization, with 4495 subjects evaluated for the primary efficacy outcome — 2211 in the apixaban group and 2284 in the enoxaparin group. Among the patients who could be evaluated, 2.71% in the apixaban group (60 patients) and 3.06% in the enoxaparin group (70 patients) met the criteria for the primary efficacy outcome (relative risk with apixaban, 0.

### Dissociation between the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of once-daily rivaroxaban and twice-daily apixaban: A randomized crossover study [^115qvWx1]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

In this crossover study, the anticoagulant effects of rivaroxaban and apixaban were compared. Healthy volunteers received rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily or apixaban 5 mg twice daily. Rivaroxaban was associated with more prolonged inhibition of thrombin generation than apixaban. It induced a clear prolongation of prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time.

- **Summary**: The anticoagulant actions of the oral direct activated factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban and apixaban, have not previously been directly compared.

- **Objectives**: To compare directly the steady-state pharmacokinetics and anticoagulant effects of rivaroxaban and apixaban at doses approved for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

- **Methods**: Twenty-four healthy Caucasian male volunteers were included in this open-label, two-period crossover, phase 1 study (EudraCT number: 2015–002612–32). Volunteers were randomized to receive rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily or apixaban 5 mg twice daily for 7 days, followed by a washout period of at least 7 days before they received the other treatment. Plasma concentrations and anticoagulant effects were measured at steady state and after drug discontinuation.

- **Results**: Overall exposure was similar for both drugs. The geometric mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve for the 0–24-hour interval was 1830 μg h L⁻¹ for rivaroxaban and 1860 μg h L⁻¹ for apixaban. Rivaroxaban was associated with greater inhibition of endogenous thrombin potential.

### Anticoagulation in patients with chronic kidney disease [^112coef5]. American Journal of Nephrology (2024).

- **Apixaban**: Steady-state pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, including data from patients in the second month of the ARISTOTLE trial, which recruited participants with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) as low as 25 mL/min, showed considerable overlap of drug exposure with the 5 mg twice daily apixaban dose in patients with mild, moderate, and severe chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, in a PK analysis of seven patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on hemodialysis, Mavrakanas et al. showed that steady-state exposure on day seven with each apixaban dose was significantly higher compared with day one. The accumulation index was higher in ESKD (3.6) compared to healthy controls (1.3–1.7). Steady-state exposure attained at the dose of 2.5 mg twice daily was comparable to that achieved with the 5 mg twice daily dose in healthy volunteers, whereas exposure in some patients with ESKD was supratherapeutic with the 5 mg twice daily dose. The authors recommended dose reduction of apixaban to 2.5 mg twice daily in patients with ESKD.

- **RENAL-AF trial**: The RENAL-AF was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) which compared apixaban to warfarin in patients with ESKD and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation at high risk for stroke. Apixaban was given at the standard dose of 5 mg twice daily. The reduced dose (2.5 mg twice daily) was used in patients over 80 years of age or with a body weight less than 60 kg. Exposure attained with the standard dose was higher than the exposure observed in patients from the ARISTOTLE trial, who had preserved kidney function (median steady-state area under the curve (AUC) in RENAL-AF was 2,475 ng/mL.h vs. 1,374 ng/mL.h in ARISTOTLE). Drug exposure with the reduced apixaban dose was comparable to patients with normal kidney function from the ARISTOTLE trial.

### Effectiveness and safety of standard-dose nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants and warfarin among patients with atrial fibrillation with a single stroke risk factor: A nationwide cohort study [^115TdTpZ]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). High credibility.

- **Importance**: The randomized clinical trials comparing nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) versus warfarin largely focused on recruiting high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation with more than two stroke risk factors, with only the trials testing dabigatran or apixaban including few patients with one stroke risk factor. Despite this, regulatory approvals of all NOACs have been based on stroke prevention for patients with atrial fibrillation with one or more stroke risk factors.

- **Objective**: To compare the effectiveness and safety of standard-dose NOACs (dabigatran at 150 mg twice daily, rivaroxaban at 20 mg once daily, and apixaban at 5 mg twice daily) and warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation with one low-risk, non-sex-related stroke risk factor.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This nationwide observational cohort study used data from Danish registries to determine the inverse probability of treatment-weighted comparative effectiveness and safety of standard-dose NOACs (dabigatran at 150 mg twice daily, rivaroxaban at 20 mg once daily, and apixaban at 5 mg twice daily) compared with treatment with warfarin among 14,020 patients with atrial fibrillation with one low-risk, non-sex-related stroke risk factor.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Rates of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism, death, and bleeding.

- **Results**: Of 14,020 participants, 5,151 (36.7%) were women, and the median age for participants was 66.5 years. For the principal effectiveness endpoint of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism, no significant differences were observed for the NOACs compared with treatment with warfarin.

### Factor Xa inhibitors versus vitamin K antagonists for preventing cerebral or systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation [^111JvXiz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Factor Xa inhibitors and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are now recommended in treatment guidelines for preventing stroke and systemic embolic events in people with atrial fibrillation (AF). This is an update of a Cochrane review previously published in 2013.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of treatment with factor Xa inhibitors versus VKAs for preventing cerebral or systemic embolic events in people with AF.

- **Search methods**: We searched the trials registers of the Cochrane Stroke Group and the Cochrane Heart Group (September 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (August 2017), MEDLINE (1950 to April 2017), and Embase (1980 to April 2017). We also contacted pharmaceutical companies, authors, and sponsors of relevant published trials. We used outcome data from marketing authorisation applications of apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban that were submitted to regulatory authorities in Europe and the United States.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that directly compared the effects of long-term treatment (lasting more than four weeks) with factor Xa inhibitors versus VKAs for preventing cerebral and systemic embolism in people with AF.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The primary efficacy outcome was the composite endpoint of all strokes and systemic embolic events. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of the trials and the risk of bias. We calculated a weighted estimate of the typical treatment effect across trials using the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence.

### D-dimer and reduced-dose apixaban for extended treatment after unprovoked venous thromboembolism: The Apidulcis study [^116oHmmG]. Blood Advances (2022). Low credibility.

All included patients underwent serial D-dimer assessment starting at baseline during anticoagulation (T0). Patients with positive baseline D-dimer were instructed to take apixaban 2.5 mg twice a day for 18 months, while those with negative D-dimer at T0 were asked to stop anticoagulant therapy and repeat D-dimer testing after 15 ± 3 (T1), 30 ± 4 (T2), and 60 ± 5 (T3) days from T0. At the first positive D-dimer result, apixaban 2.5 mg twice a day was given by the local investigator for a treatment duration of 18 months. Three boxes containing apixaban 2.5 mg tablets (each box sufficient for 1 month of treatment) were distributed to patients directly by the participant investigators and refilled every 3 months. Patients with persistently negative D-dimer results were invited to stay off anticoagulant treatment.

Patients underwent assessment, either at the clinic or by phone, every 3 to 6 months during the study period. They were invited to report to the study center if they had symptoms suggestive of reVTE or bleeding. An independent adjudication committee that was unaware of patient name, D-dimer testing result at inclusion, management, and enrolling center assessed all outcomes. ReDVT was diagnosed if a previously fully compressible segment at compression ultrasonography (CUS; contralateral or ipsilateral) could no longer be compressed or if an increase of ≥ 4 mm in the diameter of the residual thrombus during compression was detected. In patients with suspected PE, recurrence was diagnosed following objective imaging criteria.

### Apixaban in patients on haemodialysis: A single-dose pharmacokinetics study [^114akRsf]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Low credibility.

Apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant inhibiting factor Xa, has been proven to reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation-related stroke and thromboembolism in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency. However, patients on renal replacement therapy were excluded from randomized controlled trials. Therefore, uncertainty remains concerning the benefits, dosing, and timing of intake in the haemodialysis population.

- **Methods**: We conducted a Phase II pharmacokinetics study in which 24 patients on maintenance haemodialysis were given a single dose (2.5 mg or 5 mg) of apixaban, either 30 minutes before or immediately after dialysis on the mid-week dialysis day.

- **Results**: Apixaban 5 mg resulted in a higher area under the curve (AUC0–48) compared to 2.5 mg, although significance could only be reached for dosing pre-dialysis (2.5 mg versus 5 mg, P = 0.008). In line with this, peak concentrations (Cmax) after dosing pre-dialysis were significantly higher in the 5 mg group than in the 2.5 mg group (P = 0.02). Additionally, dialysis resulted in a significant reduction of drug exposure. AUC0–48 pre-dialysis were on average 48% (2.5 mg) and 26% (5 mg) lower than the AUC0–48 post-dialysis, which aligned with Cmax. As a result, a dose of 2.5 mg post-dialysis and a dose of 5 mg pre-dialysis resulted in similar AUC0–48. In contrast, significant differences were found between the 5 mg group post-dialysis and the 2.5 mg group pre-dialysis (P = 0.02).

- **Conclusions**: Our data suggest that exposure to apixaban in patients on maintenance haemodialysis is dependent not only on drug dose but also on the timing of intake relative to the haemodialysis session.

### Direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists after recent ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation [^111shgN1]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

In a post-hoc analysis, among the 2,656 patients receiving a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), 723 (27.2%) were administered apixaban, 959 (36.1%) dabigatran, 11 (0.4%) edoxaban, and 880 (33.1%) rivaroxaban. In 83 patients (3.1%), the type of DOAC was not specified. Compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKA), DOAC bid — specifically apixaban or dabigatran — was associated with a reduced risk of the composite endpoint (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.48–0.82; p < 0.001) in 3 (11.5%).

### Asundexian versus apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112uaboQ]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Stroke prevention with direct-acting oral anticoagulant agents in patients with atrial fibrillation confers a risk of bleeding and limits their use. Asundexian, an activated factor XI (XIa) inhibitor, is an oral anticoagulant that may prevent strokes with less bleeding.

- **Methods**: In a phase 3, international, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation in a 1:1 ratio to receive asundexian at a dose of 50 mg once daily or standard-dose apixaban. The primary efficacy objective was to determine whether asundexian is at least noninferior to apixaban for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism. The primary safety objective was to determine whether asundexian is superior to apixaban with respect to major bleeding events.

- **Results**: A total of 14,810 randomly assigned patients were included in the intention-to-treat population. The mean (± SD) age of the patients was 73.9 ± 7.7 years, 35.2% were women, 18.6% had chronic kidney disease, 18.2% had a previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, 16.8% had received oral anticoagulants for no more than 6 weeks, and the mean CHA₂DS₂-VASc score (range, 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating a greater risk of stroke) was 4.3 ± 1.3. The trial was stopped prematurely at the recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee. Stroke or systemic embolism occurred in 98 patients (1.3%) assigned to receive asundexian and in 26 (0.4%) assigned to receive apixaban (hazard ratio, 3.79; 95% confidence interval, 2.46 to 5.83). Major bleeding occurred in 17 patients (0.2%) who received…

### Apixaban in patients at risk of stroke undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation [^114fW88k]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Patients randomized to apixaban received 5 mg b.i.d. throughout the study period. The apixaban dose was reduced to 2.5 mg b.i.d. if two or more of the following characteristics were present: age ≥ 80 years, body weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine level ≥ 1.5 mg/dL (133 μmol/L). Apixaban was continued during the ablation procedure without interruption, including on the morning of ablation. Continuous anticoagulation in this group was defined as having taken all but one apixaban dose per week based on pill count.

### Asundexian versus apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation [^111idcHj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The OCEANIC-AF study, published in 2025 in the New England Journal of Medicine, examined the impact of asundexian on patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) at risk of stroke. This multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) included a population of 14,810 patients, consisting of 5,214 females and 9,596 males. The inclusion criteria targeted adult patients with AF at risk of stroke, while key exclusion criteria included conditions such as mechanical heart valve prosthesis, moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis (MS), AF due to reversible causes, recent acute ischemic stroke (AIS), active bleeding, chronic bleeding disorder, history of non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and significant liver disease.

- **Interventions**: The study compared two interventions: asundexian at an oral dose of 50 mg daily (n = 7,415) and apixaban at an oral dose of 5 mg twice daily (n = 7,395).

- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant increase in stroke or systemic embolism with asundexian (1.3%) compared to apixaban (0.4%) with a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.79 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.46 to 5.83).

- **Secondary outcomes**: The study reported a significant increase in AIS or systemic embolism (1.3% vs. 0.3%; HR 4.38, 95% CI 2.76 to 6.96) with no significant difference in death from any cause (0.8% vs. 1%; HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.6 to 1.19). There was also a significant increase in AIS alone (1.1% vs. 0.3%; HR 4.06, 95% CI 2.52 to 6.54).

- **Safety outcomes**: The study found no significant difference in adverse events between the two groups. There was, however, a significant difference in major bleeding, with asundexian showing 0.2% compared to 0.7% in the apixaban group.

In conclusion, the OCEANIC-AF study found that in adult patients with AF at risk of stroke, asundexian use led to an increase in certain adverse outcomes compared to apixaban.

### Apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation [^116AqjZP]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). High credibility.

The ARISTOTLE study, published by Granger CB and colleagues in 2011 in The New England Journal of Medicine, examines apixaban's role in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). This multi-center, double-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) included 18,201 patients (6,416 female, 11,785 male). Participants had AF and at least one additional risk factor for stroke. Key exclusion criteria were AF due to a reversible cause, moderate or severe mitral stenosis, conditions other than AF requiring anticoagulation (e.g. a prosthetic heart valve), stroke within the previous 7 days, the need for aspirin at a dose greater than 165 mg a day or both aspirin and clopidogrel, and severe renal insufficiency.

The interventions included 9,120 patients receiving apixaban (5 mg PO BID) and 9,081 patients receiving dose-adjusted warfarin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0.

- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant decrease in the incidence of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or systemic embolism in the apixaban group compared to the warfarin group (1.2% per year vs. 1.6% per year; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.95).

- **Secondary outcomes**: The study reported a significant decrease in the incidence of major bleeding (2.13% per year vs. 3.09% per year; HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.6 to 0.8), death from any cause (3.52% vs. 3.94%; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.8 to 0.99), and hemorrhagic stroke (0.24% per year vs. 0.47% per year; HR 0.51, 95% CI).

### Off-label dosing of non-vitamin K-dependent oral antagonists in AF patients before and after stroke: Results of the prospective multicenter Berlin Atrial Fibrillation Registry [^1127tDoV]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

An off-label daily dose was prescribed in 23 (20.7%) of 111 AF patients on rivaroxaban. Among these, 5 (4.5%) patients were over-dosed, receiving 20 mg OD instead of 15 mg OD (n = 4) or 30 mg OD instead of 20 mg. Additionally, 19 (17.1%) patients were under-dosed, receiving 15 mg OD instead of 20 mg OD. Rivaroxaban under-dosing at hospital discharge after stroke was associated with age ≥ 80 years [OR 3.49, 95% CI 1.24–9.84, P = 0.02].

An off-label daily dose was prescribed in 74 (16.1%) of 459 AF patients on apixaban. Of these, 18 (3.9%) patients were over-dosed (receiving 5.0 mg TD instead of 2.5 mg TD), and 56 (12.2%) patients were under-dosed (receiving 2.5 mg TD instead of 5 mg TD). Apixaban under-dosing at hospital discharge after stroke was associated with body weight ≤ 60 kg [OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01–0.47, P < 0.01], CHA₂DS₂-VASc score [OR per point 1.47, 95% CI 1.08–2.00, P = 0.01], and HAS-BLED score [OR per point 1.91, 95% CI 1.28–2.84, P < 0.01].

### Eliquis [^11152cqz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

In the AVERROES study, patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who were not considered candidates for warfarin therapy were randomized to receive either Eliquis 5 mg orally twice daily (or 2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients) or aspirin 81 to 324 mg once daily. The primary objective was to determine if Eliquis was superior to aspirin in preventing the composite outcome of stroke or systemic embolism. AVERROES was stopped early based on a prespecified interim analysis showing a significant reduction in stroke and systemic embolism for Eliquis compared to aspirin, which was associated with a modest increase in major bleeding [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Special considerations for therapeutic choice of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants for Japanese patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^114ERxnt]. Clinical Cardiology (2017).

**Characteristics of the Noacs**: The characteristics of the four NOACs (edoxaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban) have been compared with those of warfarin and reported in numerous studies. In brief, NOACs have shorter half‐lives and take less time to reach maximum blood concentration than does warfarin. Unlike warfarin, NOACs have a specific target (either thrombin or factor Xa), do not require coagulation monitoring, and can be administered with fixed doses.

### Apixaban compared to heparin/vitamin K antagonist in patients with atrial fibrillation scheduled for cardioversion: the EMANATE trial [^116XsJ6w]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The EMANATE trial was a multinational, randomized, active-controlled, open-label study involving patients with recently diagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF) scheduled for cardioversion. The study included patients with electrocardiographically confirmed AF and no more than 48 hours of prior anticoagulation. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either apixaban or usual care with parenteral heparin and/or an oral vitamin K antagonist (VKA). The randomization process utilized a centralized interactive voice-response system.

- **Study design**: The protocol encouraged a single loading dose of apixaban, either 10 mg or 5 mg, with imaging guidance at the investigator's discretion, to facilitate a more rapid transition to cardioversion. The dosage was reduced to 2.5 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) or a single loading dose of 5 mg based on the presence of two out of these factors: age ≥ 80 years, weight ≤ 60 kg, or serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL (133 μmol/L). Imaging guidance, whether via transoesophageal echocardiography or computer tomography, was also at the investigator's discretion.

For patients receiving usual care with heparin and a VKA, the target international normalized ratio (INR) was set between 2.0 and 3.0. Heparin administration was to be continued until the INR reached 2 or higher. In those assigned apixaban, the standard dosage was 5 mg twice daily, with a reduction to 2.5 mg b.i.d. for patients meeting the specified criteria of age, weight, or serum creatinine levels. This dosing reflects the approved strategy for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular AF. Cardioversion could proceed after five doses of apixaban, by which time steady-state blood levels were expected.

### Apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation [^116LPtpz]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). High credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists are highly effective in preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation but have several limitations. Apixaban is a novel oral direct factor Xa inhibitor that has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke in a similar population in comparison with aspirin.

- **Methods**: In this randomized, double-blind trial, we compared apixaban (at a dose of 5 mg twice daily) with warfarin (target international normalized ratio, 2.0 to 3.0) in 18,201 patients with atrial fibrillation and at least one additional risk factor for stroke. The primary outcome was ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or systemic embolism. The trial was designed to test for noninferiority, with key secondary objectives of testing for superiority with respect to the primary outcome and to the rates of major bleeding and death from any cause.

- **Results**: The median duration of follow-up was 1.8 years. The rate of the primary outcome was 1.27% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 1.60% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio with apixaban, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.95; P < 0.001 for noninferiority; P = 0.01 for superiority). The rate of major bleeding was 2.13% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 3.09% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.80; P < 0.001), and the rates of death from any cause were 3.52% and 3.94%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.99; P = 0.047). The rate of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.24% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 0.47% per year in the warfarin group.

### Apixaban in patients at risk of stroke undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation [^112P6ykB]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation ablation with continuous anticoagulation is recommended. Continuous apixaban, however, has not been previously tested.

We conducted a prospective, open, multi-centre study with blinded outcome assessment to compare continuous apixaban (5 mg b.i.d.) with vitamin K antagonists (VKA, international normalized ratio 2–3) in atrial fibrillation patients at risk of stroke. The primary outcome was a composite of death, stroke, or bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 2–5). A high-resolution brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sub-study quantified acute brain lesions. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at baseline and at the end of follow-up.

Overall, 674 patients (median age 64 years, 33% female, 42% with non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, across 49 sites) were randomized, and 633 received the study drug and underwent ablation. Of these, 335 participants undertook MRI scans at 25 sites, with 323 scans being analyzable. The primary outcome occurred in 22 out of 318 patients randomized to apixaban and 23 out of 315 randomized to VKA, with a difference of −0.38% [90% confidence interval (CI) −4.0%, 3.3%], demonstrating non-inferiority (P = 0.0002 at the pre-specified absolute margin of 0.075). This included 2 (0.3%) deaths, 2 (0.3%) strokes, and 24 (3.8%) ISTH major bleeds. Acute small brain lesions appeared in a similar number of patients in each treatment arm [apixaban 44/162 (27.2%); VKA 40/161 (24.8%); P = 0.64]. Cognitive function improved at the end of follow-up with a median increase of 1 MoCA unit (P = 0.005), and no significant differences were observed between the study groups.

In conclusion, continuous apixaban is safe and effective in patients undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1111eHN8]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, specifically with respect to rhythm control maintenance therapy, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of low-dose amiodarone (100–200 mg/day) for the long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with AF and normal LV function. Due to its adverse effect profile, amiodarone should be reserved for situations when other rhythm control strategies are ineffective, not preferred, or contraindicated.
