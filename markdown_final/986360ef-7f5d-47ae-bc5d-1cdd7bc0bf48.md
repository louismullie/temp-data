## Question

What is the appropriate next workup for a left lower lobe solid nodular opacity measuring 2.8 cm × 1.3 cm with a 1.3 cm solid component identified on CT lung screening?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate next workup for a 2.8 cm left lower lobe solid nodular opacity with a 1.3 cm solid component detected on CT lung screening. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about nodule characterization and baseline malignancy risk. Then, I should align the size and morphology with major guideline thresholds. Next, I will decide on the immediate next imaging versus proceeding directly to tissue diagnosis. After that, I will map the downstream pathway based on functional imaging results and sampling feasibility. Finally, I should reconcile screening-specific frameworks like Lung-RADS with general nodule guidelines to ensure concordance and practicality [^112Sigqt] [^114JqRBL] [^111mHsJx] [^111hebEh].

> Let me first confirm the risk profile from the descriptors provided, because I need to ensure I'm not underestimating risk due to wording nuances. A 2.8 cm lesion is well above the 8 mm threshold that triggers aggressive evaluation in all major guidelines, and if the term "solid nodular opacity" conceals a part-solid morphology, the 13 mm solid component alone exceeds the 6 mm action threshold that typically mandates expedited workup rather than surveillance, especially in a high-risk screening context [^114JqRBL] [^115uUqSn]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — if this were truly a small nodule in a low-risk patient, surveillance could be reasonable, but here the size and context make the pretest probability high enough that surveillance alone would be inappropriate [^112YruNE] [^114N446G].

> Next, I should review the guideline thresholds and specific recommendations to anchor the choice of the next test. The Fleischner Society recommends combined PET and CT and/or tissue sampling for solitary solid noncalcified nodules larger than 8 mm, with selection informed by size, morphology, and comorbidity, which in this case all point away from mere short-interval CT follow-up given the 28 mm size and possible part-solid features [^114JqRBL]. I will now examine ACR Appropriateness Criteria, which explicitly recommend FDG-PET/CT whole body as the next imaging step for incidentally detected indeterminate solid pulmonary nodules greater than 8 mm, a directive that aligns with using metabolic characterization and staging to guide biopsy strategy and potential definitive management [^112Sigqt]. The ACCP similarly advises PET-CT, nonsurgical biopsy, or upfront resection for solid nodules greater than 8 mm depending on pretest probability and patient factors, reinforcing the need to move beyond surveillance here [^111mHsJx]. The British Thoracic Society recommends percutaneous lung biopsy when the result will alter management, which it clearly will at this size and context [^111hebEh].

> Wait, let me verify the immediate next diagnostic step so I don't skip a crucial sequencing detail. The most appropriate next study is whole-body FDG-PET/CT, because it assesses metabolic activity, refines malignancy probability, provides nodal and distant staging, and informs the safest and highest-yield site and route for tissue sampling; this is directly supported by the ACR Appropriateness Criteria and is compatible with Fleischner guidance on using PET/CT for nodules over 8 mm [^112Sigqt] [^114JqRBL]. I should confirm that in the screening setting this remains consistent with Lung-RADS v2022 approaches for highly suspicious lesions, where diagnostic evaluation with PET/CT and tissue sampling is appropriate for category 4B/4X–type findings rather than continued LDCT surveillance [^115uUqSn] [^111Mxoqa].

> Hold on, I should verify CT technique considerations before biopsy planning, because suboptimal imaging can mislead both PET interpretation and procedural planning. If the only prior study is low-dose screening CT, obtaining a thin-section diagnostic chest CT with appropriate technique can sharpen margin assessment, vascular relationships, and bronchus sign to guide interventional route, consistent with BTS and ACR technical recommendations, though this step should not delay PET/CT given the lesion's size and risk [^114Hf7ZN] [^1172MEfW]. But wait, what if limited respiratory motion or segmentation uncertainty complicates measurement and morphology classification? Ensuring accurate segmentation and thin-section reconstructions is recommended to reduce misclassification that might otherwise affect management decisions [^114iXGyU] [^114Hf7ZN].

> Next, I should review what to do with the PET/CT result, and I need to ensure I don't over-rely on PET negativity given size and morphology. If PET shows focal hypermetabolism without distant disease, proceed to tissue diagnosis via percutaneous or bronchoscopic biopsy depending on location and procedural risk, because histology will determine the path and is necessary for potential molecular testing if malignant; this aligns with BTS and ACCP recommendations [^111hebEh] [^111mHsJx]. If PET is negative yet morphology remains suspicious, particularly at this 2.8 cm size or if a substantial solid component exists, biopsy is still indicated since PET false negatives occur and the pretest probability remains high; ACCP reserves surveillance for carefully selected low-probability scenarios and not for a lesion of this size and context [^112YruNE] [^111mHsJx]. Let me consider one more nuance: in adenocarcinoma-spectrum lesions, solid component size correlates with invasiveness and prognosis, so a 13 mm solid portion strengthens the argument to obtain tissue even if PET uptake is modest [^116Zw6g7] [^115MEhTm].

> I will now examine procedural approach and risks to match the nodule's location and patient factors. For a left lower lobe peripheral lesion of this size, CT-guided percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy typically offers high diagnostic yield but carries pneumothorax risk that must be weighed against bronchoscopic approaches, especially if a bronchus sign or navigational bronchoscopy capability is present; BTS emphasizes considering image-guided biopsy with an understanding of complication risk and clinical impact of the result on management decisions [^114UnkDS] [^116Vo255]. Hold on, I should verify that pursuing biopsy after PET/CT is preferred over upfront resection; given the frequent need for staging and molecular characterization, PET-first then biopsy is generally more informative, reserving primary surgery for select high-probability, operable cases where tissue could be obtained surgically without delay or where PET/CT would not alter management, per ACCP principles [^111mHsJx].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought short-interval CT surveillance could be an acceptable bridge given the screening context, but that would be a mistake here; at 2.8 cm with potential part-solid morphology and a 13 mm solid component, surveillance alone risks stage migration and delays definitive care, whereas guidelines consistently support PET/CT and tissue diagnosis for nodules over 8 mm, especially beyond 2 cm, so I should correct that earlier consideration and affirm a diagnostic pathway rather than surveillance [^114JqRBL] [^112Sigqt] [^111mHsJx].

> Synthesis and final recommendation: I should double-check that the plan is guideline-concordant across societies. The most appropriate next workup is whole-body FDG-PET/CT to assess metabolic activity and stage disease, immediately followed by tissue sampling via percutaneous or bronchoscopic biopsy based on procedural feasibility and patient risk, because this 2.8 cm lesion (with a 1.3 cm solid component) carries a high pretest probability where functional characterization and histopathology will directly alter management; this approach is concordant with ACR Appropriateness Criteria, Fleischner recommendations for nodules > 8 mm, BTS guidance on proceeding to biopsy when the result will change care, and ACCP pathways for larger solid nodules [^112Sigqt] [^114JqRBL] [^111hebEh] [^111mHsJx]. I need to ensure shared decision-making and rapid coordination so that diagnostic steps are not delayed, especially if PET/CT identifies nodal or distant disease that would shift the sampling target and treatment strategy [^112Sigqt] [^111mHsJx].

For a solid nodular opacity of the left lower lobe measuring 2.8 × 1.3 cm with a 1.3 cm solid component on CT lung screening, the next step is to **obtain a PET-CT scan** [^112Sigqt] to assess metabolic activity and stage disease [^114JqRBL]. If the PET-CT is positive or the clinical risk is high, proceed to **tissue diagnosis** via CT-guided transthoracic needle biopsy [^114UnkDS] or bronchoscopy with EBUS, selected by nodule location and patient factors [^112YruNE]. If malignancy is confirmed or strongly suspected, refer to a multidisciplinary team [^111UkTmm] for surgical resection or definitive therapy; if PET-CT is negative and clinical risk is low, consider CT surveillance at 3–6, 9–12, and 18–24 months [^111mHsJx].

---

## Initial risk assessment

Clinical risk assessment considers **age, smoking history, prior malignancy, family history, occupational exposures, and comorbidities** [^112fLWzu] [^111RnwGJ]. Radiographic features informing risk [^112fLWzu] include nodule size, solid component, spiculation, irregular margins, and growth rate [^111G3qam] [^111RnwGJ]. Given the nodule's size and solid component, the malignancy risk is **moderate to high**, warranting further evaluation [^112YruNE].

---

## Recommended diagnostic imaging

### PET-CT scan

- **Indication**: Solid pulmonary nodules [^114JqRBL] > 8 mm [^112Sigqt].

- **Purpose**: Assess metabolic activity (SUV) and detect regional/distant metastases [^114WFeX1].

- **Interpretation**: SUV > 2.5 suggests malignancy; false positives/negatives can occur [^112YruNE].

---

### High-resolution CT (HRCT)

High-resolution CT refines **nodule characterization** [^1172MEfW] by detailing morphology, margins, and growth. Thin-section (≤ 1.25 mm) imaging [^114Hf7ZN] with MIP/VR reconstructions [^116AFw8z] is recommended for optimal assessment.

---

## Tissue diagnosis

### CT-guided transthoracic needle biopsy (TTNB)

- **Indication**: Peripheral nodules accessible by percutaneous approach [^116Vo255].

- **Advantages**: High diagnostic yield for peripheral lesions [^111hebEh].

- **Risks**: Pneumothorax, bleeding, infection [^114UnkDS].

---

### Bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)

- **Indication**: Central lesions or suspected mediastinal lymphadenopathy [^112YruNE].

- **Advantages**: Minimally invasive, allows lymph node sampling [^112YruNE].

- **Limitations**: Lower yield for peripheral lesions.

---

## Multidisciplinary team (MDT) evaluation

Evaluation by a **multidisciplinary team** including a pulmonologist, thoracic surgeon, radiologist, oncologist, and pathologist ensures coordinated care [^111UkTmm]. The team integrates clinical, radiographic, and pathological data to guide management decisions.

---

## Management based on diagnostic findings

### Malignant or highly suspicious lesions

For malignant or highly suspicious lesions, **surgical resection** with lobectomy or segmentectomy and lymph node sampling is preferred when the patient is operable. In inoperable patients, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) or systemic therapy offers definitive non-surgical management [^112YruNE].

---

### Benign or low-risk lesions

Benign or low-risk lesions may be managed with **serial CT surveillance** [^114JqRBL] at 3–6, 9–12, and 18–24 months [^111mHsJx]. Patients can be discharged from imaging follow-up after at least 2 years of demonstrated stability [^114N446G].

---

## Patient counseling and shared decision-making

Counsel patients regarding the **risks, benefits, and alternatives** of diagnostic and therapeutic options. Incorporate patient values and preferences into the management plan through **shared decision-making** [^112YruNE].

### Management of progressive pulmonary nodules found during and outside of CT lung cancer screening studies [^112PywyE]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Although the effectiveness of screening for lung cancer remains controversial, it is a fact that most lung cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage outside of lung cancer screening programs. In 2013, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force revised its lung cancer screening recommendation, now supporting lung cancer screening by low-dose computed tomography in patients at high risk. This is also endorsed by many major medical societies and advocacy group stakeholders, albeit with different eligibility criteria. In Europe, population-based lung cancer screening has so far not been recommended or implemented, as some important issues remain unresolved. Among them is the open question of how enlarging pulmonary nodules detected in lung cancer screening should be managed.

### ACR lung-RADS v2022: Assessment categories and management recommendations [^115uUqSn]. Chest (2024). High credibility.

The American College of Radiology created the Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) in 2014 to standardize the reporting and management of screen-detected pulmonary nodules. Lung-RADS was updated to version 1.1 in 2019 and revised size thresholds for nonsolid nodules, added classification criteria for perifissural nodules, and allowed for short-interval follow-up of rapidly enlarging nodules that may be infectious in etiology. Lung-RADS v2022, released in November 2022, provides several updates, including guidance on the classification and management of atypical pulmonary cysts, juxtapleural nodules, airway-centered nodules, and potentially infectious findings. This new release also provides clarification for determining nodule growth and introduces stepped management for nodules that are stable or decreasing in size. This article summarizes the evidence and expert consensus supporting Lung-RADS v2022.

- **Figure 1**: Axial chest CT scan in lung window setting of a 54-year-old man with persistent cough shows a sharply delineated oval nodule in the left lower lobe. Due to the lesion's slow increase in size, a lobectomy was performed. Histopathology revealed a 1 cm typical carcinoid.

- **Figure 2**: A 63-year-old woman with a history of lobectomy on the right upper lobe 10 years prior for invasive adenocarcinoma and wedge excision of the left upper lobe 2 years prior for minimally invasive adenocarcinoma was referred for CT. This follow-up chest CT showed numerous subsolid nodules in both lungs, with two part-solid lesions in the right middle lobe, increasing in size and density. The axial CT image in lung window setting shows a pure ground-glass nodule in the apex (Fig. 2a) and a more centrally located part-solid nodule (Fig. 2b) with both ground-glass and dense components. Histopathological examination after lobectomy showed an adenocarcinoma in situ in the pure ground-glass lesion and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma in the subsolid lesion.

- **Figure 3**: Axial CT image in lung window setting of a 25-year-old immunocompromised man with myelodysplastic syndrome, treated with induction chemotherapy, shows a subpleural nodule in the right lower lobe. The nodule has a predominant solid aspect with a surrounding ground-glass halo. Additionally, small foci of ground glass are noted in the right lung. Clinical and laboratory findings were consistent with invasive aspergillosis.

### Incidental perifissural nodules on routine chest computed tomography: Lung cancer or not [^116gRXE1]. European Radiology (2018).

Solid pulmonary nodules are a common finding in computed tomography (CT) of the chest, and management decisions regarding these nodules are encountered by many on an almost daily basis. The majority of solid nodules, however, will not represent a malignancy. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to reliably differentiate potentially malignant nodules from benign lesions. To guide this process, screening-focused guidelines like Lung-RADS (Lung Screening Reporting and Data System) are available. Additionally, for clinical use, ACCP (American College of Chest Physicians), Fleischner Society, and British Thoracic Society guidelines have been issued.

A substantial subset of solid pulmonary nodules will represent perifissural nodules (PFNs), most likely representing intrapulmonary lymph nodes. Morphologically, these are solid, homogeneous nodules with a smooth margin and are oval or rounded, lentiform, or triangular in shape. It has been proposed to differentiate between typical and atypical PFNs on one hand and non-PFN nodules on the other, based on the presence of fissural attachment and morphological characteristics. Prior lung cancer-screening studies have shown that solid pulmonary nodules that conform to the definition of PFNs — either typical or atypical — do not represent or develop into lung malignancies over time, and should be regarded as non-suspect and benign lesions.

Outside a screening setting, these perifissural nodules are also regularly found in daily routine imaging, and one may assume that they behave similarly. However, data on PFNs in routine settings remain sparse.

### Pulmonary nodules and CT screening: The past, present and future [^1121yLFN]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

With these advances in CT technology and pulmonary nodule management, are we now in a position to recommend screening? In 1968, Wilson and Jungner compiled a report commissioned by the WHO, highlighting that while the concept of screening was admirable, it was not without difficulties in terms of optimizing benefits and harms. In order to aid the appropriate selection of conditions for which the benefits of screening outweighed the harms, they outlined 10 screening principles for appraising the viability, effectiveness, and appropriateness of a screening programme, which form the basis for the criteria outlined by the UK NSC. Below are key factors that need to be addressed for successful implementation of a lung cancer screening programme.

- **Radiation risk**: Advances in CT scanning technology have improved nodule detection and characterization while reducing radiation dose. Techniques such as iterative reconstruction (which reduces the extent of noise and artifact associated with images at lower radiation doses), altering tube voltage, and gantry rotation speed are valuable in reducing effective radiation doses. Further reduction to overall radiation exposure over time will follow the implementation of more conservative approaches to managing positive findings, as suggested in recent guidelines.

### Follow-up of incidental pulmonary nodules and the radiology report [^117H1S6y]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Incidental pulmonary nodules that require follow-up are often noted on chest CT. Evidence-based guidelines regarding appropriate follow-up have been published, but adherence to these guidelines is uncertain. Moreover, the influence of the radiology report on the nodule follow-up rate is also unknown.

- **Methods**: A review of 1,000 CT pulmonary angiographic studies ordered in the emergency department was conducted to identify incidental pulmonary nodules. The study applied Fleischner Society guidelines to determine if follow-up was recommended. Radiology reports were classified based on whether nodules were listed in the findings section only, noted in the impression section, or included explicit follow-up recommendations. The impact of the radiology report on the follow-up rate was evaluated according to these three categories.

- **Results**: Incidental pulmonary nodules needing follow-up were noted on 9.9% (95% confidence interval, 8%-12%) of CT pulmonary angiographic studies. Overall, follow-up for these nodules was poor (29% [28 of 96]; 95% confidence interval, 20%-38%). This rate significantly decreased to 0% (0 of 12) when nodules were mentioned only in the findings section. Even when specific instructions to follow up on nodules were included in radiology reports, the follow-up rate remained low at 29% (19 of 65; 95% confidence interval, 18%-40%).

- **Conclusions**: Incidental pulmonary nodules detected on CT pulmonary angiography are common, yet follow-up is frequently inadequate. Although inclusion of a pulmonary nodule in the report's impression section slightly improves follow-up rates, overall adherence remains suboptimal.

### Correlation between the size of the solid component on thin-section CT and the invasive component on pathology in small lung adenocarcinomas manifesting as ground-glass nodules [^116Zw6g7]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

We aimed to evaluate the correlation between the size of the solid component on thin-section computed tomography (CT) and the invasive component on pathology in small lung adenocarcinomas manifesting as subsolid nodules.

- **Methods**: Fifty-nine subsolid nodules in 58 patients were evaluated. The maximum diameters of subsolid nodules and the solid component on CT were measured by two radiologists in three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) planes using in-house software. In addition, the maximum diameters of the tumor and invasive component were measured on pathology by two pathologists. CT measurements were compared with pathologic measurements.

- **Results**: There was a strong correlation between the size of the solid component on CT and the invasive component on pathology, as well as the size of subsolid nodules and the tumor size (r = 0.82–0.87 for 3D measurement, 0.72–0.88 for 2D measurement; p < 0.0001). The size of subsolid nodules in 3D and 2D measurements was significantly larger than the tumor size (p < 0.0001). In regard to measurement of the solid component, 3D measurements tended to be larger than the size of the invasive component, whereas 2D measurement tended to be similar to the size of the invasive component. By applying a size criterion of a solid component that was 3 mm or lesser in maximum diameter, preinvasive and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma was predicted with a specificity of 100% (28 of 28).

- **Conclusion**: We found a significant correlation between the size of the solid component on thin-section CT and the invasive component on pathology.

### Current readings: Radiologic interpretation of the part-solid nodule: Clinical relevance and novel technologies [^111tPrvz]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Persistent subsolid nodules, whether part-solid or pure ground-glass attenuation, are associated with primary lung adenocarcinoma. This was recently redefined by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer-American Thoracic Society-European Respiratory Society in 2011 to include newly categorized entities such as adenocarcinoma in situ, minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, and lepidic-predominant adenocarcinoma. Awareness of the relationship between subsolid nodules and adenocarcinoma has emerged in the era of high-resolution multidetector computed tomography (CT).

This article highlights the role of noninvasive CT in evaluating subsolid nodules, with an emphasis on the potential for quantitative measures to predict adenocarcinoma subtypes and their longitudinal behavior. Of particular importance is the knowledge that an increase in solid components on CT indicates progression. Continued experience in evaluating quantitative measures, in combination with morphologic features such as margin contour, internal architecture, and nodule size, will further aid in guiding crucial decisions pertaining to the use of CT surveillance versus more invasive approaches like biopsy and surgical resection.

### Evaluation of individuals with pulmonary nodules: When is it lung cancer? Diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116up4tD]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to update previous evidence-based recommendations for the evaluation and management of individuals with solid pulmonary nodules and to generate new recommendations for those with nonsolid nodules.

- **Methods**: We updated prior literature reviews, synthesized evidence, and formulated recommendations by using the methods described in the "Methodology for Development of Guidelines for Lung Cancer" in the American College of Chest Physicians Lung Cancer Guidelines, 3rd ed.

- **Results**: We formulated recommendations for evaluating solid pulmonary nodules that measure > 8 mm in diameter, solid nodules that measure ≤ 8 mm in diameter, and subsolid nodules. The recommendations stress the value of assessing the probability of malignancy, the utility of imaging tests, the need to weigh the benefits and harms of different management strategies (nonsurgical biopsy, surgical resection, and surveillance with chest CT imaging), and the importance of eliciting patient preferences.

- **Conclusions**: Individuals with pulmonary nodules should be evaluated and managed by estimating the probability of malignancy, performing imaging tests to better characterize the lesions, evaluating the risks associated with various management alternatives, and eliciting their preferences for management.

### Executive summary: Diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^115QV7Wn]. Chest (2013). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for pulmonary nodules, specifically in relation to follow-up imaging of solid nodules, the ACCP 2013 guidelines recommend deciding on the frequency and duration of CT surveillance based on the size of the nodule in patients with a solid nodule ≤ 8 mm in diameter and no risk factors for lung cancer:

- **Situation: ≤ 4 mm**: Do not monitor but inform the patient about the potential benefits and harms of this approach.

- **Situation: > 4 mm to 6 mm**: Reevaluate nodules at 12 months without the need for additional follow-up if unchanged.

- **Situation: > 6 mm to 8 mm**: Monitor nodules sometime between 6 and 12 months and then again between 18 and 24 months if unchanged.

### ACR lung-RADS v2022: Assessment categories and management recommendations [^111Mxoqa]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). High credibility.

The ACR created the Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) in 2014 to standardize the reporting and management of screen-detected pulmonary nodules. Lung-RADS was updated to version 1.1 in 2019 and revised size thresholds for nonsolid nodules, added classification criteria for perifissural nodules, and allowed for short-interval follow-up of rapidly enlarging nodules that may be infectious in etiology. Lung-RADS v2022, released in November 2022, provides several updates including guidance on the classification and management of atypical pulmonary cysts, juxtapleural nodules, airway-centered nodules, and potentially infectious findings. This new release also provides clarification for determining nodule growth and introduces stepped management for nodules that are stable or decreasing in size. This article summarizes the evidence and expert consensus supporting Lung-RADS v2022.

### Stage at diagnosis following delay to interval scans for indeterminate nodules in lung cancer screening: An observational study examining the outcomes of CHEST expert panel recommendations [^115J3BiT]. Chest (2024). Low credibility.

The proportion of cancers diagnosed at stage > I remained stable when nodule follow-up CT scans were performed between 3 and 6 months, but it rose when nodule follow-up CT scans were delayed beyond 6 months (≥ 181 days; relative risk, 3.69; 95% CI, 1.32–10.30; p = 0.056). Fisher exact test indicated no significant difference in the proportion of lung cancers diagnosed at stage > 1A1 after nodule follow-up CT scans performed between 88–120 days and 121 to 150 days (relative risk, 0.91; p = 0.609), at 151–180 days (relative risk, 0.95; p = 0.643), or 181–365 days (relative risk, 0.95; p = 0.499).

The number of participants for whom nodule follow-up CT scans were performed at ≥ 181 days was small; hence, the number of cancer diagnoses was also low (n = 6). Therefore, there were insufficient cases to perform more detailed analyses, such as stratification by initial nodule size or malignancy probability.

To allow extrapolation to screening programs using the Lung-RADS protocol for the management of findings, we analyzed our results according to Lung-RADS categories at baseline LDCT. We performed a secondary analysis limited to cancers diagnosed in participants with Lung-RADS categories 4A, 4B, 4X, or indeterminate consolidation (i.e. follow-up CT scan was due at 3 months). We observed no significant difference in stage distribution when nodule follow-up CT scans were performed within the target timeframe (88–120 days) and 121–150 days (relative risk, 0; p = 0.579) and 151–180 days (relative risk, 1.51; p = 0.626), with a trend toward a higher proportion of cancers being diagnosed at later stages.

### Growing small solid nodules in lung cancer screening: Safety and efficacy of a 200 mm minimum size threshold for multidisciplinary team referral [^111QnFsL]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

The positive predictive value (PPV) of a growing nodule that reached a size greater than 200 mm³ being malignant was 65.9% (29/44). This constituted 21 cancers in 36 nodules greater than 200 mm³ at the first interval scan, plus 8 cancers in 8 nodules which grew to greater than 200 mm³ at subsequent scans. The PPV was 60.5% (23/38) on a per-participant basis.

In this study, 53 growing nodules of 200 mm³ or less at 3 months were managed by further surveillance. Of these, eight were diagnosed as lung cancer within 2 years; seven were stage 1, and one was stage 3 with pN2 nodal involvement at surgical resection, not demonstrable on preoperative CT imaging. The false-negative rate of the protocol was therefore 1.9% (95% CI 0.33% to 9.94%).

At the first interval scan, the median volume doubling time (VDT) was shorter in nodules subsequently confirmed to be malignant compared with those where malignancy was ultimately excluded (median 98 days, range 42–389, vs. median 202 days, range 27–440). At the first interval scan, a nodule management protocol based on evidence of growth alone would have resulted in all 87 participants being referred for definitive assessment; a combination of growth and minimum volume threshold reduced this by 62% to 33/87.

Example images are shown in Figure 4. Panel A illustrates a growing nodule subsequently diagnosed as lung cancer: (A) Baseline scan, volume 42 mm³; (B) 3 months, volume 92 mm³, PVC +117%, VDT 98 days; (C) 6-month scan (performed at 8 months), volume 246 mm³, PVC +168%, VDT 109 days.

### Persisting new nodules in incidence rounds of the NELSON CT lung cancer screening study [^116oNDB6]. Thorax (2019). Low credibility.

The US guidelines recommend low-dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer screening for high-risk individuals. New solid nodules after baseline screening are common and have a high lung cancer probability. Currently, no evidence exists concerning the risk stratification of non-resolving new solid nodules at first LDCT screening after initial detection.

- **Methods**: In the Dutch-Belgian Randomized Lung Cancer Screening (NELSON) trial, 7,295 participants underwent the second and 6,922 participants the third screening round. We included participants with solid nodules that were registered as new or < 15mm³ (study detection limit) at previous screens and received additional screening after initial detection, thereby excluding high-risk nodules according to the NELSON management protocol (nodules ≥ 500mm³).

- **Results**: Overall, 680 participants with 1,020 low-risk and intermediate-risk new solid nodules were included. A total of 562 (55%) new solid nodules were resolving, leaving 356 (52%) participants with a non-resolving new solid nodule, of whom 25 (7%) were diagnosed with lung cancer. At first screening after initial detection, volume doubling time (VDT), volume, and VDT combined with a predefined ≥ 200mm³ volume cut-off had high discrimination for lung cancer (VDT, area under the curve (AUC): 0.913; volume, AUC: 0.875; VDT and ≥ 200mm³ combination, AUC: 0.939). Classifying a new solid nodule with either ≤ 590 days VDT or ≥ 200mm³ volume positive provided 100% sensitivity, 84% specificity, and 27% positive predictive value for lung cancer.

- **Conclusions**: More than half of new low-risk and intermediate-risk nodules were resolving, yet a significant proportion of non-resolving nodules were associated with lung cancer. The study provides evidence for using VDT and volume as discriminators for risk stratification in LDCT lung cancer screening.

### Stage at diagnosis following delay to interval scans for indeterminate nodules in lung cancer screening: An observational study examining the outcomes of CHEST expert panel recommendations [^111KUsJc]. Chest (2024). Low credibility.

Our findings should not be interpreted as providing the "optimal" time to perform surveillance scans. There is a discrepancy between LungRADS, which recommends a 3-month follow-up for higher risk nodules and a 6-month follow-up for lower risk nodules, and the BTS and European position statements for lung cancer screening guidelines, which recommend a repeat LDCT at 3 months. Determining the optimal nodule follow-up CT scan interval must consider the risk of stage shift while ensuring enough time for true growth to be observed and for feasibility for participants and screening programs.

Our comparative analysis is limited by the fact that we performed the vast majority of nodule follow-up CT scans within 6 months; therefore, only a small number of participants were scanned after an interval of more than 180 days. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the 2,001 individuals and 87 cancers included in this analysis are comparable with other entire screening cohorts. A further limitation is that this is observational data. Finally, although LungRADS categories were available for secondary analysis, our nodule management protocol used BTS guidelines.

In conclusion, in a cohort of 2,001 participants who underwent NFU CT for indeterminate nodules identified at baseline LDCT, we observed no difference in the risk of lung cancer diagnosis at stage > 1 when nodule follow-up CT scans were delayed from 3–6 months. However, we observed a higher proportion of cancers diagnosed at stage II or above when scans were delayed beyond 6 months. This finding provides support to the guidelines proposed by the authorities.

### Performance of volume and diameter thresholds in malignancy prediction of solid nodules in lung cancer screening [^116nn2NG]. Thorax (2025). Low credibility.

Effective lung cancer screening (LCS) with low-dose CT (LDCT) requires the ability to distinguish between pulmonary nodules that are sufficiently suspicious for malignancy to warrant referral for definitive investigation, those of intermediate risk requiring further surveillance, and those of sufficiently low risk to disregard. Several models have been developed and validated for predicting malignancy of a nodule seen on a single or baseline LDCT, only some of which have been developed from LCS data. Size is the dominant factor in these models and is thus the key discriminator in guiding management at baseline LDCT in LCS programs. Guidelines have been developed for both screen-detected and incidentally detected nodules, which propose size thresholds below which no further surveillance is required, and also size and risk thresholds above which further investigation (e.g. with positron emission tomography CT, PET-CT) should be performed.

There remains discordance between guidelines for the preferred measurement method, size thresholds, and the point at which predicted malignancy risk is incorporated into management decisions. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) nodule management guidelines (2015), using evidence largely from LCS data, recommend volumetry as the primary sizing method, with a < 80 mm³ 'rule out' threshold (< 5 mm maximum diameter where reliable volumetric analysis cannot be obtained) for solid nodules at baseline LDCT, and is used by the targeted lung health check (TLHC) program in England. Lung-RADS (reporting and data systems) (V.2022) is used in screening programs in the US.

### Low-dose computed tomography lung cancer screening: Clinical evidence and implementation research [^116C7oKY]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The nodule type has been shown to be consequential to the risk of malignancy. Nodules can be classified into calcified and noncalcified, with the latter further classified into solid and subsolid (part-solid and pure ground-glass). Solid nodules are most prevalent in lung cancer screening. However, subsolid nodules are associated with a higher malignancy risk, albeit they are usually detected at a premalignant or early stage. Furthermore, a nodule's risk of malignancy can also be related to other distinguishing characteristics, such as location and attachment.

For example, in the NELSON trial, 82.2% of adenocarcinomas were detected in the periphery (outer one-third of the hilar-costal diameter) of the lungs and were attached to the pleura, compared to 17.8% detected in the middle or centrally (inner two-thirds of the hilar-costal diameter). Additionally, 45.0% of all lung cancers were situated in the right upper lobe. These results affirm the suggestion that nodule management should be decided on an independent nodule-to-nodule basis.

Computed tomography (CT) images of solid and subsolid nodules can be seen in Fig. 2.

- **Figure 2**
- **(a) Mixed ground-glass malignant (invasive adenocarcinoma) nodule**: Peripherally situated in the left upper lobe, measuring 25 mm maximum diameter.
- **(b) Mixed ground-glass malignant (invasive adenocarcinoma) nodule**: Situated peripherally in the left upper lobe, measuring 14 mm maximum diameter.
- **(c) Solid benign nodule**: Situated peripherally in the left lower lobe, measuring 248 mm.

### Pulmonary nodules: Common questions and answers [^111RnwGJ]. American Family Physician (2023). Low credibility.

Pulmonary nodules are often discovered incidentally on chest imaging or during dedicated lung cancer screening. Screening adults aged 50 to 80 years who have a 20-pack-year smoking history, and who currently smoke or have quit smoking within the past 15 years, with low-dose computed tomography, is associated with a decrease in cancer-associated mortality. Once a nodule is detected, specific radiographic and clinical features can be used in validated risk stratification models to assess the probability of malignancy and guide management. Solid pulmonary nodules less than 6 mm warrant surveillance imaging in patients at high risk, and nodules between 6 and 8 mm should be reassessed within 12 months. The recommended interval varies by the risk of malignancy and allows for patient-physician decision-making. A functional assessment with positron emission tomography/computed tomography, nonsurgical biopsy, and resection should be considered for solid nodules 8 mm or greater that have a high risk of malignancy. Subsolid nodules have a higher risk of cancer and should be followed with surveillance imaging for a longer duration. Direct physician-patient communication, clinical decision support within electronic health records, and guideline-based management algorithms included in radiology reports are associated with increased compliance with existing guidelines.

### Resource use and guideline concordance in evaluation of pulmonary nodules for cancer: Too much and too little care [^117QReFL]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Pulmonary nodules are common, and more will be found with the implementation of lung cancer screening. How potentially malignant pulmonary nodules are evaluated may affect patient outcomes, healthcare costs, and the effectiveness of lung cancer screening programs. Guidelines for evaluating pulmonary nodules for cancer exist, but little is known about how nodules are evaluated in the usual care setting.

- **Objective**: To characterize nodule evaluation and concordance with guidelines.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, including a detailed review of medical records from pulmonary nodule detection through evaluation completion, cancer diagnosis, or the study's end (December 31, 2012). The participants included 300 adults with pulmonary nodules from 15 Veterans Affairs hospitals.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Resources used for evaluation at any Veterans Affairs facility and guideline-concordant evaluation served as the main outcomes.

- **Results**: Twenty-seven of 300 patients (9.0%) with pulmonary nodules ultimately received a diagnosis of lung cancer: 1 of 57 (1.8%) with a nodule of 4 mm or less, 4 of 134 (3.0%) with a nodule of 5 to 8 mm, and 22 of 109 (20.2%) with a nodule larger than 8 mm. Nodule evaluation entailed 1,044 imaging studies, 147 consultations, 76 biopsies, 13 resections, and 21 hospitalizations. Radiographic surveillance (n = 277) lasted a median of 13 months but ranged from less than 0.5 months to 8.5 years. Forty-six patients underwent invasive procedures (range per patient, 1–4): 41.3% (19 patients) did not have cancer.

### Characteristics of new solid nodules detected in incidence screening rounds of low-dose CT lung cancer screening: The NELSON study [^113uGa46]. Thorax (2018). High credibility.

New nodules after baseline are regularly found in low-dose CT lung cancer screening and have a high lung cancer probability. It is unknown whether morphological and location characteristics can improve new nodule risk stratification by size.

- **Methods**: Solid non-calcified nodules detected during incidence screening rounds of the randomized controlled Dutch-Belgian lung cancer screening (NELSON) trial and registered as new or previously below detection limit (15 mm³) were included. A multivariate logistic regression analysis with lung cancer as outcome was performed, including previously established volume cut-offs (< 30 mm³, 30- < 200 mm³, and ≥ 200 mm³) and nodule characteristics (location, distribution, shape, margin, and visibility < 15 mm³ in retrospect).

- **Results**: Overall, 1,280 new nodules were included with 73 (6%) being lung cancer. Of nodules ≥ 30 mm³ at detection and visible < 15 mm³ in retrospect, 22% (6/27) were lung cancer. Discrimination based on volume cut-offs (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC): 0.80, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.84) and continuous volume (AUC: 0.82, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.87) was similar. After adjustment for volume cut-offs, only location in the right upper lobe (OR 2.0, P = 0.012), central distribution (OR 2.4, P = 0.001), and visibility < 15 mm³ in retrospect (OR 4.7, P = 0.003) remained significant predictors for lung cancer. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test (P = 0.75) and assessment of bootstrap calibration curves indicated adequate model fit. Discrimination based on the continuous model probability (AUC: 0.85, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.89) was superior.

### Detection and quantification of the solid component in pulmonary subsolid nodules by semiautomatic segmentation [^114ubfD3]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

To determine whether semiautomatic volumetric software can differentiate part-solid from nonsolid pulmonary nodules and aid quantification of the solid component, 115 nodules were differentiated into nonsolid and part-solid by two radiologists; disagreements were adjudicated by a third radiologist. The diameters of solid components were measured manually. Semiautomatic volumetric measurements were used to identify and quantify a possible solid component, using different Hounsfield unit (HU) thresholds. The measurements were compared with the reference standard and manual measurements.

The reference standard detected a solid component in 86 nodules. Diagnosis of a solid component by semiautomatic software depended on the threshold chosen. A threshold of -300 HU resulted in the detection of a solid component in 75 nodules with good sensitivity (90%) and specificity (88%). At a threshold of -130 HU, semiautomatic measurements of the diameter of the solid component (mean 2.4 mm, SD 2.7 mm) were comparable to manual measurements at the mediastinal window setting (mean 2.3 mm, SD 2.5 mm [p = 0.63]).

Semiautomatic segmentation of subsolid nodules could diagnose part-solid nodules and quantify the solid component similar to human observers. Performance depends on the attenuation segmentation thresholds. This method may prove useful in managing subsolid nodules.

- **Key points**: Semiautomatic segmentation can accurately differentiate nonsolid from part-solid pulmonary nodules.

### Growing small solid nodules in lung cancer screening: Safety and efficacy of a 200 mm minimum size threshold for multidisciplinary team referral [^116kR23Q]. Thorax (2023). High credibility.

Indeterminate pulmonary nodules are common in lung cancer screening, with only a small proportion ultimately confirmed as malignant. On baseline scans, malignancy risk and nodule management in solid nodules are primarily driven by size, whereas at follow-up CT scans, growth indicates an elevated risk of malignancy. The question of how to optimally manage growing solid nodules, which remain below a size threshold for subsequent investigations, is an area of uncertainty.

In Lung-RADS 1.1, participants with growing nodules that remain under 8 mm are recommended for either CT surveillance or positron-emission tomography (PET)/CT scanning. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines and the European Position Statement stipulate that all nodules initially between 80 or 100 mm³ (respectively) and 300 mm³ (or ≥ 5 to < 10 mm in diameter when volumetry is not possible) which subsequently demonstrate growth with volume doubling time (VDT) under 400 days are referred for further definitive management, regardless of size.

The SUMMIT study (NCT03934866) is an observational study in high-risk participants using low-dose CT (LDCT) screening in London. The nodule management protocol used in SUMMIT is based on the BTS guidelines but includes a specific threshold volume of 200 mm³ before referral for growing solid nodules to the multidisciplinary team (MDT) for further investigation is advised. The rationale for this was twofold: first, data from the NELSON study found that the development of new solid pulmonary nodules was associated with a higher cancer risk, but only above a threshold volume.

### Pulmonary nodules and CT screening: The past, present and future [^112gVXSA]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

The management of pulmonary nodules through low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has been an ongoing area of study. Recent research has clarified the CT features of nodules and the growth rates that help in distinguishing benign from malignant diagnoses. Several predictive models, which consider clinical and demographic factors alongside CT and positron emission tomography (PET) features of nodules, have been proposed and validated. These models enable the quantification of malignancy risk for specific nodules, allowing for a more conservative approach through CT surveillance and reserving invasive procedures for high-risk nodules.

In response to the issue of small CT-detected nodules, the Fleischner Society published a management algorithm in 2005. This strategy advocated for the follow-up of all small nodules in high-risk individuals, primarily smokers or former smokers. Recent guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) align closely with the Fleischner guidelines, showing minimal changes in follow-up recommendations. The Fleischner Society has addressed the management of subsolid nodules by releasing further statements. For individuals at high risk according to the US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) criteria, the Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) was specifically developed.

However, evidence indicates that the implementation of ACCP guidelines in the United States has been suboptimal. Furthermore, the performance of Lung-RADS may not be as accurate as approaches using the Brock University model.

### Follow-up of incidental pulmonary nodules and the radiology report [^113jdu4x]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Incidental pulmonary nodules that require follow-up are often noted on chest CT. Evidence-based guidelines regarding appropriate follow-up have been published, but the rate of adherence to guideline recommendations is unknown. Furthermore, it is unknown whether the radiology report affects the nodule follow-up rate.

- **Methods**: A review of 1,000 CT pulmonary angiographic studies ordered in the emergency department was performed to determine the presence of an incidental pulmonary nodule. Fleischner Society guidelines were applied to ascertain if follow-up was recommended. Radiology reports were classified on the basis of whether nodules were listed in the findings section only, noted in the impression section, or had explicit recommendations for follow-up. Whether the rate of nodule follow-up was affected by the radiology report was determined according to these three groups.

- **Results**: Incidental pulmonary nodules that required follow-up were noted on 9.9% (95% confidence interval, 8%-12%) of CT pulmonary angiographic studies. Follow-up for nodules was poor overall (29% [28 of 96]; 95% confidence interval, 20%-38%) and decreased significantly when the nodules were mentioned in the findings section only (0% [0 of 12]). Specific instructions to follow up nodules in radiology reports still resulted in a low follow-up rate of 29% (19 of 65; 95% confidence interval, 18%-40%).

- **Conclusions**: Incidental pulmonary nodules detected on CT pulmonary angiography are common and are frequently not followed up appropriately.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® incidentally detected indeterminate pulmonary nodule [^114WFeX1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Incidental pulmonary nodules are common. Although the majority are benign, most are indeterminate for malignancy when first encountered, making their management challenging. CT remains the primary imaging modality to first characterize and follow up on incidental lung nodules. This document reviews available literature on various imaging modalities and summarizes the management of indeterminate pulmonary nodules detected incidentally.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodological principles, such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In instances where peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may serve as the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### British thoracic society guidelines for the investigation and management of pulmonary nodules [^112Eyp6m]. Thorax (2015). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for pulmonary nodules, particularly in patients with a previous malignancy, the BTS 2015 guidelines recommend considering monitoring nodules below the threshold of < 5 mm maximum diameter or < 80 mm³ volume. This applies to patients with a history of previous or active cancer, based on clinical judgment.

### Projected outcomes using different nodule sizes to define a positive CT lung cancer screening examination [^115fecBR]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2014). Low credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) screening for lung cancer has been associated with a high frequency of false positive results due to the high prevalence of indeterminate but usually benign small pulmonary nodules. The acceptability of reducing false-positive rates and diagnostic evaluations by increasing the nodule size threshold for a positive screen depends on the projected balance between benefits and risks.

- **Methods**: We examined data from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) to estimate screening CT performance and outcomes for scans with nodules above the 4mm NLST threshold used to classify a CT screen as positive. Outcomes assessed included screening results, subsequent diagnostic tests performed, lung cancer histology and stage distribution, and lung cancer mortality. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated for the different nodule size thresholds. All statistical tests were two-sided.

- **Results**: In 64% of positive screens (11,598/18,141), the largest nodule was 7 mm or less in greatest transverse diameter. By increasing the threshold, the percentages of lung cancer diagnoses that would have been missed or delayed and false positives that would have been avoided progressively increased, for example, from 1.0% and 15.8% at a 5 mm threshold to 10.5% and 65.8% at an 8 mm threshold, respectively. The projected reductions in postscreening follow-up CT scans and invasive procedures also increased as the threshold was raised. Differences across nodule sizes for lung cancer histology and stage distribution were noted.

### Improved interobserver agreement on nodule type and Lung-RADS classification of subsolid nodules using computer-aided solid component measurement [^1121fBsh]. European Journal of Radiology (2022). High credibility.

The Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) classification of subsolid nodules (SSNs) can be challenging due to limited interobserver agreement in determining the type and size of the nodule. Our study aimed to assess the effect of a computer-aided method on the interobserver agreement of Lung-RADS classification for SSNs.

This study consisted of 156 SSNs in 121 patients who underwent initial CT screening for lung cancer. Three independent readers determined the nodule type and measured the size of the entire nodule as well as the solid component, first without and then assisted by a semi-automated computer-aided tool. They assigned to each nodule the corresponding Lung-RADS 1.1 category.

- **Agreement in size measurements**: Assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman indexes.
- **Agreement in nodule type and Lung-RADS**: Determined using Fleiss kappa statistics.
- **Relationship**: Evaluated between final diagnosis of the nodules and Lung-RADS classifications.

Among the 156 nodules, manual size measurement reached an ICC of 0.994, and 48 nodules contained solid components measured by all three readers both manually and semi-automatically. ICCs for the solid component measurement were 0.952, 0.997, and 0.996 for manual diameter, semi-automated diameter, and volume measurement, respectively. Bias and 95% limits of agreement for average diameter of solid component were smaller with semi-automated measurements than with manual measurements. Kappa values of semi-automated assessment for…

### Fleischner Society guideline recommendations for incidentally detected pulmonary nodules and the probability of lung cancer [^112byS1Y]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

The Fleischner Society aims to limit further evaluations of incidentally detected pulmonary nodules when the probability of lung cancer is less than 1% and to pursue further evaluations when the probability of lung cancer is 1% or greater. To evaluate the internal consistency of guideline goals and recommendations, the authors assessed stratum-specific recommendations and 2-year probabilities of lung cancer.

A retrospective cohort study from 2005 to 2015 was conducted involving individuals enrolled in one of two integrated health systems with solid nodules incidentally detected on CT. The 2017 Fleischner Society guidelines were used to define strata based on smoking status and nodule size and number. Lung cancer diagnoses within 2 years of nodule detection were identified using cancer registry data. Confidence interval (CI) inspections were used to determine if stratum-specific probabilities of lung cancer differed from 1%.

Among 5,444 individuals with incidentally detected lung nodules (median age, 66 years; 54% women; 57% smoked; median nodule size, 5.5 mm; 55% with multiple nodules), 214 (3.9%; 95% CI, 3.4%-4.5%) were diagnosed with lung cancer within 2 years. For 7 out of 12 strata (58%), covering 2,765 patients (51%) and 194 lung cancer cases (91%), there was alignment between Fleischner Society goals and recommendations. Alignment was indeterminate for 5 strata (42%), encompassing 2,679 patients (49%) and 20 lung cancer cases (9%), because the CIs for the probability of lung cancer spanned 1%.

The conclusion is that Fleischner Society guideline goals and recommendations align in at least half the teir examined.

### Evaluating the patient with a pulmonary nodule: A review [^112fLWzu]. JAMA (2022). Low credibility.

- **Importance**: Pulmonary nodules are identified in approximately 1.6 million patients per year in the US and are detected on approximately 30% of computed tomographic (CT) images of the chest. Optimal treatment of an individual with a pulmonary nodule can lead to early detection of cancer while minimizing testing for a benign nodule.

- **Observations**: At least 95% of all pulmonary nodules identified are benign, most often granulomas or intrapulmonary lymph nodes. Smaller nodules are more likely to be benign. Pulmonary nodules are categorized as small solid (< 8 mm), larger solid (≥ 8 mm), and subsolid. Subsolid nodules are divided into ground-glass nodules (no solid component) and part-solid (both ground-glass and solid components). The probability of malignancy is less than 1% for all nodules smaller than 6 mm and 1% to 2% for nodules 6 mm to 8 mm. Nodules that are 6 mm to 8 mm can be followed with a repeat chest CT in 6 to 12 months, depending on the presence of patient risk factors and imaging characteristics associated with lung malignancy, clinical judgment about the probability of malignancy, and patient preferences. The treatment of an individual with a solid pulmonary nodule 8 mm or larger is based on the estimated probability of malignancy; the presence of patient comorbidities, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease; and patient preferences. Management options include surveillance imaging, defined as monitoring for nodule growth with chest CT imaging; positron emission tomography-CT imaging; and nonsurgical biopsy with bronchoscopy or transthoracic needle aspiration.

### Defining growth in small pulmonary nodules using volumetry: Results from a "coffee-break" CT study and implications for current nodule management guidelines [^117RPx7u]. European Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

Lung nodule growth is defined as an increase in nodule diameter or volume on sequential computed tomography (CT) scans and is a powerful predictor of lung malignancy. Measuring nodule growth can be performed using electronic calipers or semi-automated tools. However, establishing that true nodule growth has occurred can be challenging in cases where the increase in nodule size is small, due to the inherent limitations of measurement tools. For this reason, many clinical practice guidelines stipulate that a minimum increase in nodule size must be achieved before nodule growth can be determined. For example, the Fleischner Society guidelines stipulate that a threshold of 2 mm diameter growth should be used to define true nodule growth. By contrast, the British Thoracic Society (BTS) nodule management guidelines stipulate a 25% increase in nodule volume to determine growth, a threshold also used in the Nederlands–Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek (NELSON) lung cancer screening trial.

The threshold of a 25% increase in volume to determine true nodule growth in the BTS guidelines and NELSON nodule management protocol was based on a number of in vivo "coffee break" studies, in which individuals were scanned twice on the same day, demonstrating up to 25% variability in nodule volumes. This variability has been attributed to slight differences in nodule segmentation, including for nodules which are irregular in shape, or attached to pleural surfaces or vessels, and to patient factors, such as the level of patient inspiration or pulsation of the heart.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for pulmonary nodules, specifically concerning follow-up imaging, the British Thoracic Society 2015 guidelines recommend considering discharging or obtaining ongoing CT surveillance for patients with nodules that have a volume doubling time of over 600 days. This consideration should take into account patient preference and clinical factors, such as fitness and age.

### Computerized tomography screening for lung cancer: new findings and diagnostic work-up [^117ChPbh]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

On computerized tomography (CT) screening for lung cancer within the Early Lung Cancer Action Project, both at baseline and repeat screening, we found not only solid but also subsolid nodules, which, unlike solid ones, do not completely obscure the lung parenchyma. We established that subsolid nodules represent approximately 20% of the nodules shown on screening and that they have a higher frequency of malignancy than solid nodules. Although we found the growth of solid nodules to be a reliable indicator of malignancy, growth of subsolid nodules was more difficult to assess.

On review of our results at the time of writing in screening, we have continued to refine our definition of a positive result of screening from that given in our initial publication on screening. We have also provided an updated screening regimen. It starts with the initial, low-dose CT test and, for all those with positive results on this initial test, the regimen continues by specifying the work-up needed to rule-in a diagnosis of malignancy. In this regimen, we found growth assessed by high-resolution CT to be a useful indicator of malignancy and have developed image-processing tools to help in this assessment. Once growth is ascertained, we recommend fine-needle aspiration for confirmation of malignancy. It may be that once criteria for definitive growth are established and validated, fine-needle aspiration may become optional. However, in the meantime, in the context of screening, a more cautious approach is warranted.

### Clinical and non-contrast computed tomography characteristics and disease development in patients with benign pulmonary subsolid nodules with a solid component ≤ 5 mm [^112wVnNK]. Insights into Imaging (2024). Low credibility.

To evaluate the clinical and non-contrast computed tomography (CT) features of patients with benign pulmonary subsolid nodules (SSNs) with a solid component ≤ 5 mm and their development trends via follow-up CT.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively collected data from 436 patients who had SSNs with a solid component ≤ 5 mm, including 69 with absorbable benign SSNs (AB-SSNs), 70 with nonabsorbable benign SSNs (NB-SSNs), and 297 with malignant SSNs (M-SSNs). Models 1, 2, and 3 for distinguishing the different types of SSNs were then developed and validated.

- **Results**: Patients with AB-SSNs were younger and exhibited respiratory symptoms more frequently than those with M-SSNs. The frequency of nodules detected during follow-up CT was in the following order: AB-SSNs > NB-SSNs > M-SSNs. NB-SSNs were smaller than M-SSNs, and ill-defined margins were more frequent in AB-SSNs than in NB-SSNs and M-SSNs. Benign SSNs exhibited irregular shape, target sign, and lower CT values more frequently compared to M-SSNs, whereas the latter demonstrated bubble lucency more commonly. Furthermore, AB-SSNs showed more thickened interlobular septa and satellite lesions than M-SSNs, while M-SSNs had more pleural retraction than AB-SSNs (all p < 0.017). The three models had AUCs ranging 0.748–0.920 and 0.790–0.912 in the training and external validation cohorts, respectively. A follow-up CT showed nodule progression in four benign SSNs.

- **Conclusions**: The three SSN types have different clinical and imaging characteristics, with some benign SSNs progressing to resemble malignancy.

### Spectrum of early lung cancer presentation in low-dose screening CT: a pictorial review [^114y6nrM]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

A pulmonary nodule is defined as solid when it completely obscures the entire lung parenchyma within it. Non-solid nodules, or pure ground-glass nodules (pGGN), are defined as focal nodular areas of increased attenuation through which lung parenchymal structures, such as the pulmonary vessels or airway structures, can be visualized. Part-solid nodules are those having both ground-glass and solid components.

Lung nodule attenuation is, therefore, a key feature in lung cancer screening, with particular emphasis on subsolid nodules. Subsolid nodules are complex lesions both for interpretation and management, and recently the Fleischner Society has published recommendations for their management. Of subsolid nodules, 40–70% resolve spontaneously in 3 months and, upon resolution, are presumed to have been benign. Part-solid nodules that persist at 3-month follow-up should be considered potentially malignant; in the ELCAP study, after adjusting for nodule size, the malignancy rates for part-solid, solid, and pGGN were 63%, 32%, and 13%, respectively.

An increase in pulmonary nodule attenuation at LCDT follow-up, or the development or increment of a solid component within the pulmonary nodule, should raise suspicions of malignancy, even if the nodule size is stable.

### The incidental pulmonary nodule in a child. Part 1: Recommendations from the SPR Thoracic Imaging Committee regarding characterization, significance and follow-up [^114FPpyn]. Pediatric Radiology (2015). High credibility.

No guidelines are in place for the follow-up and management of pulmonary nodules that are incidentally detected on CT in the pediatric population. The Fleischner guidelines, which were developed for the older adult population, do not apply to children. This review summarizes the evidence collected by the Society for Pediatric Radiology (SPR) Thoracic Imaging Committee in its attempt to develop pediatric-specific guidelines.

- **Characterization of small pulmonary opacities**: Small pulmonary opacities can be characterized as linear or as ground-glass or solid nodules. Linear opacities and ground-glass nodules are extremely unlikely to represent an early primary or metastatic malignancy in a child. In our review, we found a virtual absence of reported cases of a primary pulmonary malignancy presenting as an incidentally detected small lung nodule on CT in a healthy immune-competent child.

- **Management considerations**: Due to the lack of definitive information on the clinical significance of small lung nodules that are incidentally detected on CT in children, the management of those that do not have the typical characteristics of an intrapulmonary lymph node should be dictated by the clinical history. Considerations include possible exposure to infectious agents, the presence of an occult immunodeficiency, and the higher likelihood that the nodule represents a metastasis than a primary lung tumor. Ultimately, the individual preference of the child's caregiver should be considered. Nodules appearing in children with a history of immune deficiency, malignancy, or congenital pulmonary airway malformation should not be considered incidental, and their workup should be dictated by the natural history and clinical context.

### Characteristics of subsolid pulmonary nodules showing growth during follow-up with CT scanning [^111koPDi]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

The positive results of a screening CT scan trial are likely to lead to an increase in the use of CT scanning, and, consequently, an increase in the detection of subsolid nodules. Noninvasive methods, including follow-up with CT scanning to determine which nodules require invasive diagnosis and surgical treatment, should be defined promptly.

- **Methods**: Between 2000 and 2008, from our database of 60,000 examinations with CT scanning, we identified 174 subsolid nodules, which showed a ground-glass opacity area greater than 20% of the nodule and measured 2 cm in diameter, in 171 patients. We investigated the clinical characteristics and CT images of the subsolid nodules in relation to changes identified during the follow-up period.

- **Results**: The nodule sizes ranged from 4 mm to 20 mm at the first presentation. Nonsolid nodules numbered 98. During the follow-up period, 18 nodules showed resolution or shrinkage, and 41 showed growth of 2 mm or more in diameter. The time to 2-mm nodule-growth curves, calculated by Kaplan-Meier methods, indicated that the 2-year and 5-year cumulative percentages of growing nodules were 13% and 23% in patients with nonsolid nodules, and 38% and 55% in patients with part-solid nodules, respectively. Multivariate analysis disclosed that a large nodule size (greater than 10 mm) and a history of lung cancer were significant predictive factors of growth in nonsolid nodules.

- **Conclusions**: An effective schedule for follow-up with CT scanning for subsolid nodules should be developed according to the type of subsolid nodule, initial nodule size, and history of lung cancer.

### Executive summary: Diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112YruNE]. Chest (2013). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for pulmonary nodules, specifically in relation to follow-up imaging of solid nodules, the ACCP 2013 guidelines recommend considering surveillance with serial CT in patients with a solid, indeterminate nodule greater than 8 mm in diameter under the following circumstances:

- **Low HU measurement**: The nodule demonstrates very low Hounsfield units (15 HUs) on dynamic contrast CT, resulting in a very low post-test probability of malignancy.

- **Nondiagnostic needle biopsy**: The lesion is not hypermetabolic on PET.

- **Patient preference**: The fully informed patient prefers a non-aggressive management approach.

### Stage at diagnosis following delay to interval scans for indeterminate nodules in lung cancer screening: An observational study examining the outcomes of CHEST expert panel recommendations [^116p22P3]. Chest (2024). High credibility.

In a cohort of 2,001 participants who underwent interval surveillance (due at 3 months) for an indeterminate nodule at baseline LDCT, we found no change in the proportion of participants diagnosed with stage > I lung cancer when nodule follow-up CT scans were delayed from 3 to 6 months. We observed a higher proportion of cancers diagnosed at stage II or above when scans were delayed beyond 6 months, which suggests that delays beyond this time point risk disease progression becoming significant.

Although adherence to recommended follow-up for screen-detected findings is known to be suboptimal, there is little evidence regarding the consequences of such delays. Such research is challenging for two main reasons:

- **Large cohorts required**: Most participants who undergo nodule follow-up CT scan will not have cancer, meaning large screened cohorts are needed to obtain sufficient cancer numbers.
- **Pathological upstaging**: Given that pathologic upstaging at surgery occurs in 17%-38% of cases, it is not possible to determine whether extended delays truly lead to stage shift in individual cases.

A recently published article in a US screening cohort found that clinical upstaging was observed more frequently following delayed nodule follow-up CT scans compared with cancers diagnosed following nodule follow-up CT scans performed at the target time, with a median delay in cases where upstaging occurred of 131 days after the target time.

### Occurrence and lung cancer probability of new solid nodules at incidence screening with low-dose CT: Analysis of data from the randomised, controlled NELSON trial [^116so3HE]. The Lancet Oncology (2016). High credibility.

U.S. guidelines now recommend lung cancer screening with low-dose CT for high-risk individuals. Reports of new nodules after baseline screening have been scarce and inconsistent due to differences in definitions used. The aim of the study was to identify the occurrence of new solid nodules and their probability of being lung cancer at incidence screening rounds in the Dutch-Belgian Randomized Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NELSON).

- **Methods**: In the ongoing, multicentre, randomised controlled NELSON trial conducted between Dec 23, 2003, and July 6, 2006, a total of 15,822 participants were enrolled. These participants had smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day for more than 25 years or ten cigarettes a day for more than 30 years and were either smokers or had quit smoking less than 10 years ago. They were randomly assigned to receive either screening with low-dose CT (n = 7,915) or no screening (n = 7,907). From Jan 28, 2004, to Dec 18, 2006, 7,557 individuals underwent baseline screening with low-dose CT, and 7,295 participants underwent second and third screening rounds. The study included all participants with solid non-calcified nodules, registered by the NELSON radiologists as new or smaller than 15 mm³, which is the study detection limit, at previous screens. Nodule volume was generated semiautomatically by software. The maximum volume doubling time was calculated for nodules with an estimated percentage volume change of 25% or more, representing the minimum growth rate for the time since the previous scan. Lung cancer diagnosis was based on histology, while benignity was determined by histology or stable size for at least 2 years.

### Evaluation of patients with pulmonary nodules: When is it lung cancer? ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition) [^115hCbef]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Pulmonary nodules are spherical radiographic opacities that measure up to 30 mm in diameter. These nodules are extremely common in clinical practice and challenging to manage, especially small "subcentimeter" nodules. Identification of malignant nodules is important because they represent a potentially curable form of lung cancer.

- **Methods**: We developed evidence-based clinical practice guidelines based on a systematic literature review and discussion with a large, multidisciplinary group of clinical experts and other stakeholders.

- **Results**: We generated a list of 29 recommendations for managing the solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) that measures at least 8 to 10 mm in diameter; small, subcentimeter nodules that measure less than 8 mm to 10 mm in diameter; and multiple nodules when they are detected incidentally during evaluation of the SPN. These recommendations stress the value of risk factor assessment, the utility of imaging tests (especially old films), the necessity to weigh the risks and benefits of various management strategies (biopsy, surgery, and observation with serial imaging tests), and the importance of eliciting patient preferences.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with pulmonary nodules should be evaluated by estimating the probability of malignancy, performing imaging tests to better characterize the lesion(s), evaluating the risks associated with various management alternatives, and eliciting patient preferences for treatment.

### Multidisciplinary team-based management of incidentally detected lung nodules [^111UkTmm]. Chest (2020). Low credibility.

Each year, more than 1.5 million Americans are diagnosed with an incidentally detected lung nodule. Practice guidelines attempt to balance the benefit of early detection of lung cancer with the risks of diagnostic testing, but adherence to guidelines is low. The goal of this study was to determine guideline adherence rates in the setting of a multidisciplinary nodule clinic and describe reasons for nonadherence as well as associated outcomes.

- **Methods**: This cohort study included 3 years of follow-up of patients aged ≥ 35 years with an incidentally detected lung nodule evaluated in a multidisciplinary clinic that used the 2005 Fleischner Society Guidelines.

- **Results**: Among 113 patients, 67% (95% CI, 58–76) were recommended a guideline-concordant nodule evaluation; 7.1% (95% CI, 3.1–13) and 26% (95% CI, 18–25) were recommended less or more intense evaluation, respectively. In contrast, 58% (95% CI, 48–67), 22% (95% CI, 18–25), and 23% (95% CI, 16–32) received a guideline-concordant, less intense, or more intense evaluation. The most common reason for recommending guideline-discordant care was concern for two different diagnoses that would each benefit from early detection and treatment. A majority of lung cancer diagnoses (88%) occurred in patients who received guideline-concordant care. There were no lung cancer cases in those who received less intense nodule care.

- **Conclusions**: A multidisciplinary nodule clinic may serve as a system-level intervention to promote guideline-concordant care while also providing a multidisciplinary basis by which to deviate from guidelines.

### An official American Thoracic Society research statement: A research framework for pulmonary nodule evaluation and management [^114RaRa1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Pulmonary nodules are frequently detected during diagnostic chest imaging and as a result of lung cancer screening. Guidelines for their evaluation are largely based on low-quality evidence, and patients and clinicians could benefit from more research in this area.

- **Methods**: In this research statement from the American Thoracic Society, a multidisciplinary group of clinicians, researchers, and patient advocates reviewed available evidence for pulmonary nodule evaluation. They characterized six focus areas to direct future research efforts and identified fundamental gaps in knowledge along with strategies to address them. Formal mechanisms were not used to prioritize one research area over another or to achieve consensus.

- **Results**: There was widespread agreement that novel tests (including novel imaging tests, biopsy techniques, biomarkers, and prognostic models) may improve diagnostic accuracy for identifying cancerous nodules. However, better evidence is needed to show that they improve more distal outcomes of importance to patients before they are used in clinical practice. Additionally, the pace of research and the quality of clinical care would be improved by the development of registries linking demographic and nodule characteristics with patient-level outcomes. Methods to share data from registries are also necessary.

- **Conclusions**: This statement may help researchers develop impactful and innovative research projects and enable funders to better judge research proposals. We hope that it will accelerate the pace and increase the efficiency of discovery.

### Solid tumor size on high-resolution computed tomography and maximum standardized uptake on positron emission tomography for new clinical T descriptors with T1 lung adenocarcinoma [^115MEhTm]. Annals of Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

To better describe clinical T descriptors using solid tumor size (the maximum dimension of the solid component of the tumor) on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) on F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT (FDG-PET/CT), we examined 610 consecutive patients with clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma who underwent complete resection. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was assessed based on whole tumor size (maximum dimension of the tumor), solid tumor size, or a combination of solid tumor size and SUVmax.

- **Patients and methods**: RFS based on whole tumor size was not significantly different between patients with tumors measuring ≤ 2 cm and 2–3 cm (P = 0.089), whereas RFS based on solid tumor size was significantly different (P < 0.0001).

- **Results**: RFS was significantly different among defined groups: group 1 (solid tumor size ≤ 2 cm, SUVmax ≤ 1.8) versus group 2 (solid tumor size ≤ 2 cm, SUVmax > 1.8), and group 3 (solid tumor size 2–3 cm, SUVmax ≤ 3.6) versus group 4 (solid tumor size 2–3 cm, SUVmax > 3.6). Groups 2 and 3 were combined due to similar RFS. Significant differences in RFS were found: group 1 versus groups 2 + 3, P < 0.0001; groups 2 + 3 versus group 4, P = 0.019.

- **Conclusions**: Both solid tumor size on HRCT and SUVmax on FDG-PET/CT reflect prognosis well in patients with clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma and may support new clinical T descriptors.
