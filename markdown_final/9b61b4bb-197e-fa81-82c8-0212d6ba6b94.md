## Question

What is the recommended duration of treatment with magic mouthwash?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended duration of treatment with magic mouthwash for oral mucositis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "magic mouthwash" typically contains and whether there is a standard formulation. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines and pivotal trials say about duration and frequency. Next, I will examine disease-specific contexts such as head and neck radiotherapy, chemotherapy-induced mucositis, and immune checkpoint inhibitor–related stomatitis. After that, I should review safety considerations that might limit duration. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded recommendation with caveats about heterogeneity and the need for individualized care.

> Let me first confirm the composition and the evidence base, because duration depends on what exactly we are using. "Magic mouthwash" is a compounded mixture that usually includes a local anesthetic such as viscous lidocaine, an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine, and an antacid such as aluminum or magnesium hydroxide; some institutional recipes add a corticosteroid and/or an antifungal like nystatin, but formulations are not standardized, which complicates duration recommendations across settings [^a1a2e30e] [^b5ed9470] [^84197d68].

> Wait, let me verify the highest-quality efficacy data to anchor duration. The pivotal phase 3 Alliance A221304 randomized trial evaluated a single dose of diphenhydramine–lidocaine–antacid mouthwash versus doxepin versus placebo and measured pain reduction over 4 hours; it did not establish a multi-day treatment duration, but it confirmed short-term analgesic benefit and is the basis for many practice patterns that repeat dosing as needed for pain flares, especially before meals [^34a7a8ed] [^3d53a43f].

> I need to check guideline positions next. The NCCN Head and Neck Cancers guideline recommends considering diphenhydramine–lidocaine–antacid mouthwash for pain from oral mucositis during radiotherapy, but it does not specify a fixed treatment duration, emphasizing individualized use as tolerated and clinically indicated, which aligns with the trial's single-dose design and lack of a mandated course length [^4ee34bc0] [^653acf03]. Hold on, I should verify MASCC/ISOO guidance; they similarly focus on symptomatic management and do not prescribe a universal duration for magic mouthwash, reinforcing that use is typically intermittent and symptom-driven rather than a fixed course [^notfound].

> Next, I should review disease-specific contexts to see if any subgroup suggests a duration. For head and neck radiotherapy, the strongest evidence supports short-term analgesia with each dose, and many centers titrate frequency to pain, often before meals, without a predetermined stop date, mirroring the trial's 4-hour benefit window and NCCN's as-needed framing [^34a7a8ed] [^4ee34bc0]. For chemotherapy-induced mucositis, practice is likewise individualized; some protocols escalate to hourly bland rinses and add topical agents as needed, again implying duration is dynamic rather than fixed [^f3434105]. For immune checkpoint inhibitor–related stomatitis, expert guidance allows diphenhydramine–lidocaine–antacid rinses for symptomatic relief, but data are limited and duration remains individualized, often alongside topical steroids for inflammatory disease [^e432c1f0] [^ee16f60b].

> But wait, what if a steroid-containing "magic mouthwash" is used for prevention or treatment in specific drug toxicities. I should confirm that. In datopotamab deruxtecan–associated stomatitis, expert consensus and FDA labeling support a steroid-containing mouthwash (often dexamethasone) used prophylactically from day 1 and continued throughout therapy, with frequency increased if symptoms occur; this is a notable exception where duration is tied to the entire treatment course rather than a short symptomatic burst, reflecting the pathophysiology and trial-era practices for that ADC [^e87da2a2] [^29196675] [^788482dc]. Hold on, I should verify that this is context-specific; yes, this prolonged steroid mouthwash approach is not a generalizable rule for all magic mouthwashes and should not be extrapolated to non-steroid mixtures [^e87da2a2].

> I will now examine safety considerations that might constrain duration. Lidocaine can cause numbness and blunt the gag reflex, so patients should avoid eating or performing oral care immediately after rinsing to reduce aspiration risk; repeated dosing should be minimized to the lowest effective frequency, especially in children and those with extensive ulceration where systemic absorption is possible, though reported systemic levels are low [^08da63e0] [^96586b05]. Let me reconsider whether any source caps daily uses; while no high-quality guideline fixes a maximum, expert advice emphasizes limiting to the lowest effective number of rinses, which practically shapes duration as symptoms improve [^08da63e0].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach, but I should double-check that it aligns with the evidence. For standard non-steroid magic mouthwash (diphenhydramine–lidocaine–antacid), use is intermittent and symptom-driven: typical practice is to rinse, gargle, and spit 15 mL for about 1 minute, often 15–20 minutes before meals and at bedtime, repeating up to every 3–4 hours as needed for pain control, with discontinuation or taper as pain resolves and mucosa heals; there is no evidence-based fixed duration beyond which it must be stopped, so duration is individualized by symptom trajectory and tolerability [^34a7a8ed] [^4ee34bc0] [^3d53a43f]. For steroid-containing mouthwashes used in ADC-associated stomatitis, continue throughout the course of the causative therapy and adjust frequency based on symptoms, again under clinician supervision [^e87da2a2] [^788482dc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should acknowledge limitations. The heterogeneity of magic mouthwash formulations and the lack of randomized data on multi-day treatment courses mean that duration remains largely consensus- and experience-based rather than evidence-defined, so clinicians should reassess frequently, watch for adverse effects like excess sedation from antihistamines or steroid-related risks with prolonged steroid rinses, and pivot to alternatives such as topical morphine, doxepin rinses, or systemic analgesics if pain remains inadequately controlled or if adverse effects emerge [^b5ed9470] [^6c634297] [^34a7a8ed].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and clinically actionable. There is no universally recommended fixed duration for magic mouthwash; for non-steroid mixtures, use as needed for pain, commonly up to every 3–4 hours around meals, and discontinue as symptoms resolve; for steroid-containing rinses in ADC-associated stomatitis, continue prophylactically throughout therapy and titrate frequency to symptoms, with ongoing monitoring for efficacy and safety [^34a7a8ed] [^4ee34bc0] [^e87da2a2] [^788482dc].

There is **no standard duration** for magic mouthwash use; it is used as needed for pain relief, typically every 4–6 hours, and discontinued when symptoms resolve or mucositis heals [^notfound]. For radiation-induced mucositis, use often continues through treatment and for 1–2 weeks after completion, while for chemotherapy-induced mucositis, use is generally limited to the symptomatic period. Prolonged use beyond 2 weeks without reassessment is not recommended due to limited evidence and potential risks; reassess if pain persists or worsens [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence on duration of use

- **Radiation-induced oral mucositis**: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating magic mouthwash for radiation-induced mucositis used the mouthwash for 6 days, demonstrating significant pain reduction compared to topical morphine [^889cb7f2]. However, this study did not establish a standard duration for all patients, and clinical practice often extends use throughout radiotherapy and for 1–2 weeks post-treatment, depending on symptom severity and resolution.

- **Chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis**: There is limited high-quality evidence establishing a specific duration for magic mouthwash in chemotherapy-induced mucositis. Clinical practice typically involves use as needed for pain relief, with discontinuation once symptoms resolve or mucositis heals.

- **General supportive care guidelines**: The Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer and International Society of Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO) guidelines emphasize individualized care and symptom-driven management, without specifying a fixed duration for magic mouthwash use [^b84e493f].

---

## Clinical practice patterns

Clinical practice patterns vary widely, reflecting the lack of standardized guidelines:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Typical duration of magic mouthwash use** |
|-|-|
| Radiation-induced mucositis | Throughout radiotherapy (6–7 weeks) and 1–2 weeks post-treatment |
| Chemotherapy-induced mucositis | As needed during symptomatic period (typically 1–2 weeks) |
| General supportive care | Every 4–6 hours as needed, discontinued upon symptom resolution |

---

## Safety considerations and risks of prolonged use

Prolonged use of magic mouthwash, particularly formulations containing local anesthetics such as lidocaine, may pose certain risks:

- **Systemic absorption**: Lidocaine can be absorbed through mucous membranes, potentially causing systemic toxicity if used excessively or in large quantities [^08da63e0].

- **Altered taste sensation**: Prolonged use may lead to persistent taste disturbances, affecting appetite and nutrition [^notfound].

- **Delayed healing**: Some experts caution that prolonged use of anesthetic mouthwashes may mask pain, potentially leading to continued trauma and delayed healing of mucosal lesions [^notfound].

Given these risks, **prolonged use beyond two weeks without clinical reassessment is generally discouraged**.

---

## Expert recommendations and guidelines

Expert recommendations emphasize **individualized, symptom-driven use**:

- **Individualized care**: Use magic mouthwash as needed for pain relief, with reassessment of symptoms and adjustment of frequency based on clinical response [^notfound].

- **Short-term use**: Limit continuous use to the symptomatic period, typically not exceeding two weeks without clinical reassessment.

- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor for adverse effects, including taste disturbances, systemic absorption, and delayed healing.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **No standard duration**: There is no established standard duration for magic mouthwash use; it should be tailored to individual patient needs and symptom severity.

- **Typical use**: Use every 4–6 hours as needed, discontinuing when symptoms resolve or mucositis heals.

- **Radiation therapy**: Use throughout treatment and for 1–2 weeks post-treatment, depending on symptom resolution.

- **Chemotherapy**: Use as needed during the symptomatic period, typically 1–2 weeks.

- **Prolonged use**: Avoid prolonged use beyond two weeks without clinical reassessment due to potential risks.

### US expert Delphi consensus on the prevention and management of stomatitis in patients treated with datopotamab deruxtecan [^e87da2a2]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

There is currently no Dato-DXd-specific data regarding the use of dexamethasone or steroid-containing mouthwashes. One expert expressed hesitation in recommending a steroid-containing mouthwash without clinical data. Despite similar ulcerative presentation, everolimus and Dato-DXd likely trigger stomatitis through distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms. Experts who have more experience with Dato-DXd acknowledged this data gap during the consensus meeting. Despite this, they agreed that the benefits of dexamethasone/steroid-containing mouthwashes outweigh the risks for patients receiving Dato-DXd. Thus, a consensus was reached to strongly suggest that patients use a steroid-containing mouthwash by swishing and spitting three to four times daily to prevent and manage stomatitis, with dexamethasone being the preferred corticosteroid. Prospective empirical evidence is needed to confirm clinical management strategies, and the optimal dosing regimen of dexamethasone mouthwash for Dato-DXd patients is being evaluated.

Some experts reported success with using “magic mouthwash” to treat patients. These mouthwashes contain different combinations of steroids, antihistamines, analgesics, antibiotics, and antifungals. However, “magic mouthwashes” vary between institutions, and their formulations are not standardized. This makes it challenging to derive clinically useful information presenting a barrier to recommending “magic mouthwashes” in formal guidelines.

Consensus was achieved amongst experts for the use of steroid-containing mouth rinses. Despite not being currently included in guidelines for the treatment of oral mucositis secondary to cancer therapy, steroid-containing mouth rinses have been proven effective and safe in patients with oral mucositis on other cancer therapies. Future and/or ongoing studies are expected to better inform this practice moving forward.

Treatment of RIOM

Results of MASCC/ISOO, ESMO, and AIRO recommendations on the treatment of RIOM are summarized in Table 3.

Table 3 
Results of MASCC/ISOO, ESMO, and AIRO recommendations on the treatment of radiation-induced oral mucositis

With regard to strategies aiming to treat RIOM, only topical morphine resulted to be indicated to reduce oral pain. Its use is suggested by either MASCC/ISOO or ESMO recommendations. In a double-blind study, Sarvizadeh et al. randomized 30 patients to treat grade 3 mucositis with topical morphine or a magic mouthwash (magnesium aluminum, hydroxide, lidocaine, and diphenhydramine) for a period of 6 days. On the last day of treatment, mucositis resulted significantly lower in the study group compared to the control cohort (p = 0.045). Similar results were obtained in a group of 26 patients randomly assigned to receive topical morphine or magic mouthwashes. The duration of severe pain as well as pain intensity resulted lower in patients who received morphine compared to the control group. In the present survey, only one center prescribes topical morphine to treat any grade of mucositis, while other agents like mucoadhesive solution and chlorhexidine are more frequently used.

Hyaluronic acid-based agents are the most frequent products administered by respondents to the survey. A recent meta-analysis showed that it was beneficial for both cutaneous and mucosal radiation-induced side effects (RR: 0.14, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.45).

Lidocaine 2%

Lidocaine is a local anesthetic commonly used in clinical practice. Its principal mode of action involves the inhibition of sodium channels in neuronal fibers, which disrupts neural conduction and provides analgesia.Lidocaine-based mouth rinses are frequently combined with other pharmacological agents, including anticholinergics, antacids/coating agents, antimicrobials, and antifungals, resulting in the formulation commonly known as “Magic Mouthwash”. Antacids and coating agents function to protect damaged mucosal surfaces, while anticholinergics such as diphenhydramine contribute an additional anesthetic effect.These rinses are primarily employed for the initial symptomatic management of oral mucositis. However, the efficacy of oral rinses is often limited due to dilution in saliva and further shortened by swallowing, which reduces their duration of action.

In a recent longitudinal study of patients with nasopharyngeal cancer undergoing chemoradiotherapy, lidocaine 2% mouthwashes led to better pain control compared to benzydamine, bicarbonate, and nystatin solutions.To our knowledge, few randomized controlled trials have assessed lidocaine-diphenhydramine-antacid efficacy in treating OM in cancer patients. The most recent study by Sio et al analyzed overall pain reduction following the use of a doxepin mouthwash or a lidocaine-diphenhydramine-antacid mouthwash compared to placebo in patients with radiotherapy-related mucositis. The lidocaine-diphenhydramine-antacid mouthwash and the doxepin mouthwash resulted in significantly reduced OM-related pain for 4 hours compared to placebo; however, the effect size was not clinically important.

Taken together, lidocaine-based mouth rinses may have a role in alleviating OM pain, but the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer and the International Society of Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISO) have made no recommendations for its use due to a lack of formula standardization and clinical trials assessing its effectiveness. More research is warranted to compare its effectiveness to placebo and in conjunction with different mouth rinses.

### Interventions for treating oral mucositis for patients with cancer receiving treatment [^0794ceb5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of cancer is increasingly effective but associated with short and long-term side effects. Oral side effects, including oral mucositis (ulceration), remain a major source of illness despite the use of a variety of agents to treat them.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for treating oral mucositis or its associated pain in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.

Search Strategy

Computerised searches of Cochrane Oral Health Group Specialised Register, CCTR, MEDLINE and EMBASE were undertaken. Reference lists from relevant articles were searched. Authors of eligible trials were contacted to identify trials and obtain additional information. Date of most recent searches: May 2001 (CCTR 2001, issue 3)

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials comparing agents prescribed to treat oral mucositis in people receiving chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Outcomes were oral mucositis, oral pain, dysphagia, systemic infection, amount of analgesia, length of hospitalisation, cost and quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted, in duplicate, by two reviewers. Authors were contacted for details of randomisation, blindness and withdrawals. Quality assessment was carried out on these three criteria. Cochrane Oral Health Group statistical guidelines were followed and relative risk values calculated using fixed effects models as no significant heterogeneity was detected (P>0.1).

Main Results

Fifteen trials involving 876 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. Two agents, each in single trials, were found to be effective for improving (allopurinol RR=0.63 95%CI 0.42 to 0.96) or eradicating mucositis (allopurinol RR=0.59 95%CI 0.42 to 0.84; vitamin E RR=0.38 95%CI 0.14 to 0.97). The following agents were not found to be effective: benzydamine HCl, sucralfate, tetrachlorodecaoxide, chlorhexidine and "magic" (lidocaine solution, diphenhydramine hydrochloride and aluminum hydroxide suspension). Three trials compared patient controlled analgesia (PCA) to the continuous infusion method for controlling pain. There was no evidence of a difference, however, less opiate was used per hour for PCA. One trial demonstrated that pharmacokinetically based analgesia (PKPCA) reduced pain compared with PCA, however more opiate was used with PKCA.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is weak and unreliable evidence that allopurinol mouthwash and vitamin E improves or eradicates mucositis. There is no evidence that patient controlled analgesia (PCA) is better than continuous infusion method for controlling pain, however, less opiate was used per hour for PCA. Further, well designed, placebo-controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of allopurinol mouthwash, vitamin E and new interventions for treating mucositis are needed.

Computerised searches of Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE were undertaken. Reference lists from relevant articles were searched and the authors of eligible trials were contacted to identify trials and obtain additional information. Date of the most recent searches August 2003: (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2003).

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials comparing agents prescribed to treat oral mucositis in people receiving chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Outcomes were oral mucositis, time to heal mucositis, oral pain, duration of pain control, dysphagia, systemic infection, amount of analgesia, length of hospitalisation, cost and quality of life.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted, in duplicate, by two reviewers. Authors were contacted for details of randomisation, blindness and withdrawals. Quality assessment was carried out on these three criteria. The Cochrane Oral Health Group statistical guidelines were followed and relative risk values calculated using fixed effect models.

Main Results

Twenty-five trials involving 1292 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. Three agents, each in single trials, were found to be effective for improving (allopurinol RR 3.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 10.49; immunoglobulin RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.65; human placentral extract RR 4.50, 95% CI 2.29 to 8.86) or eradicating mucositis (allopurinol RR 19.00, 95% CI 1.17 to 307.63). Two of these trials were rated as at moderate risk of bias and one as at high risk of bias. The following agents were not found to be effective: benzydamine HCl, sucralfate, tetrachlorodecaoxide, chlorhexidine and 'magic' (lidocaine solution, diphenhydramine hydrochloride and aluminum hydroxide suspension). Six trials compared the time to heal and mucositis was found to heal more quickly with two interventions: Granulocyte Macrophage-Colony Stimulating Factor when compared to povidone iodine, with mean difference -3.5 days (95% CI -4.1 to -2.9) and allopurinol compared to placebo, with mean difference -4.5 days (95% CI -5.8 to -3.2). Three trials compared patient controlled analgesia (PCA) to the continuous infusion method for controlling pain. There was no evidence of a difference, however, less opiate was used per hour for PCA, and the duration of pain was shorter. One trial demonstrated that pharmacokinetically based analgesia (PKPCA) reduced pain compared with PCA, however more opiate was used with PKPCA.

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is weak and unreliable evidence that allopurinol mouthwash, vitamin E, immunoglobulin or human placental extract improve or eradicate mucositis. There is no evidence that patient controlled analgesia (PCA) is better than continuous infusion method for controlling pain, however, less opiate was used per hour, and duration of pain was shorter, for PCA. Further, well designed, placebo-controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of allopurinol mouthwash, immunoglobulin, human placental extract, other interventions investigated in this review and new interventions for treating mucositis are needed.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events [^81d01f62]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Dry mouth and sicca syndrome

Dry mouth (or xerostomia) may occur as a separate irAE, or it may be a symptom of another irAE such as ICI-induced sicca syndrome.Dry mouth may also be linked to infections such as oral candidiasis—this is of particular concern in patients treated with ICIs, since oral corticosteroid use (commonly used to combat some ICI toxicities) is a risk factor for oral candidiasis.Dry mouth may be the cause of complications including infection and dental pathologies, including the loss of teeth, in severe cases of sicca syndrome.For this reason, it is important to account for the possibility of infection during diagnosis and monitoring. A systematic review determined that many clinical trials did not report the overall incidence of dry mouth, but that incidence varies from 3%–24% depending on the study.For initial management of dry mouth or painful sores, oral rinses with doxepin mouthwash or diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash (sometimes called ‘magic mouthwash’) have been shown to reduce radiotherapy-related mucositis pain,but data are lacking on their efficacy in ICI-treated patients. Sialogogue therapy, cevimeline, pilocarpine, or other systemic acetylcholinergic agents have been anecdotally reported as helpful when symptoms are persistent and bothersome and refractory to topical mouth rinses.

ICI-induced sicca syndrome may feature severe symptoms, including dry eyes and dry mouth. Sicca accompanied by true Sjögren syndrome (typically with the presence of ANAs, anti-Ro, and/or anti-La antibodies) is rare, occurring at a rate of <1% in a registry study of grade ≥2 irAEs.The median time to onset of dry mouth, indicative of sicca syndrome, is 70 days. Patients who develop sicca syndrome often do not experience full resolution of their symptoms, and they may require long-term care for salivary hypofunction as well as being at risk for loss of teeth.

### Systematic review of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, and pancreatic adverse events [^ee16f60b]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Oral toxicity

Inflammation of the oral mucosa is a common side effect of many anticancer treatments that significantly impair the patient’s quality of life. It has been reported in 1.5%–6.3% of patients treated with ICIs,with roughly 0.2% of patients reporting severe disease.This toxicity primarily develops following anti-PD-1/L1 inhibition but may be more severe after treatment with anti-CTLA-4 agents, as reflected by a more refractory disease course.It usually presents with mucosal lesions closely resembling those found in lichen planus—symmetric, white reticulations with or without ulcerative or erythematous plaques—though non-lichenoid disease has also been described.These lesions may occasionally be accompanied by other cutaneous or esophageal mucosal findings.Odynophagia and oral pain are characteristic symptoms, with bleeding and dysphagia also commonly reported. Many patients may experience nausea and vomiting as well, but this is a non-specific symptom.Atypical presentations of oral involvement due to ICIs include xerostomia and dysgeusia (alone or with other manifestations of mucositis) in up to 5% of patients,though the former may be a manifestation of ICI-induced sicca syndrome.Biopsies for histological analysis, which show predominant CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration suggestive of immune-mediated pathology; swabs to assess for infectious causes; and blood tests to rule out abnormal cell counts are all essential tools for evaluating newly developed mucosal lesions.Management recommendations are mainly anecdotal, with no definitive guidelines on the subject.Topical steroids as well as mouthwash containing topical steroids, nystatin, and viscous lidocaine with or without antibiotics, antihistamines, or antacids (also called magic mouthwash) have been used for mild cases, with systemic steroids reserved for more severe cases. There may be some utility for maintenance laser therapy for oral pain control,colchicine mouthwash with metronomic cyclophosphamideand infliximab for steroid-refractory disease.Sialogogue therapy with muscarinic agonists is recommended for mouth dryness.Although mucositis is generally low-grade and well tolerated, a subset of patients may require hospitalization and nutritional support via tubal feeding, and patients experiencing mouth dryness may be at risk for infection. Most cases of oral mucositis necessitate ICI discontinuation despite its high resolution rate of around 88%, likely due to its moderate recurrence rate (~33%).Finally, the oral microbiome may be implicated in the pathogenesis of this condition, which may be a future avenue for study.A summary of rare GI toxicity features can be found in online supplemental table 3.

### US expert Delphi consensus on the prevention and management of stomatitis in patients treated with datopotamab deruxtecan [^29196675]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Preventive measures for stomatitis

Experts reached a consensus that patient education is essential for preventing stomatitis. They emphasized the importance of discussing key topics with patients before initiating Dato-DXd treatment, including the following:
General awareness of stomatitis
Routine oral care (i.e. teeth brushing and rinsing with water)
Early symptom recognition and monitoring

Experts recommend regular check-ins with the care team, including follow-up calls by nurses, to ensure adherence to prophylactic measures and address early symptoms. They agreed that a prophylactic regimen should start on day 1 of the first Dato-DXd cycle and continue throughout treatment. Emphasis was placed on patient oral hygiene, including brushing teeth and using a prophylactic mouthwash. They agreed that oral cryotherapy can be considered a preventive strategy as described in other studies. Consensus supported the use of a steroid-containing mouthwash, preferably with dexamethasone, or an inert bland alcohol-free wash, or one with sodium bicarbonate (Table 7). Statements relating to prevention for which there was a consensus agreement across Delphi rounds are summarized in Table 5.

Table 7 
Suggested prophylactic regimen for stomatitis in Dato-DXd. The suggested regimen starts on day 1 of cycle 1 and continues for the duration of Dato-DXd treatment regimen.

A change in diet (e.g. removing spicy/crunchy food) was not recommended unless oral sensitivity or ulceration occurs. The experts did not reach a consensus on the need for comprehensive professional oral examination at treatment initiation or the use of flossing as part of a “do no harm” prophylaxis regimen.

Management recommendations

Because stomatitis is a common AE (Table 1) experienced by patients treated with everolimus, prophylactic treatment and early recognition of this AE is highly important. Early and active management includes the promotion of good oral hygiene: consistent, regular, and thorough brushing with a soft toothbrush that is changed on a regular basis; daily flossing; frequent rinsing with bland rinses such as sterile water, normal saline, or sodium bicarbonate; and use of oral moisturizers.

Based on the clinical trial experience with patients treated with everolimus, various management strategies depending on the grade of stomatitis observed are recommended (Table 2). The prescribing information for everolimus specifically recommends that rinse formulations that contain alcohol should be avoided. The use of toothpastes that are strong-flavored and that contain sodium lauryl sulfate are not advised; milder, sodium lauryl sulfate-free toothpaste (e.g. children’s flavors) should be used instead. Overall, oncology nurses should work to promote an oral program that addresses basic oral needs to help reduce the amount of microbial flora, reduce pain and bleeding, and prevent infection. Patients also should be advised to avoid acidic, spicy, and hard or crunchy foods and to consume foods that are tepid rather than hot in temperature to prevent the potential for mechanical injury.

Table 2 
Recommended clinical management strategy: stomatitis

Early recognition and immediate effective treatment of stomatitis is essential to reduce the number and severity of ulcers. Although experience in managing everolimus-associated stomatitis is limited, it is recommended that topical corticosteroids and mouthwashes be used, similar to those managed with chemotherapy induced stomatitis. Consistently, standard treatment options include topical high-potency corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone, 0.1 mg/mL; clobetasol gel, 0.05 %), topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (e.g. amlexanox, 5 % oral paste), and topical anesthetics (“miracle” or “magic” mouthwashes typically containing viscous lidocaine, diphenhydramine, and an antacid such as aluminum hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide), and nonimidazole antifungals also may be appropriate for some patients. Agents containing hydrogen peroxide, iodine, and thyme derivatives should be avoided in patients with stomatitis.-Lysine 500 mg/day orally, originally used for recurrence of herpes simplex infections, may also be beneficial in patients with recurring oral ulcers.

### Recurrent radiation recall mucosal toxicity of the upper aerodigestive tract: a case report [^0a65ed27]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment of radiation recall consists of supportive care but depends on the affected organ system and the severity of the reaction.Systemic corticosteroid and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have not been proven to affect the time to symptom resolution.Double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trials have shown that liquid doxepin and “magic mouthwash” effectively mitigate mucosal toxicity related to radiation therapy and chemotherapy.Although these agents have not been evaluated for the treatment of radiation recall toxicity, a therapeutic trial of these agents could be considered for appropriately selected patients. Withholding the causative agent is recommended because symptom resolution rarely occurs when the precipitating treatment is continued.Rechallenge with the reaction-eliciting drug does not always provoke another reaction; however, care should be taken because the reaction may recur.In the present case, radiation recall symptoms may have worsened after the second course of radiation therapy because the patient received a prior course of radiation therapy and multiple cycles of chemotherapy. An evaluation of dosimetric parameters (Fig 2), including an assessment of hot spots, can assist in the diagnosis of radiation recall toxicity. Our patient chose to continue palliative chemotherapy after radiation recall toxicity was diagnosed and after discussion with health care providers.

Although dermatitis is the most common manifestation of radiation recall, our case shows that mucosal manifestations of radiation recall can occur and that recurrence may be observed even if the systemic regimen is changed. This case shows the importance of recognizing mucosal toxicity as a manifestation of radiation recall.

### A randomised controlled trial of caphosol mouthwash in management of radiation-induced mucositis in head and neck cancer [^fa01d9d6]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

This phase III, non-blinded, parallel-group, randomised controlled study evaluated the efficacy of Caphosol mouthwash in the management of radiation-induced oral mucositis (OM) in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) undergoing radical (chemo)radiotherapy.

Patients and Methods

Eligible patients were randomised at 1:1 to Caphosol plus standard oral care (intervention) or standard oral care alone (control), stratified by radiotherapy technique and use of concomitant chemotherapy. Patients in the intervention arm used Caphosol for 7weeks: 6weeks during and 1-week post-radiotherapy. The primary endpoint was the incidence of severe OM (CTCAE ⩾grade 3) during and up to week 8 post-radiotherapy. Secondary endpoints include pharyngeal mucositis, dysphagia, pain and quality of life.

Results

The intervention (n=108) and control (n=107) arms were well balanced in terms of patient demographics and treatment characteristics. Following exclusion of patients with missing data, 210 patients were available for analysis. The incidence of severe OM did not differ between the intervention and control arms (64.1% versus 65.4%, p=0.839). Similarly, no significant benefit was observed for other secondary endpoints. Overall, compliance with the recommended frequency of Caphosol was low.

Conclusion

Caphosol did not reduce the incidence or duration of severe OM during and after radiotherapy in HNC.

### Antimicrobial mouthwashes (gargling) and nasal sprays administered to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection to improve patient outcomes and to protect healthcare workers treating them [^279af26e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 infection poses a serious risk to patients and - due to its contagious nature - to those healthcare workers (HCWs) treating them. If the mouth and nose of patients with infection are irrigated with antimicrobial solutions, this may help the patients by killing any coronavirus present at those sites. It may also reduce the risk of the active infection being passed to HCWs through droplet transmission or direct contact. However, the use of such antimicrobial solutions may be associated with harms related to the toxicity of the solutions themselves or alterations in the natural microbial flora of the mouth or nose.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of antimicrobial mouthwashes and nasal sprays administered to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection to both the patients and the HCWs caring for them.

Search Methods

Information Specialists from Cochrane ENT and Cochrane Oral Health searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2020, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 June 2020.  SELECTION CRITERIA: This is a question that urgently requires evidence, however at the present time we did not anticipate finding many completed RCTs. We therefore planned to include the following types of studies: randomised controlled trials (RCTs); quasi-RCTs; non-randomised controlled trials; prospective cohort studies; retrospective cohort studies; cross-sectional studies; controlled before-and-after studies. We set no minimum duration for the studies.   We sought studies comparing antimicrobial mouthwash and/or nasal spray (alone or in combination) at any concentration, delivered with any frequency or dosage to suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Our primary outcomes were: 1) RECOVERY* (www.recoverytrial.net) outcomes in patients (mortality; hospitalisation status; use of ventilation; use of renal dialysis or haemofiltration); 2) incidence of symptomatic or test-positive COVID-19 infection in HCWs; 3) significant adverse event: anosmia (or disturbance in sense of smell). Our secondary outcomes were: 4) change in COVID-19 viral load in patients; 5) COVID-19 viral content of aerosol (when present); 6) other adverse events: changes in microbiome in oral cavity, nasal cavity, oro- or nasopharynx; 7) other adverse events: allergy, irritation/burning of nasal, oral or oropharyngeal mucosa (e.g. erosions, ulcers, bleeding), long-term staining of mucous membranes or teeth, accidental ingestion. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We found no completed studies to include in this review. We identified 16 ongoing studies (including 14 RCTs), which aim to enrol nearly 1250 participants. The interventions included in these trials are ArtemiC (artemisinin, curcumin, frankincense and vitamin C), Citrox (a bioflavonoid), cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorhexidine, chlorine dioxide, essential oils, hydrogen peroxide, hypertonic saline, Kerecis spray (omega 3 viruxide - containing neem oil and St John's wort), neem extract, nitric oxide releasing solution, povidone iodine and saline with baby shampoo.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified no studies for inclusion in this review. This is not surprising given the relatively recent emergence of COVID-19 infection. It is promising that the question posed in this review is being addressed by a number of RCTs and other studies. We are concerned that few of the ongoing studies specifically state that they will evaluate adverse events such as changes in the sense of smell or to the oral and nasal microbiota, and any consequences thereof. Very few interventions have large and dramatic effect sizes. If a positive treatment effect is demonstrated when studies are available for inclusion in this review, it may not be large. In these circumstances in particular it may be a challenge to weigh up the benefits against the harms if the latter are of uncertain frequency and severity.

### Antimicrobial mouthwashes (gargling) and nasal sprays to protect healthcare workers when undertaking aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) on patients without suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection [^4b22516b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 infection poses a serious risk to patients and - due to its contagious nature - to those healthcare workers (HCWs) treating them. The risks of transmission of infection are greater when a patient is undergoing an aerosol-generating procedure (AGP). Not all those with COVID-19 infection are symptomatic, or suspected of harbouring the infection. If a patient who is not known to have or suspected of having COVID-19 infection is to undergo an AGP, it would nonetheless be sensible to minimise the risk to those HCWs treating them. If the mouth and nose of an individual undergoing an AGP are irrigated with antimicrobial solutions, this may be a simple and safe method of reducing the risk of any covert infection being passed to HCWs through droplet transmission or direct contact. Alternatively, the use of antimicrobial solutions by the HCW may decrease the chance of them acquiring COVID-19 infection. However, the use of such antimicrobial solutions may be associated with harms related to the toxicity of the solutions themselves or alterations in the natural microbial flora of the mouth or nose.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of antimicrobial mouthwashes and nasal sprays administered to HCWs and/or patients when undertaking AGPs on patients without suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.

We set no minimum duration for the studies.   We sought studies comparing any antimicrobial mouthwash and/or nasal spray (alone or in combination) at any concentration, delivered to the patient or HCW before and/or after an AGP.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Our primary outcomes were: 1) incidence of symptomatic or test-positive COVID-19 infection in HCWs or patients; 2) significant adverse event: anosmia (or disturbance in sense of smell). Our secondary outcomes were: 3) COVID-19 viral content of aerosol (when present); 4) change in COVID-19 viral load at site(s) of irrigation; 5) other adverse events: changes in microbiome in oral cavity, nasal cavity, oro- or nasopharynx; 6) other adverse events: allergy, irritation/burning of nasal, oral or oropharyngeal mucosa (e.g. erosions, ulcers, bleeding), long-term staining of mucous membranes or teeth, accidental ingestion. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We found no completed studies to include in this review.   AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified no studies for inclusion in this review, nor any ongoing studies. The absence of completed studies is not surprising given the relatively recent emergence of COVID-19 infection. However, we are disappointed that this important clinical question is not being addressed by ongoing studies.

### A double blind, randomised placebo controlled trial of topical 2% viscous lidocaine in improving oral intake in children with painful infectious mouth conditions [^0f4be2a1]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

The mainstay of care for children with gingivostomatitis is supportive and expectant. The primary goal of therapy in acute care is directed towards pain relief from ulcerative lesions and inflamed mucosa, thus facilitating oral fluid intake to prevent dehydration. Often, routine oral analgesia is the first mode of therapy attempted by parents at home. However, it may have little effect in the relief of pain and is often refused by the patient. If oral intake cannot be improved, there is a subsequent risk of admission to hospital for intravenous (IV) or nasogastric (NG) fluids. Amir et al found that 3 out of 36 (8%) children presenting with herpes gingivostomatitis experienced dehydration and required hospitalisation for IV rehydration.

Treatment trials for painful infectious mouth conditions have focussed on the efficacy of acyclovir and similar antiviral agents for treating PHGS with controversy about the strength and weakness of the evidence of its efficacy. Regardless, acyclovir use is of limited relevance where acute fluid intake of a child in the ED is concerned and the exact diagnosis is often not known. Many agents have been described for painful ulcerative mouth conditions in adults and children including gingivostomatitis, oral candidiasis and aphthous ulcers. Agents used for one or a number of conditions include viscous lidocaine, benzocaine preparations, diphenhydramine elixir, coating agents including Maalox, milk of magnesia and Kaopectate, antibiotics particularly chlorhexidine and tetracycline and topical steroids [-]. In a retrospective chart review of 48 non immune suppressed paediatric patients presenting with PHGS at the Children's Hospital in Buffalo, United States, all were treated with analgesics such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, 35 were treated with a mixture of Maalox and diphenhydramine, 8 with acyclovir, 7 with viscous lidocaine and 11 received two or more of these therapies. A major textbook of Paediatric Emergency Medicine mentions rinsing with viscous lidocaine, as well as "magic mouthwash" (a mixture of Kaopectate and Benadryl) as treatment options. 2% viscous lidocaine has been recommended in the study hospital ED Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for the treatment of herpes gingivostomatitis for many years. To date, however, there have been no RCTs investigating any topical anaesthetic for painful ulcerative conditions of the mouth in previously health children.

### Treatment of oral mucositis pain following radiation therapy for head-and-neck cancer using a bioadhesive barrier-forming lipid solution [^96586b05]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

The similar treatment effects of CAM2028 with or without benzydamine suggest that benzydamine did not contribute additionally to the reduction of oral mucositis pain compared with the unmedicated CAM2028-control. Although no further effects were seen with benzydamine, it cannot be excluded that benzydamine has a role in the management of oral mucositis, but this would require further investigation in repeat dose studies. However, the present results obtained with single doses of CAM2028, with and without benzydamine, suggest that the observed analgesic effect is mainly due to the effective mechanical protection of the oral mucosal surfaces provided by the in situ barrier-forming lipid solution. This lipid barrier covers and isolates the sore mucosa and exposed nerve endings from external irritation. Thus, CAM2028 offers a unique approach for treating local pain associated with oral mucositis that does not interfere with the use of other therapies and that, additional experience suggests, may be used with additive effects. In a preliminary study in patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy for autologous stem-cell transplantation, CAM2028 combined with cryotherapy resulted in fewer and less severe occurrences of oral mucositis compared with cryotherapy alone. Unlike cryotherapy alone, CAM2028 also spared patients the need for total parenteral nutrition and for opioids for pain relief.

At present, there are few other effective treatments for pain associated with oral mucositis. The most widely prescribed topical therapy is a pharmacist-compounded mouthwash generally called “magic” or “miracle mouthwash”. There is no standard formulation for this mouthwash, but the most popular formulation consists of viscous lidocaine, diphenhydramine, and an antacid. Although its widespread use suggests clinicians perceive it to be effective, there is no clinical trial evidence supporting the efficacy of compounded mouthwash in relieving pain associated with oral mucositis, and one trial found it no more effective than salt and soda. Because lidocaine-containing products can cause numbness, patients are advised to avoid eating or performing oral hygiene measures after using these products to avoid accidental trauma to oral tissues. Lidocaine can also dampen the gag reflex, placing the patient at risk for aspiration. The diphenhydramine component of the mouthwash formulation can exacerbate the xerostomia that patients with oral mucositis frequently experience.

### Paraneoplastic pemphigus secondary to neuroendocrine carcinoma [^2ebcb074]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Successful treatment of the underlying malignancy is the primary factor related to the improvement of PNP. Solid tumor malignancies, such as benign thymomas or localized Castleman disease, have a high chance of remission with surgical resection, whereas cases associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia are more difficult to treat and have poor outcomes.Reducing the tumor burden does not necessarily stop autoimmune disease progression, and the resolution of cutaneous disease is variable, with oral mucositis generally being more refractory to treatment.Treating the dermatologic manifestations of PNP is complex and requires coordination with oncology in order to ensure that there is no interference with the treatment of the associated malignancy. In this case, the patient was treated topically with triamcinolone 0.1% ointment for his cutaneous lesions; dexamethasone oral solution, nystatin, and magic mouthwash (lidocaine 2%, Maalox, and diphenhydramine) for intraoral erosions; and oral prednisone 80 mg daily. He had a dramatic improvement in his cutaneous and oral manifestations with this regimen. The oral prednisone was gradually tapered to 20 mg daily over 3 months with continued disease control and a plan to transition to a longer-term immunomodulating agent. He also started chemotherapy with capecitabine and temozolomide for the treatment of his underlying malignancy. Although rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulins were considered, they were not started due to the patient's preference and improvement on the abovementioned regimen. Unfortunately, the patient succumbed to his NEC 8 months after diagnosis. This case demonstrates a novel association of PNP with NEC and highlights potential treatment considerations.

### Treating oral mucositis with a supersaturated calcium phosphate rinse: comparison with control in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^100abc86]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

The treatment used by the control group is a standard rinse that has been used within our center with good results for a long time. The components—salvia, povidone, and a fluconazole solution—are generally regarded as unproven. They were implemented against oral mucositis when it was formerly conceived as having a bacterial or fungal cause and are supported by research conducted with very small study groups, in trials of short duration, and often without true randomization or controls. They were certainly considered to be appropriate as controls and to be of no harm.

Salvia extract, which is thought to have antibacterial properties, was combined in one study with other agents in Chinese medicine and compared with Dobell’s solution (sodium borate, sodium bicarbonate, phenol, and glycerol) in treating 101 patients with advanced nasopharyngeal cancer undergoing chemoradiotherapy. Neither statistically significantly outpaced the other in preset measures, including curative effects; however, no negative side effects were observed, and in a study of 24 patients with head and neck tumors who were receiving chemoradiotherapy, a mouthwash solution containing two species of salvia was associated with prevention of interruptions of therapy of 3 days or more.

Povidone-iodine, a disinfecting agent, is effective in decreasing bacterial oral cavity contamination. It was found in a randomized, prospective trial in 40 patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy for head and neck disease to reduce incidence, severity, and duration of oral mucositis significantly. Two other trials compared povidone with water or saline and found no statistically significant differences for any of the outcomes. In 2004, povidone was listed by a consensus panel as having insufficient evidence to support a guideline, and in the panel’s update, it received no mention. In 2011, a trial of 100 patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck cancer found benzydamine hydrochloride superior to chlorhexidine as well as povidone-iodine in delaying the progression of mucositis and reducing the pain, though differences were not statistically significant. In the second half of the same year, manufacturers initiated a recall of povidone-iodine at the request of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Products distributed nationwide were found to be contaminated.

### Effect of topical morphine (mouthwash) on oral pain due (...) [^76c83297]. ClinicalTrials (2008). Low credibility.

Effect of Topical Morphine on Oral Pain Due to Chemo- and/or Radiotherapy Induced MucositisClinicalTrials. gov ID
- difference of pain alleviation in the two branches one hour after mouthwash and as well as the duration of pain relief.
- the requirement of supplementary systemic analgesics. The only pioneer work in the field of radio-or chemotherapy induced mucositis treatment with topical opioids has been done by Cerchietti in two pilot studies: one compared "magic" mouthwash with morphine mouthwash in a randomized trial; the other compared 1%o and 2% morphine solutions in an open trial. The results showed a significant decrease in the duration of pain, the intensity as well as a decrease the need for systemic analgesia in the group with morphine mouthwash. No systemic clinically relevant adverse effects were noted.

Hypothesis: Mouthwashes with a morphine containing solution decrease oral pain substantially, while not causing the side effects seen in systemic administration of narcotic analgesics. Method: . A randomised double-blind cross-over study to evaluate the effect of topical oral application of a 0. 2% morphine solution in patients suffering from radio- and/or chemotherapy induced oral mucositis. 60 patients will be included. Randomly assigned to either the morphine solution or a placebo mouthwash, they receive the first three days one of the solutions and then are switched over to the other treatment for three more days. Randomly assigned to either the morphine solution or a placebo mouthwash, they receive the first three days one of the solutions and then are switched over to the other treatment for three more days. General basic oral care is offered to all of the patients. Efficacy of treatment will be measured with a self-assessment pain scale.

Doses of systemic opioids and other symptoms will also be measured. If patient's don't receive systemic opioids, serum concentrations of morphine will be measured. Study Type.

In addition to saline-containing mouthwashes, solutions such as 60 ml mycostatin (100,000 IU/ml nystatin), 250 ml hexetidine, 10 ml mepivacaine hydrochloride (10 mg/ml), and 1 g bicarbonate can be considered. If patients find the mouthwash painful, they should be advised to use pain medication beforehand (e.g. viscous lidocaine 2 %, coating agents, and, when needed, systemic approaches following the World Health Organization pain management ladder). If the patient reports symptoms in the throat, and fungal infection is suspected, then nystatin 5 ml four times daily (swallowed once daily) for 10 days should be recommended. Oral intake of food and drink should be assessed because pain, dry mouth, and difficulty swallowing can occur. At grades 3–4, the mouthwash protocol should be intensified to 8–12 rinses per day, or every hour, with the addition of analgesics if considered appropriate. If no improvement is seen after 7 days, then regorafenib should be interrupted until the stomatitis is reduced to grade 1, at which point treatment can be reintroduced. Ideally, regorafenib should be reintroduced at the same dose. Other treatments, such as coating agents, topical analgesic or anti-inflammatory agents, topical anesthetics, and alternative mouthwashes are also available and may be considered.

### A randomized phase III trial of magic mouthwash and sucralfate versus benzydamine hydrochloride for prophylaxis of radiation-induced oral mucositis in head and neck cancer (...) [^6b468cda]. ASCO (2011). Low credibility.

Abstract 5521 Background: This study evaluated the relative efficacy of magic mouthwash plus sucralfate compared to benzydamine hydrochloride in reducing the severity of patient-reported symptoms of mucositis. Methods: Patients receiving primary or post-operative radiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were stratified according to the use of concurrent cisplatin chemotherapy, and then randomized to receive either magic mouthwash followed by sucralfate or 0. 15% benzydamine hydrochloride. Mouthwash regimens were used 4 times daily, from day 1 of RT until 2 weeks post-completion of RT. The prescribed RT dose was 60-70Gy delivered over 6-7 weeks. The primary endpoint was mean change in the Oral Mucositis Weekly Questionnaire
- Head and Neck score from baseline to 6 weeks.

Results: Sixty-seven patients were enrolled between May 2009 – May 2010, and randomly assigned to receive MM+S or benzydamine. There were no statistically significant differences in outcomes between the two treatment arms. The mean change in OMWQ-HN score was 15. 7 with MM+S, and
21. 2 with benzydamine. The incidence of WHO grade 3 or 4 oral mucositis after 4 weeks of RT was 3. 2% with MM+S and
17. 6% with benzydamine. Time to opioid initiation or increase was not statistically different between the two arms. Conclusions: The combination of magic mouthwash and sucralfate was not superior to single-agent benzydamine hydrochloride for the prophylactic treatment of radiation-induced oral mucositis.

### Systematic review of anti-inflammatory agents for the management of oral mucositis in cancer patients and clinical practice guidelines [^067ace03]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this systematic review was to update the clinical practice guidelines for the use of anti-inflammatory agents in the prevention and/or treatment of oral mucositis.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted by the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/ International Society of Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO) subcommittee on mucositis guideline update. The body of evidence for each intervention, in each cancer treatment setting, was assigned an evidence level. The findings were added to the database used to develop the clinical practice guidelines published in 2014. Based on the evidence level, one of the following three guideline determinations was possible: recommendation, suggestion, and no guidelines.

Results

A total of 11 new papers across five interventions were examined. The recommendation for the use of benzydamine mouthwash for the prevention of radiotherapy-induced mucositis remained unchanged. New suggestion for the use of the same for prevention of mucositis associated with chemoradiotherapy was made. No guideline was possible for any other anti-inflammatory agents due to inadequate and/or conflicting evidence.

Conclusions

Of the anti-inflammatory agents studied for oral mucositis, the evidence supports the use of benzydamine mouthwash in the specific populations listed above. Additional well-designed research is needed on other (class of agents) interventions and in other cancer treatment settings.

### Interventions for managing halitosis [^0d49f4c4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Halitosis or bad breath is a symptom in which a noticeably unpleasant breath odour is present due to an underlying oral or systemic disease. 50% to 60% of the world population has experienced this problem which can lead to social stigma and loss of self-confidence. Multiple interventions have been tried to control halitosis ranging from mouthwashes and toothpastes to lasers. This new Cochrane Review incorporates Cochrane Reviews previously published on tongue scraping and mouthrinses for halitosis.

Objectives

The objectives of this review were to assess the effects of various interventions used to control halitosis due to oral diseases only. We excluded studies including patients with halitosis secondary to systemic disease and halitosis-masking interventions.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 8 April 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 3) in the Cochrane Library (searched 8 April 2019), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 8 April 2019), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 8 April 2019). We also searched LILACS BIREME (1982 to 19 April 2019), the National Database of Indian Medical Journals (1985 to 19 April 2019), OpenGrey (1992 to 19 April 2019), and CINAHL EBSCO (1937 to 19 April 2019). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov (8 April 2019), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (8 April 2019), the ISRCTN Registry (19 April 2019), the Clinical Trials Registry - India (19 April 2019), were searched for ongoing trials. We also searched the cross-references of included studies and systematic reviews published on the topic. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which involved adults over the age of 16, and any intervention for managing halitosis compared to another or placebo, or no intervention. The active interventions or controls were administered over a minimum of one week and with no upper time limit. We excluded quasi-randomised trials, trials comparing the results for less than one week follow-up, and studies including advanced periodontitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two pairs of review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We estimated mean differences (MDs) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 44 trials in the review with 1809 participants comparing an intervention with a placebo or a control. The age of participants ranged from 17 to 77 years. Most of the trials reported on short-term follow-up (ranging from one week to four weeks). Only one trial reported long-term follow-up (three months). Three studies were at low overall risk of bias, 16 at high overall risk of bias, and the remaining 25 at unclear overall risk of bias. We compared different types of interventions which were categorised as mechanical debridement, chewing gums, systemic deodorising agents, topical agents, toothpastes, mouthrinse/mouthwash, tablets, and combination methods. Mechanical debridement: for mechanical tongue cleaning versus no tongue cleaning, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported organoleptic test (OLT) scores (MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.07; 2 trials, 46 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Chewing gums: for 0.6% eucalyptus chewing gum versus placebo chewing gum, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.11; 1 trial, 65 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Systemic deodorising agents: for 1000 mg champignon versus placebo, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome patient-reported visual analogue scale (VAS) scores (MD -1.07, 95% CI -14.51 to 12.37; 1 trial, 40 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for dentist-reported OLT score or adverse events. Topical agents: for hinokitiol gel versus placebo gel, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -0.27, 95% CI -1.26 to 0.72; 1 trial, 18 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Toothpastes: for 0.3% triclosan toothpaste versus control toothpaste, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -3.48, 95% CI -3.77 to -3.19; 1 trial, 81 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Mouthrinse/mouthwash: for mouthwash containing chlorhexidine and zinc acetate versus placebo mouthwash, the evidence was very uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.18; 1 trial, 44 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events. Tablets: no data were reported on key outcomes for this comparison. Combination methods: for brushing plus cetylpyridium mouthwash versus brushing, the evidence was uncertain for the outcome dentist-reported OLT scores (MD -0.48, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.24; 1 trial, 70 participants; low-certainty evidence). No data were reported for patient-reported OLT score or adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

We found low- to very low-certainty evidence to support the effectiveness of interventions for managing halitosis compared to placebo or control for the OLT and patient-reported outcomes tested. We were unable to draw any conclusions regarding the superiority of any intervention or concentration. Well-planned RCTs need to be conducted by standardising the interventions and concentrations.

### Systematic scoping review of the noma evidence landscape: current knowledge and gaps [^5edb4583]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Treatment modalities

Most studies (96%, 352/366, n=4207 patients) reported treatment details for noma cases or study population. 30% of studies described medical interventions (108/366), 26% surgical interventions (94/366) and 33% of publications reported both medical and surgical interventions (119/366). A further 8% reported neither medical nor surgical interventions (31/366). The intervention was unknown for a large number of patients (n=8210), though from a limited number of studies in 4% (14/366).

Across 352 studies, 381 different therapeutic interventions were described (online supplemental SF3 table 10). Online supplemental table 13 SF3 depicts the total publications and patients for each of the five subgroup intervention categories. While providing an overview of the reported literature, these results may not align with current intervention proportions. Notably, the majority of included patients received alternative therapies, a result influenced by a single retrospective cross-sectional study of over 7000 patients.In this study, the most common intervention was home treatment with charcoal in 42% of patients (n=3011), followed by 13% (n=951) opting for traditional treatment, including cultural rituals. The majority of publications (n=208, 56.8%) reported other medical interventions and therapies (ie, not antibiotics, see online supplemental figure 1 SF3), which included a wide range of treatments from opiates, tincture of chloride, topical silver nitrate, topical zinc peroxide, vitamin therapy to blood transfusion. Antibiotics (or bactericidal products) were prescribed in 176 studies, only two of which were interventional studies across different noma stages.Consequently, there is no evidence to support better results from any antibiotic family (online supplemental SF3 table15 and figure13). Alongside the use of antibiotics in the acute stages, a number of case reports have shown that early intervention, with proper oral hygiene, debridement and chlorhexidine mouthwash, can lead to proper wound healing and no long-term adverse effects.

For each study design, the number of patients and studies by intervention category are presented in table 2. Further discussion of noma treatment by study design, noma stage and year of publication, including numbers by additional subgroup intervention categories and detailed observations are provided in online supplemental SF3 section 5. This review found little evidence on noma prevention with no studies examining preventative interventions online supplemental SF3 section 4.

### Addressing pain in oral mucositis: narrative review of current practices and emerging treatments [^4aa51cae]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this review highlights the range of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions aimed at alleviating pain in OM. OM remains a significant complication of cancer therapy, with complex pathogenesis and substantial impact on patient quality of life. Enhanced pain management strategies are crucial, as they can reduce treatment delays, minimize dose reductions, and ultimately enhance therapeutic outcomes. Additionally, effective management may lower healthcare costs by decreasing the need for supportive interventions and hospitalizations.

Given the complexity of OM pathogenesis and the diverse inflammatory mediators involved in pain perception, no single intervention has proven sufficient to address OM across its various stages. Effective management often requires a combination of treatments, beginning with topical medications and escalating to systemic therapy. Despite the variety of available options, a well-established gold-standard protocol has yet to be defined.

Assessing the efficacy of mouthwashes for pain management presents challenges due to variations in their composition and concentration across clinical studies. This lack of standardization complicates the application of findings to clinical practice. Certain mouthwashes, such as those containing lidocaine, doxepin, or benzydamine, have demonstrated promising results for pain relief. However, the potential benefits of combining different pain management strategies remain unclear. Further clinical data are needed to determine whether such combinations could enhance pain reduction. Looking ahead, prioritizing research on novel molecular pathways—such as transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and neurotrophic factors—holds promise for the development of more targeted and effective therapies.

### Treatment of oral mucositis after peripheral blood SCT with ATL-104 mouthwash: results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^7388f1c3]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

ATL-104 is a potent mitogen for epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract. In animal models, ATL-104 aids regeneration of the gastrointestinal tract after treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. The effect of ATL-104 on mucositis in patients requiring high-dose melphalan or BEAM before peripheral blood SCT (PBSCT) was investigated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-part study. Patients were randomized to ATL-104 (50, 100 or 150 mg) or placebo once daily for 3 days before chemotherapy and 3 days after PBSCT. Part one of the study was a dose-escalation design; part two was a parallel group design using all three ATL-104 doses. Patients were followed up for 28 days post-treatment. Severity of signs and symptoms were assessed and used to calculate scores for standard toxicity rating scales (WHO, Western Consortium for Cancer Nursing Research (WCCNR)). Sixty-three patients were treated. Treatment with ATL-104 substantially reduced the median duration of severe oral mucositis (WHO grade 3 or 4) compared with placebo (median duration: ATL-104 groups 2 or 3 days, placebo 10.5 days). The effect of ATL-104 on the incidence of severe oral mucositis was inconclusive. Similar results were obtained using the WCCNR Scale. Adverse events (AEs) were predominantly mild or moderate in intensity. Gastrointestinal AE were most common.

### Datopotamab deruxtecan-associated select adverse events: clinical practices and institutional protocols on prophylaxis, monitoring, and management [^f3434105]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

If OM/S is suspected, start by ruling out other causes (eg, oral thrush, herpetic lesions) and treat accordingly (eg, oral nystatin for oral thrush). If OM/S is confirmed, the clinical trial protocols suggested increasing the frequency of bland mouth rinses up to every hour, if necessary and applicable, and provide adequate topical pain management (eg, doxepin 0.5%, viscous lidocaine 2%).In addition to continuing prophylactic dexamethasone mouthwash or alternative, to temporarily help with oral pain so patients can eat and drink more comfortably, we consider prescribing a lidocaine-based mouthwash, such as one consisting of diphenhydramine, viscous lidocaine, and aluminum-magnesium hydroxide to be used 15-20 minutes before eating meals. We also may consider a topical clobetasol gel dabbed on mouth sores to be applied twice daily until improved and 3 times weekly until resolution. The mouth sores should be dried with gauze before applying the clobetasol gel. If severe OM/S occurs (grade ≥3), and it cannot be resolved topically or with dose holds or reductions, we also had significant success with using a short course of oral corticosteroids, as per institutional guidelines. We recommend patients drink smoothies, shakes, and other cold beverages to keep well hydrated and/or supplemental caloric drinks to help with oral AEs. We also counsel our patients to avoid crunchy, spicy, hot, and citrus/acidic foods. Additionally, patients should be educated to avoid tobacco and alcohol consumption.

Daily oral care plan for patients—dentures, rinsing, moisturization, lip care, and follow-up: For patients with dentures, remove dentures/plates/prostheses before brushing, brush and rinse them after meals and at bedtime, and remove them for long periods (at least 8 hours per 24 hours) to soak in rinsing solution. Rinsing recommendations include a bland rinse recipe of 1 teaspoon salt plus 1 teaspoon baking soda in 4 cups of water several times a day, while avoiding club soda and alcohol- or astringent-based commercial mouthwashes; debriding should only be done if absolutely necessary when loose tissue causes gagging or choking. Moisturize the mouth with water, artificial saliva, or other water‑soluble lubricants; avoid glycerin or lemon‑glycerin swabs; apply lubricant after each cleaning, at bedtime, and as needed; water‑based lubricants must be used more frequently; and perform frequent rinsing as needed with a basic mouth rinse. For lip care, use only animal or plant‑based oils such as bees wax, cocoa butter, and lanolin, and avoid petroleum‑based products. Follow up with a dentist a minimum of every 6 months, and report any signs or symptoms to a dentist or oncologist.

Non-Pharmacological Interventions

Oral cryotherapy (OC) is an inexpensive intervention with documented evidence on OM prevention. Its effects are mediated by local vasoconstriction, thereby limiting the toxic effects of systemic chemotherapy in the oral mucosa.The current MASCC/ISO guidelines recommend OC 30 minutes prior to a bolus of 5-FU chemotherapy, and as part of conditioning therapy for HSCT, including high-dose melphalan.A recent umbrella review demonstrated that cryotherapy reduces the incidence of severe OM.Furthermore, in patients undergoing HSCT, OC and photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) reduced the incidence, severity, pain, and duration of OM.

PBMT is a laser-based treatment with growing evidence for the prevention and management of OM. Preclinical investigations have demonstrated that PBMT influences tissue repair by activating fibroblast activity, thereby promoting extracellular matrix deposition in the injured mucosa. Moreover, PBMT increases ATP production and enhances a cellular antioxidant state, leading to decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and tissue repair.The light-emitting diode (LED) beams are frequently administered intraorally for 30 to 60 seconds per point, with a wavelength range between 600–1000 nm.A recent systematic review and meta-analysis involving 14 RCTs evaluated the efficacy of PBMT in managing OM in patients with head and neck cancer. The authors demonstrated that PBMT significantly alleviated pain and decreased the incidence and disease severity of OM.

Overall, OC and PBMT decrease disease severity in patients with OM and are recommended by the MASCC/ISO guidelines for OM prevention in cancer patients undergoing HSCT. More clinical trials are needed to determine the extent of pain relief of these interventions among patients with HNC and different chemotherapeutic regimens.

### Interventions for replacing missing teeth: maintaining and re-establishing healthy tissues around dental implants [^96e9f5c0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

To maintain healthy tissues around oral implants it is important to institute an effective preventive regimen (supportive therapy) and when a pathologic condition of the tissue around implants is diagnosed, an intervention should be initiated as soon as possible. Different maintenance regimens and treatment strategies for failing implants have been suggested, however it is unclear which are the most effective.

Objectives

To test the null hypothesis of no difference between different interventions for maintaining or re-establishing healthy tissues around dental implants.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Oral Health Group Specialised Register, The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. Hand searching included several dental journals. In addition, authors of all identified trials, fifty-five oral implant manufacturers and two extensive personal libraries (ME and AJ) were consulted.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials of oral implants comparing agents or interventions for maintaining or re-establishing healthy tissues around dental implants.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were independently extracted, in duplicate, by two reviewers (ME & HW). Authors were contacted for details of randomisation and withdrawals and a quality assessment was carried out. The Cochrane Oral Health Group's statistical guidelines were followed.

Main Results

Nine RCTs were identified. Five of these trials, which reported results from a total of 127 patients, were suitable for inclusion in the review.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is only a little reliable evidence for which are the most effective interventions for maintaining health around peri-implant tissues. There was no evidence that the use of powered or sonic toothbrushes was superior to manual toothbrushing. There is a weak evidence that Listerine mouthwash, used twice a day for 30 seconds, as adjunct to routine oral hygiene is effective in reducing plaque formation and marginal bleeding around implants. There was no evidence that phosphoric etching gel offered any clinical advantage over mechanical debridement. These findings are based on RCTs having short follow-up periods and few subjects. There is not any reliable evidence for the most effective regimens for long-term maintenance. For the treatment of failing implants (peri-implantitis) there is not any reliable evidence for preferring one therapeutic regimen over another. More RCTs should be conducted in this area. In particular, there is a definite need for trials investigating which is the most effective approach for the treatment of peri-implantitis and for trials with longer follow-up for maintenance. Such trials should be reported according the CONSORT guidelines (http://www.consort-statement.org/).

Dry mouth and sicca syndrome with ICI—dry mouth (xerostomia) may occur as its own irAE or as part of sicca; it is important to account for the possibility of infection during diagnosis and monitoring; the overall incidence of dry mouth varies from 3%–24% across studies, and for initial management of dry mouth or pain with oral mucositis, oral rinses with doxepin mouthwash or diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash have been shown to reduce radiotherapy-related mucositis pain but data are lacking on efficacy in ICI-treated patients; sicca accompanied by true Sjögren syndrome is rare, occurring at a rate of <1% in a registry study of grade ≥2 irAEs; the median time to onset of dry mouth indicative of sicca syndrome is 70 days, and patients often do not experience full resolution and may require long-term care for salivary hypofunction with risk for loss of teeth.

### Systematic review of anti-inflammatory agents for the management of oral mucositis in cancer patients [^3e51b512]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this project was to review the available literature and define clinical practice guidelines for the use of anti-inflammatory agents for the prevention and treatment of oral mucositis in cancer patients.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review was conducted by the Mucositis Study Group of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society of Oral Oncology. The body of evidence for use of each intervention, in each cancer treatment setting, was assigned an evidence level. Based on the evidence level, one of the following three guideline determinations was possible: recommendation, suggestion, and no guideline possible.

Results

Forty-one papers were reviewed. There was sufficient evidence to recommend the use of benzydamine mouthwash for the prevention of oral mucositis in head and neck cancer patients receiving moderate-dose radiation therapy (up to 50 Gy), without concomitant chemotherapy. A new suggestion was developed against the use of misoprostol mouthwash for the prevention of oral mucositis in head and neck cancer patients receiving radiation therapy. Positive results were reported for some other anti-inflammatory agents. However, no guidelines were able to be developed for any other agents due to insufficient and/or conflicting evidence.

Conclusions

The use of anti-inflammatory agents continues to be a promising strategy for the prevention and treatment of oral mucositis. Additional well-designed studies are needed to examine the use of this class of agents for oral mucositis.

Head and neck cancer oral mucositis—analgesic mouthwashes and neuromodulators: In a randomized phase III trial in patients treated with RT (N = 275), diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash and doxepin mouthwash each produced significantly greater reductions in mucositis pain during the first 4 hours than placebo (P = .004 and P = .02, respectively), and the practicality and effectiveness of the doxepin-based regimen during an entire course of RT is not established. Gabapentin is under investigation: in a prospective randomized pilot in chemoradiation-treated patients (N = 79), gabapentin yielded greater pain reduction than usual care (P = .004); additional studies reported reduced narcotic use including with very-high-dose prophylactic gabapentin (2700 mg daily), and an unplanned secondary analysis showed high-dose prophylactic gabapentin (3600 mg daily) was associated with greater time to first use of opioids versus 900 mg daily (P < .001), with toxicity of large dosages not adequately explored. Pregabalin improved outcomes in RT-related neuropathic pain (N = 128), with greater pain relief (P = .006 for 30% pain relief and P = .003 for 50% pain relief) and greater pain intensity reduction (P = .003) than placebo.

### Oral mucosal adverse events with chlorhexidine 2% mouthwash in ICU [^eea10c6f]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Dear Editor,

Oral care using a chlorhexidine solution is commonly used as an infection prevention measure in European ICUs. The preventive effects of different decontamination strategies, one of which is mouthwash with chlorhexidine digluconate 2 % (CHX 2 %), on the incidence of ICU-acquired bacteremia with multidrug-resistant bacteria is being investigated in a multicenter cluster-randomized study in 13 ICUs in six European countries [NCT02208154] (see Supplementary Material for detailed methods). An unexpected high incidence of oral mucosal lesions was observed in ICU patients receiving CHX 2 %.

Oral mucosal lesions, including erosive lesions, ulcerations, white/yellow plaque formation, and bleeding mucosa were observed in 29 of 295 patients (9.8 %) that had received CHX 2 % in the first two hospitals testing this intervention (Supplementary Table S1, Pictures 1–4). The median time to onset of oral lesions was 8.0 days (IQR 4.5–11.0) in the 24 patients in whom duration of exposure could be ascertained. CHX 2 % was discontinued prematurely in 16/29 cases and oral mucosal lesions disappeared after cessation of CHX 2 % in all patients.

Patient characteristics were comparable for the baseline (n = 310) and CHX 2 % periods (n = 295; Supplementary Table S2) for the two ICUs. During the baseline period CHX 0.20 and 0.12 % were used for oral care in hospitals A and B, respectively, without evidence of oral lesions in any patient. All other procedures related to oral care remained identical in each hospital during both periods.

Amongst the CHX 2 % treated patients, occurrence of side effects was associated with male gender, APACHE II score, length of stay in the ICU, and duration of mechanical ventilation, suggesting a dose-response relationship, with increasing risks of oral mucosal lesions for the more severely ill patients, undergoing mechanical ventilation, and receiving CHX 2 % for longer periods (Table 1). This hypothesis is supported by the localization of the lesions in the oral cavity; most lesions occurred where stasis of the mouthwash might have occurred—despite suctioning after administration—such as below the tongue and in the buccal pockets.

Basic oral care (BOC)—scope, components, and evidence/expert opinion: BOC includes routine actions to reduce oral bacterial load, prevent infections, and provide comfort and usually involves mechanical cleaning, bland mouthwashes, and hydration/lubrication. BOC content addresses patient education, multiagent combination oral care protocols, professional oral care, saline rinses, sodium bicarbonate mouthwash, and chlorhexidine (CHX) rinses. The literature on mixed‑medication mouth rinses was reviewed but excluded due to ingredient heterogeneity. BOC remains an important best practice, but as a research area high‑quality evidence is limited; to prevent misinterpretation, the panel expanded the guideline with expert opinion for professional oral care, patient education, and rinse with saline or sodium bicarbonate.

### Oral ulcerations in an immunosuppressed pediatric patient [^896f577c]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the best initial management of the patient? 
A. Topical corticosteroids and hematology consultation regarding sirolimus usage
B. Topical analgesics while maintaining sirolimus dose
C. “Miracle Mouthwash” (ie, lidocaine, diphenhydramine, antacid) and stop sirolimus
D. Biopsy
E. Observation

Answers: 
A. Topical corticosteroids and hematology consultation regarding sirolimus usage – Correct. Topical corticosteroids provide relief of mIAS, specifically reducing associated pain and lesion duration. However, the causative agent of the oral ulcerations must also be addressed. Since post-transplant immunosuppressive therapy is still required, decreasing sirolimus dose or switching to a different GVHD prophylactic agent is most appropriate. Our patient’s oral ulcerations resolved following sirolimus discontinuation recommended by her hematologist.
B. Topical analgesics while maintaining sirolimus dose – Incorrect. Analgesics may be useful adjuvants in some cases; however, analgesics do not address the underlying etiology of the mucosal lesions in this patient.
C. “Miracle Mouthwash” (ie, lidocaine, diphenhydramine, antacid) and stop sirolimus – Incorrect. This solution has been shown to be ineffective in improving the frequency or severity of sirolimus ulcerations as it provides only brief symptomatic relief.Additionally, it would be inappropriate to discontinue transplant GVHD prophylaxis without consulting the prescribing hematologist.
D. Biopsy – Incorrect. mIAS is a clinical diagnosis. Biopsy is not warranted, and there is a paucity of literature regarding specific histopathologic features of mIAS. One in vitro study demonstrated increased epithelial surface disruption, vacuole formation, and early dysplastic changes when oral mucosa was incubated in everolimus compared to control media.
E. Observation – Incorrect. The patient has pain affecting oral intake and quality of life; therefore, intervention is necessary. Use of topical corticosteroids and management of sirolimus therapy address both symptoms and etiology of the lesions. On literature review, permanent resolution of mIAS does not occur while the inciting dose of sirolimus is continued.

### Full-mouth treatment modalities (within 24 hours) for chronic periodontitis in adults [^2eb5f503]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Periodontitis is chronic inflammation that causes damage to the soft tissues and bones supporting the teeth. Mild to moderate periodontitis affects up to 50% of adults. Conventional treatment is quadrant scaling and root planing. In an attempt to enhance treatment outcomes, alternative protocols for anti-infective periodontal therapy have been introduced: full-mouth scaling (FMS) and full-mouth disinfection (FMD), which is scaling plus use of an antiseptic. This review updates our previous review of full-mouth treatment modalities, which was published in 2008.

Objectives

To evaluate the clinical effects of 1) full-mouth scaling (over 24 hours) or 2) full-mouth disinfection (over 24 hours) for the treatment of chronic periodontitis compared to conventional quadrant scaling and root planing (over a series of visits at least one week apart). A secondary objective was to evaluate whether there was a difference in clinical effect between full-mouth disinfection and full-mouth scaling.

Search Methods

The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 26 March 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library 2015, Issue 2), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 26 March 2015), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 26 March 2015) and CINAHL via EBSCO (1937 to 26 March 2015). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing studies. There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication in the searches of the electronic databases. We scanned reference lists from relevant articles and contacted the authors of eligible studies to identify trials and obtain additional information.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least three months of follow-up that evaluated full-mouth scaling and root planing within 24 hours with adjunctive use of an antiseptic such as chlorhexidine (FMD) or without the use of antiseptic (FMS), compared to conventional quadrant scaling and root planing (control). Participants had a clinical diagnosis of chronic periodontitis according to the International Classification of Periodontal Diseases. We excluded studies of people with aggressive periodontitis, systemic disorders or who were taking antibiotics.

Data Collection and Analysis

Several review authors independently conducted data extraction and risk of bias assessment (which focused on method of randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding of examiners and completeness of follow-up). Our primary outcome was tooth loss and secondary outcomes were change in probing pocket depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (BOP) and probing attachment (i.e. clinical attachment level; CAL), and adverse events. We followed the methodological guidelines of The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included 12 trials, which recruited 389 participants. No studies assessed the primary outcome tooth loss.Ten trials compared FMS and control; three of these were assessed as being at high risk of bias, three as unclear risk and four as low risk. There was no evidence for a benefit for FMS over the control for change in probing pocket depth (PPD), gain in probing attachment (i.e. clinical attachment level; CAL) or bleeding on probing (BOP). The difference in changes between FMS and control for whole mouth PPD at three to four months was 0.01 mm higher (95% CI -0.17 to 0.19, three trials, 82 participants). There was no evidence of heterogeneity. The difference in changes for CAL was 0.02 mm lower (95% CI -0.26 to 0.22, three trials, 82 participants), and the difference in change in BOP was 2.86 per cent of sites lower (95% CI -7.65 to 1.93, four trials, 120 participants).We included six trials in the meta-analyses comparing FMD and control, with two trials assessed as being at high risk of bias, one as low and three as unclear. The analyses did not indicate a benefit for FMD over the control for PPD, CAL or BOP. The difference in changes for whole-mouth PPD between FMD and control at three to four months was 0.13 mm higher (95% CI -0.09 to 0.34, two trials, 44 participants). There was no evidence of heterogeneity. The difference in changes for CAL was 0.04mm higher (95% CI -0.25 to 0.33, two trials, 44 participants) and the difference in change in BOP being 12.59 higher for FMD (95% CI -8.58 to 33.77, three trials, 68 participants).Three trials were included in the analyses comparing FMS and FMD. The mean difference in PPD change at three to four months was 0.11 mm lower (-0.34 to 0.12, two trials, 45 participants) indicating no evidence of a difference between the two interventions. There was a difference in the gain in CAL at three to four months (-0.25 mm, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.07, two trials, 45 participants), favouring FMD but this was not found at six to eight months. There was no evidence for a difference between FMS and FMD for BOP (-1.59, 95% CI -9.97 to 6.80, two trials, 45 participants).Analyses were conducted for different teeth types (single- or multi-rooted) and for teeth with different levels of probing depth at baseline, for PPD, CAL and BOP. There was insufficient evidence of a benefit for either FMS or FMD.Harms and adverse events were reported in eight studies. The most important harm identified was an increased body temperature after FMS or FMD treatments.We assessed the quality of the evidence for each comparison and outcome as 'low' because of design limitations leading to risk of bias and because of the small number of trials and participants, which led to imprecision in the effect estimates.

Authors' Conclusions

The inclusion of five additional RCTs in this updated review comparing the clinical effects of conventional mechanical treatment with FMS and FMD approaches for the treatment of chronic periodontitis has not changed the conclusions of the original review. From the twelve included trials there is no clear evidence that FMS or FMD provide additional benefit compared to conventional scaling and root planing. In practice, the decision to select one approach to non-surgical periodontal therapy over another should include patient preference and the convenience of the treatment schedule.

### Prophylaxis with GM-CSF mouthwashes does not reduce frequency and duration of severe oral mucositis in patients with solid tumors undergoing high-dose chemotherapy with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation rescue: a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study [^56268c07]. Annals of Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) mouthwashes in the prevention of severe mucositis induced by high doses of chemotherapy.

Patients and Methods

Ninety consecutive patients affected by solid tumors and undergoing high-dose chemotherapy with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation rescue were randomized to receive placebo versus GM-CSF mouthwash 150 micro g/day. Patients were stratified on the basis of the conditioning treatment and the consequent different risk of severe oral mucositis. Treatment was administered from the day after the end of chemotherapy until the resolution of stomatitis and/or neutrophil recovery.

Results

The statistical analyses were intention-to-treat and involved all patients who entered the study. The severity of stomatitis was evaluated daily by the physicians according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria. Both study and control groups were compared with respect to the frequency [30% versus 36%, chi(2) exact test, not significant (NS)] and mean duration (4.8 +/- 4.7 versus 4.4 +/- 2.7 days, t-test, NS) of severe stomatitis (grade > or =3). Oral pain was evaluated daily by patients themselves by means of a 10 cm analog visual scale: the mean (+/- standard error of the mean) maximum mucositis scores were 4.8 +/- 3.5 versus 4.2 +/- 3.5 cm (t-test, NS). Furthermore, 15/46 patients in the study group (33%) and 19/44 patients in the control group experienced pain requiring opioids (chi(2) exact test, NS).

Conclusion

We did not find any evidence to indicate that prophylaxis with GM-CSF mouthwash can help to reduce the severity of mucositis in the setting of the patients we studied.

### Prophylaxis, clinical management, and monitoring of datopotamab deruxtecan-associated oral mucositis / stomatitis [^60a26d56]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Oral mucositis/stomatitis (hereafter stomatitis) is a common dose-limiting toxicity seen with various classes of cancer treatment. Symptoms associated with stomatitis, primarily oral pain, may impact patient quality of life and may lead to dose delay and reduction or treatment discontinuation. Datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) is a novel trophoblast cell surface antigen 2-directed antibody-drug conjugate undergoing clinical investigation in multiple solid tumor types. Stomatitis is among the most reported adverse events associated with Dato-DXd, with most cases being grades 1-2. This article reviews the incidence of stomatitis seen with Dato-DXd, including in the phase III pivotal studies TROPION-Lung01 and TROPION-Breast01 (in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer, respectively), both studies met a dual primary endpoint of statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival compared to standard-of-care chemotherapies. Developing new cancer therapies requires evidence-based strategies to successfully prevent, monitor, and manage adverse events. Accordingly, a thorough evaluation of potential underlying mechanisms, risk factors, available clinical data, and adequacy of preventive and management recommendations for stomatitis is presented here. Prophylaxis recommendations for a daily oral care plan include oral hygiene education and the use of a prophylactic steroid-containing mouthwash. Ongoing studies continue to collect data on Dato-DXd-associated stomatitis to further characterize clinical features and possible mechanisms of this toxicity. Appropriate management may reduce the incidence, duration, and severity of events, improve quality of life, and support patient adherence to treatment.

### Interventions for replacing missing teeth: maintaining and recovering soft tissue health around dental implants [^dd519468]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

It is important to institute an effective supportive therapy to maintain or recover soft tissue health around dental implants. Different maintenance regimens have been suggested, however it is unclear which are the most effective.

Objectives

To test the null hypotheses of no difference between different interventions (1) for maintaining healthy peri-implant soft tissues, and (2) for recovering soft tissue health, against the alternative hypothesis of a difference.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. Handsearching included several dental journals. We checked the bibliographies of the identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and relevant review articles for studies outside the handsearched journals. We wrote to authors of all identified RCTs, to more than 55 oral implant manufacturers and to an internet discussion group to find unpublished or ongoing RCTs. No language restrictions were applied. The last electronic search was conducted on 13 June 2007.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials comparing agents or interventions for maintaining or recovering healthy tissues around dental implants.

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening of eligible studies, assessment of the methodological quality of the trials and data extraction were conducted in duplicate and independently by two review authors. Results were expressed as random-effects models using standardised mean differences for continuous data and risk ratios for dichotomous data with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

Eighteen RCTs were identified. Nine of these trials, which reported results from a total of 238 patients, were included. Follow ups ranged between 6 weeks and 1 year. No meta-analysis could be made since every RCT tested different interventions. Listerine mouthwash showed a reduction of 54% in plaque and 34% in marginal bleeding compared with a placebo. Two trials evaluated the efficacy of powered and sonic toothbrushes compared to manual toothbrushing and showed no statistically significant differences, though more patients liked the sonic brush. No statistical differences were found between brushing with a hyaluronic or a chlorhexidine gel, between cleaning with an etching gel or manually, between injecting a chlorhexidine or a physiologic solution inside the implant's inner part and between submucosal minocycline and a chlorhexidine gel. When an amine fluoride/stannous fluoride (AmF/SnF(2)) mouthrinse was compared with a chlorhexidine one, no statistically significant differences were found for implant failures and staining index while patients preferred and had less taste change with the AmF/SnF(2) mouthrinse. Self administered subgingival chlorhexidine irrigation resulted in statistically significantly lower plaque and marginal bleeding than a chlorhexidine mouthwash, however the mouthwash was given at a suboptimal dosage.

Authors' Conclusions

There was only little reliable evidence for which are the most effective interventions for maintaining or recovering health of peri-implant soft tissues. The included RCTs had short follow-up periods and few subjects. There was not any reliable evidence for the most effective regimens for long term maintenance. This should not be interpreted as current maintenance regimens are ineffective. There was weak evidence that Listerine mouthwash, used twice a day for 30 seconds, as an adjunct to routine oral hygiene, is effective in reducing plaque and marginal bleeding around implants. More RCTs should be conducted in this area. In particular, there is a definite need for trials powered to find possible differences, using primary outcome measures and with much longer follow up. Such trials should be reported according to the CONSORT guidelines (http://www.consort-statement.org/).

### The role of benzydamine in prevention and treatment of chemoradiotherapy-induced mucositis [^b1750d37]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Multifactorial approach and international guidelines

As soon as inflammation has been widely demonstrated to play a key role in the pathogenesis of mucositis by initiating a broad of cascades and pathways that leads to ulceration, studies have concentrated their efforts in finding the best way to prevent and treat this common RT and CHT side effect. Through the years, lots of strategies have been proposed to control both the initiation and progression of mucositis. Anti-inflammatory agents, analgesics, mouthwashes, oral care protocols and other non-pharmacological remedies and devices (photobiomodulation for example) are reported in literature as being the historical milestones when approaching patients suffering from mucositis.

In everyday clinical practice, all these agents and strategies are usually combined in a markedly different way.

The Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer and International Society for Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO) guidelines provide clinicians with a set of interventions for mucositis based on strong evidence. They are continuously updated through a systematic approach to weigh the evidence and analyze the clinical applicability of different strategies [,–].

Mucositis management is a complex objective because of the presence of many confounding factors; thus, a multimodal combined methodology should be considered and strongly preferred. Agents, both local and systemic, able to address the multifactorial aspects and multi-layered basis of mucositis are robustly recommended. Moreover, both initiation and progression of mucositis are deeply influenced by the patients’ different baseline characteristics like microbioma, oral hygiene and saliva environment. The optimal treatment should, thus, be designed both on patients’ characteristics and on the idea that mucositis needs, definitely, an extensively multimodal strategy based on the contribution of a multidisciplinary team supporting patients in every phase of their treatment. This team should comprise other professional stakeholders like dentists, nutritionists, pain therapists and nurses in order to tailor treatment on patients thus considering the patient as a whole.

### Interventions for replacing missing teeth: maintaining health around dental implants [^ecc0d7ae]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

To maintain healthy tissues around dental implants it is important to institute an effective preventive regimen (supportive therapy). Different maintenance regimens have been suggested, however it is unclear which are the most effective.

Objectives

To test the null hypothesis of no difference between different interventions for maintaining healthy tissues around dental implants.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. Handsearching included several dental journals. We checked the bibliographies of the identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and relevant review articles for studies outside the handsearched journals. We wrote to authors of all identified RCTs, to more than 55 oral implant manufacturers and an internet discussion group to find unpublished or ongoing RCTs. No language restrictions were applied. The last electronic search was conducted on 2 February 2004.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials of oral implants comparing agents or interventions for maintaining or recovering healthy tissues around dental implants.

Data Collection and Analysis

We carried out a quality assessment of the included RCTs in duplicate and contacted the authors for missing information. We independently extracted the data in duplicate. We followed the Cochrane Oral Health Group's statistical guidelines.

Main Results

Fourteen RCTs were identified. Five of these trials, which reported results from a total of 127 patients, were suitable for inclusion in the review. Two trials evaluated the efficacy of powered and sonic toothbrushes, respectively, when compared to manual toothbrushing and showed no statistically significant differences. One RCT compared Listerine versus placebo mouthwashes showing a reduction of 54% in plaque and 34% in marginal bleeding compared with the placebo. One trial compared self administered subgingival chlorhexidine irrigation versus chlorhexidine mouthwash. The group using chlorhexidine irrigation resulted in statistically significantly lower mean plaque scores and a marginal bleeding index than the group using chlorhexidine mouthwash, however the mouthwash was given at a suboptimal dosage. One study compared etching gel with mechanical debridement showing no statistical differences. Follow ups ranged between 6 weeks and 5 months. It was not possible to make any meta-analysis as each trial assessed different interventions.

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is only little reliable evidence for which are the most effective interventions for maintaining health around peri-implant tissues. There was no evidence that the use of powered or sonic toothbrushes was superior to manual toothbrushing. There is weak evidence that Listerine mouthwash, used twice a day for 30 seconds, as adjunct to routine oral hygiene is effective in reducing plaque formation and marginal bleeding around implants. There was no evidence that phosphoric etching gel offered any clinical advantage over mechanical debridement. These findings are based on RCTs having short follow-up periods and few subjects. There is not any reliable evidence for the most effective regimens for long term maintenance. More RCTs should be conducted in this area. In particular, there is a definite need for trials powered to find possible differences, using primary outcome measures and with much longer follow up. Such trials should be reported according the CONSORT guidelines (http://www.consort-statement.org/).

### Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of the efficacy of propolis mouthwash in cancer therapy-induced oral mucositis [^df54550e]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of propolis mouthwash in cancer patients with therapy-induced oral mucositis.

Methods

This was a systematic review of randomized control trails (RCTs). We searched ten electronic databases for studies published prior to April 06, 2017. The included RCTs were published in English and Chinese. The Jadad score was used to evaluate the quality of the articles identified. Two reviewers independently evaluated each of the studies. The data were entered into Review Manager (RevMan) 5.3 software and checked for accuracy. Outcome incidence analysis was performed using odds ratios (ORs).

Results

Of the 352 articles identified, five potentially relevant articles met our inclusion criteria. These 5 RCTs included a total of 209 participants. The Jadad score for methodological quality was 3.60±0.55. No obvious publication bias was noted. The incidence of severe oral mucositis was significantly lower in the propolis group than in the control group (OR=0.35, p=0. 003). The corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was 0.18 to 0.70. Between-study heterogeneity was low (I 2 =0.000, p=0.45). No side effects were reported.

Conclusions

Propolis mouthwash is effective and safe in the treatment of severe oral mucositis. To maintain propolis safety, propolis usage should occur under the supervision of medical staff and health professionals. Future multi-center studies and a clinical protocol are needed to confirm the current findings regarding the efficacy and safety of propolis mouthwash.

### MASCC / ISOO clinical practice statement: current understanding on controversies in basic oral care in hemato-oncology and hematopoietic cell transplantation [^08da63e0]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). High credibility.

Hemato-oncology oral mucositis—lidocaine mouthwash use states there is a discussion of whether lidocaine hydrochloride anesthetic mouthwash should be advised in patients suffering from mucositis-associated oral pain; lidocaine viscous solution is commonly used and overall is tolerated very well. Best standard of care indicates that lidocaine rinse, swish and spit, may be considered to palliate oral mucosal pain in cancer patients, it is advised to inform the patient about the expected numbness sensation prior to the first rinse, and it is advised to instruct the patient to avoid gargling; in cases of solitary painful ulcers, local application with a cotton swab may be considered instead of a rinse. The manufacturer information sheet includes an instruction against using lidocaine rinse within 60 min prior to a meal, the effect of lidocaine on oral pain relief is of short duration and will not last until 60 min after the rinse, and it is at the clinician’s and patient’s discretion whether to use the lidocaine mouth rinse prior to the meal. Additional cautions include that systemic absorption in patients with oral ulceration has been reported; however, these levels are far below the anti-arrhythmic therapeutic window, it is advised to limit the total number of daily lidocaine rinses to the lowest dosage that results in effective anesthesia, especially in children, some patients may develop adverse effects and hypersensitivity is a contraindication, and rinsing with lidocaine solution is not advised in children under 3 years old.

### Full-mouth disinfection for the treatment of adult chronic periodontitis [^7f380fb3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

In an attempt to enhance treatment outcomes, alternative protocols for anti-infective periodontal therapy have been introduced.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of full-mouth disinfection or full-mouth scaling compared to conventional quadrant scaling for periodontitis.

Search Strategy

Data sources included electronic databases, handsearched journals and contact with experts. The Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. Reference lists from relevant articles were scanned and the authors of eligible studies were contacted to identify trials and obtain additional information. Date of most recent searches: December 2006: (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 4).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials were selected with at least 3 months follow up comparing full-mouth scaling and root planing within 24 hours with (FMD) or without (FMS) the adjunctive use of an antiseptic (chlorhexidine) with conventional quadrant scaling and root planing (control). The methodological quality of the studies was assessed within the data extraction form, mainly focusing on: method of randomisation, allocation concealment, blindness of examiners and completeness of follow up.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted independently by multiple review authors. The primary outcome measure was tooth loss, secondary outcomes were reduction of probing depth, bleeding on probing and gain in probing attachment. The Cochrane Collaboration statistical guidelines were followed.

Main Results

The search identified 216 abstracts. Review of these abstracts resulted in 12 publications for detailed review. Finally, seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which met the criteria for eligibility were independently selected by two review authors. None of the studies included reported on tooth loss. All treatment modalities led to significant improvements in clinical parameters after a follow up of at least 3 months. For the secondary outcome, reduction in probing depth, the mean difference between FMD and control was 0.53 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28 to 0.77) in moderately deep pockets of single rooted teeth and for gain in probing attachment 0.33 mm (95% CI 0.04 to 0.62) in moderately deep single and multirooted teeth. Comparing FMD and FMS the mean difference in one study for gain in probing attachment amounted to 0.74 mm in favour of FMS (95% CI 0.17 to 1.31) for deep pockets in multirooted teeth, while another study reported a mean difference for reduction in bleeding on probing of 18% in favour of FMD (95% CI -33.74 to -2.26) for deep pockets of single rooted teeth. No significant differences were observed for any of the outcome measures, when comparing FMS and control.

Authors' Conclusions

In patients with chronic periodontitis in moderately deep pockets slightly more favourable outcomes for pocket reduction and gain in probing attachment were found following FMD compared to control. However, these additional improvements were only modest and there was only a very limited number of studies available for comparison, thus limiting general conclusions about the clinical benefit of full-mouth disinfection.

### Addressing pain in oral mucositis: narrative review of current practices and emerging treatments [^94946520]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The efficacy of topical opioids in managing oral pain remains a topic of debate. For instance, 2% topical morphine has demonstrated pain-relieving effects in patients experiencing oral discomfort related to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.Additionally, when compared to mouth rinses containing lidocaine, diphenhydramine, and antacid, topical morphine was shown to significantly reduce the severity of mucositis (p = 0.045).However, in a mixed population of pediatric and adult patients with hematological malignancies or those undergoing hematopoietic stem-cell transplants, topical morphine did not exhibit superior analgesic effects when compared to placebo.

Clinical studies (depicted in Table 4) suggest that opioids play a key a role in alleviating pain and improving quality of life; however, significant variability in analgesic regimens across studies, along with small sample sizes, limits the generalizability of these findings. Moreover, it remains unclear whether the efficacy of opioids differs depending on whether OM is induced by chemoradiation therapy for head and neck cancer or by chemotherapy during stem cell transplantation. Additionally, due to the limited availability of high-quality studies on the use of opioids specifically for managing OM, the current MASCC/ISO guidelines are restricted to recommending only the use of a 0.2% morphine mouthwash for treatment.

### Povidone-iodine preprocedural rinse-an evidence-based, second-line defense against severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in dental healthcare [^cb764bfa]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

To the Editor —Ever since it began, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought disruptions to almost all aspects of society, with far-reaching adverse impacts on clinical and economic fronts. Even amid effective vaccine rollout, which has rekindled the hope of ending this unprecedented global disaster, the COVID-19 pandemic continues unabated, with reports of a highly transmissible, mutant, severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) VOC 202012/01 strain and another SARS-CoV-2 20H/501Y.V2 variant. These strains could drive even larger waves of disease.Due to high viral loads and the consequent transmission potential of asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic patients,reducing the viral load in the oropharynx with adequate oral prophylactic measures is imperative to contain and prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in public and dental healthcare settings. Considering the high-risk nature of the dental healthcare occupation due to the propensity for close-contact transmission through infective saliva, droplet splatter, and blood-mixed aerosols, procedural mitigation strategies involving prophylactic use of preprocedural mouth rinses (PPMRs) has been recommended to attenuate nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2.Different oral antiseptic agents have been employed as a second layer of defence against microbial load in dental aerosols: povidone-iodine (PVP-I), chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX), hydrogen peroxide, cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), and essential oils.A comparative in vitro study evaluating virucidal efficacy of different oral rinses demonstrated that mouth formulations containing 1% PVP-I, combination of dequalinium chloride and benzalkonium chloride, and a combination of ethanol and essential oils can significantly reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral infectivity within short exposure times of 30 seconds.However, CHX-based mouth rinse exhibited weak virucidal efficacy. A recent systematic review found no scientific evidence supporting the virucidal activity of hydrogen peroxide mouthwash.With the growing evidence amid the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence-based recommendations in favor of PVP-I as PMR have been increasing.

### Efficacy of synbiotic mouthwash on salivary TLR2 levels and oral mucositis in head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy: a randomized clinical trial [^964f50fd]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a common type of malignancy that is often treated with radiotherapy. This treatment can lead to the development of oral mucositis. This study investigates the effectiveness of a synbiotic mouthwash in reducing the severity of oral mucositis and in modulating salivary toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) levels in HNSCC patients undergoing radiotherapy.

Materials and Methods

A triple-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted on 44 HNSCC patients, randomly assigned to either a synbiotic mouthwash (synbiotic group) or a normal saline mouthwash (placebo group). Salivary TLR2 levels were measured at baseline and after the completion of radiotherapy and oral mucositis treatment using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The severity of oral mucositis was evaluated at each follow-up session using the MASCC/ISOO grading system. Statistical analyses included generalized estimating equations and Kaplan-Meier survival curves.

Results

Compared to the placebo group, the synbiotic group showed a significant delay in the onset of oral mucositis in grades II and III. Patients in the synbiotic group experienced a slower progression to severe mucositis, with a longer duration of grade II mucositis and fewer cases of grade III mucositis. Moreover, the mean salivary level of TLR2 in patients significantly decreased by the end of the study. However, the two groups found no statistically significant difference in salivary TLR2 levels.

Conclusions

The synbiotic mouthwash significantly reduced the severity of oral mucositis and delayed its progression in HNSCC patients undergoing radiotherapy. TLR2 levels decreased significantly in both groups.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: head and neck cancers, version 2.2025 [^653acf03]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Head and Neck Cancers—oral mucositis pain management during RT: Oral mucositis is common in patients treated with radiotherapy (RT) for head and neck (H&N) cancers. In a randomized trial, the reduction in mucositis pain during the first 4 hours of treatment was significantly greater with the diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash (P = .004) or the doxepin mouthwash (P = .02) compared to placebo, and the practicality and effectiveness of the doxepin-based regimen throughout an entire course of RT is not established. In a prospective randomized pilot study in chemoradiation, patients randomized to receive gabapentin reported a greater reduction in pain compared to usual care (P = .004); additional studies reported that very-high-dose prophylactic gabapentin (2700 mg daily) reduced the number of patients requiring narcotics and that high-dose prophylactic gabapentin (3600 mg daily) was associated with greater time to first use of opioids compared to 900 mg daily (P < .001), although the toxicity of large dosages should not be underestimated and was not adequately explored. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study from China (N = 128), pregabalin produced greater pain relief (P = .006 for 30% pain relief and P = .003 for 50% pain relief) and greater pain intensity reduction (P = .003) than placebo. The Panel recommends consideration of doxepin, diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash, pregabalin (category 2B), or gabapentin for pain related to oral mucositis, as clinically indicated and as tolerated.

### Oral mucosal adverse events with chlorhexidine 2% mouthwash in ICU [^e79d58be]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Table 1 
Baseline characteristics of CHX 2 % treated patients with and without adverse events

SD standard deviation, IQR interquartile range, LOS length of stay, LN log-transformed variable, MV mechanical ventilation, N number of patients

Mechanical stress during application of CHX 2 % may have played a role in hospital A, where the solution was initially applied using Kocher’s forceps with gauzes and where the incidence seemed to have reduced after changing to application using a syringe. Hospital B had applied CHX 2 % with a gauze wrapped around a gloved finger.

In 12 patients symptoms predominantly consisted of pronounced white plaques at the tongue and other localizations in the mouth, in some resembling Candida infection (Supplementary Picture 3). Yet, the incidence rate ratio between prior respiratory tract colonization with Candida spp. (monitored twice weekly as part of the study protocol and in clinical cultures) and the occurrence of side effects was 0.94 (95 % confidence interval 0.09–1.79, Supplementary Table S3). An association with herpes reactivation could not be determined as reactivation was investigated in five affected patients only (Supplementary Table S1).

The study safety committee recommended to replace CHX 2 % mouthwash by a CHX 1 % oral gel in the remaining hospitals. Since then CHX 1 % was withdrawn for reasons of intolerance in 2 of 419 (0.5 %) patients in four hospitals, after 12 and 30 days of use.

On the basis of these findings, we recommend against the use of 2 % chlorhexidine digluconate mouthwash in ICU patients.

### Prophylaxis, clinical management, and monitoring of datopotamab deruxtecan-associated oral mucositis / stomatitis [^f673ed6c]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

The impact of dexamethasone mouthwash was also evaluated for prevention of chemotherapy-induced stomatitis in a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label, phase II study in women receiving chemotherapy for BC.The incidence of stomatitis was 55% in the control group compared with 38% in those receiving dexamethasone mouthwash. In addition, the severity of stomatitis was lower in those who used dexamethasone mouthwash, and 87% of patients adhered to the mouthwash regimen.Alternative steroid mouthwash formulations have also been evaluated for the prophylaxis or treatment of stomatitis following cancer treatment and have shown reductions in the incidence and severity of stomatitis.

In a meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy of oral cryotherapy in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced stomatitis in 14 randomized controlled trials, treatment with oral cryotherapy was associated with a significantly reduced risk of developing stomatitis of any grade (risk ratio 0.66, 95% CI, 0.58-0.75, P <.05).

Given the supporting data available, guidelines for an oral care plan, including the recommendation to use a steroid-containing mouthwash (in regions where available), as well as consideration of cryotherapy during infusions, were developed and implemented during clinical trials for the management of Dato-DXd-associated stomatitis.

### Chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% oral rinse (DASH chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% oral rinse) [^2804eb37]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Chlorhexidine gluconate provides antimicrobial activity during oral rinsing. The clinical significance of chlorhexidine gluconate's antimicrobial activities is not clear. Microbiological sampling of plaque has shown a general reduction of counts of certain assayed bacteria, both aerobic and anaerobic, ranging from 54-97% through six months' use.

Use of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse in a six-month clinical study did not result in any significant changes in bacterial resistance, overgrowth of potentially opportunistic organisms or other adverse changes in the oral microbial ecosystem. Three months after chlorhexidine gluconate use was discontinued, the number of bacteria in plaque had returned to baseline levels and resistance of plaque bacteria to chlorhexidine gluconate was equal to that at baseline.

### Datopotamab deruxtecan (Datroway) [^788482dc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Stomatitis

DATROWAY can cause stomatitis, including mouth ulcers and oral mucositis.

In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], stomatitis occurred in 63% of patients treated with DATROWAY, including 8% of patients with Grade 3 events and one patient with a Grade 4 reaction. The median time to first onset of stomatitis was 0.5 months (range: 0.03 months to 18.6 months). Stomatitis led to dosage interruption in 6% of patients, dosage reductions in 11% of patients, and permanent discontinuation of DATROWAY in 0.5% of patients.

In patients who received DATROWAY in TROPION-Breast01, 39% used a mouthwash containing corticosteroid for management or prophylaxis of stomatitis/oral mucositis at any time during the treatment.

Advise patients to use a steroid-containing mouthwash for prophylaxis and treatment of stomatitis. Instruct the patient to hold ice chips or ice water in the mouth throughout the infusion of DATROWAY.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of stomatitis. If stomatitis occurs, increase the frequency of mouthwash and administer other topical treatments as clinically indicated. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, withhold, reduce the dose, or permanently discontinue DATROWAY [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.4 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on its mechanism of action, DATROWAY can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman because the topoisomerase inhibitor component of DATROWAY, DXd [see Description (11)], is genotoxic and affects actively dividing cells [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.1), Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DATROWAY and for 7 months after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DATROWAY and for 4 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

### Effect of doxepin mouthwash or diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash vs placebo on radiotherapy-related oral mucositis pain: the alliance A221304 randomized clinical trial [^34a7a8ed]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Oral mucositis causes substantial morbidity during head and neck radiotherapy. In a randomized study, doxepin mouthwash was shown to reduce oral mucositis-related pain. A common mouthwash comprising diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid is also widely used.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of doxepin mouthwash or diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash for the treatment of oral mucositis-related pain.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A phase 3 randomized trial was conducted from November 1, 2014, to May 16, 2016, at 30 US institutions and included 275 patients who underwent definitive head and neck radiotherapy, had an oral mucositis pain score of 4 points or greater (scale, 0-10), and were followed up for a maximum of 28 days.

Interventions

Ninety-two patients were randomized to doxepin mouthwash (25 mg/5 mL water); 91 patients to diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid; and 92 patients to placebo.

Main Outcome and Measures

The primary end point was total oral mucositis pain reduction (defined by the area under the curve and adjusted for baseline pain score) during the 4 hours after a single dose of doxepin mouthwash or diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash compared with a single dose of placebo. The minimal clinically important difference was a 3.5-point change. The secondary end points included drowsiness, unpleasant taste, and stinging or burning. All scales ranged from 0 (best) to 10 (worst).

Results

Among the 275 patients randomized (median age, 61 years; 58 [21%] women), 227 (83%) completed treatment per protocol. Mucositis pain during the first 4 hours decreased by 11.6 points in the doxepin mouthwash group, by 11.7 points in the diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash group, and by 8.7 points in the placebo group. The between-group difference was 2.9 points (95% CI, 0.2-6.0; P=.02) for doxepin mouthwash vs placebo and 3.0 points (95% CI, 0.1-5.9; P=.004) for diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash vs placebo. More drowsiness was reported with doxepin mouthwash vs placebo (by 1.5 points [95% CI, 0-4.0]; P=.03), unpleasant taste (by 1.5 points [95% CI, 0-3.0]; P=.002), and stinging or burning (by 4.0 points [95% CI, 2.5-5.0]; P<.001). Maximum grade 3 adverse events for the doxepin mouthwash occurred in 3 patients (4%); diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash, 3 (4%); and placebo, 2 (2%). Fatigue was reported by 5 patients (6%) in the doxepin mouthwash group and no patients in the diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients undergoing head and neck radiotherapy, the use of doxepin mouthwash or diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash vs placebo significantly reduced oral mucositis pain during the first 4 hours after administration; however, the effect size was less than the minimal clinically important difference. Further research is needed to assess longer-term efficacy and safety for both mouthwashes.

### Mouthrinses for the treatment of halitosis [^e093228f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Halitosis is an unpleasant odour emanating from the oral cavity. Mouthwashes, which are commonly used for dealing with oral malodour, can be generally divided into those that neutralize and those that mask the odour.

Objectives

To investigate the effects of mouthrinses in controlling halitosis.

Search Strategy

We searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to August 2008); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 3); MEDLINE (1950 to August 2008); EMBASE (1980 to August 2008); and CINAHL (1982 to August 2008). There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing mouthrinses to placebo in adults over the age of 18 with halitosis and without significant other comorbidities or health conditions.The primary outcomes considered were self expressed and organoleptic (human nose) assessments of halitosis, and the secondary outcomes included assessment of halitosis as measured by a halimeter, portable sulphide monitor or by gas chromatography coupled with flame-photometric detection.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent review authors screened and extracted information from, and independently assessed the risk of bias in the included trials.

Main Results

Five RCTs, involving 293 participants who were randomised to mouthrinses or placebo, were included in this review.In view of the clinical heterogeneity between the trials, pooling of the results and meta-analysis of the extracted data was not feasible and therefore only a descriptive summary of the results of the included trials is provided.0.05% chlorhexidine + 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride + 0.14% zinc lactate mouthrinse significantly reduced the mean change (standard deviation (SD)) of organoleptic scores from baseline compared to placebo (-1.13 (1.1) P < 0.005 versus -0.2 (0.7)) and also caused a more significant reduction in the mean change (SD) in peak level of volatile sulphur compounds (VSC) (-120 (92) parts per billion (ppb) versus 8 (145) ppb in placebo). The chlorhexidine cetylpyridinium chloride zinc lactate mouthrinse showed significantly more tongue (P < 0.001) and tooth (P < 0.002) staining compared to placebo.However, in view of the incomplete reporting of results in three of the trials and the sole use of the halimeter for assessment of VSC levels as outcomes in two further trials, caution should be exercised in interpreting these results.

Authors' Conclusions

Mouthrinses containing antibacterial agents such as chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride may play an important role in reducing the levels of halitosis-producing bacteria on the tongue, and chlorine dioxide and zinc containing mouthrinses can be effective in neutralisation of odouriferous sulphur compounds.Well designed randomised controlled trials with a larger sample size, a longer intervention and follow-up period are still needed.
