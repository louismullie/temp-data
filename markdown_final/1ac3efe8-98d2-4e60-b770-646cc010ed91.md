## Question

Rehabilitation after rotator cuff surgery

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about postoperative rehabilitation after rotator cuff repair. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching evidence base and guideline consensus. Then, I should verify how tear size modifies risk and protocol choice. Next, I will examine immobilization and the timing of passive and active motion. After that, I need to check strengthening progression and exercise selection. I will then review pain control strategies and their impact on rehabilitation. I should also consider the role of supervised versus home-based therapy, technology-enabled options, and adherence. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, phase-based protocol and highlight special populations and future directions, ensuring each step aligns with high-quality evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the core evidence base and guideline stance before drawing any conclusions. High-quality guidelines from AAOS and APTA indicate that for small to medium full-thickness tears, early and delayed mobilization produce similar long-term outcomes, with early motion yielding faster range-of-motion gains that converge by 6 months, and delayed motion trending toward better structural healing without statistically significant differences in retear rates across trials, which supports a shared decision-making approach rather than a one-size-fits-all rule [^117C5PPK] [^111WAMfs]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of early-motion benefits; meta-analytic data show modest but real improvements in forward elevation up to 6 to 12 months with early motion, while functional outcomes and retear rates remain comparable overall, reinforcing that timing can be individualized based on patient goals and risk profile [^111sC4K5] [^111begTh].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about early motion for everyone. I need to check how tear size changes the risk calculus. For tears larger than 5 cm, early passive motion is associated with substantially higher retear risk, with meta-analytic estimates around a 2.3-fold increase, whereas for tears 3 cm or smaller, early motion may actually reduce retear risk in some repair configurations, so protocol selection should be explicitly stratified by tear size and repair quality [^113nDzvT] [^114MhHie]. I should double-check that this size-dependent signal is consistent across high-quality syntheses; yes, multiple meta-analyses converge on the same caution for large tears while showing neutral or favorable effects for small tears, which justifies more conservative immobilization for massive tears and permits earlier motion for small to medium tears when tissue quality and fixation are adequate [^111sC4K5] [^113nDzvT].

> Next, I should review immobilization duration and sling strategy. ASSET recommends about 2 weeks of strict immobilization followed by protected passive motion, whereas many contemporary programs individualize sling use from 0 to 6 weeks based on tear size, tissue quality, and patient factors, with shared decision-making endorsed by AAOS to balance stiffness risk against healing protection [^112itg4E] [^111d5XWd]. Wait, let me verify whether early sling weaning truly increases stiffness; feasibility data suggest early patient-directed mobilization increases time out of sling without clear early harm signals, but surgeons withdrew some participants due to perceived risk, underscoring the need for equipoise and careful selection when accelerating sling discontinuation [^114t1PLD] [^113FZfsp].

> I will now examine the timing of passive range of motion. Early passive motion starting within days after surgery accelerates recovery of forward elevation and external rotation up to 6 to 12 months but does not consistently improve long-term functional outcomes or retear rates across all-comers, supporting a tailored approach rather than routine early PROM for everyone [^111begTh] [^111sC4K5]. But wait, what if we delay PROM entirely; randomized data show that delaying passive motion for 4 to 6 weeks does not worsen long-term outcomes in small to medium tears and may reduce early loading of the repair, which can be advantageous when tissue quality is questionable or fixation is tenuous [^113EChJG] [^116ZqzSd].

> Let me consider when to initiate active motion and strengthening, and I should confirm the load thresholds. Most guidelines advise delaying active motion until about 12 weeks for small to medium tears, with earlier initiation only when the repair is robust and tissue quality is good, while EMG-informed exercise selection helps limit supraspinatus and infraspinatus activation to under about 15% MVIC in the early phases to protect the repair [^112itg4E]. Hold on, I should verify whether early isometric loading helps; pilot randomized data suggest early isometric activation may improve short-term pain and function without clear detriment, but these are preliminary findings and should be applied cautiously and selectively pending stronger trials [^117JCEA6].

> Next, I should review strengthening progression and scapular mechanics. Progressive strengthening typically begins around 12 weeks with elastic bands and advances to light weights by 16 weeks, emphasizing scapulothoracic control and avoiding provocative positions such as full-range external rotation with abduction early on, with pulley exercises at 6 weeks not demonstrating inferior outcomes in small studies, though scapular substitution should still be monitored clinically [^112itg4E] [^114D5wf3]. I need to ensure we incorporate kinetic chain and postural training once pain allows, as scapular dyskinesis can perpetuate impingement mechanics and compromise repair longevity if uncorrected [^114DMAod].

> I should confirm pain control strategies and their impact on rehabilitation participation. Multimodal analgesia with acetaminophen, NSAIDs, regional anesthesia such as interscalene or suprascapular nerve blocks, and perioperative dexamethasone reduces pain and facilitates early motion without compromising healing when used judiciously, and cryotherapy offers short-term symptom relief though evidence for opioid-sparing is mixed [^1115xoNW] [^113nwTYn]. Wait, let me verify adjuncts; TENS may modestly reduce pain and opioid consumption in some trials, and emerging but still investigational modalities like electroacupuncture are being studied as nonpharmacologic adjuncts within multimodal frameworks, so they should not replace standard regimens pending stronger evidence [^113D3GdJ] [^112J3BLv].

> Now, I need to check the role of supervised therapy versus home-based programs. For small to medium tears, a single physical therapy session teaching a structured home program yields pain and function outcomes comparable to multiple supervised visits over 3 to 12 months, suggesting that resource-intensive supervised care may not be necessary for all patients, though adherence and technique quality must be verified [^112k8iVo] [^1111wH7F]. Hold on, I should verify whether multimodal supervised therapy adds benefit; some trials show short-term advantages with supervised multimodal care, but crossover and missing data complicate interpretation, so shared decision-making about intensity of supervision is prudent, especially for patients at higher risk of stiffness or with comorbidities [^112k8iVo].

> Let me review technology-enabled rehabilitation and adherence monitoring. Digital platforms with motion capture and biofeedback can deliver high-dose, standardized home programs and may maintain or improve outcomes while reducing in-person visits, though evidence is still maturing and should be integrated with clinical checkpoints and outcome tracking [^115aHsqe] [^111gFwzQ]. I should double-check that these tools are paired with validated patient-reported outcomes and periodic clinician review to ensure safe progression and timely intervention if plateaus occur [^115aHsqe].

> Next, I should review special populations and risk modifiers. Diabetic patients, smokers, patients with high BMI, and those with substantial fatty infiltration or retraction have impaired healing environments and may benefit from more conservative, slower protocols with delayed active loading and closer surveillance, as comorbidity burden correlates with worse general health outcomes and potentially higher retear risk even if shoulder-specific function can still improve meaningfully [^1146fx4n] [^111jqQjP]. I need to ensure that these patients receive additional education on adherence and activity modification to mitigate modifiable risks during the critical healing window [^115mFGQj].

> I will now synthesize a practical, phase-based protocol while acknowledging the evidence limitations. For small to medium tears with good tissue quality, early patient-directed motion as pain allows with sling weaning over 0 to 2 weeks, protected PROM from weeks 2 to 6, active-assisted motion from weeks 6 to 8, and progressive strengthening from week 12 is reasonable, with return to full activity by 16 to 24 weeks if milestones are met, whereas for large to massive tears or compromised tissue, strict immobilization for 4 to 6 weeks, delayed PROM until week 6, active motion no earlier than week 12, and strengthening no earlier than week 16 may better protect the repair, all contingent on intraoperative findings and surgeon guidance [^117C5PPK] [^112itg4E]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to cap forward elevation at 90 degrees for 6 weeks across the board, but I should correct that; elevation limits should be individualized to the tear pattern and repair tension, with many programs limiting passive forward elevation to 90 to 120 degrees for the first 4 to 6 weeks in larger tears to reduce stress on the supraspinatus footprint [^112itg4E].

> Finally, I need to ensure we set expectations, define milestones, and plan for stiffness management. Most patients achieve a functional arc by 3 months and near-full recovery by 6 to 12 months, with early motion conferring a time-to-ROM advantage that largely dissipates by 6 months. Persistent stiffness at 3 months should trigger escalation with intensified ROM therapy, and resistant cases may require arthroscopic capsular release, which is generally effective at restoring motion [^111sC4K5] [^114bqAR3]. I should confirm that patients understand the trade-offs between early motion and healing protection, engage in shared decision-making about sling use and activity progression, and commit to adherence, as nonadherence and premature aggressive loading correlate with higher retear risk in observational analyses [^115mFGQj] [^111d5XWd].

Rehabilitation after rotator cuff repair should be **individualized** [^114DMAod] based on tear size, tissue quality, repair type, and patient factors, with a **phased approach** [^112YHxFh] that balances tendon healing with motion and function. Early passive motion (within 1–2 weeks) is safe for small-to-medium tears [^116ZqzSd] and improves short-term ROM without increasing retear risk [^111sC4K5], whereas delayed motion (after 4–6 weeks) is preferred for large or poor-quality repairs to protect healing [^113nDzvT]. Strengthening begins around 12 weeks [^112itg4E], and full activity resumes by 4–6 months. Pain is managed with **multimodal analgesia** [^1115xoNW], and supervised therapy is recommended for complex cases or slower progressors [^1176ySAU]. Outcomes are generally excellent, with 85–95% patient satisfaction and durable function at 2–5 years [^notfound].

## Phases of rehabilitation

| **Phase** | **Timeframe** | **Goals** | **Interventions** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Phase 1 | Weeks 0–2 | Protect repair, control pain, maintain passive ROM | - Sling immobilization <br/> - Passive ROM (pendulums, therapist-assisted) <br/> - Cryotherapy <br/> - Multimodal analgesia [^1115xoNW] |
| Phase 2 | Weeks 2–6 | Gradual ROM restoration, prevent stiffness | - Passive to active-assisted ROM <br/> - Scapular stabilization <br/> - Patient education [^1134ckJJ] |
| Phase 3 | Weeks 6–12 | Restore active ROM, initiate strengthening | - Active ROM <br/> - Isometrics <br/> - Light resistance <br/> - Closed-chain scapular work [^112itg4E] |
| Phase 4 | Weeks 12–24 | Progressive strengthening, functional training, return to activity | - Progressive resistance <br/> - Eccentric loading <br/> - Sport/work-specific drills <br/> - Gradual return to full activity [^112YHxFh] |

---

## Timing of rehabilitation initiation

- **Early motion (within 1–2 weeks)**: Safe and beneficial for small-to-medium tears [^117C5PPK]; improves short-term ROM without increasing retear risk [^111sC4K5].
- **Delayed motion (after 4–6 weeks)**: Preferred for large, massive, or poor-quality repairs to protect healing [^113nDzvT].
- **Individualized decision-making**: Based on tear size, tissue quality, repair type, and patient factors [^112itg4E].

---

## Role of supervised physical therapy

Supervised physical therapy provides **structured progression** with expert guidance and monitoring [^114DMAod]. It also enables **early detection** of complications such as stiffness or retear. Evidence suggests outcomes with supervised therapy are comparable to well-designed home programs for small tears [^112k8iVo], though supervision is valuable for complex cases or slower progressors [^notfound].

---

## Common complications and management

- **Stiffness**: Occurs in 10–20%; managed with aggressive ROM, manual therapy, and, if refractory, arthroscopic release [^114bqAR3].
- **Retear**: Occurs in 10–20%, higher with large tears or poor tissue; managed with revision or nonoperative care if asymptomatic [^113nDzvT].
- **Pain**: Managed with multimodal analgesia, NSAIDs, regional anesthesia, and cryotherapy [^1115xoNW].

---

## Long-term outcomes

Long-term outcomes include **high satisfaction**, with 85–95% of patients satisfied at 2–5 years [^notfound]. Function is durable, with sustained improvement in pain, ROM, and strength [^111Lsneg]. Retear risk is 10–20% and is influenced by tear size, tissue quality, and patient factors [^113nDzvT].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing rehabilitation

- **Age**: Older patients may heal more slowly and require longer immobilization [^1146fx4n].
- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, smoking, and obesity impair healing and may necessitate conservative protocols [^notfound].
- **Occupation and activity level**: Manual laborers and athletes may need prolonged rehabilitation and delayed return to activity [^notfound].

---

## Current evidence and controversies

Evidence supports **early motion** for small-to-medium tears, with similar long-term outcomes to delayed protocols [^111WAMfs] [^117C5PPK]. Controversy persists for **large tears**, where delayed motion may better protect healing, though functional outcomes may be similar [^113nDzvT] [^111sC4K5]. Supervision is beneficial in **complex cases**, whereas home programs suffice for motivated patients with small tears [^112k8iVo] [^1176ySAU].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Phased rehabilitation**: Protect repair early, then progressively restore motion and strength [^114DMAod].
- **Early motion**: For small-to-medium tears; delayed motion for large or poor-quality repairs [^113nDzvT].
- **Supervised therapy**: For complex cases or slower progressors [^notfound].
- **Multimodal analgesia**: For pain control and improved participation [^1115xoNW].
- **Individualized care**: Tailor to tear size, tissue quality, repair type, and patient factors [^112itg4E].

---

Rehabilitation after rotator cuff repair should be **individualized and phased**, balancing healing with motion and function. Early motion benefits small-to-medium tears, whereas delayed motion better protects large or poor-quality repairs. Supervised therapy aids complex cases, and multimodal analgesia supports participation. Outcomes are excellent, with high satisfaction and durable function when protocols are tailored to patient and repair factors [^117C5PPK].

Results

The number of patients screened and participants recruited and followed-up post-surgery is presented in Figure 1. 73/185 eligible patients (39%) were recruited. Eight surgeons treated at least one participant in the randomised controlled trial. Thirty-one physiotherapists with a mean of 16 years of clinical experience supported delivery of the rehabilitation interventions. The baseline characteristics of the patient participants are described in Table 1.

Table 1.
Baseline characteristics of the patient participants.

Of the 73 participants recruited, 20 were subsequently withdrawn before or at the time of surgery (Figure 1).

Fifty-three post-operative case report forms detailed completeness of the surgical repair. 47/53 were complete repairs (early patient-directed rehabilitation = 17, standard rehabilitation = 30) and six were partial repairs (early patient-directed rehabilitation = 6). There were no reports of inability to repair in the completed case report forms.

At six weeks, follow-up defined by return of questionnaire including the Oxford Shoulder Score, Shoulder Pain and Disability Index, EQ-5D-5L, and healthcare resource was 68% (50/73) (Table 2). Excluding withdrawals, follow-up was 94% (50/53). At 12 weeks, follow-up was 71% (52/73) (Table 2). Excluding withdrawals, follow-up was (98%) (52/53).

Number of questionnaires returned at 6 and 12 weeks and the clinical outcome scores for the Oxford shoulder ccore and shoulder pain and disability index.

At 6- and 12-weeks, the mean difference in Oxford Shoulder Score (positive value favours early patient-directed rehabilitation) was 1.5 (80% CI −2.6, 5.6) and 2.4 (80% CI −1.0, 5.7) respectively. At 6- and 12-weeks, the mean between-group difference in Shoulder Pain and Disability Index score (negative value favours early patient-directed rehabilitation) was −4.8 (80% CI −14.3, 4.6) and −5.5 (80% CI −15.0, 4.1) respectively.

### Double-row repair lowers the retear risk after accelerated rehabilitation [^11213yTZ]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Recently, an accelerated rehabilitation protocol after rotator cuff (RC) repair has been proposed for patients at risk of postoperative stiffness.

Purpose

To investigate, in patients undergoing early accelerated mobilization, whether double-row (DR) repair provides better clinical outcomes and a lower retear rate compared with single-row (SR) configurations.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods

A total of 58 patients were randomized to undergo either SR or DR repair. After 2 years of follow-up, 12 men and 13 women (mean age, 61.8 years; range, 52–67 years) in the SR group and 15 men and 10 women (mean age, 58.9 years; range, 51–69 years) in the DR group were evaluated. To assess the retear rate, magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder was performed at 2-year follow-up. The clinical evaluation was based on the modified University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder score and range of motion (ROM) measurements.

Results

Magnetic resonance arthrography showed a significantly lower full-thickness retear rate for the DR group than for the SR group (8% vs 24%, respectively; P < .05). Conversely, at both 6-month and 2-year follow-up, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of the rate of stiffness in the SR and DR groups (8% vs 12% and 0% vs 0%, respectively; P > .05). No clinical differences were recorded regarding the UCLA score (SR group: mean, 32.6 [range, 30–35]; DR group: mean, 33.3 [range, 29–35]; p = 0.61) and ROM.

Conclusion

In selected patients at a high risk of shoulder stiffness and therefore necessitating accelerated postoperative rehabilitation, DR repair of the RC could lower retear rates.

### Patient outcome following rehabilitation for rotator cuff repair surgery: the impact of selected medical comorbidities [^111jqQjP]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Study Design

Prospective, multicenter research design.

Objectives

To assess functional and health status outcomes in patients following a physical therapy program after rotator cuff repair surgery, and to determine the impact of selected patient medical comorbidities on rehabilitation outcomes.

Background

While authors have studied the influence of multiple factors on patient outcomes after rotator cuff repair surgery, little research has been done on the impact of comorbidities, particularly as it relates to establishing an accurate patient prognosis. eighteen patients who had recently undergone a rotator cuff repair surgical procedure were recruited at 1 of 30 Physiotherapy Associates, Inc outpatient clinics located in 13 states. A rehabilitation protocol was implemented and included the following interventions, as indicated: therapeutic exercise, manual therapy, electrotherapeutic modalities, and physical agents. Patient health history factors were documented during the initial examination, including age, race, body mass index, smoking, rotator cuff tear size, type of surgical procedure, and selected medications and comorbidities. The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) and the Short-Form-36 (SF-36) were completed prior to rehabilitation, at discharge, and at 6 months postdischarg

Results

DASH andmost SF-36 domain mean scores obtained postrehabilitation were significantly improved from pretherapy scores. Most health status outcomes were maintained at 6-month follow-up, with slight further improvement noted in SF-36 physical dimensions and DASH scores. Having a greater number of comorbidities was associated with worse postrehabilitation SF-36 scores, but not with the DASH shoulder function scores. The mean change scores (difference between prerehabilitation and postrehabilitation status) for the DASH and SF-36 were not significantly different for patients with 0 to 1, 2, or at least 3 or more comorbidities (except for emotional role). In regression analyses a model with baseline physical function score (P = 0.0001), age (P = 0.03), and number of comorbidities (P = 0.003) fitted the data well and explained 38% of the variance in the physical function score at discharge.

Conclusions

A higher number of comorbidities had a negative effect on general health status outcomes but not on shoulder function outcomes at the time of patient discharge following rehabilitation. Despite a negative effect of more comorbidities on health status outcomes, the specific number of medical comorbidities did not affect the overall level of improvement prerehabilitation to postrehabilitation in function and health status. The findings describing the influence of comorbidities on rehabilitation outcomes may assist therapists in establishing accurate patient prognosis.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for rotator cuff disorders, more specifically with respect to indications for referral, APTA 2022 guidelines recommend to modify the treatment plan and consider implementing other therapeutic approaches if there is no significant clinical improvement after a maximum of 12 weeks of adequate rehabilitation in patients presenting with shoulder pain. Ensure high adherence to the rehabilitation program.

Rotator cuff repair — risks and harms and shared decision-making: Because the early and delayed mobilization protocols yield similar results there is no known harm from implementing this recommendation, and timing for discharge of sling use should be determined by shared decision making with the patient based on numerous patient specific factors that impact repair healing in order to reduce risk of retears during post-operative rehabilitation.

### Are pulley exercises initiated 6 weeks after rotator cuff repair a safe and effective rehabilitative treatment? A randomized controlled trial [^114D5wf3]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There are few level 1 or 2 evidence studies that examine rehabilitation after rotator cuff repair. Pulleys have been used in postoperative shoulder rehabilitation with the intention of improving range of motion and developing strength. There is a concern that the use of pulleys in rehabilitation of rotator cuff repairs may contribute to excessive scapular motion (scapular substitution) and potentially inferior outcomes.

Hypothesis

Rotator cuff repair patients treated with pulley exercises would have increased scapular substitution and inferior patient-determined outcome scores, range of motion, and strength compared with patients treated with an alternative rehabilitation program without pulleys.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods

A total of 27 patients who underwent rotator cuff repair were randomized to a rehabilitation group that used pulleys initiated 6 weeks postoperatively, and 26 patients followed a rehabilitation protocol without pulleys. Inclusion criteria were patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Exclusion criteria were large to massive rotator cuff tears, revision rotator cuff repair, glenohumeral osteoarthritis, adhesive capsulitis, and a symptomatic contralateral shoulder. Outcomes of intervention were patient-determined outcome scores (Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index [WORC], American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons [ASES] Shoulder Score, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation [SANE], Shoulder Activity Level, and Simple Shoulder Test [SST]), range of motion, scapular substitution, and strength. Outcomes were determined at 6, 12, 18, 26, and 52 weeks. A power analysis determined that 22 patients were needed per group to have a power of 0.80, α = 0.05, and effect size of f = 0.5.

Results

Both groups had statistically significant improvements in WORC, ASES Shoulder Score, SST, and SANE scores over time after rotator cuff repair (P < .0001). There were no differences between the interventions for WORC (P = 0.18), ASES Shoulder Score (P = 0.73), SANE (P = 0.5), Shoulder Activity Level (P = 0.39), or SST (P = 0.36). Both interventions demonstrated improvements in shoulder flexion (P = 0.002), abduction (P = 0.0001), external rotation (P = 0.02), strength (P ≤ .0002), and scapular substitution (P ≤ .07) over time after rotator cuff repair. However, there was no difference in range of motion (P ≥ .26), strength (P ≥ .20), or scapular substitution (P ≥ .17) between interventions.

Conclusion

A rotator cuff repair rehabilitation program that uses pulleys does not result in inferior outcomes, as determined by patient-determined outcome scores, measurements of scapular substitution, range of motion, and scaption strength.

### Prevention and management of stiffness after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: systematic review and implications for rotator cuff healing [^114bqAR3]. Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To define the incidence of stiffness after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) and address the prevention and management of postoperative stiffness.

Methods

A PubMed search was performed using the combined terms "rotator cuff and stiffness", "shoulder and capsular release", and "capsular release and stiffness". Inclusion criteria were (1) primary outcome of postoperative shoulder stiffness, (2) Levels I to IV evidence, and (3) entirely arthroscopic technique for rotator cuff repair.

Results

Seven articles met our inclusion criteria. Two articles discussed the management of preoperative stiffness and ARCR. These articles managed preoperative stiffness differently, preventing an adequate comparison to provide recommendations. Three articles described both the incidence of and risk factors for postoperative stiffness after ARCR. The incidence of transient stiffness responsive to nonoperative management was 10%. The incidence of resistant stiffness that was permanent or required capsular release was 3.3%. Several risk factors for stiffness were identified in this review. Two articles focused on postoperative rehabilitation protocols and stiffness after ARCR. Overall, resistant postoperative stiffness was reported in 1.5% of patients with an immediate passive range-of-motion protocol, 4.5% of patients in a 6-week sling-immobilization protocol, and 0% of patients with a modified protocol. Three articles, all among the above mentioned articles, reported that arthroscopic capsular release for stiffness after ARCR improved motion to a level comparable to that in patients who did not require reoperation.

Conclusions

The studies in this systematic review indicate that with ARCR, postoperative stiffness resistant to nonoperative management is uncommon despite an initial immobilization period. In the setting of resistant postoperative stiffness, arthroscopic capsular release can successfully restore range of motion. ARCR allows a delayed mobilization protocol that may be important in achieving rotator cuff healing. The optimal management of preoperative stiffness in patients undergoing ARCR is inconclusive based on this review.

Level Of Evidence

Level IV, systematic review of Level III and IV studies.

### Rehabilitation following rotator cuff repair: a multi-centre pilot&feasibility randomised controlled trial (RaCeR) [^111V3Zei]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

In a fully powered randomised controlled trial, the target sample size would be 658 randomised participants (329 in each treatment arm) if the following assumptions were adopted; 90% power and 5% two-sided statistical significance to detect a minimally clinically important difference of eight pointsbetween the two treatment groups at 12 weeks on the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index, assuming a standard deviation of 30 (conservative estimate from this pilot RCT) and accounting for an expected 10% loss to follow-up.

Other recent randomised controlled trials have been reported. Mazzocca et al.(n = 73) compared early movement (starting two to three days after surgery) versus delayed movement (starting 28 days after surgery), similar to standard rehabilitation reported here. There was no statistically significant difference in Western Ontario Rotator Cuff scores at six months, but the early movement group reported lower scores (better clinical status) throughout the post-operative period. After six months, there was no difference in re-tear rates (31% vs 34%). Sheps et al.(n = 206) compared sling weaning and early pain-free mobilisation versus standard rehabilitation, including immobilisation, following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (all tear sizes included). They reported statistically significant improvement in range of movement at six weeks for the early mobilisation group, but no difference in other clinical outcomes. After one year there was no difference in re-tear rates (30% vs 33%) and after two years there was no difference in clinical outcomes. Tirefort et al.(n = 80) compared no sling versus the use of a sling for the first four post-operative weeks following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (small to medium tears included). There was a statistically significant improvement in range of movement at six and 12 weeks for the no sling group. At six months there was no difference in clinical outcomes or repair integrity.

### Rehabilitation following rotator cuff repair: a nested qualitative study exploring the perceptions and experiences of participants in a randomised controlled trial [^113yYoBe]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

We conducted a multi-centre pilot and feasibility randomised controlled trial to evaluate the feasibility of a fully powered randomised controlled trial to compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of early patient-directed rehabilitation with standard rehabilitation, incorporating sling immobilisation for four-weeks following surgical repair of the rotator cuff. Patients diagnosed with non-traumatic tears of the rotator cuff and listed for surgical repair were recruited from five English National Health Service Hospitals and randomly allocated to early patient-directed rehabilitation or standard rehabilitation. The comprehensive protocol describing the methods and interventions has been publishedand the results of the pilot and feasibility randomised controlled trial have been reported in a linked paper.

Alongside the pilot and feasibility randomised controlled trial we conducted this nested qualitative study with the following objectives:

(1) To understand the acceptability of the interventions to participants and healthcare practitioners.
(2) To explore the barriers and enablers to adherence with interventions.
(3) To understand which outcome measure(s) best reflect(s) the participants' rehabilitation goals.

Effective rehabilitation is considered important to help patients achieve the best clinical and quality of life outcomes. Despite this, there is uncertainty about the optimal approach including when a patient should remove their sling or brace, provided after the surgery to immobilise the shoulder, and when they should begin moving their shoulder. –

### Editorial commentary: to move or not to move the shoulder, that is the question [^116Gq73L]. Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Whether to use an immediate range of motion exercise protocol or, rather, to delay the initiation of rehabilitation exercises for patients after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair presents a significant dilemma for the treating surgeon. The study "The Effect of Early Range of Motion on Quality of Life, Clinical Outcome, and Repair Integrity After Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair" by Mazzocca, Arciero, Shea, Apostolakos, Solovyova, Gomlinski, Wojcik, Tafuto, Stock, and Cote reveals that no differences in quality of life scores or rotator cuff healing were identified after comparing 2 groups of patients undergoing either immediate (within 3 days) or delayed (after 28 days) postoperative rehabilitation protocols. These results underscore the fact that little data has been published to date that demonstrates an optimum time period for initiating postoperative rehabilitation after rotator cuff repair.

### Rotator cuff tendinopathy diagnosis, nonsurgical medical care, and rehabilitation: a clinical practice guideline [^1157BHuN]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Evidence eligibility and follow-up periods — Eligible publications were identified via searches of Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central, and CINAHL, including only new systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis published since the 2022 CPG, with updates conducted between July 2022 and October 2023. Two reviewers independently screened each step, disagreements were handled by a third reviewer, and data extraction used a predefined standardized form by 1 evaluator revised by a second evaluator. Follow-up windows for extracted results were defined as immediate (data within 1 day), short-term (closest follow-up to 1 month but less than 2 months), medium-term (closest follow-up to 3 months between 2 and 6 months), long-term (closest follow-up to 12 months between 6 and 18 months), and very long-term (any follow-up beyond 18 months after initiation of care).

### Early versus delayed passive range of motion exercise for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111begTh]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative shoulder stiffness complicates functional recovery after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

Purpose

To compare early passive range of motion (ROM) exercise with a delayed rehabilitation protocol with regard to the effectiveness of stiffness reduction and functional improvements and rates of improper healing in patients undergoing arthroscopic repair for torn rotator cuffs.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing both rehabilitation approaches were identified in PubMed and Scopus. Between-group differences in shoulder function were transformed to effect sizes for comparisons, whereas the effectiveness against stiffness and the risk of tendon failure were reported using standardized mean differences of ROM degrees and odds ratios (ORs) of recurrent tears, respectively.

Results

Six RCTs were included, consisting of 482 patients. No significant difference in shoulder function existed across both protocols. The early ROM group demonstrated more improvement in shoulder forward flexion than the delayed rehabilitation group, with a standardized mean difference of 7.45° (95% CI, 3.20°-11.70°) at 6 months and 3.51° (95% CI, 0.31°-6.71°) at 12 months. Early ROM exercise tended to cause a higher rate of recurrent tendon tears (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.90–2.28), and the effect became statistically significant (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.04–3.60) after excluding 2 RCTs that recruited only those patients with small to medium-sized tears.

Conclusion

Early ROM exercise accelerated recovery from postoperative stiffness for patients after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair but was likely to result in improper tendon healing in shoulders with large-sized tears. The choice of either protocol should be based on an accommodation of the risks of recurrent tears and postoperative shoulder stiffness.

Rotator cuff postoperative rehabilitation research recommendations — activity tracking should be utilized with "activity monitors in supervised physical therapy, home exercises, and with active motion with activities of daily living". Studies should evaluate short-term outcomes (6–12 weeks) and at minimum should examine "the dose and load of mobilization, home exercise, and active motion out of the sling over the course of post-operative care". The page also states that "more patient-centric disease-specific outcome measures such as the WORC quality of life score (Mazzocca et. al.) should be routinely incorporated" to determine the patient impact of differing rehabilitation protocols.

### Effectiveness of early versus delayed rehabilitation following total shoulder replacement: a systematic review [^116raVB6]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

The process of study selection is summarised in Figure 1. No disagreements occurred between reviewers regarding eligibility. One disagreement occurred during the risk of bias assessment relating to a single signalling question on the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised controlled trials, for the outcome of 'healing of the lesser tuberosity osteotomy'. This was resolved through discussion.

Figure 1.
PRISMA flow diagram.

None of the three published papers provided sufficient information to facilitate a meta-analysis. Corresponding authors were contacted to request access to the required data. Two authors did not respond despite two separate requests being sent. A narrative synthesis was therefore undertaken.

Characteristics of included studies

Table 2 provides an overview of the characteristics of the three included randomised controlled trials. 230 participants were recruited across the three trials: 60 (26%) had an anatomic total shoulder replacement with a lesser tuberosity osteotomyand 170 (74%) had a reverse total shoulder replacement without repair of the subscapularis. 204 patients were included in the final analyses; 100 were female and 104 were male. The mean age of participants ranged from 68.3 to 75.1 years.

Table 2.
Characteristics of included studies.

The follow-up time points varied (Table 2). Early post-operative outcomes (less than three months) were recorded in two randomised controlled trials;, one randomised controlled trial recorded the first post-operative measurements at three months. Each included trial recorded outcomes at 12 months after the surgery, and one recorded final outcomes at two years.

Rehabilitation protocols

The definitions of 'early' and 'delayed' rehabilitation varied across the three randomised controlled trials. Table 3 summarises the rehabilitation protocols employed, demonstrating the differences within and between the included trials.

### Early loading in physiotherapy treatment after full-thickness rotator cuff repair: a prospective randomized pilot-study with a two-year follow-up [^111hxf8S]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the clinical changes following two different physiotherapy treatment protocols after rotator cuff repair.

Design

A prospective, randomized pilot study with a two-year follow-up.

Subjects

Five women and nine men, 55 (40–64) years old, were included.

Intervention

The progressive group (n = 7) started with dynamic, specific muscle activation of the rotator cuff the day after surgery as well as passive range of motion. After four weeks of immobilization the loading to the rotator cuff increased and in a progressive manner throughout the rehabilitation. In the traditional group (n = 7) the rotator cuff was protected from loading. Patients were immobilized for six weeks and started with passive range of motion the day after surgery. No specific exercises to the rotator cuff were introduced during this period.

Main Measures

A clinical evaluation was made preoperatively, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery. Pain rating during activity and at rest, patient satisfaction, active range of motion and muscle strength, Constant score, hand in neck, hand in back and pour out of a pot, as well as Functional Index of the Shoulder were used.

Results

At two years follow-up, the progressive group and traditional group scored pain during activity visual analogue scale (VAS) 2/0 mm and pain at rest 0/0 mm, respectively. The groups attained 170/175 degrees in active abduction in standing and 70/90 degrees in passive external rotation while lying in supine. Using Constant score, the groups attained 82/77 points respectively.

Conclusion

The present study showed that the progressive protocol produced no adverse effects compared with the traditional protocol.

### A systematic review of proposed rehabilitation guidelines following anatomic and reverse shoulder arthroplasty [^115HoJ4s]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is indicated for patients with glenohumeral arthritis. In this procedure, the humeral head and glenoid surface are replaced with prosthetic components. Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) is indicated for patients with glenohumeral arthritis and a poorly functioning rotator cuff. In this procedure, a glenosphere articulates with a humerosocket. While those surgeries are commonly performed, a thorough review of the literature is required to determine the areas of agreement and variations in postoperative rehabilitation.

Objectives

To describe the literature on rehabilitation protocols following anatomic TSA and RTSA.

Methods

For this systematic review, a computerized search was conducted in medical databases from inception to May 21, 2018 for relevant descriptive studies on TSA and RTSA rehabilitation protocols. The methodological index for nonrandomized studies tool and the modified Downs and Black tool for randomized controlled trials were used for assessment of the individual studies.

Results

Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 1 provided level I evidence, 1 provided level III evidence, 2 provided level IV evidence, and 12 provided level V evidence. Ten of the studies described rehabilitation guidelines for TSA and 6 described those for RTSA. Following TSA, the use of a sling was recommended for a duration that varied from 3 to 8 weeks, and 4 of the 10 published protocols included resisted exercise during the initial stage of healing (the first 6 weeks after surgery). Seven of 10 published protocols recommended limiting shoulder external rotation to 30° and that passive range of motion be fully restored by 12 weeks post surgery. Suggested use of a sling post RTSA varied from "for comfort only" to 6 weeks, motion parameters varied from no passive range of motion to precautionary range limits, and all protocols agreed on performing deltoid isometric exercises early post surgery. There was a high level of heterogeneity for the rehabilitation guidelines and associated precautions for both TSA and RTSA.

Conclusion

The majority of published protocols were descriptive in nature. Published rehabilitation strategies following TSA and RTSA are based on biomechanical principles, healing time frames, and exercise loading principles, with little consistency among protocols. There is a need to determine optimal rehabilitation approaches post TSA and RTSA based on clinical outcomes.

### Move It or lose It? The effect of early active movement on clinical outcomes following rotator cuff repair: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^117FDKTd]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the effect of early active shoulder movement after rotator cuff repair, compared to delayed active shoulder movement, on clinical outcomes, rotator cuff integrity, and return to work.

Study Design

Intervention systematic review.

Literature Search

We searched 14 databases in November 2017 and updated the search in December 2018 and February 2020.

Study Selection Criteria

We included comparative studies that assessed the effect of early active shoulder movement versus delayed active shoulder movement following rotator cuff repair.

Data Synthesis

Means and SDs were used to calculate weighted mean differences and 95% confidence intervals for outcomes of interest. The sensitivity analysis included only randomized controlled trials and was performed when heterogeneity among studies was statistically significant.

Results

Eight studies with a total of 756 participants (early active shoulder movement, n = 379; delayed active shoulder movement, n = 377) were included. There was high-certainty evidence favoring early active movement for forward flexion (6 weeks), abduction (6 weeks), and external rotation (6 weeks and 3 and 6 months) postsurgery. There was moderate-certainty evidence of worse Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index score (6 weeks) for the early active movement group, and no difference in rotator cuff integrity between the early and delayed active movement groups. There were no group differences for all other outcomes.

Conclusion

Patients who commenced active shoulder movement early after rotator cuff repair had greater shoulder range of motion and worse shoulder-specific quality of life after surgery than patients who delayed active shoulder movement. However, the group differences did not appear to be clinically important, and rotator cuff integrity was similar. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2021;51(7):331–344.

### Operative vs nonoperative treatment for atraumatic rotator cuff tears: a trial protocol for the arthroscopic rotator cuff pragmatic randomized clinical trial [^112atTZL]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

The paucity of evidence for operative vs nonoperative treatments for rotator cuff tears is highlighted in the 2012 American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons Clinical Practice Guidelines, Cochrane reviews, a report by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and expert reviews. Thus, a well-conducted randomized clinical trial with an adequate sample size is urgently needed.

We are performing a pragmatic randomized clinical trial, the Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff (ARC) trial, to compare outcomes of operative vs nonoperative treatments for atraumatic rotator cuff tears. The aims of this trial are to compare pain and function in patients undergoing operative vs nonoperative treatment of atraumatic rotator cuff tears at 12 months of follow-up (aim 1) and to assess the associations of rotator cuff tear size and age with comparative outcomes in operative vs nonoperative treatments for atraumatic rotator cuff tears (aim 2). Operative treatment includes rotator cuff surgery followed by postoperative rehabilitation. Nonoperative treatment includes physical therapy only.

Randomization and Allocation Concealment

Block randomization will be employed for group assignment, and an independent statistician will generate the randomization sequence to allocate participants into the treatment and control groups in a 1:1 ratio. The block size will be 4, with 2 subgroups. A random number table will be generated using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS, version 26.0, IBM, USA) software. Randomization will be implemented using sealed and opaque envelopes, prepared in duplicate for both the research initiator and the research center to ensure allocation concealment. According to the group assignment indicated in the envelopes, eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either the treatment group or control group. The study does not stratify randomization by specific tendon repaired, as the primary outcome is acute postoperative pain, which is more closely related to the overall surgical intervention than to isolated tendon pathology. However, surgical reports will document repaired tendons to enable exploratory subgroup analyses.

This trial employed a single-blind design. Patients will be blinded to group allocation; however, blinding of acupuncturists is not feasible due to the nature of the intervention. Prior to treatment, participants will be informed that they have an equal chance of being assigned to either group. To maintain blinding during the intervention, participants will wear an eye mask. The principal investigator, data analysts, outcome assessors, and the statistician will remain blinded throughout the trial. All study staff will be trained on trial procedures and are required to strictly adhere to the principle of role separation.

Qualification of Practitioners

All acupuncturists will receive standardization training from the principal investigator (YM) prior to the start of the trial to ensure protocol compliance and treatment consistency. EA procedure will be performed following the guidance for the clinical practice of acupuncture. All acupuncturists must be licensed, hold at least a master's degree and have a minimum of 3 years of clinical experience in acupuncture practice.

### The RaCeR study: rehabilitation following rotator cuff repair… [^112rvF1Q]. isrctn.com (2025). Medium credibility.

Plain English summary of protocol Background and study aims Disorders of the muscles and tendons of the shoulder, the rotator cuff, are the most common cause of shoulder pain. Injury to the RC, e.g. a tear, can result in significant pain and disability. The number of operations to repair the torn RC has increased significantly over recent. rehabilitation early might help people return to their usual activities more quickly, which is important to patients. The aim of this small study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a larger trial which will test whether early rehabilitation is more clinically and cost-effective than the usual practice of delayed rehabilitation. Who can participate. Patients aged 18 or over diagnosed with a non-traumatic symptomatic tear of the RC and listed for surgical repair What does the study involve.

Participants are randomly allocated to receive one of two rehabilitation programmes: either early patient-directed mobilisation using pain as a guide, or immobilisation of the. arm in a sling for four weeks. After four weeks both groups of patients undertake further rehabilitation led by a physiotherapist as per standard practice. The key difference is that those in the early mobilisation group begin moving their shoulder more quickly after the operation. Patients report their levels of pain and disability after surgery through questionnaires and. approximately two weeks later at an out-patient physiotherapy appointment to re-confirm these messages. Participants will be asked to record their adherence to the programme, i.e. the time out of their sling, at regular periods throughout the day using a Personal Exercise Diary. Intervention: participants will receive one session with a.

physiotherapist after surgery where they will be advised to remove the post-operative sling, as pain allows, as soon as possible and gradually begin actively using the arm as able. This will be progressed by the individual patient over time and to agreed goals within the context of their own pain experience and tolerance. Participants will also be advised to perform specific daily. healing. Consented patient participants and health care practitioners may be invited to an informal interview to share their perceptions and experiences of post-operative treatment and study processes.

### Effectiveness of early compared with conservative rehabilitation for patients having rotator cuff repair surgery: an overview of systematic reviews [^116ShZ4r]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Aim/Objective

The aim is to critically analyse and discuss the current literature and determine the effectiveness of rehabilitation for patients after surgical repair of rotator cuff tears for range of motion (ROM), pain, functional status and retear rates; in addition, an update of new literature is included.

Design

Overview of systematic reviews.

Data Sources

A search was performed with no restrictions to date of publication and language in the following databases: EBSCO, AMED, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, EMBASE, Cochrane, LILACS, MEDLINE, PEDro, Scielo, SCOPUS and Web of Knowledge. The PRISMA guideline was followed to develop this review and the R-AMSTAR tool was used for critical appraisal of included reviews.

Eligibility Criteria

Only systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effectiveness of early with conservative rehabilitation, after surgical repair of the rotator cuff, were included. Moreover, the studies should report ROM, pain, functional status and/or retears rates before and after 3–24months of the surgery.

Results

10 systematic reviews and 11 RCTs were included for the final analysis. Conflicting results and conclusions were presented by the systematic reviews, the use of primary studies varied; also the methodological quality of the reviews was diverse. This updated review, with new meta-analysis, showed no difference for function, pain, ROM or retears ratio between early and conservative rehabilitation.

Summary/Conclusions

Early mobilisation may be beneficial, particularly for small and medium tears; however, more studies with higher quality are required, especially for patients with large tears who have been given less attention.

### Management of rotator cuff injuries [^112k8iVo]. AAOS (2025). High credibility.

Supervised exercise vs unsupervised exercise after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair for small tears — Visits of physical therapy for supervision of exercises that are performed independently at home do not provide greater improvements in pain and function outcomes (at 3 months, up to 1 year) compared to a single session of physical therapist instruction followed by an independent home program in patients following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair for small tears. Quality of Evidence is Moderate and Strength of Recommendation is Moderate. In a randomized trial comparing a single session instruction of a 2-phase home exercise program to the same program with additional supervised visits, there were no clinically meaningful differences in pain and function outcomes at 3 months and 1 year follow up. In multimodal programs, at 6, 12 and 24 weeks post-operative comparable outcomes were reported between individualized supervised physiotherapy and a standardized unsupervised home exercise program, though functional deficits of 14% and 32% were reported in the individualized physiotherapy group and standardized home exercise group, respectively, at 24 weeks post-operatively, with methodological limitations including a high number (28%) of patients (9/32) crossed over to the supervised therapy group and missing data up to 31% for the PT group and 44% for the HEP group. In contrast, another randomized trial reported supervised multi-modal physical therapy resulted in improved short term (3 and 6 week) outcomes versus an independent home exercise program. Potential harms include cost and resource use when postoperative interventions are limited only to supervision of the same exercises done independently at home.

### Effectiveness of early versus delayed rehabilitation following total shoulder replacement: a systematic review [^115hMCXC]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Total shoulder replacement is a treatment option for individuals experiencing severe pain and functional restriction of their shoulder. Two of the main indications for total shoulder replacement are osteoarthritis and cuff tear arthropathy. Between 1998 and 2017, over 58,000 elective shoulder replacements were undertaken in the United Kingdom (UK), and this number is rising annually. A similar trend has been reported in the United States (US), resulting in significant annual costs to both the UK National Health Service (NHS)and the US healthcare system.

Following total shoulder replacement, a programme of rehabilitation is important to help patients achieve the best clinical and quality of life outcomes. However, the optimal approach to post-operative rehabilitation is unknown. Variation is observed across the UK NHSand few institutions adapt their rehabilitation protocol based on prosthesis typedespite the common assertion that different approaches are necessary. One key uncertainty regarding rehabilitation relates to the best time to begin mobilisation of the shoulder after surgery. This has recently been identified as a research priority by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.

A previous systematic review highlighted the paucity of high-quality evidence available relating to rehabilitation following total shoulder replacement. Only one randomised controlled trial was eligible for inclusion, which suggested that early rehabilitation might lead to a more rapid return of function following total shoulder replacement. Since this previous systematic review, further relevant randomised controlled trials have been published. The aim of this review was therefore to build on the previous systematic review and examine evidence from randomised controlled trials to investigate the effectiveness of early versus delayed rehabilitation on pain, function, and tissue healing in adults who have undergone primary anatomic, primary reverse, or revision total shoulder replacement.

### Effects of 12 weeks of progressive early active exercise therapy after surgical rotator cuff repair: 12 weeks and 1-year results from the CUT-N-MOVE randomized controlled trial [^113k3ByC]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Traumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears are typically managed surgically, followed by rehabilitation, but the load progression to reach an optimal clinical outcome during postoperative rehabilitation is unknown.

Purpose

To evaluate whether there was a superior effect of 12 weeks of progressive active exercise therapy on shoulder function, pain, and quality of life compared with usual care.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods

Patients with surgically repaired traumatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears were recruited from 2 orthopaedic departments and randomized to progressive active exercise therapy (PR) or limited passive exercise therapy (UC [usual care]). The primary outcome was the change in the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC) score between groups from before surgery to 12 weeks after surgery. Secondary outcomes included changes in the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire score, pain, range of motion, and strength. Adverse events were registered during the intervention period.

Results

A total of 82 patients were randomized to the PR (n = 41) or UC (n = 41) group. All 82 patients (100%) participated in the 12-week assessment and 79 in the 1-year follow-up. At 12 weeks, there was no significant difference between the groups in the change in the WORC score from baseline adjusted for age, sex, and center (physical symptoms: P = 0.834; sports and recreation: P = 0.723; work: P = 0.541; lifestyle: P = 0.508; emotions: P = 0.568). Additionally, there was no between-group difference for the secondary outcomes including the WORC score at 1 year and the DASH score, pain, range of motion, and strength at 12 weeks and 1 year. Both groups showed significant improvements over time in all outcomes. In total, there were 13 retears (16%) at 1-year follow-up: 6 in the PR group and 7 in the UC group.

Conclusion

PR did not result in superior patient-reported and objective outcomes compared with UC at either short- or long-term follow-up (12 weeks and 1 year).

### Management of rotator cuff injuries [^115Vu6WP]. AAOS (2025). High credibility.

Management of rotator cuff injuries — post-operative rehabilitation research priorities state that future research should evaluate short- and long-term pain, function and clinical outcomes and compare traditional post-operative physical therapy management that is multimodal to phased post-operative surgeon instructed home exercise programs for rehabilitation of patients following full-thickness rotator cuff repairs. Future research is needed to identify which patients may need traditional multimodal physical therapy, including neuromuscular re-education and manual therapy, compared to a home-directed program, and future studies that are stratified by tear size are also needed. The one high-level study referenced above was done on a small tear population only and may not be applicable to larger tears.

### PROSPECT guideline for rotator cuff repair surgery: systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^1115xoNW]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary

Rotator cuff repair can be associated with significant and difficult to treat postoperative pain. We aimed to evaluate the available literature and develop recommendations for optimal pain management after rotator cuff repair. A systematic review using procedure‐specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) methodology was undertaken. Randomised controlled trials published in English from 1 January 2006 to 15 April 2019 assessing postoperative pain after rotator cuff repair using analgesic, anaesthetic or surgical interventions were identified from, Embase and Cochrane Databases. Out of 322 eligible studies identified, 59 randomised controlled trials and one systematic review met the inclusion criteria. Pre‐operative and intra‐operative interventions that improved postoperative pain were paracetamol, cyclo‐oxygenase‐2 inhibitors, intravenous dexamethasone, regional analgesia techniques including interscalene block or suprascapular nerve block (with or without axillary nerve block) and arthroscopic surgical technique. Limited evidence was found for pre‐operative gabapentin, perineural adjuncts (opioids, glucocorticoids, or α‐2‐adrenoceptor agonists added to the local anaesthetic solution) or postoperative transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Inconsistent evidence was found for subacromial/intra‐articular injection, and for surgical technique‐linked interventions, such as platelet‐rich plasma. No evidence was found for stellate ganglion block, cervical epidural block, specific postoperative rehabilitation protocols or postoperative compressive cryotherapy. The analgesic regimen for rotator cuff repair should include an arthroscopic approach, paracetamol, non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, dexamethasone and a regional analgesic technique (either interscalene block or suprascapular nerve block with or without axillary nerve block), with opioids as rescue analgesics. Further randomised controlled trials are required to confirm the influence of the recommended analgesic regimen on postoperative pain relief.

### Early active rehabilitation after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: a prospective randomized pilot study [^117JCEA6]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare two different rehabilitation strategies, primary passive motion versus early isometric loading of the rotator cuff.

Design

Prospective randomized controlled observer-blinded pilot study.

Setting

Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.

Subjects

Thirty patients after rotator cuff surgery.

Intervention

All participants were randomly assigned to one of the two outpatient treatment groups: primary passive motion versus early isometric loading of the rotator cuff. Both groups were treated for 12 weeks and performed additionally a home exercise program.

Main Measures

The primary outcome measure for functional assessment was the Constant Murley score. The secondary outcome measures were the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score (DASH), active range of motion, pain level and strength. Patients were assessed before, 6, 12 and 24 weeks after surgery.

Results

Repeatedly measured metric variables were compared by the Quade rank analysis of covariance and revealed substantially better Constant Murley scores in the early activated group at all 3 assessments (6 weeks: 41 [31;45] versus 30 [23;37]; 12 weeks: 68 [56;77] versus 59 [53;62]; 24 weeks: 79 [76;81] versus 66 [62;74]; data as median [25%;75%]). Postoperative changes of Constant score were in favour of the active group with the biggest difference at week 12 (28 [38;12] versus 9 [27;-4]). Maximal pain levels showed clear more reduction 6 and 24 weeks after surgery in the early activated group.

Conclusions

This pilot study with early isometric loading of the rotator cuff shows better function and less maximal pain. Further research is warranted to confirm our results.

Surgery includes a rotator cuff repair and/or debridement based on an evidence-based surgical protocol (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 2) developed for this trial. Surgery is done almost exclusively on an arthroscopic basis unless the operating surgeon determines on the basis of intraoperative or perioperative factors that an open procedure is required. Information is collected on the specific surgical techniques used, such as number of anchors and type of repair (eg, single row, double row, transosseous, or transtendinous). Any concomitant procedures that are performed, such as subacromial decompression and acromioclavicular joint resection, are also noted. The operating surgeon determines whether a patient may need concomitant or alternate shoulder surgical procedures. The recruiting surgeon completes a standardized postsurgery report form noting details of the surgery and intraoperative observations of tear size, location, and shape; tendon quality and retraction; and cuff repair performed.

After surgery, participants follow a prescribed physical therapy and home exercise program. A standardized, postoperative rehabilitation protocol (eAppendix 3 in Supplement 2) has been developed for this trial with extensive input from our team of clinicians, researchers, and expert consultants. The duration of the postoperative physical therapy program is approximately 4 months, with participants attending physical therapy 1 to 2 times a week, for a total of approximately 16 to 32 visits. Participants are encouraged to perform exercises at home with a dosing of therapy (physical therapy and/or home exercises) of approximately 4 times per week. The treatment stages of the postoperative rehabilitation protocol are linked to specific time frames after surgery. Participants in the operative group who meet treatment goals for a given stage early are not advanced to the next stage ahead of schedule, to allow proper healing of their shoulder postoperatively. Participants perform a home exercise program during their postoperative rehabilitation program and may continue physical therapy beyond 4 months as prescribed or as deemed appropriate by their treating clinicians.

Potential Risks From Intervention

Both the operative and nonoperative treatments in this trial are standards of usual care. The adverse events and serious adverse events are therefore those inherent to standard-of-care treatments. Adverse events for this trial include postoperative infection, postoperative bleeding, thromboembolism, nerve injury, complications due to anesthesia, and adhesive capsulitis. Serious adverse events include death and an event requiring hospitalization (in-patient admission) related to the treatment.

### Implementing the 27 PRISMA 2020 statement items for systematic reviews in the sport and exercise medicine, musculoskeletal rehabilitation and sports science fields: the PERSiST (implementing prisma in exercise, rehabilitation, sport medicine and sporTs science) guidance [^111yYXTW]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Our review was designed to assess the benefits and harms of subacromial decompression surgery for managing subacromial pain syndrome. To date, no trial has demonstrated benefit of surgery for any clinical subgroup. In the future, subgroup claims should be supported by data from well-conducted trials at low risk of bias and the use of established criteria for credibility of subgroup effects, ideally enhanced by IPD meta-analysis.

For harms we welcome well-performed observational studies that specifically report harms after subacromial decompression surgery separately from harms following other types of shoulder surgery. Although the finding of no important benefit of surgery is robust, the root cause of subacromial pain and the underlying pathological process remain uncertain, as does the possible best treatment — if such exists — for subacromial pain syndrome. Network meta-analysis might provide information on this question and provide hypotheses to be tested in future methodologically sound trials. Future triallists investigating any treatment for subacromial pain syndrome should adopt a common set of outcomes, and the outcome measures should be standardised'.

Provide registration information for the review, including register name and registration number, or state that the review was not registered.

Note for systematic reviewers. A systematic review protocol is an important way for readers to check whether the systematic review questions and methods have been pre-specified and followed. The protocol guards against bias introduced when too many decisions are made after the data are analysed (eg, selective reporting and outcome switching). Protocols may be (appropriately) modified during the conduct of a systematic review (ensure the registry record is updated when the protocol is modified). The PRISMA-Pchecklist guides systematic reviewers on developing a review protocol.

### Does early motion lead to a higher failure rate or better outcomes after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair? A systematic review of overlapping meta-analyses [^111sC4K5]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The aims of the study were as follows: to perform a systematic review of meta-analyses comparing "early motion" and "delayed motion" after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair; to provide a framework to analyze the best available evidence to develop recommendations; and to identify gaps where suggestions could be made for future investigations.

Methods

Literature searches were performed to identify meta-analyses examining arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with early-motion vs. delayed-motion rehabilitation protocols. Clinical data were extracted, and meta-analysis quality was assessed using the Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses and Oxman-Guyatt scales.

Results

Nine meta-analyses met inclusion criteria. No clear superiority was noted in clinical outcome scores for early-motion or delayed-motion rehabilitation. Results of tendon healing were found to be either no different or in favor of delayed motion, but no differences were noted in rotator cuff tear recurrence rates postoperatively. The majority of meta-analyses found significantly better range of motion with early motion up to a year postoperatively for forward elevation and up to 6 months for external rotation, but significant differences were not reported for functional improvements and strength at 12 months postoperatively. Subgroup analyses suggested that larger preoperative tear sizes have significantly greater retear rates with early-motion rehabilitation.

Conclusions

The current highest level of evidence suggests that early-motion rehabilitation after rotator cuff repair results in superior postoperative range of motion up to 1 year. Whereas early motion and delayed motion after cuff repair may lead to comparable functional outcomes and retear rates, concern exists that early motion may result in greater retear rates, particularly with larger tear sizes.

### Hydrotherapy versus classical rehabilitation after… [^1176fyHf]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

Hydrotherapy Versus Classical Rehabilitation After Surgical Rotator Cuff RepairClinicalTrials. gov ID
- Passive forward flexion
- As primary outcome, we will evaluate if passive antepulsion is superior with balneotherapy than classical rehabilitation. We consider the effective intervention with a 105 ° forward flexion.
- Pain.
- Minimum score is 0 while the maximum score is 100. The higher the score, the better the outcome. Introduction: Postoperative rehabilitation following rotator cuff repair is important to promote tendon healing, restore strength, and recover normal function. Aquatic rehabilitation in hot water allows body relaxation and well-being that promote patient conditioning for efficient rehabilitation and is appreciated by patients.

The aim of this study is to assess whether aquatic rehabilitation is more efficient than classical rehabilitation in term of range of motion, function, and pain after an arthroscopic repair of the rotator cuff. Multivariable linear regressions were performed to determine if 2-year postoperative scores were associated with gender, body mass index, age at index operation, rehabilitation group, and baseline passive range of motion Active range of motion. Study Type
- Rotator Cuff Tears. Other: Land-based Therapy

### Rehabilitation following rotator cuff repair: a multi-centre pilot&feasibility randomised controlled trial (RaCeR) [^116vDHCC]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

The findings of these randomised controlled trials reflect the results of our previous systematic reviewsuggesting that early mobilisation facilitates a more rapid recovery of uncertain clinical importance without long-term consequence. Despite this, most patients continue to be immobilised in a sling for up to six weeks with increasing tendency to immobilise as the size of the tear increases. In contrast to previous interventions evaluated in these randomised controlled trials, the RaCeR early patient-directed rehabilitation intervention is more progressive in nature in terms of encouragement to discard the sling immediately, permitting active movement, and enabling participants to use their acceptable symptom response as a guide. The clinical outcomes reported here provide a signal of effectiveness of early patient-directed rehabilitation given the upper bounds of the 80% confidence intervals for the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index and Oxford Shoulder Score include the upper limit of the range of minimal clinical important differences at 6 and 12 weeks.

In this pilot and feasibility randomised controlled trial we experienced a higher than expected number of withdrawals due to participants not receiving rotator cuff repair surgery. Despite this we were able to address our feasibility objectives and inform the development of a future main randomised controlled trial.

Hence, in the context of the findings that a future main RaCeR randomised controlled trial is feasible, previous randomised controlled trials and the clinical outcomes reported here provide a signal of effectiveness and platform from which to conduct a high-quality fully powered randomised controlled trial comparing early patient-directed rehabilitation with standard rehabilitation. The implications of this study include the need to randomly allocate participants following surgery and to carefully consider clinician equipoise to minimise withdrawal.

From this RaCeR pilot and feasibility randomised controlled trial, we conclude that a fully powered randomised controlled trial is feasible but would require a minor change to randomly allocate participants following surgery, rather than pre-surgery, to counter the issue of withdrawal due to participants not receiving rotator cuff repair surgery. Additionally, consideration of equipoise of the participating clinicians with regard to comparison of the randomised controlled trial interventions will be paramount to further minimise withdrawals.

Clinical messages

A main randomised controlled trial to compare early patient-directed rehabilitation with standard rehabilitation is feasible and would require 658 participants based on the specified assumptions;
Random allocation before surgery contributed to study withdrawal due to participants not receiving rotator cuff repair surgery.

### Rehabilitation following rotator cuff repair: a multi-centre pilot&feasibility randomised controlled trial (RaCeR) [^116NiQoY]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical status and outcomes were collected at baseline, 6-weeks and 12-weeks post-surgery by postal questionnaire. The Oxford Shoulder Score is a 12-item shoulder-specific self-report measure which is reliable, valid, responsive and acceptable to patients. – The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index is also a shoulder-specific self-report measure which is reliable, valid, responsive and is the most commonly used outcome measure in randomised controlled trials of non-surgical interventions. – The EQ-5D-5L is a generic measure of health related quality of life that provides a single index value for health status. Other clinical outcomes included global rating of change on a 6-point ordinal scale, time taken to return to driving, and days lost from work. A patient-completed diary detailing time spent out of sling and adherence with exercise was also completed for four weeks post-surgery. Two text messages were sent each week for 12 weeks; the first asking about pain in the last week and the second asking about work or activity interference, both on a 5-point ordered categorical scale derived from the Oxford Shoulder Score. At 12-weeks post-surgery, a diagnostic ultrasound scan was undertaken to determine the number of rotator cuff tendon re-tears. Number of adverse events post-surgery were collected up to 12-weeks post-surgery via clinician and patient self-report questionnaire.

The following pre-specified success criteria were agreed:

(1) Consent and randomisation of 20% or more of eligible patients
(2) Difference in time with arm out of the sling of 40% or more, that is, the early patient-directed rehabilitation group would report 40% more time out of the sling than the standard rehabilitation group in the first four weeks after surgery
(3) Follow up rates for potential main outcome measure(s) > 70% for questionnaires and text messages.

Surgeons were blinded to group allocation until after the surgery to minimise the likelihood of withdrawal through knowledge of the allocated intervention. Ultrasound scan findings were withheld from patient participants and clinicians. No further measures to blind participants, clinicians, research team or oversight committees were implemented.

The sample size was based on the ability to detect a difference in time spent out of sling between the two randomised groups. Allowing 20% for missing adherence-related data, 76 participants would provide 90% power to detect at least a minimum 40% difference in sling use between the two groups, given 1-sided 5% significance level.

### Digitally assisted versus conventional home-based rehabilitation after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: a randomized controlled trial [^111gFwzQ]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Intervention

Both groups received a 12-wk program, as outlined in Supplemental Digital Content 1, consisting of five stages: (a) immediate postsurgery phase (weeks 0–2); (b) immobilization period (weeks 3–4); (c) passive mobilization (weeks 5–8); (d) active movement (weeks 9–10); and (e) strengthening (weeks 11–12). Face-to-face sessions schedule is depicted in Table 1.

TABLE 1
Face-to-face session schedule according to the established protocol, not counting with the exceptions (i.e. patient who can proceed to the following phases earlier)

In the absence of a criterion standard, the rehabilitation protocols were designed taking into account the following: (a) a recent systematic review on the subject; (b) a review of the concepts and evidence-based guidelines on this subject by van der Meijden et al.(2012); (c) an overview of systematic reviews comparing early and conservative rehabilitation; and (d) the protocol of the Massachusetts General Hospital for rehabilitation after RCR.

Participants in the DT group performed an exercise program using SWORD Phoenix. They were provided with a tablet computer with a SWORD mobile app installed, along with three inertial motion trackers to be placed on the chest, upper arm, and wrist, respectively (Fig. 1). These trackers enable precise movement quantification, feeding the mobile app, which guides the patient through the session, providing real-time audio and video biofeedback during exercise. Participants were instructed to perform digital exercise sessions at least 5 times per week. These sessions were set to last between 15 and 30 mins, depending on patient performance and program phase (see exercise protocol in Supplemental Digital Content 1). Patients had to complete at least 15 mins of session for the intervention to be counted. Sessions were evaluated on a daily basis and adjusted weekly by the assigned PT, through a web-based portal. These sessions were complemented with home-based one-to-one physical therapy sessions, for a total of thirteen 60-min sessions. Apart from the deployed session, where the PT assisted participants from the DT group setting up the digital therapist, either through phone or video call, no additional training was required to initiate the rehabilitation program.

### Management of rotator cuff injuries [^114afT3v]. AAOS (2025). High credibility.

Rotator cuff repair — future research and definition of mobilization: The PICO question using the term mobilization was updated to include the timing of post-operative mobilization exercises (initiation of supervised physical therapy intervention of manual passive range of motion, active assistive, and active motion exercises) and immediate weaning sling use, and it notes that a physical therapy visit for mobilization passively or therapist active assistive exercises may not be the measure most indicative of stress on the healing repair. Absolute load and cyclic loading have been identified as factors affecting suture durability, and counting the number of physical therapy visits assumes the amount of load and the cycles across the tendon-suture-bone interface are consistent within sessions and home protocols, which may explain why there are few differences between early and delayed rehabilitation protocols when dosing is defined as initiation of supervised physical therapy with timing variations.

Supervised exercise vs unsupervised exercise after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair for small tears: Visits of physical therapy for supervision of exercises that are performed independently at home do not provide greater improvements in pain and function outcomes (at 3 months, up to 1 year) compared to a single session of physical therapist instruction followed by an independent home program. Quality of Evidence: Moderate. Strength of Recommendation: Moderate.

### The clinical efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture (EA) in perioperative rehabilitation of rotator cuff repair surgery: a protocol for a single-centre, randomized controlled trial [^11566NLp]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rotator cuff injuries are common rotator cuff tendon disorders and a leading cause of shoulder pain and dysfunction with prevalence increasing with age. These injuries, often caused by trauma, sports-related injuries or degeneration, can progress to rotator cuff tears. In China, the incidence has risen with population aging and national fitness initiatives, reaching up to 20%. Untreated injuries may lead to cartilage damage, glenohumeral osteoarthritis, and a heavy healthcare burden.

Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) is now the gold standard for symptomatic rotator cuff tears, offering faster recovery and lower infection risk, with utilization rising more than 600% in recent years. However, postoperative complications remain frequent, including pain, stiffness, and muscle atrophy, which may progress to adhesive capsulitis and impair the tendon-to-bone healing. Pain is particularly prominent. Poorly control of acute postoperative pain not only disrupts sleep but also contributes to psychological distress, which in turn exacerbates pain and dysfunction, further increasing the risk of adhesive capsulitis. Effective pain management is therefore essential for recovery and long-term outcomes.

### Rehabilitation following rotator cuff repair: a multi-centre pilot&feasibility randomised controlled trial (RaCeR) [^114t1PLD]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective:

To evaluate the feasibility of a multi-centre randomised controlled trial to compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of early patient-directed rehabilitation versus standard rehabilitation following surgical repair of the rotator cuff of the shoulder.

Design:

Two-arm, multi-centre pilot and feasibility randomised controlled trial.

Setting:

Five National Health Service hospitals in England.

Participants:

Adults (n = 73) with non-traumatic rotator cuff tears scheduled for repair were recruited and randomly allocated remotely prior to surgery.

Interventions:

Early patient-directed rehabilitation (n = 37); advised to remove their sling as soon as able and move as symptoms allow. Standard rehabilitation (n = 36); sling immobilisation for four weeks.

Measures:

(1) Randomisation of 20% or more eligible patients. (2) Difference in time out of sling of 40% or more between groups. (3) Follow-up greater than 70%.

Results:

73/185 (39%) potentially eligible patients were randomised. Twenty participants were withdrawn, 11 due to not receiving rotator cuff repair. The between-group difference in proportions of participants who exceeded the cut-off of 222.6 hours out of the sling was 50% (80% CI = 29%, 72%), with the early patient-directed rehabilitation group reporting greater time out of sling. 52/73 (71%) and 52/53 (98%) participants were followed-up at 12 weeks when withdrawals were included and excluded respectively. Eighteen full-thickness re-tears were reported (early patient-directed rehabilitation = 7, standard rehabilitation = 11). Five serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusion:

A main randomised controlled trial is feasible but would require allocation of participants following surgery to counter the issue of withdrawal due to not receiving surgery.

### The clinical efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture (EA) in perioperative rehabilitation of rotator cuff repair surgery: a protocol for a single-centre, randomized controlled trial [^116TaSsH]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Multimodal analgesic is widely advocated for ARCR, mainly involving pharmacological agents such as paracetamol, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, gabapentin, and intravenous dexamethasone, etc. Yet many patients continue to experience moderate-to-severe pain, with stiffness rates up to 32.7%. Drug therapies may also cause adverse effects and increase psychological stress. Integrating non-pharmacological therapies into multimodal strategies is therefore important. Evidence supports that exercise, manual therapy, and electrotherapy benefit patients with rotator cuff disorders.

Acupuncture, a traditional non-pharmacological therapy rooted in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), recognized for safety and minimal side effects, is strongly recommended in the "Guidelines for Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Diagnosis and Treatment of Rotator Cuff Injuries (2023 Edition)". Acupuncture has been shown to inhibit pain transmission at peripheral, spinal, and central levels. Electroacupuncture (EA), combining traditional acupuncture with electrical stimulation, has demonstrated superior efficacy compared to manual acupuncture in relieving shoulder pain and restoring joint function. Randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence supports the role of EA in musculoskeletal rehabilitation, showing reduced pain, lower opioid use, and improved joint function. In perioperative care, EA has also reduced pain and anesthesia requirements in spinal and neurological surgeries. However, during the perioperative period of ARCR, multimodal analgesia remains predominantly drug-based and do not integrate TCM-based non-pharmacological modalities. Consequently, there is a pressing need for clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EA for managing acute postoperative pain following rotator cuff repair.

This placebo-controlled trial aims to evaluate the superiority of EA over sham EA (SEA) in managing acute pain and other postoperative symptoms after rotator cuff repair. The study seeks to provide high-quality evidence supporting EA in perioperative pain management and promote broader integration of TCM into multimodal analgesia. As a protocol paper, it also enhances methodological transparency and helps prevent unnecessary duplication.

### PROSPECT guideline for rotator cuff repair surgery: systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^113nwTYn]. Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rotator cuff repair improves long‐term pain and quality of life in patients with symptomatic rotator cuff disease 1. However, rotator cuff repair is associated with significant postoperative pain, and effective pain control can affect early postoperative rehabilitation 2 and long‐term outcomes 1. Pain continues to be a significant concern after rotator cuff repair as it may result in prolonged admission or re‐admission to hospital 3. With significant variations in analgesic protocols, a unified approach is necessary to provide standardised interventions to reduce pain. A systematic review 4 assessed the evidence for the effectiveness of commonly used regional anaesthesia techniques for postoperative analgesia after shoulder surgery and made recommendations for management. That review was not specific to rotator cuff repair and it focused on regional analgesic techniques only. Moreover, the authors did not assess non‐opioid analgesics like paracetamol and NSAIDs. A narrative review 5 examined modalities for pain relief after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, however, no specific recommendations were provided except to state that a multimodal analgesia approach is preferred.

The PROSPECT Working Group is a collaboration of surgeons and anaesthetists working to formulate procedure‐specific recommendations for pain management after common but potentially painful operations 6. The recommendations are based on a procedure‐specific systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCT). The methodology considers clinical practice, efficacy and adverse effects of analgesic techniques 7.

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available literature on the effects of analgesic and surgical interventions on pain after rotator cuff repair. The primary outcomes sought were postoperative pain scores and analgesic requirements. Other recovery outcomes, including adverse effects, were also assessed when reported and the limitations of the data were reviewed. The ultimate aim was to develop recommendations for pain management after rotator cuff repair.

### Postoperative rehabilitation following rotator cuff repair [^114DMAod]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Postoperative rehabilitation following rotator cuff repair is essential for a positive patient outcome. Each patient should have a program tailored to their individual tear and repair characteristics. Their plan should be advanced according to their progress, with therapist and surgeon communication. The rehabilitation progresses through 4 stages. This begins with a period of immobilization, passive range of motion, and protecting the repair and ends with functional and sport-specific exercises. Rehabilitation advances in progress-based steps during 24 weeks. The rehabilitation process aims to balance healing of the tendon repair and the risk of postoperative stiffness.

### Management of rotator cuff injuries [^117C5PPK]. AAOS (2025). High credibility.

Post-op mobilization timing — arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: Postoperative clinical and patient-reported outcomes are similar for small to medium-sized full-thickness rotator cuff tears managed with early mobilization or delayed mobilization (delayed up to 8 weeks), supported by Quality of Evidence: High and Strength of Recommendation: Strong. Across randomized trials, mobilization timing compared initiation within 0–2 weeks versus 4–8 weeks post-operatively, and for nearly all measures early and delayed mobilization paradigms yield similar outcomes; early mobilization favors improved range of motion and quality of life measures, but these differences become negligible by 6 months post-operatively. Delayed mobilization until 4–8 weeks is associated with higher rates of post-operative healing, although these differences do not reach statistical significance in the best available evidence; post-operative healing was analyzed by ultrasound and/or MRI from 7 days through up to 2 years post-operatively.

### The American society of shoulder and elbow therapists' consensus statement on rehabilitation following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair [^112itg4E]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

This is a consensus statement on rehabilitation developed by the American Society of Shoulder and Elbow Therapists. The purpose of this statement is to aid clinical decision making during the rehabilitation of patients after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. The overarching philosophy of rehabilitation is centered on the principle of the gradual application of controlled stresses to the healing rotator cuff repair with consideration of rotator cuff tear size, tissue quality, and patient variables. This statement describes a rehabilitation framework that includes a 2-week period of strict immobilization and a staged introduction of protected, passive range of motion during weeks 2–6 postoperatively, followed by restoration of active range of motion, and then progressive strengthening beginning at postoperative week 12. When appropriate, rehabilitation continues with a functional progression for return to athletic or demanding work activities. This document represents the first consensus rehabilitation statement developed by a multidisciplinary society of international rehabilitation professionals specifically for the postoperative care of patients after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

### Early versus delayed passive range of motion after rotator cuff repair: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113nDzvT]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative rehabilitation has been shown to affect healing of the rotator cuff after surgical repair. However, it is unknown whether an early or delayed rehabilitation protocol is most beneficial for healing.

Purpose

To determine whether early versus delayed passive range of motion (PROM) affects rotator cuff (RC) retear rates after surgery.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

A systematic review of the literature published between January 2003 and February 2014 was conducted. Retear rates were compared for early (within 1 week after surgery) versus delayed (3–6 weeks after surgery) PROM using χ² or Fisher exact tests as well as relative risks (RR) and 95% CIs. In the first analysis, data from evidence level 1 studies that directly compared early versus delayed PROM were pooled; and in the second analysis, data from level 1 to 4 studies that did not directly compare early versus delayed PROM were pooled. The second analysis was stratified by tear size and repair method.

Results

Twenty-eight studies (1729 repairs) were included. The first analysis of level 1 studies did not reveal a significant difference in retear rates for early (13.7%) versus delayed (10.5%) PROM (P = 0.36; RR = 1.30 [95% CI, 0.74–2.30]). The second analysis revealed that for ≤ 3 cm tears, the risk of retear was lower for early versus delayed PROM for transosseous (TO) plus single-row anchor (SA) repairs (18.7% vs 28.2%, P = 0.02; RR = 0.66 [95% CI, 0.47–0.95]). For > 5 cm tears, the risk of retear was greater for early versus delayed PROM for double-row anchor (DA) repairs (56.4% vs 20%, P = 0.002; RR = 2.82 [95% CI, 1.31–6.07]) and for all repair methods combined (52.2% vs 22.6%, P = 0.01; RR = 2.31 [95% CI, 1.16–4.61]). There were no statistically significant associations for tears measuring < 1 cm, 1 to 3 cm, 3 to 5 cm, and > 3 cm.

Conclusion

Evidence is lacking with regard to the optimal timing of PROM after RC repair; however, this study suggests that tear size may be influential.

### Rehabilitation following rotator cuff repair: a multi-centre pilot&feasibility randomised controlled trial (RaCeR) [^114YMLjL]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Shoulder pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal pain presentations with disorders of the rotator cuff, the muscles and tendons surrounding the shoulder, widely regarded as the most common contributing factor. The prevalence of rotator cuff abnormalities, including rotator cuff tears, increases with age.

First-line treatment for people with shoulder pain and a torn rotator cuff includes advice to modify activity, analgesics, corticosteroid injection, and exercise supported by a physiotherapist. If insufficient, then surgical repair might be considered. Following surgery, rehabilitation is regarded as important. However, as surgical technique has progressed and the number of operations has increased, our understanding of the optimal approach to post-operative rehabilitation remains limited and opinions of surgeons and physiotherapists conflicting. Currently, following rotator cuff repair surgery, most patients are immobilised in a sling for up to six weeks, despite research suggesting that early mobilisation by discarding the sling might speed up recovery without long-term consequence. –

We conducted a multi-centre pilot and feasibility randomised controlled trial to evaluate the feasibility of a larger, fully powered, multi-centre randomised controlled trial to compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of early patient-directed rehabilitation with standard rehabilitation incorporating sling immobilisation for four weeks.

### Operative vs nonoperative treatment for atraumatic rotator cuff tears: a trial protocol for the arthroscopic rotator cuff pragmatic randomized clinical trial [^116YpfBE]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Randomization

Participants are randomized to receive operative or nonoperative treatment. Randomization is stratified by site, age, and tear size and is blocked within strata using a random sequence of differing block sizes (eg, blocks of 2, 4, and 6 could be used). Randomization strings for each site are unique and are randomly generated using an algorithm and administered in real time using a Research Electronic Data Capture randomization module.

Baseline Procedures

At baseline, participants complete study questionnaires about pain and movement, shoulder symptoms, daily and recreational activities, general and emotional health, and what treatments have been used to help the participant's shoulder. Participants also undergo a brief physical examination to measure strength and range of motion. Each participant's MRI examination is independently read using a standardized form in a blinded fashion by a musculoskeletal radiologist.

Treatment Protocols

Nonoperative and operative interventions for ARC are consistent with routine clinical standards of care for rotator cuff tears.

Nonoperative Intervention

Participants randomized to the nonoperative group of the study follow a prescribed physical therapy and home exercise program. A standardized, nonoperative rehabilitation protocol (eAppendix 1 in Supplement 2) has been developed for this trial with extensive input from our team of clinicians, researchers, and expert consultants. The duration of the nonoperative physical therapy program is approximately 3 months, with participants attending physical therapy 1 to 2 times a week, for a total of approximately 12 to 24 visits. Participants are encouraged to perform exercises at home with a dosing of therapy (physical therapy and/or home exercises) of approximately 4 times per week. The treatment stages of the nonoperative rehabilitation protocol are goal or performance based. Participants in the nonoperative group who make rapid progress may be advanced to the next stage of the rehabilitation treatment protocol if they meet the criteria to do so and may be discharged from physical therapy earlier than 3 months as appropriate. Participants perform a home exercise program during their rehabilitation program and may continue physical therapy beyond 3 months as prescribed or as deemed appropriate by their treating clinicians.

### Delayed versus early motion after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: a meta-analysis [^115Zzssp]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized trials to compare delayed vs early motion therapy on function after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

Methods

We searched 4 electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and Physiotherapy Evidence Database [PEDro]). The methodologic quality of the included studies was assessed, and the relevant data were extracted. Data were pooled for functional outcomes, rotator cuff tear recurrence, and shoulder range of motion. Complications were reported descriptively.

Results

Three level I and 1 level II randomized trials were eligible and included. Pooled analysis revealed no statistically significant differences in American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores between delayed vs early motion rehabilitation (mean difference [MD], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.8 to 4.7; p = 0.38, I² = 34%). The risk of retears after surgery did not differ statistically between treatment groups (risk ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.63–1.64; p = 0.95). Early passive motion led to a statistically significant, although clinically unimportant, improvement in forward elevation between groups (MD, -1°; 95% CI, -2° to 0°; P = 0.04, I² = 0%). There was no difference in external rotation between treatment groups (MD, 1°; 95% CI, -2° to 4°; P = 0.63, I² = 0%). None of the included studies identified any cases of postoperative shoulder stiffness.

Conclusions

The current meta-analysis did not identify any significant differences in functional outcomes and relative risks of recurrent tears between delayed and early motion in patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs. A statistically significant difference in forward elevation range of motion was identified; however, this difference is likely clinically unimportant.

### Does quality of life influence retear rate following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair? [^115mFGQj]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The primary objective was to assess whether a patient's early postoperative quality of life (QOL) correlates with the retear rate following single-tendon double-row rotator cuff repair.

Methods

We performed a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial of 58 patients who underwent single-tendon arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of full-thickness tears performed by a single surgeon. Patients were randomized to an early- or delayed-motion protocol. At 6 months, all patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging to assess whether the rotator cuffs were intact or retorn. QOL was assessed preoperatively and at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively using the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) index.

Results

After 6 months of rehabilitation, 41 patients (71%) had intact rotator cuff repairs whereas 17 (29%) had full-thickness tears. Patients with torn rotator cuffs at 6 months postoperatively had significantly lower WORC scores at 6 weeks postoperatively (P = 0.041). Patients with greater improvements in QOL perioperatively (preoperative WORC score minus 6-week postoperative WORC score > 264.5) were more likely to have full-thickness tears by 6 months postoperatively. Compliant patients assigned to the delayed-motion protocol had a failure rate of 11% (2 of 19) compared with 38% (15 of 39) in the noncompliant and early-motion protocol patients (P < .01). Overall, patients who were noncompliant with the shoulder immobilizer were 8.2 times more likely to have a failed repair on magnetic resonance imaging (P = 0.01).

Conclusions

Patients with better QOL shortly after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were more likely to have retears by 6 months.

### Digitally assisted versus conventional home-based rehabilitation after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: a randomized controlled trial [^115aHsqe]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

What Is Known

Rotator cuff tendinopathy is a major source of shoulder pain and disability. Surgical rotator cuff repair is many times required to tackle disability, and postsurgical rehabilitation is an essential step toward full recovery.
Evidence is growing that digitally assisted therapeutics can improve outcomes, personalize care, and decrease costs, but no such solution exists for postsurgical shoulder rehabilitation.

What Is New

This is the first study comparing a digitally assisted home-based rehabilitation program after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with conventional care. Treatment intensity and long-term clinical outcomes were maximized, while decreasing the dependency on human resources.

Shoulder pain is the third main complaint in primary care settings. – Approximately 65%–70% of these involve problems in the rotator cuff tendons (ROCTs), with incidence rising higher after the fourth decade of life.– The ROCT dysfunction represents, therefore, a huge burden for healthcare systems, insurance companies, and employers alike. In the United Kingdom, nearly £310 million is spent on medical appointments in the first 6 mos of pain onset, with costs of surgical procedures estimated at £30 million per year. In the United States, the annual financial burden of ROCT management was estimated at US $3 billion.

Most cases are initially treated conservatively. However, approximately 40% of patients will have persistent pain. Surgical repair may be an option in these cases. Rotator cuff repair (RCR) is one of the most commonly used surgical procedures,– and is becoming more frequent in advanced ages. In the United States alone, more than 300,000 RCRs are performed annualy.

Rehabilitation plays a pivotal role in the recovery from RCR. The need for home-based digital solutions is now felt more acutely than ever, in the face of the current COVID-19 pandemic. – Solutions enabling home-based rehabilitation without requiring real-time human supervision can be key to improving effectiveness and lowering costs, while keeping all stakeholders safe. Indeed, there are studies demonstrating the potential – and cost-effectivenessof postoperative shoulder care and rehabilitation through telehealth.

### Rehabilitation following rotator cuff repair: a multi-centre pilot&feasibility randomised controlled trial (RaCeR) [^113FZfsp]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Based on these findings, a fully powered randomised controlled trial comparing the clinical and cost-effectiveness of early patient-directed rehabilitation versus standard rehabilitation would be feasible with minor amendment to the research design. With reference to our predefined success criteria, 73/189 (39%) eligible patients were recruited, exceeding the target of 20%. A 50% proportional difference was identified between the groups for time spent out of sling (14/17 in the early patient-directed rehabilitation group, 8/25 in the standard rehabilitation group), exceeding the target of 40%. When withdrawals are included, the target of over 70% follow-up rates for the potential primary outcome measures at six weeks (50/73; 68%) was not met. This was met at 12 weeks (52/73; 71%) but would be regarded as insufficient in the context of a future randomised controlled trial with longer term follow-up.

The findings suggest that recruitment of eligible patients is feasible and that advice and support to remove the sling, and vice versa, enables a valid comparison between early and standard rehabilitation, incorporating four weeks of sling immobilisation. The principal issue faced was withdrawal due to participants not receiving rotator cuff repair surgery or not receiving surgery at all (11/73), an issue reported in other rotator cuff repair randomised controlled trials. When withdrawals are not included, the follow-up rates at 6 and 12 weeks were 94% and 98% suggesting that the randomised controlled trial follow-up processes were robust. We randomly allocated participants at variable time-points before surgery which risks the withdrawals we observed. In a future randomised controlled trial, consenting participants before surgery but randomly allocating once rotator cuff repair surgery has been undertaken would address this. We also observed six withdrawals requested by surgeons due to perceived risk of early patient-directed rehabilitation. This reason for withdrawal was more common in the early patient-directed rehabilitation group (n = 5) compared to the standard rehabilitation group (n = 1). Therefore in a future randomised controlled trial, working with surgeons who are in equipoise with regard to the comparison of early patient-directed rehabilitation and standard rehabilitation will be paramount.

### Comparing expert opinion within the care team regarding postoperative rehabilitation protocol following rotator cuff repair [^1159mkij]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There is no established consensus regarding the optimal rehabilitation protocol following rotator cuff repair, including duration of immobilization, timing to initiate range of motion and resistance exercises, and the importance of supervised, formal therapy. The purpose of this study was to determine agreement in opinion regarding rotator cuff rehabilitation between orthopedic surgeons and physical therapists (PTs).

Methods

A 50-question survey was created on a secure data capture system and distributed via e-mail to members of professional organization affiliations. Surgeon participants were recruited from the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, and PTs were recruited from the American Society of Shoulder and Elbow Therapists and the Academy of Orthopaedic Physical Therapy of the American Physical Therapy Association. Survey responses were analyzed for interprofessional differences in majority opinion and distribution of answer choices.

Results

A total of 167 surgeons and 667 PTs responded to the survey. Of the 39 questions evaluated, surgeons and PTs reached intraprofessional majority agreement in 26 (67%) and 28 (72%) statements, respectively, with agreements matching in 17 instances and differing in 4. The 2 groups had different answer preferences in 32 questions (82%). PTs were more likely to support shorter immobilization intervals (P < .001), earlier strengthening (P < .001), and more frequent home exercises (P = 0.002), whereas surgeons endorsed more conservative weight-bearing restrictions (P < .001), time-based phase transitions (P < .001), and web-based technological platforms for rehabilitation (P < .001).

Conclusion

Our findings show that although significant discrepancy of opinion exists within professions, greater differences in preferences exist between surgeons and PTs regarding rotator cuff repair rehabilitation.

### Is early passive motion exercise necessary after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair? [^113EChJG]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Early passive motion exercise has been the standard rehabilitation protocol after rotator cuff repair for preventing postoperative stiffness. However, recent approaches show that longer immobilization may enhance tendon healing and quality.

Purpose

To elucidate whether early passive motion exercise affects functional outcome and tendon healing after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

Study Design

Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods

One hundred five consecutive patients who underwent arthroscopic repair for small to medium-sized full-thickness rotator cuff tears were included. Patients with large to massive tears and concomitant stiffness or labral lesions were excluded. Patients were instructed to wear an abduction brace for 4 to 5 weeks after surgery and to start active-assisted shoulder exercise after brace weaning. Fifty-six patients were randomly allocated into group 1: early passive motion exercises were conducted 3 to 4 times per day during the abduction brace-wearing period. Forty-nine patients were allocated into group 2: no passive motion was allowed during the same period. Range of motion (ROM) and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain were measured preoperatively and 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Functional evaluations, including Constant score, Simple Shoulder Test (SST), and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, were also evaluated at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, or computed tomography arthrography was utilized to evaluate postoperative cuff healing.

Results

There were no statistical differences between the 2 groups in ROM or VAS for pain at each time point. Functional evaluations were not statistically different between the 2 groups either. The final functional scores assessed at 12 months for groups 1 and 2 were as follows: Constant score, 69.81 ± 3.43 versus 69.83 ± 6.24 (P = 0.854); SST, 9.00 ± 2.12 versus 9.00 ± 2.59 (P = 0.631); and ASES score, 73.29 ± 18.48 versus 82.90 ± 12.35 (P = 0.216). Detachment of the repaired cuff was identified in 12% of group 1 and 18% of group 2 (P = 0.429).

Conclusion

Early passive motion exercise after arthroscopic cuff repair did not guarantee early gain of ROM or pain relief but also did not negatively affect cuff healing. We suggest that early passive motion exercise is not mandatory after arthroscopic repair of small to medium-sized full-thickness rotator cuff tears, and postoperative rehabilitation can be modified to ensure patient compliance.

### Nonoperative treatment of chronic, massive irreparable rotator cuff tears: a systematic review with synthesis of a standardized rehabilitation protocol [^115UGU6L]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

A massive, irreparable rotator cuff tear may cause significant pain and dysfunction. However, the efficacy of nonoperative treatment modalities in this subset of patients is not currently well known. Also, there is currently no gold standard nonoperative protocol to guide treatment. The goal of the present systematic review is to determine if there is any evidence to support the use of various nonoperative treatment modalities and synthesize a standardized nonoperative treatment protocol for the patient with a massive irreparable rotator cuff tear.

Methods

A comprehensive review of the literature utilizing PRISMA guidelines was performed. Studies involving clinical outcomes of nonoperative treatment of massive, irreparable rotator cuff tears were included. Articles were reviewed by 2 reviewers to determine inclusion or exclusion based on established criteria. Selected articles were reviewed for results of clinical and functional outcomes. The studies were also reviewed to determine their level of evidence and potential sources of bias. A standardized nonoperative treatment protocol was developed by taking described elements of the protocols used in studies that demonstrated clinical improvement beyond the MCID for the outcome scores used by the authors.

Results

A total of 10 studies met inclusion criteria for our studies. Of the included studies, 1 was Level III evidence and the remaining 9 were Level IV evidence. Multiple studies showed significant improvement exceeding the MCID for functional outcome scores following treatment. Also, several studies demonstrated significant improvements in strength and range of motion. The overall success of nonoperative treatment ranged from 32%-96%. The synthesized nonoperative treatment protocol is characterized by requiring some supervised physical therapy, often requiring 12 weeks or more, focusing on supine exercises with gradual progression to upright. Corticosteroid injections and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may also be of benefit.

Conclusion

Despite low-quality evidence, nonoperative treatment has been shown to be efficacious for patients with chronic, massive, irreparable rotator cuff tears. Using these results, a synthesized rehabilitation program was developed to guide clinicians when treating patients with massive irreparable rotator cuff tears.

### Early versus delayed motion after rotator cuff repair: a systematic review of overlapping meta-analyses [^114MhHie]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Previous meta-analyses have been conducted to compare outcomes of early versus delayed motion after rotator cuff repair.

Purpose

To conduct a systematic review of overlapping meta-analyses comparing early versus delayed motion rehabilitation protocols after rotator cuff repair to determine which meta-analyses provide the best available evidence.

Study Design

Systematic review.

Methods

A systematic review was performed by searching PubMed and Cochrane Library databases. Search terms included "rotator cuff repair", "early passive motion", "immobilization", "rehabilitation protocol", and "meta-analysis". Results were reviewed to determine study eligibility. Patient outcomes and structural healing were extracted from these meta-analyses. Meta-analysis quality was assessed using the Oxman-Guyatt and Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses (QUOROM) systems. The Jadad decision algorithm was then used to determine which meta-analyses provided the best level of evidence.

Results

Seven meta-analyses containing a total of 5896 patients met the eligibility criteria (1 Level I evidence, 4 Level II evidence, 2 Level III evidence). None of these meta-analyses found immobilization to be superior to early motion; however, most studies suggested that early motion would increase range of motion (ROM), thereby reducing time of recovery. Three of these studies suggested that tear size contributed to the choice of rehabilitation to ensure proper healing of the shoulder. A study by Chan et al in 2014 received the highest QUOROM and Oxman-Guyatt scores, and therefore this meta-analysis appeared to have the highest level of evidence. Additionally, a study by Riboh and Garrigues in 2014 was selected as the highest quality study in this systematic review according to the Jadad decision algorithm.

Conclusion

The current, best available evidence suggests that early motion improves ROM after rotator cuff repair but increases the risk of rotator cuff retear. Lower quality meta-analyses indicate that tear size may provide a better strategy in determining the correct rehabilitation protocol.

### Which is better? Early versus delayed rehabilitation after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair [^111Lsneg]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to compare the 5-year clinical and functional outcomes, including repaired tendon healing status, between early and delayed rehabilitation after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair METHODS: A total of 75 patients with rotator cuff tears (less than 5cm) underwent arthroscopic repairs over a 60-month period. Participants were randomly assigned to early and delayed postoperative rehabilitation groups with distinct protocols. Clinical and functional outcome measures included Constant score, University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) score, visual analogue scale for pain and isokinetic dynamometer test for muscle strength recovery. Clinical and functional scores were compared between baseline and 5 years postoperatively. Radiologic assessment via magnetic resonance imaging was performed at a minimum of 12 months postoperatively for evaluations of tendon integrity and recurrent tears.

Results

Baseline characteristics showed no statistically significant differences between groups. Both groups demonstrated equivalent improvement in range of motion and pain scores with no statistical differences. Clinical scores improved significantly in both groups by postoperative 12 months and plateaued. At the postoperative 5-year mark, the early group showed better improvement in the visual analogue scale and UCLA score, while the delayed group had superior Constant scores. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging revealed six recurrent tears, two in the early group and four in the delayed group, with no statistical differences. Muscle strength recovery showed no differences between the two groups.

Conclusion

Both the early and the delayed rehabilitation groups showed similar outcomes in postoperative range of motion, functional scores, muscle strength recovery and tendon healing in the short- and mid-term follow-ups.

Level Of Evidence

Level III.

### Limited physical therapy utilization protocol does not affect impairment and disability in workers' compensation patients after rotator cuff repair: a short-term follow-up study [^115RyMzd]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment of rotator cuff tears in injured workers is associated with poorer outcomes and abnormally high utilization of clinical services. This study evaluates the effect on impairment and disability rates after the implementation of an accelerated independent rehabilitation protocol on injured workers undergoing mini-open rotator cuff repair.

Materials and Methods

Seventy-one primary rotator cuff repairs in injured workers were reviewed at least 1 year after claim closure. Outcomes based on permanent partial disability and impairment were compared among 28 patients using traditional outpatient physical therapy (group A) and 43 patients using an accelerated protocol-driven independent exercise program (group B). The number of physical therapy visits attended, disability, and impairment rates were compared between the 2 groups.

Results

Group B used a median of 16 physical therapy visits, which were 9 fewer visits per patient than group A (P < .001). This constituted a 36% reduction in the median number of physical therapy visits without negatively affecting disability and impairment rates. The difference between the 2 groups in time to release to work or time to claim closure was not significant.

Conclusions

The implementation of an accelerated, independent, exercise protocol reduced physical therapy utilization to levels below national best-practices benchmarks without negatively affecting impairment or disability rates in Workers' Compensation patients undergoing mini-open rotator cuff repair.

Level Of Evidence

Level IV, Retrospective Case Series, Prognostic Study.

### Post-surgery rehabilitation following rotator cuff repair. A survey of current (2020) Italian clinical practice [^116VJAXw]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

To analyse the clinical practice of Italian physiotherapists within the framework of postoperative rehabilitation of rotator cuff (RC) surgery patients, and to compare it with similar studies carried out in other countries.

Methods

A web-based, voluntary, cross-sectional survey with 27 closed multiple-choice questions was developed and submitted to Italian-based physiotherapists in order to assess their clinical practice.

Results

Data from 1160 questionnaires were then analysed. Thirty-five percent of respondents (n = 413/1160) reported that they commence passive range of motion from the first postoperative week, while 49.2% (n = 571/1160) start during the second or third week. The majority of respondents (n = 603/1160, 52.0%) introduce active mobilisation between the fourth and the sixth week after surgery and 41.1% (n = 477/1160) introduce overhead movements between the fourth and the sixth week after surgery.

Discussion and Conclusions

When managing the postoperative rehabilitation of RC surgery patients, Italian physiotherapists' practice is congruent with the guidelines published by American Society of Shoulder and Elbow Therapists (ASSET) and also with other UK surveys. However, while Italian physiotherapists manage immobilisation periods, active and passive mobilisation and the return to sport activities, according to evidence-based best practice guidelines, there is less consistency with respect to physical exercise, patient follow-up and referral. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONItalian physiotherapists' practice with patients following rotator cuff (RC) repair complies with evidence-based practice guidelines regarding immobilisation periods, passive and active mobilisation, and return to sport activities. There is less consistency between reported/declared practice and available evidence concerning physical exercise, patient follow-up, and referral. Physiotherapist with Orthopaedic Manipulative Physical Therapy (OMPT) training is more aligned with the current literature compared to physiotherapists without specific training, in terms of managing rehabilitation programmes, period of immobilisation and therapeutic exercise. More careful adherence to the international guidelines is recommended, in order to manage patients following RC repair in accordance with the evidence and to achieve the best possible outcomes.

### Minimal stiffness after rotator cuff repair with bioinductive collagen implants [^113QLW7J]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to specific restriction measurements in ROM, the definition of postoperative stiffness typically includes a time component. The onset of postoperative stiffness typically peaks at 3 months after RCR and can be "transient" or "resistive", based on the presence or absence of a response to nonsurgical treatment (respectively). However, stiffness occurring after a period of normal ROM may not be related to the primary surgery — a distinction that is rarely made in the literature. Patients in this study were required to have a minimum follow-up time of 6 months to allow for rehabilitation progression. Patients who presented before 6 months with delays in progression or limitations in ROM would be offered an escalation in care, including aggressive rehabilitation and/or surgical intervention. Six months is slightly longer that the "peak" incidence of postoperative stiffness; however, previous research has shown distinguishable remnants of the BCI to remain at 3 months after implantation, which could theoretically still cause or contribute to stiffness until full implant absorption by 6 months. In this study, therefore, a minimum follow-up time of 6 months was established as an acceptable time frame to fully evaluate stiffness over the expected lifespan of the BCI.

In addition to highlighting the need for a more consistent, well-accepted definition of postoperative stiffness, comparison between studies also raises specific concerns around confounding variables, such as postoperative rehabilitation and systemic medical comorbidities, both of which may influence the incidence of stiffness after surgery. Aligning with previously published rehabilitation recommendations, patients in the current study with partial thickness tears underwent an accelerated rehabilitation, with recommendations for patients to remove the sling within 1 week. Comparatively, Yeazell et almaintained patients in a sling for up to 7 weeks after surgery, and later agreed that this prolonged period of immobility could have contributed to the rates they observed. While controversy remains regarding the best rehabilitation protocol, the results of this study do seem to support the idea that a more aggressive time frame of sling discontinuation and ROM exercises can decrease the risk of stiffness in cases where the BCI is used. Future studies should directly analyze rehabilitation "aggressiveness" as an independent factor for stiffness and other outcome measures.

### The clinical efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture (EA) in perioperative rehabilitation of rotator cuff repair surgery: a protocol for a single-centre, randomized controlled trial [^117LMKcK]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Participants

Eligible patients must meet the diagnostic criteria for rotator cuff injuries as outlined in the "American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS): Management of Rotator Cuff Injuries Clinical Practice Guideline"and have confirmed rotator cuff tears identified via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) prior to surgery. The rotator cuff tear should be classified as a full-thickness tear less than 5-cm in size, according to the Ellman classification. In addition, patients should be between 40 and 70 years of aged, with no restriction on gender, and must be scheduled to undergo unilateral ARCR at Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital. Since ARCR is usually performed in conjunction with other procedures such as subacromial decompression or distal clavicle resection, these surgeries are permitted to enhance generalizability of the study. Participants must voluntarily agree to join the study, be willing to undergo all required examinations and treatments, and be able to cooperate with follow-up. Recruitment is scheduled to begin in June 2025 and is expected to conclude in December 2026.

Exclusion criteria include: shoulder pain or movement limitation due to cervical disc herniation, shoulder tumors, dislocation, fractures, stroke-induced hemiplegia, etc; concurrent surgeries in other anatomical regions; severe comorbidities involving the heart, liver, kidney, hematopoietic system, endocrine system, immune system, nervous system, malignancies and psychiatric disorders; history of alcohol or anesthetic drug abuse, or preoperative opioid use for pain management; known allergy to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); acupuncture treatment received within the past 6 months; allergies to acupuncture needles, with localized skin ulcer infections, needle-phobia, or with blood disorders (such as coagulation disorders, bleeding disorders, etc).

Participants will be withdrawn from the trial if they are found to have a full-thickness rotator cuff tear that does not meet the Ellman classification criteria of less than 5-cm. Participants will also be discontinued from the trial if they receive treatment other than the approved protocol or experience serious postoperative adverse events, such as severe incision infections, fractures, or dislocations, etc.

### A systematic review of electromyography studies in normal shoulders to inform postoperative rehabilitation following rotator cuff repair [^116GGxKo]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Study Design Systematic review. Background Electromyography (EMG) has previously been used to guide postoperative rehabilitation progression following rotator cuff repair to prevent deleterious loading of early surgical repair. Objective To review the current literature investigating EMG during rehabilitation exercises in normal shoulders, and to identify exercises that meet a cut point of 15% maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) or less and are unlikely to result in excessive loading in the early postoperative stages. Methods An electronic search of MEDLINE via Ovid, Embase, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library for all years up to June 2016 was performed. Studies were selected in relation to predefined selection criteria. Pooled mean MVICs were reported and classified as low (0%-15% MVIC), low to moderate (16%-20% MVIC), moderate (21%-40% MVIC), high (41%-60% MVIC), and very high (greater than 60% MVIC). Results A search identified 2159 studies. After applying the selection criteria, 20 studies were included for quality assessment, data extraction, and data synthesis. In total, 43 exercises spanning passive range of motion, active-assisted range of motion, and strengthening exercises were evaluated. Out of 13 active-assisted exercises, 9 were identified as suitable (15% MVIC or less) to load the supraspinatus and 10 as suitable to load the infraspinatus early after surgery.

### Rehabilitation variability after rotator cuff repair [^113HXux4]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There has been increasing recognition of the importance for standardized postoperative rehabilitation protocols. Despite published guidelines in 2016 by the American Society of Shoulder and Elbow Therapists (ASSET), optimal postoperative rehabilitation after rotator cuff repair (RCR) remains an area of active academic debate. The goals of this study were (1) to assess the variability of RCR rehabilitation protocols published online, (2) to study the congruence between online RCR rehabilitation protocols and the ASSET consensus statement, and (3) to identify differences in online RCR rehabilitation protocols from before and after 2016.

Methods

A web-based search was conducted for publicly available RCR rehabilitation protocols from websites of all Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) academic orthopedic institutions. A supplemental 10-page Google search was also performed with the search terms "rotator cuff repair rehabilitation protocol". Collected protocols were grouped by tear size (small/medium or large/massive) and examined for information relating to the following categories: protocol demographics, adjunctive therapy use, immobilization/range of motion, and strengthening. Findings were compared to the ASSET statement's recommendations. Protocols published before and after ASSET's 2016 publication were compared for differences.

Results

A total of 66 online RCR rehabilitation protocols were collected. Only 16 of 187 (8.5%) ACGME institutions provided online RCR rehabilitation protocols. The collected protocols recommend more aggressive rehabilitation in comparison to ASSET, specifically regarding immobilization time, passive range of motion initiation, active assisted range of motion initiation, and strengthening initiation (P < .001). Protocols published after 2016 trended toward more conservative recommendations in comparison to protocols published before 2016. Regardless of this trend, the majority of these recommendations were still largely more aggressive than ASSET's recommendations.

Conclusion

Despite an attempt by ASSET to provide standardization, this study highlights the marked variations that still exist regarding RCR rehabilitation. Additionally, online RCR rehabilitation protocols tend to make more aggressive recommendations than the ASSET consensus statement. Further research is needed to address these variations and to either validate, alter, or reject the ASSET recommendations.

### Does adding a 12-month exercise programme to usual care after a rotator cuff repair effect disability and quality of life at 12 months? A randomized controlled trial [^114uoB4b]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare a 12-month home-based exercise programme with usual care for disability and health-related quality of life after rotator cuff repair.

Design

Randomized controlled trial.

Setting

Outpatient physical and rehabilitation medicine clinic.

Subjects

Consecutive patients (n = 67, mean age 54 years) who underwent rotator cuff repairs were randomized into an experimental group (EG) or a usual care group (UCG).

Interventions

The UCG received ordinary postoperative instructions, while the EG were given advice and instructions on a shoulder muscle strengthening programme to be undertaken at home.

Main Measures

Disability was assessed with the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form (ASES), and quality of life with the Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36).

Results

At the follow-up, no between-group differences were observed in any of the outcomes. The mean (SD) ASES score improved by 21 points (95% CI, 16 to 26, p < 0.001) in the EG from the baseline 74 (14) and by 25 points (95% CI, 20 to 31, p < 0.001) in the UCG from the baseline 70 (18). Both groups exhibited significant improvements (p < 0.001) in the SF-36 physical component score. In the UCG, improvements were observed in the Social Functioning (p = 0.034) and Role Emotional (p = 0.003) dimensions. In the EG, 57% of the patients completed the exercises twice weekly for the first six months, after which training adherence declined.

Conclusions

The home exercise programme and usual care were equally effective in improving disability and quality of life after rotator cuff repair. The extra time involved in teaching the home exercise programme is not warranted.

### The clinical efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture (EA) in perioperative rehabilitation of rotator cuff repair surgery: a protocol for a single-centre, randomized controlled trial [^112J3BLv]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Pain is one of the main complications after rotator cuff repair. If acute postoperative pain is not effectively controlled, it may lead to chronic persistent pain after surgery. Electroacupuncture (EA) is an effective tool for pain control. However, EA specifically for alleviating postoperative pain after rotator cuff repair has not been studied in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This pilot study aims to design a RCT to assess the efficacy and safety of EA as an adjunctive therapy during the perioperative period of rotator cuff repair.

Patients and Methods

This single-center, subject-and-assessor-blinded, randomized, sham-controlled trial will enroll 112 participants diagnosed with rotator cuff tears and who are scheduled to undergo unilateral arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR). Participants will be allocated at a 1:1 ratio to receive either EA or sham electroacupuncture (SEA) (using blunt-tip needles and no electrical current). Treatments will be will be administered 2 hours before surgery, 2 hours after surgery and once daily for the following surgery for 2 days (4 treatment sessions in total), and then be followed up for another 1 week. The primary outcome is the changes in visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for resting pain in the affected shoulder. The secondary outcome measures include VAS scores for pain during movement of the affected shoulder, limb swelling scores, dosage of postoperative analgesic drugs, frequency of postoperative nausea and vomiting, heart rate and blood pressure after the operation, sleep quality during the hospital stay.

Conclusion

This pilot study will discuss whether EA is a valuable adjunct in postoperative care at relieving pain and improving patients' quality of life. This RCT will inform the design of a further full-scale trial.

### Management of rotator cuff injuries [^1168XXfc]. AAOS (2025). High credibility.

Future research priorities for rotator cuff pathology — High quality studies comparing the outcomes of operative and non-operative treatment of rotator cuff pathology of all types remains a major gap in knowledge. Ideally, studies will have a minimum of 5-year of follow-up in order to better understand the efficacy of each treatment. Future studies should focus more on how comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, and BMI affect RC injury outcomes. Questions persist regarding the timing of physical therapy after surgery, and the need for formal therapy versus a supervised home program. While widely employed in practice, the risks and benefits of corticosteroid injections in patients with rotator cuff tears remain unclear. The risk and expense of orthobiologics in rotator cuff surgery remains difficult to fully assess, even though multiple high-quality studies are currently available. The use of either allograft or xenograft patches for augmentation of rotator cuff repair or for superior capsular reconstruction has yet to be scientifically proven. Finally, given the opioid epidemic, high-quality studies of multimodal analgesia for rotator cuff surgery would seem to be a matter of public policy. High-strength, level one studies comparing the outcomes of operative and non-treatment of rotator cuff pathology of all types remains a major gap in knowledge.

### Open, mini-open, and all-arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgery: indications and implications for rehabilitation [^1134ckJJ]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Rotator cuff tears lead to debilitating shoulder dysfunction and impairment. The goal of rotator cuff repair is to eliminate pain and improve function with increased shoulder strength and range of motion. The clinical outcomes of the surgical methods of rotator cuff repair (open, mini-open, and all-arthroscopic cuff repair) vary, as each method provides an array of advantages and disadvantages. Although the open surgical technique has long been considered the gold standard of rotator cuff repair, surgeons are becoming more adept at decreasing patient morbidity through decreased surgical trauma from an all-arthroscopic approach. In addition to a surgery-specific rotator cuff rehabilitation program, effective communication, and coordination of care by the physical therapist and surgeon are essential in optimal patient education and outcomes. In the ideal situation, a very well-educated therapist who has great communication with the treating surgeon can mobilize the shoulder early, re-establish scapulothoracic function safely and minimize the risk of stiffness and retear, while facilitating return to function. Treatment options can be individualized according to patient age, size and chronicity of tear, surgical approach, and fixation method. We recommend that patients who have undergone an all-arthroscopic rotator cuff repair undergo an accelerated postoperative rehabilitation program. A rational approach to therapy involves early, safe motion to allow optimal tendon healing, yet maintenance of joint mobility with minimal stress. As the field of orthopedics and, particularly, rotator cuff repair continues to develop with new technologies, the patient, physical therapist, and doctor need to work together to ensure optimal outcomes and patient satisfaction.

### The effect of early range of motion on quality of life, clinical outcome, and repair integrity after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair [^112GT3hk]. Arthroscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the effect of early versus delayed motion protocols on quality of life, clinical outcomes, and repair integrity in patients who have undergone arthroscopic single-tendon rotator cuff repair.

Methods

This was a prospective, randomized, investigator-blinded clinical trial. Seventy-three patients from a single surgeon's practice who underwent arthroscopic repair of a single-tendon rotator cuff tear were randomized to either an early motion protocol (starting 2 to 3 days after surgery) or a delayed motion protocol (starting 28 days after surgery). The primary outcome measure was the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff index (WORC). Secondary outcome measures included clinical outcome scores, integrity of the repair on 6-month magnetic resonance imaging scans, pain scores, physical examination data, and ultrasonography. Study participants were followed up at 3, 6, and 12 weeks; 6 months; and 1 year postoperatively.

Results

There was no statistically significant difference in WORC scores at 6 months (529 ± 472 in delayed group vs 325 ± 400 in early group, P = 0.08). Mixed-effects analysis indicated the early group maintained lower WORC scores throughout the postoperative period (estimated difference of 191, P = 0.04). The proportions of patients with tears on the 6-month postoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan were comparable (31% in delayed group vs 34% in early group, P = 0.78).

Conclusions

There was no difference between the delayed and early motion groups in WORC scores at 6 months after surgery. Early motion was associated with lower WORC scores throughout the postoperative period; however, both groups had a similar trajectory of improvement, suggesting both protocols have the same effect on patient-reported improvement. Although failure rates were similar between the groups, the sample size was not sufficient to support a statement regarding the relation between tear morphology and the rehabilitation protocol.

Level Of Evidence

Level II, lesser-quality randomized controlled trial.

### Effect of two rehabilitation protocols on range of motion and healing rates after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: aggressive versus limited early passive exercises [^1166Avc4]. Arthroscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare range of motion and healing rates between 2 different rehabilitation protocols after arthroscopic single-row repair for full-thickness rotator cuff tear.

Methods

Sixty-four shoulders available for postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were enrolled in this study. Aggressive early passive rehabilitation (manual therapy [2 times per day] and unlimited self-passive stretching exercise) was performed in 30 shoulders (group A) and limited early passive rehabilitation (limited continuous passive motion exercise and limited self-passive exercise) in 34 shoulders (group B). A postoperative MRI scan was performed at a mean of 7.6 months (range, 6 to 12 months) after surgery.

Results

Regarding range of motion, group A improved more rapidly in forward flexion, external rotation at the side, internal and external rotation at 90° of abduction, and abduction than group B until 3 months postoperatively with significant differences. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups at 1-year follow-up (P = 0.827 for forward flexion, P = 0.132 for external rotation at the side, P = 0.661 for external rotation at 90° of abduction, and P = 0.252 for abduction), except in internal rotation at 90° of abduction (P = 0.021). In assessing the repair integrity with postoperative MRI scans, 7 of 30 cases (23.3%) in group A and 3 of 34 cases (8.8%) in group B had retears, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.106).

Conclusions

Pain, range of motion, muscle strength, and function all significantly improved after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, regardless of early postoperative rehabilitation protocols. However, aggressive early motion may increase the possibility of anatomic failure at the repaired cuff. A gentle rehabilitation protocol with limits in range of motion and exercise times after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair would be better for tendon healing without taking any substantial risks.

Level Of Evidence

Level II, randomized controlled trial.

### Operative vs nonoperative treatment for atraumatic rotator cuff tears: a trial protocol for the arthroscopic rotator cuff pragmatic randomized clinical trial [^114PKp22]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Cointerventions

Participants are able to take analgesic medications, have shoulder injections, and undergo other nonsurgical interventions, because it would not be ethical to restrict the use of these interventions. Use of cointerventions is recorded in follow-up questionnaires completed by the participant.

Assessment of Fidelity and Compliance With Rehabilitation Protocols

Patients are asked about their compliance with and frequency of attending physical therapy sessions and home exercises in the 3-, 6-, and 12-month questionnaires. Participants also maintain a self-record of their physical therapy visits, home exercises, and daily shoulder pain using a physical therapy diary. This diary can be completed either on paper or electronically via a smartphone application. Compliance with the rehabilitation program will be assessed in both the nonoperative and postoperative rehabilitation arms. The treating physical therapist completes a standardized report form that notes start and end dates and frequency of physical therapy attendance by the participant and the physical therapist's compliance with the prescribed protocol.

Crossover

Participants may cross over from one treatment to another at any point during the trial. Participants are encouraged to stay in their randomized treatment group for at least 6 months to allow the treatment to which they were randomized to be fully effective.

Follow-up

Participants are followed up via study questionnaires at approximately 3, 6, and 12 months after randomization. Follow-up questionnaires may be completed via a paper copy or an electronic version. Physical therapy diaries are also collected through 12 months.

Electronic Data Collection and Data Management

We follow Good Trial Practice guidelines for data capture and quality assurance, trial conduct, implementation, analysis, and reporting that were established by Piantadosiand Meinertand are now widely acknowledged industry standards. Study data are collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Captureelectronic data capture tools. Data validation and query management procedures will identify suspicious data through the application of validation rules, generate requests for data review by study sites, and monitor the resolution of these requests. Data will also be reviewed for quality and audited.

### Rehabilitation following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: a review of current literature [^111W31Ta]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

Physical rehabilitation following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair has conventionally involved a 4- to 6-week period of immobilization; there are two schools of thought regarding activity level during this period. Some authors encourage early, more aggressive rehabilitation along with the use of a continuous passive motion device; others propose later, more conservative rehabilitation. Although some studies report trends in improved early range of motion, pain relief, and outcomes scores with aggressive rehabilitation following rotator cuff repair, no definitive consensus exists supporting a clinical difference resulting from rehabilitation timing in the early stages of healing. Rehabilitation timing does not affect outcomes after 6 to 12 months postoperatively. Given the lack of information regarding which patient groups benefit from aggressive rehabilitation, individualized patient care is warranted.

### Rehabilitation following total shoulder arthroplasty [^115jyVMo]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

Total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is a standard operative treatment for a variety of disorders of the glenohumeral joint. Patients, who have continued shoulder pain and loss of function in the presence of advanced joint pathology, despite conservative management, are often managed by undergoing a TSA. The overall outcomes that are reported after surgical intervention are quite good and appear to be primarily determined by the underlying pathology and the tissue quality of the rotator cuff. The current Neer protocol for postoperative TSA rehabilitation is widely used and based on tradition and the basic science of soft tissue and bone healing. The purpose of this paper is to review the indications for TSA, focusing on the underlying pathologies, and to describe the variables that impact the rehabilitation program of individuals who have had a TSA. A postoperative TSA rehabilitation protocol and algorithm, founded on basic science principles and tailored toward the specific clinical condition, are presented.

### Rehabilitation of the rotator cuff: an evaluation-based approach [^112YHxFh]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

Rotator cuff disease of the shoulder, a common condition, is often incapacitating. Whether nonsurgical or surgical, successful management of rotator cuff disease is dependent on appropriate rehabilitation. Numerous rehabilitation protocols for the management of rotator cuff disease are based primarily on anecdotal clinical observation. The available literature on shoulder rehabilitation, in conjunction with clinical observation that takes into consideration the underlying tissue quality and structural integrity of the rotator cuff, can be compiled into a set of rehabilitation guidelines. The four phases of rehabilitation begin with maintaining and protecting the repair in the immediate postoperative period, followed by progression from early passive range of motion through return to preoperative levels of function.

### Rehabilitation following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: a prospective randomized trial of immobilization compared with early motion [^116ZqzSd]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The influence of rehabilitation on the outcomes after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to compare clinical results and tendon healing rates following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair utilizing two distinct rehabilitation protocols.

Methods

Over a thirty-month period, 124 patients under the age of sixty-five years underwent arthroscopic repair of a full-thickness rotator cuff tear measuring < 30 mm in width. Postoperatively, patients were randomized either to a traditional rehabilitation program with early range of motion or to an immobilization group with delayed range of motion for six weeks. Clinical outcomes assessment included visual analog pain scale score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Simple Shoulder Test (SST), relative Constant score, and strength measurements at six, twelve, and twenty-four months. Tendon integrity was assessed with ultrasonography at a minimum of twelve months postoperatively.

Results

There were no significant differences in patient age, tear size, or measures of preoperative function between groups at baseline. Final clinical follow-up was available for 114 subjects (92%). Active elevation and external rotation were better in the traditional rehabilitation group at three months. No significant differences were seen in functional scores, active motion, and shoulder strength between rehabilitation groups at later time points. Functional outcomes plateaued at six or twelve months except for the relative Constant score, which improved up to twenty-four months following surgery. Ninety-two percent of the tears were healed, with no difference between rehabilitation protocols (p = 0.46).

Conclusions

Arthroscopic repair of small and medium full-thickness rotator cuff tears results in reliable improvements in clinical outcomes and a high rate of tendon integrity using a double-row repair technique in patients under the age of sixty-five years. There is no apparent advantage or disadvantage of early passive range of motion compared with immobilization with regard to healing or functional outcome.

### Effectiveness of early versus delayed rehabilitation following total shoulder replacement: a systematic review [^113H3qaD]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

One reason commonly proposed for a more conservative postoperative approach following anatomic total shoulder replacement is to protect the subscapularis repair or lesser tuberosity osteotomy. A functioning subscapularis is thought to be important to maintain the balance of the rotator cuff. A structurally, or functionally, deficient rotator cuff can increase the shear forces and edge-loading of an anatomic shoulder replacement, increasing the likelihood of early glenoid component loosening and eventual revision surgery. For this reason a more conservative rehabilitation approach, with a period of strict shoulder immobilisation, is often recommended. Denard and Lädermannreported lower rates of lesser tuberosity osteotomy healing in the early rehabilitation group but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Despite this, healing rates need to be carefully monitored in future adequately powered randomised controlled trials.

Finally, this review found that there is limited, very low-quality evidence from one RCT that early rehabilitation may result in better functional outcome scores at four weeks and eight weeks following anatomic total shoulder replacement compared to delayed rehabilitation. Point estimates were not provided in the published paper therefore it is not known whether the between-group difference exceeded the minimum clinically important differences for the chosen outcome measures. Nonetheless, recent research has demonstrated that improved post-operative function following total shoulder replacement is associated with higher patient satisfaction. Improved functional independence also results in reduced patient frustration as reliance on others for self-care is reduced. An earlier return to function may therefore be an important outcome for patients even if the advantages of early rehabilitation are no longer visible by three-month post-surgery. The impact of early rehabilitation during the first eight weeks following surgery therefore warrants further exploration in future high-quality randomised controlled trials. Understanding patients' perspectives on early post-surgical recovery through further qualitative research would also be useful.

### Operative vs nonoperative treatment for atraumatic rotator cuff tears: a trial protocol for the arthroscopic rotator cuff pragmatic randomized clinical trial [^117PgCaJ]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Rotator cuff disorders remain the most common cause of shoulder pain and are among the most common reasons for patients to seek care in primary and specialty settings. Although operative and nonoperative treatments are offered to patients with atraumatic rotator cuff tears, there is a lack of evidence to support operative vs nonoperative treatment. This paucity of evidence has been highlighted by several professional agencies and experts.

Objective

To perform a pragmatic randomized clinical trial, the Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff trial, comparing pain and functional outcomes in patients undergoing operative vs nonoperative treatment for atraumatic rotator cuff tears, and assessing heterogeneity of treatment effects by age and tear size.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Trial protocol of the Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff trial. This pragmatic randomized clinical trial of an estimated 700 patients is adequately powered to accomplish its aims with 488 patients. Primary analysis will be conducted on an intent-to-treat population in the context of a mixed model. The multicenter trial started recruitment in 2018 with a 1-year follow-up duration. Patients aged 50 years or older to younger than 85 years with magnetic resonance imaging-confirmed atraumatic rotator cuff tears that are suitable for either operative or nonoperative treatment will be enrolled. Block randomization will be performed and stratified by site, age, and tear size.

Intervention

Nonoperative treatment consists of an approximately 3-month standardized physical therapy program, whereas operative treatment consists of rotator cuff surgery followed by approximately 4 months of postoperative rehabilitation.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome is patient-reported Shoulder Pain and Disability Index score, and the secondary outcome is American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Form score measured at 1 year of follow-up.

Discussion

The Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff trial is ongoing, and 12 sites with more than 40 physicians are currently recruiting patients. Although there is variation by site, as of May 2, 2019, 13% of all patients screened (787 of 6293) were eligible for the trial, and 9% of eligible patients (74 of 787) were recruited. Results of this study may help patients, clinicians, and policy makers assess the comparative effectiveness of operative vs nonoperative treatment for atraumatic rotator cuff tears.

### Factors affecting rotator cuff healing [^1146fx4n]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2014). Low credibility.

Several studies have noted that increasing age is a significant factor for diminished rotator cuff healing, while biomechanical studies have suggested the reason for this may be an inferior healing environment in older patients. Larger tears and fatty infiltration or atrophy negatively affect rotator cuff healing. Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, double-row repairs, performing a concomitant acromioplasty, and the use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) do not demonstrate an improvement in structural healing over mini-open rotator cuff repairs, single-row repairs, not performing an acromioplasty, or not using PRP. There is conflicting evidence to support postoperative rehabilitation protocols using early motion over immobilization following rotator cuff repair.

### The clinical efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture (EA) in perioperative rehabilitation of rotator cuff repair surgery: a protocol for a single-centre, randomized controlled trial [^115BCg4D]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This single-center, subject-and-assessor-blinded, randomized, sham-controlled trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EA in perioperative rehabilitation after rotator cuff repair, focusing on pain management and recovery. Acute pain is common after ARCR, and if not well controlled, may progress to chronic pain, impair tendon-to-bone healing and delay recovery. Current multimodal analgesia mainly relies on drugs, which may cause adverse reactions and psychological burden, underscoring the need for safe, non-pharmacological adjuncts. Evidence shows microcurrent stimulation and extracorporeal shock wave therapy can effectively reduce postoperative pain. These findings highlight the potential of non-pharmacological interventions, particularly electrotherapy, in optimizing multimodal analgesic strategies to accelerate pain relief and enhance tendon-to-bone healing.

Electroacupuncture, an advanced form of traditional acupuncture, delivers a controlled electrical current through acupuncture needles. By applying specific stimulation parameters, EA can provide more consistent and objective therapeutic input. It has demonstrated superior effects in analgesia and sedation, promoting blood circulation, and modulating muscle tension. Studies have shown that EA reduces inflammation responses, restores bioelectrical homeostasis in tissues, and promotes the release of specific neuropeptides in the central nervous system, resulting in the analgesic effect. Systematic reviews support its role in shoulder pain management and frozen shoulder, and studies report its safety and effectiveness in long-term rehabilitation after rotator cuff repair. However, most have small samples or lack placebo controls, limiting generalizability.

In postoperative pain management, a meta-analysis of 13 RCTs found acupuncture significantly reduced day-1 pain and opioid use. Other studies report EA benefits in abdominal, nasal, and gynecological surgeries, improving pain control, reducing anesthetic needs, lowering PONV incidence, and accelerating recovery. In arthroscopic rehabilitation, EA also improved short-term pain and mobility after triangular fibrocartilage complex repair. Collectively, these findings support EA as a safe adjunct in multimodal analgesia.

Musculoskeletal rehabilitation studies further suggest EA reduces pain and improves function by modulating pain sensitization pathways. A meta-meta-analysis indicates manual therapies, including acupuncture, may desensitize central and peripheral pain. Emerging evidence highlights molecular mechanisms, such as modulation of tryptophan-derived metabolites and gut microbiota in osteoarthritis-related pain. These results suggest EA exerts not only localized but also systemic modulatory effects. Nonetheless, evidence on EA after rotator cuff repair remains scarce. If effective and safe, EA could become a standard perioperative intervention in both TCM and Western contexts.

Postoperative interventions

Mazzocca et al. compared early (POD 2–3) vs. delayed (POD 28) motion rehabilitation protocols after rotator cuff repair and did not find any difference in pain scores 7–10 days postoperatively 57. Opioid consumption was not recorded. Hollman et al. assessed an abduction brace vs. an antirotation sling as a way to immobilise the shoulder after surgery 58. Neither pain scores nor opioid use after surgery were different between the techniques. Mahure et al. performed a placebo‐controlled study investigating postoperative transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and found lower pain scores at 12 h and on POD 7 59. Opioid consumption after surgery also favoured TENS. Kraeutler et al. compared compressive cryotherapy vs. standard ice wrap and found neither pain scores nor opioid use after surgery was significantly different 60. Cho et al. compared the addition of zolpidem as a sleep aid to multi‐modal analgesia with multimodal analgesia only 61. Pain scores after surgery were not significantly different; the zolpidem group had lower rescue analgesic requirements.

### The clinical efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture (EA) in perioperative rehabilitation of rotator cuff repair surgery: a protocol for a single-centre, randomized controlled trial [^115o1id8]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This randomized controlled trial will provide robust evidence on the efficacy and safety of EA in perioperative rehabilitation after rotator cuff repair. If proven effective, EA may serve as a valuable adjunct to postoperative care, enhancing analgesia, reducing side effects, and accelerating recovery. The findings could lay the groundwork for large-scale, multicenter trials and inform the development of multimodal pain management strategies that integrate traditional Chinese medicine. Ultimately, this study may contribute to refining clinical practice guidelines and optimizing postoperative care for rotator cuff repair.

### Immobilization after rotator cuff repair: what evidence Do we have now? [^1152QA2U]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Recurrent tears after rotator cuff repair are common. Postoperative rehabilitation after rotator cuff repair is a modifiable factor controlled by the surgeon that can affect re-tear rates. Some surgeons prefer early mobilization after rotator cuff repair, whereas others prefer a period of immobilization to protect the repair site. The tendon-healing process incorporates biochemical and biomechanical responses to mechanical loading. Healing can be optimized with controlled loading. Complete load removal and chronic overload can be deleterious to the process. Several randomized clinical studies have also characterized the role of postoperative mobilization after rotator cuff repair.

The study enrolled 68 patients (average age, 63.2 years) who met inclusion criteria. All patients had a full-thickness crescent-shaped tear of the supraspinatus that was repaired using a transosseous equivalent suture-bridge technique along with subacromial decompression. In the early group, 33 patients were randomized to passive elevation and rotation that began at postoperative day 2. In the delayed group, 35 patients began the same protocol at 6 weeks. Patients were monitored clinically for a minimum of 12 months, and rotator cuff healing was assessed using ultrasound imaging.

Results

Both groups had similar improvements in preoperative to postoperative American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores (early group: 43.9 to 91.9, P < .0001; delayed group: 41.0 to 92.8, P < .0001) and Simple Shoulder Test scores (early group: 5.5 to 11.1, P < .0001; delayed group: 5.1 to 11.1, P < .0001). There were no significant differences in patient satisfaction, rotator cuff healing, or range of motion between the early and delayed groups.

Conclusions

Patients in the early group and delayed group both demonstrated very similar outcomes and range of motion at 1 year. There was a slightly higher rotator cuff healing rate in the delayed passive range of motion group compared with the early passive range of motion group (91% vs 85%).

### Effectiveness of supervised physiotherapy after arthroscopic rotator cuff reconstruction: a randomized controlled trial [^1115kA7L]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The benefit of supervised physiotherapy after rotator cuff surgery is unclear. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to assess the effectiveness of supervised physiotherapy after arthroscopic rotator cuff reconstruction.

Methods

Eighty patients with full-thickness supraspinatus tendon tears were randomly assigned to either supervised physiotherapy or home exercises only. The primary outcome measure was the Constant score at 12 months after surgery.

Results

A total of 70 patients were available for analyses at 1-year follow-up. There were no statistically significant differences in the primary outcome between the treatment groups.

Conclusion

Supervised physiotherapy after arthroscopic rotator cuff reconstruction does not provide additional benefit compared with home exercises alone at 1-year follow-up.

### Electromyographic analysis of the rotator cuff in postoperative shoulder patients during passive rehabilitation exercises [^112BtacB]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Numerous rehabilitation protocols exist for postoperative rotator cuff repairs. Because the goal of early rehabilitation is to prevent postoperative adhesions while protecting the repaired tendons, it would be advantageous to know which range-of-motion exercises allow the rotator cuff to remain the most passive in a painful, guarded, postsurgical shoulder.

Methods

Twenty-six subjects who had undergone subacromial decompression, distal clavicle resection, or a combination of both procedures volunteered to participate within the first 4 days after surgery. Fine-wire electrodes were inserted into the subject's supraspinatus (SS) and infraspinatus (IS). Muscle activity was recorded at resting baseline (BL) and during 14 exercises that have been found in the passive phase of rotator cuff protocols and tested in healthy subjects. Each exercise was compared with BL activity as well as with other exercises in the same movement group.

Results

The SS remained as passive as BL during therapist- and self-assisted external rotation, therapist-assisted elevation, pendulums, and isometric internal rotation and adduction. The IS was activated greater than BL for all 14 exercises studied.

Conclusion

Of the 14 exercises studied, 6 allowed the SS and 0 allowed the IS to remain as passive as quiet-stance BL in postsurgical subacromial decompression/distal clavicle resection patients.
