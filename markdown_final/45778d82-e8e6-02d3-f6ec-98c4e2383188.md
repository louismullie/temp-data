## Question

Ionized calcium management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about ionized calcium management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about when to measure ionized calcium versus relying on total or albumin-adjusted calcium. Then, I should verify the limitations of albumin-adjusted formulas and in which populations they fail. Next, I will examine thresholds for hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia that warrant intervention. After that, I need to outline treatment strategies by scenario, including critical illness, trauma, hyperkalemia, and CKD. Finally, I should consider special populations, monitoring cadence, and synthesize a practical decision framework with caveats about evidence quality and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the physiologic basis and why ionized calcium matters. Only the ionized fraction is biologically active, whereas about half of total calcium is albumin-bound and therefore not immediately available for neuromuscular and coagulation functions, so measuring ionized calcium is the most accurate way to assess true calcium status in vivo [^271d4177] [^5b949a66].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about replacing total calcium with ionized calcium in all settings. I need to check when ionized calcium is most impactful. Contemporary guidance suggests ionized calcium is most appropriate in acute care, critical illness, massive transfusion, and when total calcium does not align with symptoms or clinical status; outside these contexts, total calcium remains practical and cost-effective, though I should double-check that this aligns with high-quality data [^4a5245f3] [^0b17dd16].

> Next, I should review the evidence that albumin-adjusted calcium is unreliable. Large cross-sectional data show adjusted calcium correlates only modestly with ionized calcium and often performs no better than unadjusted total calcium; importantly, it tends to underestimate true hypocalcemia and overestimate true hypercalcemia, especially in hypoalbuminemia and critical illness, which can mislead treatment decisions [^0b17dd16] [^b16fc0bd] [^da9a30f6].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of misclassification in specific populations. In ESRD, both uncorrected and corrected total calcium frequently misclassify ionized calcium status, with a substantial proportion of patients with elevated ionized calcium appearing normocalcemic by total or corrected calcium; this hidden hypercalcemia is associated with higher mortality, underscoring the need to measure ionized calcium in dialysis patients when results will change management [^700956f1] [^8330ecd7].

> I will now examine thresholds that trigger action. For hypocalcemia, severe ionized calcium less than about 0.8 mmol/L is independently associated with increased ICU and hospital mortality, and levels below 0.9 mmol/L are linked to coagulopathy and arrhythmias in trauma and critical care, prompting correction; for hypercalcemia, ionized calcium above roughly 1.4–1.5 mmol/L is considered severe and warrants urgent therapy, with malignancy-related hypercalcemia often graded by ionized calcium thresholds in guidelines [^2cb6a8d9] [^1cdea510].

> Let me think about critical illness and trauma, where ionized calcium is most dynamic. Hypocalcemia is common in critical illness and often reflects disease severity rather than a primary calcium disorder; observational data suggest that only severe ionized hypocalcemia independently predicts mortality, and routine supplementation to normalize values has not been shown to improve outcomes, so I should avoid reflexive replacement unless there is symptomatic or severe hypocalcemia or a specific indication like citrate toxicity or massive transfusion [^2cb6a8d9] [^f3341ab5].

> But wait, what if the patient is actively bleeding and receiving citrated blood products. I should confirm that ionized calcium must be monitored and corrected in this scenario. Multiple trauma guidelines recommend maintaining ionized calcium within the normal range during massive transfusion because citrate chelates calcium and impairs coagulation; calcium chloride is preferred for rapid correction, and some trauma studies suggest targeting at least 0.95 mmol/L within 24 hours, though causality remains uncertain and overcorrection risks hypercalcemia, so I need to balance speed with precision and reassess frequently [^c97ef47a] [^9e5a77bf] [^e19dc4dc] [^6ab4ed60] [^a3b2a515].

> Next, I should review hyperkalemia with ECG changes, where calcium is a membrane-stabilizing antidote. I initially thought calcium gluconate is always preferred peripherally, but hold on, I should verify the resuscitation context. UK hyperkalemia guidance recommends calcium chloride in cardiac arrest or peri-arrest for faster onset, and calcium gluconate otherwise, with typical dosing of about 6.8 mmol elemental calcium delivered over 5–10 minutes depending on the formulation and urgency, repeated if ECG changes persist [^760303f2] [^a72ba9fd].

> I need to ensure I address CKD and dialysis, where calcium targets and measurement strategy differ. KDIGO advises avoiding hypercalcemia in adults with CKD G3a–G5D and supports using dialysate calcium in the 1.25–1.50 mmol/L range in hemodialysis to balance hypocalcemia risk against calcium load; given the poor performance of total and corrected calcium, ionized calcium should be measured when results will alter therapy, and calcium-containing binders or vitamin D analogs should be titrated cautiously to avoid iatrogenic hypercalcemia [^61ee5457] [^129e63e4] [^700956f1].

> Let me consider special populations and scenarios. In pediatrics, ionized calcium is the reference standard for symptomatic hypocalcemia, and symptomatic children should receive IV calcium with close monitoring; in post-thyroidectomy patients, low iPTH predicts hypocalcemia and ionized calcium helps guide tapering of calcium and calcitriol; in regional citrate anticoagulation for CRRT, strict ionized calcium monitoring is mandatory to detect citrate accumulation and maintain circuit anticoagulation while preventing systemic hypocalcemia [^ed931cf9] [^0680096a] [^6ae761ab] [^be5791f8].

> I should double-check the monitoring cadence in high-risk settings. During massive transfusion or CRRT with citrate, ionized calcium should be checked frequently, often every 1–6 hours initially, with simultaneous attention to total calcium to detect a rising total-to-ionized calcium ratio that signals citrate accumulation; in general critical care, trending ionized calcium every 24–48 hours is reasonable when abnormalities are present, recognizing that many mild cases normalize spontaneously as the underlying illness improves [^be5791f8] [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical decision framework. If the clinical question is acute management of hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia, or if total calcium conflicts with symptoms or the clinical picture, I should order ionized calcium; if the question is chronic monitoring in stable outpatients without protein disturbances, total calcium may suffice, but I should avoid overinterpreting albumin-adjusted values, especially in hypoalbuminemia or kidney failure, and consider repeating ionized calcium when results are discordant or management hinges on accuracy [^4a5245f3] [^0b17dd16] [^b16fc0bd].

> Finally, I need to ensure I acknowledge uncertainties. Evidence for outcome benefit from correcting ionized calcium in trauma and critical illness remains largely observational and mixed, with a Cochrane review finding no trials linking parenteral calcium to hard outcomes in ICU patients; thus, while maintaining physiologic ionized calcium is rational in bleeding and coagulopathy, I should avoid normalization for its own sake and tailor therapy to symptoms, severity, and the underlying disease process [^f3341ab5] [^4fa82db6] [^fdf4b644].

Ionized calcium is the **physiologically active fraction** of serum calcium and should be measured directly in critical illness, trauma, massive transfusion, renal failure, and when total calcium and clinical status diverge [^4a5245f3] [^5b949a66]. In critical illness and trauma, **maintain ionized calcium ≥ 0.9 mmol/L** to support coagulation and hemodynamics, using calcium chloride 1 g IV for severe hypocalcemia and titrating to effect with frequent monitoring [^c97ef47a] [^9e5a77bf]. In renal failure, avoid hypercalcemia and use ionized calcium to guide therapy, as adjusted calcium is unreliable [^61ee5457] [^8330ecd7]. For hypercalcemia, treat only if symptomatic or severe, using IV fluids and bisphosphonates or denosumab; monitor ionized calcium to assess response [^f92ff096] [^e94e17a0]. Routine calcium supplementation is not recommended unless there is symptomatic or severe hypocalcemia, and all therapy should be individualized with close monitoring of ionized calcium and electrolytes [^4fa82db6] [^f3341ab5].

---

## Physiological significance of ionized calcium

Ionized calcium is the **biologically active fraction** responsible for neuromuscular excitability, cardiac conduction, and coagulation; it is tightly regulated by PTH, vitamin D, and calcitonin, and accounts for about 50% of total calcium, with the remainder protein-bound or complexed [^271d4177] [^6917125a].

---

## Indications for measuring ionized calcium

Ionized calcium should be measured directly in the following scenarios:

- **Critical illness**: Sepsis, trauma, massive transfusion, or ICU care where total calcium may not reflect ionized calcium [^4a5245f3] [^97f2d2f7].
- **Renal failure**: Adjusted calcium is unreliable; ionized calcium better guides therapy [^8330ecd7] [^700956f1].
- **Discrepancy**: Total calcium and clinical status do not align (e.g. symptomatic hypocalcemia with normal total calcium) [^4a5245f3] [^fbbd2f17].
- **Specific therapies**: Regional citrate anticoagulation for CRRT requires ionized calcium monitoring [^be5791f8] [^4d380f53].

---

## Clinical thresholds for ionized calcium management

| **Clinical scenario** | **Ionized calcium threshold** | **Management approach** |
|-|-|-|
| Critical illness/trauma | ≥ 0.9 mmol/L | - Correct if < 0.9 mmol/L <br/> - Use calcium chloride 1 g IV for severe cases <br/> - Titrate and monitor frequently [^c97ef47a] [^9e5a77bf] |
| Renal failure | Avoid > 1.3 mmol/L | - Use ionized calcium to guide therapy <br/> - Avoid calcium loading [^61ee5457] [^8330ecd7] |
| Hypercalcemia | > 1.5 mmol/L (severe) | - IV hydration <br/> - Bisphosphonates or denosumab <br/> - Monitor ionized calcium response [^f92ff096] [^1cdea510] |

---

## Management of hypocalcemia

### Acute management

- **Severe symptomatic hypocalcemia**: Calcium chloride 1 g IV over 10 minutes, repeat until symptoms resolve or ionized calcium is ≥ 0.9 mmol/L [^c97ef47a] [^9e5a77bf].
- **Less severe cases**: Calcium gluconate 1–2 g IV over 10 minutes, titrate to effect [^notfound].
- **Continuous infusion**: For refractory cases, use calcium gluconate infusion (e.g. 1–2 g/hour) with close monitoring [^notfound].

---

### Chronic management

Oral calcium (1–2 g/day) plus active vitamin D (calcitriol 0.25–0.5 mcg/day) is standard; **adjust to maintain ionized calcium in the low-normal range** and avoid hypercalcemia [^44ee550f].

---

## Management of hypercalcemia

### Acute management

- **Hydration**: Isotonic saline to restore volume and enhance calciuresis [^f92ff096] [^c6ded4aa].
- **Bisphosphonates**: Zoledronic acid 4–8 mg IV or denosumab for malignancy-associated hypercalcemia [^f92ff096] [^1cdea510].
- **Calcitonin**: Rapid, short-term lowering in severe cases [^f92ff096] [^19aa1dd6].
- **Dialysis**: For refractory cases or renal failure [^f92ff096] [^1cdea510].

---

### Chronic management

Treat the underlying cause (e.g. parathyroidectomy for PHPT, malignancy therapy) and **monitor ionized calcium** to guide ongoing care [^f92ff096] [^687d7cf2].

---

## Special considerations

- **Renal failure**: Ionized calcium is preferred; avoid hypercalcemia and adjust dialysate calcium as needed [^61ee5457] [^129e63e4].
- **CRRT with citrate**: Monitor systemic and post-filter ionized calcium; watch for citrate accumulation (total:ionized calcium ratio > 2.5) [^be5791f8] [^4d380f53].
- **Pediatrics**: Use age-specific ionized calcium ranges; treat symptomatic hypocalcemia promptly with IV calcium [^c418c535] [^ed931cf9].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include **frequent ionized calcium checks** during acute correction, then periodic monitoring to guide chronic therapy and detect recurrence. Also track magnesium, potassium, and phosphate because they interact with calcium homeostasis and therapy response [^0861575b] [^97f2d2f7].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **Measure ionized calcium**: In critical illness, trauma, renal failure, and when total calcium and clinical status diverge [^4a5245f3] [^5b949a66].
- **Maintain ionized calcium**: ≥ 0.9 mmol/L in critical illness and trauma [^c97ef47a] [^9e5a77bf].
- **Avoid hypercalcemia**: Especially in renal failure; use ionized calcium to guide therapy [^61ee5457] [^8330ecd7].
- **Treat symptomatic or severe hypocalcemia**: Use IV calcium chloride or gluconate, then transition to oral therapy [^c97ef47a] [^9e5a77bf].
- **Treat symptomatic or severe hypercalcemia**: Use hydration, bisphosphonates or denosumab, and monitor ionized calcium response [^f92ff096] [^1cdea510].

Ionized calcium management centers on **accurate measurement**, **context-specific thresholds**, and **targeted therapy** with close monitoring to balance benefits and risks.

### When is it appropriate to order an ionized calcium? [^5b949a66]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Convincing evidence demonstrates that ionized calcium and not total calcium is the physiologically relevant component of blood calcium. Direct measurement of ionized calcium, however, is limited by difficulties in accurate analysis, lack of standardization, and need for special handling, all resulting in increased cost; therefore, strategies have been developed to estimate ionized calcium from total calcium adjusted for levels of albumin, measurements that are more available and relatively inexpensive. This commentary compares the advantages and limitations of direct or calculated determinations of ionized calcium. Also examined are available data illustrating the settings in which measurement of ionized calcium is preferred and, in some cases, necessary for clinical decision-making.

### Use of albumin-adjusted calcium measurements in clinical practice [^4a5245f3]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

In light of these factors, we suggest that unadjusted calcium remains the best and most practical alternative to ionized calcium in most clinical settings. Clinicians should be thoughtful about ordering ionized calcium instead of total calcium. Ionized calcium should be considered to inform on acute management of hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia in hospitalized patients, especially in the critically ill. It should also be considered in patients with preexisting calcium disorders (eg, hypo- or hyperparathyroidism) when the total calcium does not reflect a patient's symptoms or clinical status. This is particularly important in the current health care climate, where there is emphasis on the reduction of unnecessary testing.

Ionized calcium: just counteracting citrated blood products?

Ionized calcium is critical for coagulation (Fig. 1). Rapid infusion of citrated blood products administered during MTPs acutely lower ionized calcium, inhibiting calcium-dependent coagulation factors. Guidelines suggest maintaining normocalcaemia during resuscitation. Of note, recalcification is required for most coagulation assays, a consideration that masks depletion and hypocalcaemia that may occur during resuscitation.

### Assessment and clinical course of hypocalcemia in critical illness [^97f2d2f7]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Hypocalcaemia is common in critical illness but tends to normalize during the early days of admission to intensive care.

- In most cases normalization of calcium status is not associated with improved outcome, however mortality may be higher in severely hypocalcaemic patients who remain hypocalcemic on the fourth day of their admission.

- Calcium supplementation does not improve either calcium normalization or survival and a large randomized controlled trial is required to assess the effectiveness and side effects of this intervention.

- Albumin-adjusted calcium is a poor predictor of low ionized calcium in critical illness and should not be used in this setting.

- Low magnesium, sodium and albumin are independently associated with low ionized calcium and this should be considered in the overall management of each patient.

### Ionized calcium in the ICU: should It Be measured and corrected? [^4fa82db6]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Serum ionized calcium (iCa) is often measured in patients admitted to ICUs, and at least half of these patients will have values outside the reference range during their ICU stay. The vast majority of these patients do not have an underlying disease of calcium homeostasis. This Contemporary Review discusses the rationale for measurement of iCa and whether available data support its measurement and correction. It is determined that while measurement of serum iCa is commonplace and attempted correction is popular, available evidence and logical analysis do not wholly support these practices. Abnormal values of iCa are likely a marker of disease severity in critical illness and most often normalize spontaneously with resolution of the primary disease process. Alternatively, low iCa levels in critical illness may be protective and attempted correction of low levels may be harmful. Dramatic curtailment of iCa measurement and calcium administration in several studies was not associated with worsening outcomes. The absence of high-quality data to guide practice allows for a spectrum of approaches to the measurement and treatment of iCa, but these approaches should be guided by basic principles of rational clinical decision-making. Widespread, protocolized measurement and administration with the simple goal of normalizing values in the name of "euboxia" should be discouraged.

### Use of albumin-adjusted calcium measurements in clinical practice [^0b17dd16]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How accurate are the calcium adjustment formulas that are used in clinical practice?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of 22 658 patients, adjusted calcium levels were modestly correlated with ionized calcium; these generally fared no better than unadjusted total calcium alone and had the tendency to systematically underestimate true hypocalcemia and overestimate true hypercalcemia.

Meaning

These results suggest that the unadjusted total calcium is the best and most practical alternative to ionized calcium in most clinical settings.

This review will discuss the importance and homeostasis of calcium and magnesium in the human body, as well as the implications and treatment of disordered calcium and magnesium. With calcium and magnesium often considered to be the "forgotten cations" in medicine, it is our hope that this review will lead providers to evaluate for and effectively manage these electrolyte disorders in the emergency department.

Conclusion

In the management of the trauma patients with massive hemorrhage, aggressive correction of iCas to maintain 0.95 mmol/L or higher within 24 hours of the admission is expected to improve their short-term outcomes.

### Albumin-corrected or ionized calcium in renal failure? What to measure? [^8330ecd7]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Secondary hyperparathyroidsm is frequently observed in patients with chronic renal failure, and clinical treatment guidelines have been published. Despite this, a large proportion of patients do not reach the target levels for calcium, phosphorus, calcium x phosphorus product, or intact parathyroid hormone. The use of albumin-corrected calcium is recommended as calcium measurement, but it is the concentration of ionized calcium that is biologically active. We hypothesized that in clinical practice, the use of ionized calcium rather than albumin-corrected calcium would influence the calcium classification of the individual patient.

Methods

Blood samples from 34 patients in chronic haemodialysis were analysed for evaluation of mineral metabolism according to K/DOQI guidelines. Blood for analysis of total and ionized calcium was drawn simultaneously. As ionized calcium is pH dependent, samples were analysed at the actual pH of the individual patient.

Results

For both methods, a similar number of patients were characterized as normocalcaemic. The use of albumin-corrected calcium caused one patient (3%) to be classified as hypocalcaemic, and 10 patients (26%) as hypercalcaemic whereas with ionized calcium, five (15%) and three patients (9%) were classified as hypo- and hypercalcaemic, respectively.

Conclusions

According to present guidelines, the difference in calcium classification of patients might have clinical implications for the prescription of vitamin D, and on the choice of phosphate binders.

### Use of albumin-adjusted calcium measurements in clinical practice [^271d4177]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Calcium is a tightly regulated mineral that is essential to intracellular signaling, bone mineralization, coagulation, and neuromuscular function. Disorders of calcium metabolism can be associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. As such, reliable calcium measurement, accurate classification of calcium status, and timely treatment of hypo- or hypercalcemia, when present, are important.

Approximately half of circulating calcium is bound to serum proteins, principally albumin, and the other half is ionized, but only the ionized fraction is biologically active. Even though ionized calcium is more physiologically relevant, total calcium is more commonly measured because of its greater accessibility and the lower costs for analysis. However, concern has been raised that reliance on total calcium alone may result in misclassification because changes in blood pH and serum protein concentrations can affect calcium-protein binding, and therefore alter the correlation between total calcium and ionized calcium.

For decades, adjustment of total calcium has been used clinically as an alternative to ionized calcium, with little empirical evidence to support the practice. Indeed, the original correction formula proposed by Payne and colleaguesin 1973 was derived from a single study of 200 patients using a historical laboratory method no longer available today, and never validated against ionized calcium. Furthermore, multiple studies have shown that albumin-adjusted calcium correlates poorly with ionized calcium, especially in patients who are critically ill, those with kidney failure on dialysis, and in geriatric populations. Addressing this, some investigators have attempted to derive new formulas that correlate better with ionized calcium, but with many still concluding that unadjusted total calcium correlates best with ionized calcium in most clinical settings. Although global evidence suggests that most adjustment formulas are not clinically reliable, it is unclear how commonly they are used in practice. Moreover, the generalizability of current evidence remains limited, as prior studies were largely limited to highly selected populations, such as hospitalized patients. Additionally, most of the laboratory data were collected from a single laboratory usually affiliated with a tertiary center.

Addressing this, we conducted a large population-based cross-sectional study to evaluate the correlation between total calcium (with or without adjustment) vs ionized calcium (as a reference standard), to examine the potential association with disease classification (where misdiagnosis could lead to inappropriate downstream investigations and/or treatments), and to describe general calcium ordering patterns in clinical practice.

### Assessment and clinical course of hypocalcemia in critical illness [^42f054b1]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

The assessment of calcium status on the intensive care unit (ICU) is also inconsistent. Approximately 50% of total circulating calcium is ionized, which is the biologically active form. Of the remainder, around 40% is bound to plasma proteins, particularly albumin, and a further 10% to anions such as phosphate, sulphate and citrate. As measurements of total calcium are traditionally more accessible than those of ionized calcium, formulas are used to correct the total calcium concentration for variations in albumin concentration in order to reflect ionized calcium concentrations. However, several factors can alter the proportion of total calcium that is ionized and studies have shown that adjusted calcium formulae do not provide a reliable substitute for ionized calcium in various groups of critically ill patients. Despite this, adjusted calcium continues to be used in many ICUs to guide clinical practice.

Other biochemical abnormalities are also common in critically ill patients, with derangements of sodium, potassium, magnesium, phosphate, lactate and albumin frequently seen. Magnesium and phosphate concentrations are known to affect calcium homeostasis, however there has been little study of the interaction of these abnormalities in the context of hypocalcemia and greater understanding could improve the therapeutic approach to hypocalcemic patients.

We retrospectively reviewed data from 1,038 admissions to an ICU in which calcium supplementation is routinely given, in this case guided by the patients' adjusted calcium level. The primary objectives were to establish the clinical course of hypocalcemia early in admission and the relationship of this to outcome, and to assess the impact of calcium supplementation on normalization of calcium concentration and outcome. In addition, we determined the suitability of using adjusted calcium levels in place of ionized calcium to guide clinical practice and examined the association of various biochemical derangements with hypocalcemia.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^687d7cf2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), the most common cause of hypercalcemia, is most often identified in postmenopausal women. The clinical presentation of PHPT has evolved over the past 40 years to include three distinct clinical phenotypes, each of which has been studied in detail and has led to evolving concepts about target organ involvement, natural history, and management.

Methods

In the present review, I provide an evidence-based summary of this disorder as it has been studied worldwide, citing key concepts and data that have helped to shape our concepts about this disease.

Results

PHPT is now recognized to include three clinical phenotypes: overt target organ involvement, mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia, and high PTH levels with persistently normal albumin-corrected and ionized serum calcium values. The factors that determine which of these clinical presentations is more likely to predominate in a given country include the extent to which biochemical screening is used, vitamin D deficiency is present, and whether parathyroid hormone levels are routinely measured in the evaluation of low bone density or frank osteoporosis. Guidelines for parathyroidectomy apply to all three clinical forms of the disease. If surgical guidelines are not met, parathyroidectomy can also be an appropriate option if no medical contraindications are present. If either the serum calcium or bone mineral density is of concern and surgery is not an option, pharmacological approaches are available and effective.

Conclusions

Advances in our knowledge of PHPT have guided new concepts in diagnosis and management.

### Is the calcium correct? Measuring serum calcium in dialysis patients [^c1d4c5b2]. Seminars in Dialysis (2010). Low credibility.

Abnormalities in calcium concentration are frequent in patients receiving dialysis therapy. Most cases of both hypo- and hypercalcemia are mild and asymptomatic. There is concern, however, that, on the one hand, hypocalcemia can drive hyperparathyroidism and eventually lead to gland hypertrophy and autonomous function. Hypercalcemia, on the other hand, can be associated with increased extraosseous calcium and phosphate deposition leading to vascular calcification with an attendant mortality and morbidity. Calcium exists in three main forms in the blood: the physiologically active free or ionized fraction (terms often used interchangeably), a protein bound fraction, and a fraction complexed to other anions. Although the ionized calcium can readily be measured using ion-specific electrodes, it is the total calcium that is most commonly measured because of sample handling and cost concerns. As it is the free or ionized form that is biologically active (and therefore of most relevance), a number of adjustment formulae have been derived to "correct" the total calcium for changes in albumin, protein, and complexing ion concentrations. These formulae show good statistical correlation with measured ionized calcium in populations studied as a whole, but are generally poor predictors of true ionized hypo- or hypercalcemia in individual patients. International guideline committees in nephrology recommend frequent assessment of calcium levels in dialysis patients and recommend that these levels be kept within the normal reference range. These guidelines are less clear on which measurement of calcium should be used to guide clinical decision making. This review examines the merits of making any adjustment to the total calcium measurement, and suggests when it is appropriate to measure the ionized or free calcium.

### Assessment and clinical course of hypocalcemia in critical illness [^a93bd5c0]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Our study is set apart from others in that many participants received intravenous calcium supplementation as part of a standard protocol. This was guided by adjusted rather than ionized calcium, allowing analysis of whether this practice affected the normalization of ionized calcium concentration and outcome. We found that the pattern of change over time and the proportion of hypocalcemic patients with a normal ionized calcium concentration by day 4 were not different between those who did and did not receive calcium supplementation. Our results suggest that calcium supplementation does not lead to a greater sustained increase in ionized calcium than occurs without supplementation. This is in keeping with previous reports suggesting that calcium supplementation does not increase ionized calcium concentrations in critical illness and that calcium concentrations cannot be corrected by calcium therapy alone. However, it needs to be taken into consideration that our study was retrospective and observational and hence lacks controlled intervention.

Normally, ionized calcium concentrations are tightly regulated and hypocalcemia can have profound adverse clinical effects. Furthermore, intravenous calcium has an important role in hemodynamic support. Interestingly, however, it has been shown that in sepsis and during treatment with catecholamines calcium is shifted into the cells, which may contribute to the hypocalcemia seen in the critically ill. Raised intracellular calcium concentrations have in turn been linked to the pathophysiology of sepsis. Giving additional parenteral calcium could therefore cause harm, a concept which is supported by experimental models of sepsis in which calcium administration was associated with higher mortality. In keeping with this, it has frequently been suggested that hypocalcemia is a marker of disease severity, rather than a contributor in itself, indicating therapy is unwarranted.

Despite this, the role of calcium replacement in hypocalcemic patients remains unclear and requires further study. The results of this investigation are limited as the study design was retrospective and purely observational, no controlled intervention was performed and not all confounders could be eliminated. In particular, some patients may have received calcium supplementation prior to admission to intensive care and the route of nutrition (enteral vs. parenteral) was not included in the analysis. Finally, although the overall sample size was large, the rarity of severe hypocalcemia renders the study underpowered to make conclusions in this subgroup.

Regarding medical management for traumatic hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to management of hypocalcemia, ABC-T 2023 guidelines recommend to monitor and maintain ionized calcium levels within the normal range following major trauma and especially during massive transfusion.

### Ionised hypocalcaemia in emergency and acute medicine [^fbbd2f17]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Acute hypocalcaemia can be life-threatening and must be diagnosed promptly. The gold-standard investigation is ionised calcium, which is measured on most blood gas analysers. Total calcium measurements are inaccurate in severe depletion even if 'corrected' or 'adjusted' for albumin. We present an illustrative case of a woman in her 30s with symptomatic hypocalcaemia and a very low ionised calcium on VBG analysis. Emergency calcium replacement was delayed due to a falsely reassuring corrected calcium result. Our discussion includes a systematic literature review on the use of ionised calcium in emergency and acute medical settings. We suggest cognitive biases that may explain clinical over-reliance on corrected calcium, and call for the inclusion of ionised calcium values in major treatment guidelines for acute hypocalcaemia.

### Ionized calcium concentration and outcome in critical illness [^2cb6a8d9]. Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the association of abnormalities of ionized calcium levels with mortality in a heterogeneous cohort of critically ill patients.

Design

Retrospective, combined clinical and biochemical study.

Setting

Four combined medical/surgical intensive care units.

Patients

Cohort of 7,024 adult critically ill patients.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

We studied 177,578 ionized calcium measurements, from 7024 patients, with a mean value of 1.11 mmol/L (ionized calcium measured every 4.5 hrs on average). The unadjusted lowest and highest ionized calcium reported during intensive care unit stay were significantly different between intensive care unit survivors and nonsurvivors (p < .001). If hypocalcemia occurred at least once during the intensive care unit stay, the probability of intensive care unit mortality increased by 46%, 108%, and 150% for ionized calcium levels < 1.15, 0.90, and 0.80 mmol/L, respectively. If hypercalcemia occurred at least once during the intensive care unit stay, the probability of intensive care unit mortality increased by 100%, 162%, and 190% for ionized calcium levels > 1.25, 1.35, and 1.45 mmol/L, respectively. Similar trends were seen for hospital mortality. However, from multivariate logistic regression analysis, only an ionized calcium < 0.8 mmol/L or an ionized calcium > 1.4 mmol/L were independently associated with intensive care unit and hospital mortality.

Conclusions

Within a broad range of values, ionized calcium concentration has no independent association with hospital or intensive care unit mortality. Only extreme abnormalities of ionized calcium concentrations are independent predictors of mortality.

### Factors affecting the relationship between ionized and corrected calcium levels in peritoneal dialysis patients: a retrospective cross-sectional study [^269f6776]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular diseases are a major cause of death in dialysis patients, and chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is an important risk factor of dialysis. It has been reported that the management of CKD-MBD is crucial not only for dialysis patients but also for non-dialysis patients. Therefore, the diagnosis and treatment guidelines of CKD-MBD were created with inputs from several countries and regions, including Japan, to establish the recommended levels of calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), and parathyroid hormone (PTH) with the goal of the appropriate management of CKD-MBD.

Ionized Ca (iCa) is the biologically active form of Ca in the blood. However, considering its inconvenience and resultant high cost, there are few studies that have measured serum iCa levels in clinical settings. Therefore, many guidelines do not list the recommended levels of iCa, but list those of target total serum Ca or corrected Ca (cCa) levels accounting for total serum Ca and serum albumin (Alb) levels. Approximately 50% of serum Ca is present in the form of iCa, approximately 45% of which binds to proteins such as Alb, while the remaining 5% binds to acid to exist as Ca salts. Because blood iCa competes with hydrogen ions as it binds to Alb, it can be influenced by the acid–base equilibrium. During acidemia, in which the hydrogen ion concentration is increased, the quantity of iCa that binds to Alb decreases, resulting in higher blood iCa levels, while a lower iCa level is observed during alkalemia.

### Use of albumin-adjusted calcium measurements in clinical practice [^d68d1272]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Correlation Between Total Calcium, Adjusted Calcium, and Ionized Calcium

We examined 10 adjustment formulas (eTable 2 in Supplement 1) that have been proposed for clinical practice, including the commonly used simplified Payne formula: adjusted calcium (mmol/L) = total calcium (mmol/L) + 0.02 [40 − albumin (g/L)]. Formulas were converted, if necessary, to SI units for standardization. All of the formulas that were examined were originally developed to adjust for total calcium (ie, by accounting for differences in protein binding), except for those developed by Pekarand Antonio, which were designed to directly estimate ionized calcium. To assess the association with albumin status, we performed a subanalysis in patients with low serum albumin (< 30 g/L) vs normal serum albumin (30–50 g/L). We conducted a Bland-Altman analysis and applied a linear transformation to standardize total calcium and ionized calcium onto the same scale (using a scaling factor [m] of [2.60 − 2.10]/[1.35 − 1.15] = 2.5 and an offset [b] of 2.10 − [2.5 × 1.15] = −0.775).

Frequency of Laboratory Measurements

To assess physician ordering patterns, we determined the frequency that serum calcium, ionized calcium, and serum albumin were measured simultaneously (collected at the same date and time). We described variations in these ordering patterns based on individual-level (eg, age, sex, and kidney function) and system-level characteristics (eg, clinical setting) over time.

### Effect of ionized calcium level on short-term prognosis in severe multiple trauma patients: a clinical study [^0095584d]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In the acute management of patients with traumatic hemorrhagic shock, it is important to achieve early and reliable hemostasis and limit blood loss while avoiding the triad of traumatic death: hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulopathy. In recent years, in addition to the triad of traumatic death, hypocalcemia has gained attention as a fourth factor that interacts with this triad to increase the risk of mortality. Initial blood ionized calcium concentration at admission (iCa_ini) is reportedly associated with prehospital hypotension, need for blood transfusion, and even mortality.

However, the relationship between temporal variations in blood ionized calcium concentration (iCa) after hospitalization and prognosis remains unclear. In this study, we also focused on the minimum blood ionized calcium concentration within 24 hours of admission (iCa_min) as a parameter reflecting temporal variations in iCa and examined the relationship between iCa_min and prognosis in patients treated with a massive transfusion protocol (MTP). The objective of this study was to clarify the relationship between temporal variations of iCa and 28-day mortality in patients with traumatic hemorrhagic shock receiving an MTP. We also aimed to determine the optimal cut-off value of iCa_min for predicting 28-day mortality and to define a target iCa as an index for correcting hypocalcemia in the acute management of patients with traumatic hemorrhagic shock.

### Calcium in major trauma: in search of the holy grail? [^fdf4b644]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

In their meta-analysis, Palitnonkiat et al confirm that hypocalcemia is associated with increased mortality in major trauma.

This finding raises the question: could calcium supplementation be the Holy Grail, a low-risk and low-cost intervention to improve survival? Yet, before embarking on this quest, we must carefully reflect on what this finding truly means.

A common pitfall in research is to mistake correlation for causation. From a distance, they can appear similar; up close, they may be very different. While this systematic review found a correlation between hypocalcemia and mortality, it remains unclear whether it is a causal factor or only a marker to predict it.

In critical care, the normalization heuristic, a tendency to normalize every laboratory value, can be seductive. However, striving for euboxia may be misleading, particularly when based on single measurements without accounting for dynamic physiological processes. No strong evidence has been found yet to support the benefit of calcium supplementation in trauma. Moreover, in critical illness, mild hypocalcemia may actually protect cells from calcium overload and mitochondrial death.

Our understanding of ionized calcium kinetics during trauma remains incomplete. Without clarity on the underlying mechanisms, the risk of overcorrection and consequent hypercalcemia, also associated with poor outcomes, cannot be ignored. The relationship between ionized calcium and outcome is indeed parabolic, not linear.

Moreover, before considering intervention trials, we need a clearer path: agreement on precise definitions of hypocalcemia and normocalcemia, identification of appropriate patient subgroups, and determination of clinically meaningful endpoints. A one-size-fits-all strategy is unlikely to be successful in a condition as heterogeneous as trauma.

This meta-analysis is an important signpost in our search for the Holy Grail. The real challenge lies ahead: seeking the right direction by deepening our understanding of calcium physiology before attempting to correct it. Let's not forget to treat the patient, not just the numbers.

The 2009 recommendation suggested maintaining serum calcium in the normal range for CKD G3a–G5D (2D), and the rationale indicates that mild and asymptomatic hypocalcemia, for example with calcimimetic treatment, can be tolerated to avoid inappropriate calcium loading in adults.

### Rapid fire: hypercalcemia [^d1247de0]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is commonly encountered in the clinical setting and requires identification by the clinician to avoid disastrous patient outcomes. The 2 most common causes are malignancy and hyperparathyroidism. The underlying cause for hypercalcemia may be readily known at presentation or may require further investigation. After identification, acuity of treatment will depend on severity of calcium level and symptoms. In the emergency setting, intravenous hydration with isotonic fluids is the treatment mainstay. Other commonly used medications to further decrease calcium include bisphosphates, calcitonin, steroids, and (rarely) furosemide. In life-threatening circumstances, dialysis can be implemented.

### Assessment and clinical course of hypocalcemia in critical illness [^03297cf0]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Change in ionized calcium level over the first 4 days of admission

To study how ionized calcium concentration changed over the first 4 days of admission to ICU, the mean of iCa measurements taken on admission and at 06:00 on days 2, 3, and four were plotted (Figure 2). By the fourth day of their stay the mean level for patients with severe and mild hypocalcemia on admission had normalized (Figure 2A). Of those severely hypocalcemic on admission, 24 (53%) had an iCa < 1.1 mmol/L on day 4, compared to 121 (35.2%) of those mildly hypocalcemic and 64 (21.9%) of those normocalcemic (P = 0.001, Table 2). There was no difference in the influence of time on iCa concentration over the first 4 days between those who survived and those who died. Also, no difference was found between patients with and without sepsis, as confirmed by repeated measures ANOVA (P = 0.35 and P = 0.1 respectively; Figure 2B and 2C).

### Use of albumin-adjusted calcium measurements in clinical practice [^3fba21f7]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date assessing the epidemiology of calcium measurements and its correlation with ionized calcium as the reference standard. We also assessed laboratory ordering patterns, rarely reported in previous studies. Our data are based on a large population with comprehensive capture of all clinical encounters using high-quality linked health administrative and laboratory databases. All laboratory measurements were performed as part of routine clinical care, reducing the risk of selection bias. In comparison to previous studies, which have mostly been conducted at a single tertiary institution with a centralized laboratory, the present study included multiple sites (inpatient and outpatient, urban and rural, academic and community) with variety of laboratory platforms, which increases the generalizability of the findings.

Despite these strengths, our study was also subject to limitations. First, missing data could have affected our results. However, only 4000 records from approximately 7.7 million total calcium tests (0.05%) were excluded due to missing results. As such, the overall effect of missing data on our final conclusions is likely negligible. Second, the laboratory measurements were not performed in a centralized laboratory according to stringent research standards, but rather as part of routine clinical care across multiple platforms. Consequently, total calcium, ionized calcium, albumin, pH, and creatinine were measured using a variety of possible instruments and techniques. Even so, our pragmatic analysis can be construed as a strength because it provides data that reflect practice patterns not otherwise captured by highly selective single-center studies. With regard to measurement error, all tests were conducted using calibrated instruments meeting laboratory clinical standards. Third, we did not examine subgroups according to the presence of acid-base status, age, or kidney function because our overarching goal was to assess a large population with results that would be applicable in most clinical settings. However, numerous previous studies have already consistently shown a poor correlation between adjusted-calcium and ionized calcium in these settings. Additionally, we were not able to prove the intent of the clinicians who ordered the tests. We inferred that concurrent total calcium and serum albumin were likely used to calculate an albumin-adjusted calcium, but we acknowledge that there may have been other reasons that a serum albumin could have been requested. However, clinical indications for measuring serum albumin are few, so it is implausible that many of these albumin measurements were ordered for a different purpose.

### Complications of regional citrate anticoagulation: accumulation or overload? [^6f7a73f7]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Net citrate overload

Net citrate overload is a common, benign, and easy to manage complication of RCA. Citrate overload is a situation in which the organism's capacity to metabolize citrate is not reached and all citrate–calcium complexes are metabolized (Fig. 4). The concomitant net load of sodium ions leads to plasma alkalinization through an increased SID. No increase in total/ionized calcium is observed and ionized calcium levels remain normal. Net citrate overload is a sign of excessive citrate administration or, more frequently, of low clearance in the hemofilter.

Insufficient trisodium-citrate delivery

Insufficient trisodium-citrate delivery is a situation where the alkalotic load administered to the patient is insufficient to adequately buffer acute kidney injury-associated acidosis, resulting in residual metabolic acidosis. This may happen if blood flow is set too low proportional to dialysate flow.

In this situation, the observed metabolic acidosis should not be interpreted as resulting from citrate accumulation. On the contrary, the adequate response should be to increase the blood flow or to decrease the dialysate flow. Key elements here are the normal total/ionized calcium ratio and calcium substitution rate.

Situations at risk of citrate accumulation or net overload

Some situations lead to increased citrate delivery or decreased metabolizing capacity. According to the extent of this process, and the patient's ability to metabolize CCC, it might lead to citrate accumulation or net overload (Fig. 4).

Bleeding resuscitation and transfusion thresholds — initial measures and targets: Aggressive volume resuscitation using intravenous isotonic crystalloids such as 0.9% NaCl or Ringer's lactate is recommended, and patients with symptomatic anemia or active bleeding should receive RBC transfusions to maintain a hemoglobin ≥ 7 g/dL; in underlying coronary artery disease, particularly acute coronary syndromes, guidelines recommend a target hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL. Platelets should be transfused to maintain a platelet count ≥ 50 × 10⁹/L and cryoprecipitate to maintain a fibrinogen > 100 mg/dL. For patients requiring ≥ 3 units of packed RBCs within 1 hour, activation of a massive transfusion protocol should be considered; protocols vary and many centers use goal-directed transfusion with TEG or ROTEM. Ionized calcium levels should be monitored; if abnormal, administration of calcium is indicated. Early administration of tranexamic acid for trauma patients within the first 3 hours is associated with decreased bleeding and overall mortality and should be considered, and the writing committee recommends further resuscitation using a goal-directed strategy guided by laboratory results.

### Parenteral calcium for intensive care unit patients [^f3341ab5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Hypocalcemia is prevalent among critically ill patients requiring intensive care. Several epidemiological studies highlight a direct association between hypocalcemia and mortality. These data provide the impetus for current guidelines recommending parenteral calcium administration to normalize serum calcium. However, in light of the considerable variation in the threshold for calcium replacement, the lack of evidence to support a causal role of hypocalcemia in mortality, and animal studies illustrating that calcium supplementation may worsen outcomes, a systematic review is essential to evaluate whether or not the practice of calcium supplementation for intensive care unit (ICU) patients provides any benefit.

Objectives

To assess the effects of parenteral calcium administration in ICU patients on the following outcomes: mortality, multiple organ dysfunction, ICU and hospital length of stay, costs, serum ionized calcium concentration, and complications of parenteral calcium administration.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Controlled Trials, and the National Research Register. We hand-searched conference abstracts from the Society of Critical Care Medicine, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the American Thoracic Surgery, the American College of Surgeons, the American College of Chest Physicians, the American College of Physicians, and the International Consensus Conference in Intensive Care Medicine. We checked references of publications and attempted to contact authors to identify additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled and controlled clinical trials of ICU patients comparing parenteral calcium chloride or calcium gluconate administration with no treatment or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently applied eligibility criteria to trial reports for inclusion and extracted data.

Main Results

There are no identifiable studies that have evaluated the association between parenteral calcium supplementation in critically ill ICU patients and the following outcomes: mortality, multiple organ dysfunction, ICU and hospital length of stay, costs, and complications of calcium administration. Serum ionized calcium concentration was reported in 5 studies (12 trial arms, 159 participants). These trials showed a small but significant increase in serum ionized calcium concentration after calcium administration. These trials showed considerable statistical heterogeneity and differed extensively in the population studied (adult versus neonate), the indication (hypocalcemia versus prophylaxis) and threshold of hypocalcemia for which parenteral calcium was administered, and the timing of subsequent measurement of serum ionized calcium concentration to the extent that we consider a pooled estimate almost inappropriate.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no clear evidence that parenteral calcium supplementation impacts the outcome of critically ill patients.

### Forgot calcium? Admission ionized-calcium in two civilian randomized controlled trials of prehospital plasma for traumatic hemorrhagic shock [^15a19274]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) support the use of prehospital plasma in traumatic hemorrhagic shock, especially in long transports. The citrate added to plasma binds with calcium, yet most prehospital trauma protocols have no guidelines for calcium replacement. We reviewed the experience of two recent prehospital plasma RCTs regarding admission ionized-calcium (i-Ca) blood levels and its impact on survival. We hypothesized that prehospital plasma is associated with hypocalcemia, which in turn is associated with lower survival.

Methods

We studied patients enrolled in two institutions participating in prehospital plasma RCTs (control, standard of care; experimental, plasma), with i-Ca collected before calcium supplementation. Adults with traumatic hemorrhagic shock (systolic blood pressure ≤ 70 mm Hg or 71–90 mm Hg + heart rate ≥ 108 bpm) were eligible. We use generalized linear mixed models with random intercepts and Cox proportional hazards models with robust standard errors to account for clustered data by institution. Hypocalcemia was defined as i-Ca of 1.0 mmol/L or less.

Results

Of 160 subjects (76% men), 48% received prehospital plasma (median age, 40 years [interquartile range, 28–53 years]) and 71% suffered blunt trauma (median Injury Severity Score [ISS], 22 [interquartile range, 17–34]). Prehospital plasma and control patients were similar regarding age, sex, ISS, blunt mechanism, and brain injury. Prehospital plasma recipients had significantly higher rates of hypocalcemia compared with controls (53% vs. 36%; adjusted relative risk, 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03–2.12; p = 0.03). Severe hypocalcemia was significantly associated with decreased survival (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.02–1.13; p = 0.01) and massive transfusion (adjusted relative risk, 2.70; 95% CI, 1.13–6.46; p = 0.03), after adjustment for confounders (randomization group, age, ISS, and shock index).

Conclusion

Prehospital plasma in civilian trauma is associated with hypocalcemia, which in turn predicts lower survival and massive transfusion. These data underscore the need for explicit calcium supplementation guidelines in prehospital hemotherapy.

### Effect of ionized calcium level on short-term prognosis in severe multiple trauma patients: a clinical study [^a3b2a515]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypocalcemia has been reported as an independent predictor of trauma mortality. We investigated the relationship between temporal variations in blood ionized calcium concentration (iCa) and prognosis in severe trauma patients who underwent massive transfusion protocol (MTP).

Methods

This single-center, retrospective, observational study investigated 117 severe trauma patients treated with MTP in the Department of Emergency Medicine and Critical Care, Saitama Medical Center, Saitama Medical University, between March 2013 and March 2019. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed, assigning pH-corrected initial and minimum blood ionized calcium concentration within 24 hours of admission (iCa_min), age, initial systolic blood pressure and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, and incidence of Ca supplementation as independent variables and 28-day mortality as dependent variable.

Results

The logistic regression analysis identified iCa_min (adjusted OR 0.03, 95% CI 0.002 to 0.4), age (adjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09), and GCS score (adjusted OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.94) as significant independent predictors of 28-day mortality. The receiver operating characteristic analysis identified optimal cut-off value of iCa_min for predicting 28-day mortality as 0.95 mmoL/L (area under the curve 0.74).

Conclusion

In the management of patients with traumatic hemorrhagic shock, aggressive correction of the iCa to maintain 0.95 mmol/L or higher within 24 hours of admission may improve short-term outcomes.

### Use of albumin-adjusted calcium measurements in clinical practice [^b16fc0bd]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cross-sectional study, we found that total calcium and serum albumin were commonly ordered together. In a population of 4.3 million people over approximately 7 years, there were more than 7 million measurements of total calcium, with approximately 4 million paired with serum albumin, suggesting a heavy reliance on albumin-adjusted calcium. Of concern, albumin-adjusted calcium only correlated modestly with ionized calcium and generally fared no better than (unadjusted) total calcium alone, but rather had the tendency to systematically underestimate true hypocalcemia, particularly in the presence of low serum albumin (ie, a scenario where adjustment formulas are likely to be relied on the most but paradoxically where they are least reliable). Therefore, the additional cost and inconvenience of manually calculating an albumin-adjusted calcium are difficult to justify, especially given the excess risk of misclassifying calcium status, which can lead to incorrect downstream treatment decisions. Instead, our findings suggested that total calcium alone was the best available alternative to directly measuring ionized calcium, against common practice.

Graves' disease postoperative calcium management — strategies and risk assessment (Recommendation 29) states that following thyroidectomy for GD, alternative strategies may be undertaken for management of calcium levels, with a weak recommendation, low-quality evidence: serum calcium with or without intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels can be measured and supplementation given based on results, or prophylactic calcium with or without calcitriol prescribed empirically. Low iPTH levels (< 10–15 pg/mL) in the immediate postoperative setting appear to predict symptomatic hypocalcemia and need for supplementation. Patients can be discharged if asymptomatic and their serum calcium levels corrected for albumin are 8.0 mg/ dL (2.0 mmol/L) or above and are not falling over a 24-hour period. Persistent hypocalcemia may warrant measurement of serum magnesium and possible repletion; following discharge, serum iPTH should be measured in persistent hypocalcemia to determine if permanent hypoparathyroidism is present or whether "bone hunger" is ongoing. In patients with severe hypocalcemia, teriparatide has yielded encouraging preliminary results, but more data are needed before it can be considered for clinical practice; intravenous calcium gluconate should be readily available and may be administered if symptoms worsen despite oral therapy.

### Electrolyte disorders related emergencies in children [^c418c535]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Calcium

Calcium (Ca) is the most prevalent mineral in the body, playing crucial roles in various processes that rely on intracellular calcium concentration. These include enzymatic reactions, the contraction of muscles, cardiac function, aggregation of platelets, and receptor activation. The normal serum calcium levels vary with age and are depicted in Table 8. Calcium is crucial for processes such as neuromuscular junction and bone strength. Most of the total calcium (99%) is in the bone tissue and the remaining less than 1% is in the extracellular fluid (ECF). Half of the ECF calcium is bound to albumin and the other half exists in its ionized, biologically active form. The regulation of calcium concentration is managed through vitamin D and PTH. A decrease in plasma calcium levels stimulates PTH secretion from the parathyroid glands, leading to increased bone resorption and subsequent release of calcium into the bloodstream. PTH additionally enhances calcium reabsorption in the kidneys by facilitating the production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. This active form of vitamin D enhances calcium and phosphate intestinal absorption and decreases renal excretion of these ions. Notably, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D also inhibits PTH synthesis. Calcitonin counteracts the action of vitamin D and PTH by inhibiting bone resorption and increasing renal calcium excretion, thus resulting in a reduction of calcium plasma levels. On the other hand, hypercalcemia causes decreased PTH secretion and inhibition of calcium release from bone tissue. Additionally, the total serum calcium level is directly linked to serum albumin concentration, with every 1 g/dL increase in serum albumin associated with a rise of 0.25 mmol/L in total serum calcium. Conversely, with a decrease of 1 g/dL in serum albumin the total serum calcium will decrease by about 0.25 mmol/L. While total serum albumin is directly correlated to total serum calcium, there is an inverse relationship between ionized calcium and serum albumin. Clinically, a formula for adjusting total calcium for albumin is used: Adjusted Ca (mmol/L) = total Ca (mmol/L) + ({40 — albumin (g/L)} × 0.02).

### Hypocalcemia in trauma patients: a systematic review [^58996ff5]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Therapy

Replacement of blood loss is a cornerstone of management in trauma patients. The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following traumarecommends ionized calcium levels be monitored and maintained within the normal range during massive transfusion with appropriate administration of calcium chloride to correct hypocalcemia. The prevalence of hypocalcemia in up to 97% of trauma patients within 24 hours of massive transfusionsfurther highlights the importance of treating this aberrancy to ameliorate outcomes such as mortality, blood transfusion requirements, and coagulopathy.

While none of the studies included in this review studied the potential therapeutic benefit of timely correction of hypocalcemia in trauma patients, there is some evidence to suggest benefit in correction of hypocalcemia. In a retrospective review of 297 military combat trauma patients who received an average of 4 U of blood products before hospital admission, hypocalcemia was present in 28.3% of the cohort treated with 10 mL 10% intravenous calcium chloride, while hypocalcemia was evident in 70.0% of the nontreatment group. In shocked patients requiring colloids, calcium-containing haemaccel infusions have been reliably found to increase ionized calcium concentrations.

Although in the context of transfusion, Giancarelli et al.identified a threshold of 0.9 mmol/L to commence calcium therapy in the form of 2 g of calcium chloride for every 2 to 4 U of blood products transfused given that even 1 U of blood can cause hypocalcemia in trauma patients. Dickerson et al.suggested a short-term infusion of 4 g of intravenous calcium gluconate for the treatment of moderate to severe hypocalcemia in critically ill, adult multiple injury patients. Correction of hypocalcemia in certain subsets of this patient population yields an improvement in left ventricular function and mean arterial pressure.

A critical determinant of RCA success is precise ionized calcium (iCa²⁺) regulation, typically targeting pre-hemofilter levels < 0.4 mmol/L through citrate infusion rates titrated to blood flow rate (BFR). However, direct translation of CRRT-derived protocols to IHD is problematic: while lower BFRs may enhance anticoagulation efficacy by reduced citrate loss achieving target iCa²⁺ levels, they risk compromising small solute clearance due to IHD's shorter treatment duration. Dialysate calcium concentration further modulates this balance - calcium-free regimens sustain circuit hypocalcemia for robust anticoagulation but increase systemic hypocalcemia risk, whereas calcium-containing dialysate simplifies clinical management and improves safety profiles despite potential citrate underdosing. To mitigate citrate loss across the hemofilter, some protocols incorporate post-hemofilter citrate supplementation. However, this approach necessitates advanced technical expertise for real-time iCa²⁺ monitoring, specialized dialysate preparation, and frequent blood gas analysis for iCa²⁺ monitoring, substantially increasing nursing workload and healthcare costs. These challenges are also compounded by the dynamic coagulation profiles of critically ill patients: Systemic inflammation may simultaneously drive platelet activation, fibrinogen production, and endothelial dysfunction, creating a paradoxical state of hypercoagulability despite thrombocytopenia. Consequently, comprehensive coagulation assessment - integrating traditional parameters (e.g. platelet count, fibrinogen) and viscoelastic testing (e.g. thromboelastography) - is essential for protocol personalization.

Traditional heparin-free protocols demonstrate unacceptably high rates of circuit thrombosis in critically ill populations with dual bleeding and hypercoagulation risks, however it is logistically simpler and easy to operate, as well as applicable for patients with extremely increased bleeding risk such as severe thrombocytopenia.

Therefore, in this retrospective case-control study, we directly compared a modified RCA protocol using calcium-containing dialysate against standard heparin-free regimens in critically ill patients requiring IHD or hemodiafiltration in the real-world. Beyond evaluating circuit longevity, dialysis adequacy (Kt/V, urea reduction ratio), and ultrafiltration efficiency, we stratified patients by coagulation profiles (platelet count, hemoglobin, thromboelastography) and clinical risk factors to identify subgroups most likely to benefit from RCA versus heparin-free strategies. Our dual objectives were to (1) validate RCA's safety and efficacy relative to conventional anticoagulation avoidance, and (2) establish practical criteria for protocol selection based on individualized bleeding/clotting risk assessments.

### Effect of ionized calcium level on short-term prognosis in severe multiple trauma patients: a clinical study [^61b64f8b]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

The second limitation stems from the relatively long patient enrollment period of 6 years. Although the criteria for triggering MTP have not been revised during the period, indications for operation and IVR may have changed, and the techniques and outcomes of these interventions may have improved. However, the impact of such changes and improvements on 28-day mortality was not considered in the present study and warrants further investigation.

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism — monitoring and timing after thyroidectomy requires anticipating the delayed calcium nadir and structured labs, as the nadir may occur 24–72 hours after thyroidectomy; postoperative measurement of absolute values and trends of total or ionized calcium blood levels are the mainstays of clinical monitoring, and at least one perioperative serum albumin level should be measured to allow calculation of corrected calcium; the cost of measuring ionized calcium level can be significantly higher than measuring serum calcium.

### Investigation and management of hypocalcaemia [^0edf4531]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypocalcaemia is a common clinical scenario in children with a range of aetiological causes. It will often present with common symptoms but may occasionally be identified in an asymptomatic child. An understanding of the physiological regulation of plasma calcium is important in understanding the potential cause of hypocalcaemia and its appropriate management. The age of presentation will influence the likely differential diagnosis. We have presented a stepwise approach to the investigation of hypocalcaemia dependent on the circulating serum parathyroid hormone level at the time of presentation. The acute and long-term management of the underlying condition is also reviewed.

### Factors affecting the relationship between ionized and corrected calcium levels in peritoneal dialysis patients: a retrospective cross-sectional study [^e00c6f84]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) management in patients with end-stage renal disease is important owing to the risk of cardiovascular diseases. In clinical practice, we manage patients not by monitoring the levels of biologically active ionized calcium (iCa) but by monitoring total serum calcium or corrected calcium (cCa). We previously reported that iCa/cCa ratio was different between patients with hemodialysis and those with peritoneal dialysis (PD). In PD patients, several factors are expected to affect iCa/cCa ratio. Therefore, modifying the strategy to achieve better CKD-MBD management might be necessary; however, no reports have studied this to date. Therefore, we investigated the factors influencing iCa/cCa ratio in PD patients.

Methods

This retrospective cross-sectional study examined background and laboratory data, including iCa, collected at routine outpatient visits. The patients were divided into the first, second, and third tertile of iCa/cCa ratio groups to compare patient background and laboratory data. Multiple regression analysis was used to investigate the factors influencing iCa/cCa ratio. We used multiple imputation to deal with missing covariate data.

Results

In total, 169 PD patients were enrolled. In PD patients with lower iCa/cCa ratio, PD duration was longer and pH was higher. Urine volume and weekly renal Kt/V were lower in the patients with lower iCa/cCa ratio than in those with higher iCa/cCa ratio. iCa/cCa ratio and weekly renal Kt/V were directly correlated (r = 0.41, p < 0.01), and weekly renal Kt/V and pH were independent factors affecting iCa/cCa ratio (t = 2.86, p < 0.01 and t = − 5.42, p < 0.01, respectively).

Conclusions

iCa levels were lower in PD patients with lower residual renal function (RRF) even though their cCa levels were equal to those with maintained RRF, warranting caution in the assessment and management of CKD-MBD in PD patients.

### Monitoring guidance for patients with hypophosphatasia treated with asfotase alfa [^0b8ae536]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2017). Medium credibility.

Calcium and endocrine monitoring with asfotase alfa — management guidance states that calcium restriction is often recommended in infants/children with HPP to manage hypercalcemia; once treatment with asfotase alfa has been initiated, restrictions may be lifted and supplementation with additional calcium may be required to maintain PTH within the normal range. Accordingly, serum calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and PTH levels should be monitored very closely after initiating asfotase alfa, and in perinatal and infantile patients, ionized calcium should be measured; if ionized calcium testing is not available, albumin levels are needed to interpret calcium findings.

### Use of albumin-adjusted calcium measurements in clinical practice [^47d5339d]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Laboratory Ordering Patterns

When looking at all tests collected during the study period (and allowing for more than 1 measurement per patient), there were 7 274 442 serum total calcium tests, 6 546 561 serum albumin tests, and 919 381 ionized calcium tests (eFigure 6 in Supplement 1). The majority of total calcium measurements (54.8%; n = 3 990 000) were ordered with a serum albumin, suggesting that albumin-adjusted calcium corrections were commonly used in clinical practice; less than half (44.9%; n = 3 265 467) of total calcium measurements were ordered alone, and very rarely (0.5%; n = 36 521) total calcium was ordered with an ionized calcium. In most cases when a serum albumin was measured (60.9%; n = 3 990 000), it was with a total calcium, suggesting that these were likely ordered with the intention of being used for calculating an adjusted calcium.

Ordering patterns were similar, irrespective of patient age, sex, or kidney function (eTable 7 in Supplement 1) and over time (eFigure 7 in Supplement 1). Ionized calcium was mostly ordered in inpatient and emergency department settings (94.7%; n = 870 679) compared with outpatient settings (4.4%; n = 40 370), whereas approximately half of the orders for combined total calcium and albumin were from the outpatient setting (55.1%; n = 2 197 193) (eTable 8 in Supplement 1).

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^7562443c]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

The workgroup agreed that each of the treatments here mentioned could be considered as first line alone or in combination. A supplementary round of Delphi did not allow prioritization of one intervention over another. Comparative studies were rare, and more than one interventions were done concurrently in most of the studies reviewed. Therefore, the workgroup emphasized that the first-line treatments should be prioritized based on the desired effect tailored to the individual patient's clinical condition (Fig. 3; Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 2).

The workgroup recommended IV calcium as a first-line treatment based on improvement in contractility and blood pressure observed in some case series and animal studies. This therapy is readily available and carries little risk provided central venous or secure peripheral venous access is available. The regimen often used for the administration of 10% calcium chloride in CCB-poisoned adults is 10–20 mL (1–2 g) every 10–20 minutes or an infusion at 0.2–0.4 mL/kg/hr (0.02–0.04 g/kg/hr). When 10% calcium gluconate is given, notably to minimize peripheral vein irritation, the dose regimen frequently used is 30–60 mL (3–6 g) every 10–20 minutes or an infusion at 0.6–1.2 mL/kg/hr (0.06–0.12 g/kg/hr).

### Albumin-adjusted calcium is not suitable for diagnosis of hyper-and hypocalcemia in the critically ill [^b1c9b59e]. Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate whether calcium adjusted for albumin can be used to monitor calcium homeostasis in critically ill patients.

Design

Prospective single-single center observational study.

Setting

Clinical laboratory and critical care unit of a regional teaching hospital.

Patients

Fifty-three paired samples were from 36 patients requiring intensive care treatment.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Total calcium, albumin-adjusted calcium, and ionized calcium were measured in critically ill patients during an 8-wk period. Calcium was adjusted for albumin using the formula that is most frequently used in The Netherlands. Using ionized calcium as the gold standard, albumin-adjusted calcium overestimated hypercalcemia and totally missed hypocalcemia. The same seemed to be true for other formulas used for albumin or protein adjustment of calcium concentrations.

Conclusions

Albumin-adjusted calcium cannot be used in an intensive care setting to monitor reliably the calcium levels in critically ill patients and should be replaced by measurement of ionized calcium.

### Hypercalcemic crisis: a clinical review [^abcfc4ee]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a common metabolic perturbation. However, hypercalcemic crisis is an unusual endocrine emergency, with little clinical scientific data to support therapeutic strategy. We review the relevant scientific English literature on the topic and review current management strategies after conducting a PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar search for articles published between 1930 and June 2014 using specific keywords: "hypercalcemic crisis", "hyperparathyroid crisis", "parathyroid storm", "severe primary hyperparathyroidism", "acute hyperparathyroidism", and "severe hypercalcemia" for articles pertaining to the diagnosis, epidemiology, clinical presentation, and treatment strategies. Despite extensive clinical experience, large and well-designed clinical studies to direct appropriate clinical care are lacking. Nonetheless, morbidity and mortality rates have substantially decreased since early series reported almost universal fatality. Improved outcomes can be attributed to modern diagnostic capabilities, leading to earlier diagnosis, along with the recognition that primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common etiology for hypercalcemic crisis. Hypercalcemic crisis is an unusual endocrine emergency that portends excellent outcomes if rapid diagnosis, medical treatment, and definitive surgical treatment are expedited.

### Assessment and management of patients with abnormal calcium [^fc3276ac]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Calcium is essential for homeostasis, and normocalcemia should be maintained strictly during the perioperative period. The biochemistry of calcium equilibrium results from the calcium-sensing receptors on the parathyroid glands, which detect changes in calcium concentrations and initiate the proper response. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia is a common metabolic derangement that is often discovered on routine serum screening. The most common etiologies are primary hyperparathyroidism and cancer. Increasingly, parathyroidectomy is the preferred therapy for primary hyperparathyroidism. Severe hypercalcemia ("hypercalcemic crisis") should be managed aggressively with a combination of intravenous fluids, steroids, bisphosphonates, and calcitonin. Some of these patients may require an urgent parathyroidectomy for calcium control. Hypocalcemia needs to be verified, as many cases of hypocalcemia are the artifact of hypoalbuminemia. Severe hypocalcemia occurs after subtotal or total parathyroidectomy with auto transplantation as well as after massive resuscitation or blood transfusion. Strategies aimed at correcting calcium concentrations depend on the severity of symptomatology. If symptoms are mild, oral calcium supplementation can be given; otherwise, intravenous calcium should be administered.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^ccfd4d76]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency in children — calcium and phosphorus metabolism and bone: In a vitamin D–sufficient state [25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)-D) levels of > 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL)], net intestinal calcium absorption is up to 30%, and during active growth it can reach 60% to 80%; in a vitamin D–deficient state, intestinal calcium absorption is only ~10% to 15% and total maximal reabsorption of phosphate decreases. In conditions of deficiency, low ionized calcium stimulates parathyroid hormone (PTH), which increases calcium reabsorption in renal tubules and increases 1-α-hydroxylase activity, causing increased 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D [1,25(OH)₂-D] synthesis; increased PTH also causes phosphorus loss in urine and a decreased calcium×phosphorus product, resulting in decreased bone mineralization.

### Calcium supplementation during trauma resuscitation: a propensity score-matched analysis from the traumaRegister DGU [^5c89bf02]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In major trauma patients, hypocalcemia is associated with increased mortality. Despite the absence of strong evidence on causality, early calcium supplementation has been recommended. This study investigates whether calcium supplementation during trauma resuscitation provides a survival benefit.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective analysis using data from the TraumaRegister DGU ® (2015–2019), applying propensity score matching to balance demographics, injury severity, and management between major trauma patients with and without calcium supplementation. 6 h mortality, 24 h mortality, and in-hospital mortality were considered as primary outcome parameters.

Results

Within a cohort of 28,323 directly admitted adult major trauma patients at a European trauma center, 1593 (5.6%) received calcium supplementation. Using multivariable logistic regression to generate propensity scores, two comparable groups of 1447 patients could be matched. No significant difference in early mortality (6 h and 24 h) was observed, while in-hospital mortality appeared higher in those with calcium supplementation (28.3% vs. 24.5%, P = 0.020), although this was not significant when adjusted for predicted mortality (P = 0.244).

Conclusion

In this matched cohort, no evidence was found for or against a survival benefit from calcium supplementation during trauma resuscitation. Further research should focus on understanding the dynamics and kinetics of ionized calcium levels in major trauma patients and identify if specific conditions or subgroups could benefit from calcium supplementation.

1.1 Administration Instructions

Renal Replacement Solution: Not for direct intravenous infusion.

The recommended effluent volume for patients receiving CRRT for acute kidney injury (AKI) is 20 to 25 mL/kg/h. This usually requires a higher prescription of effluent volume. The prescription of REGIOCIT solution must consider the flow rates of the effluent and other therapeutic fluids, the patient's fluid removal requirements, additional fluid inputs and outputs, and the desired acid-base and electrolyte balance.

The mode of therapy, solute formulations, flow rates and length of therapy should be selected by the physician responsible for managing treatment depending on the clinical condition of the patient as well as the patient's fluid, electrolyte, acid base and glucose balance.

Dialysate and replacement fluid formulations and flow rates are prescribed in accordance with the patient's clinical needs. The use of a calcium-containing dialysate or replacement fluid is not recommended, since the calcium provided by these solutions may counteract the anticoagulant effect of citrate in the circuit.

1.2 Suggested Dosing

The rate at which REGIOCIT solution is administered depends on the targeted citrate dose and the prescribed blood flow rate. The pre-filter infusion rate of REGIOCIT solution is indexed to the blood flow rate to achieve a target blood citrate concentration of 3 mmol/L of blood (See Table 1). Flow rate for anticoagulation of the extracorporeal circuit should be titrated to achieve a post-filter concentration of ionized calcium in the range of 0.25 to 0.35 mmol/L.

Table 1: REGIOCIT Solution Flow Rates to Achieve Citrate Dose of 3 mmol/L of Blood

Prior to initiating therapy, the patient's systemic ionized calcium concentration should be within the normal physiologic range (1.0 to 1.2 mmol/L) by adjustment of calcium supplementation. A separate infusion of calcium is always required during use of REGIOCIT, due to loss in the effluent. Calcium solution infusion is commenced at the rate of 4 mmol/h, when commencing therapy (see Table 4). Adjust or stop calcium infusion according to physician's prescription when REGIOCIT is stopped.

Citrate also acts as a buffer source (due to conversion to bicarbonate); the infusion rate of REGIOCIT solution must be considered in relation to the rate at which buffer administration occurs from other sources (e.g., dialysate and/or replacement fluid). REGIOCIT solution must be used together with a dialysis solution/replacement solution with appropriate bicarbonate concentration.

1.3 Laboratory Monitoring

Monitoring of the post-filter blood ionized calcium (iCa), systemic blood iCa, and total blood calcium levels in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical parameters such as acid-base balance and serum electrolytes are essential to guide appropriate REGIOCIT solution dosage based on the desired level of anticoagulation. Levels should be taken at baseline, 1 hour after initiation (or adjustment), and every 6 hours (See Table 2). Rapidly decreasing systemic ionized calcium levels are an early indicator of citrate accumulation.

Measurement of total calcium and assessment of total-to-ionized calcium ratio is necessary. Citrate accumulation causes systemic ionized calcium levels to drop and the ratio of total-to-ionized calcium increases (total-to-ionized calcium ratio > 2.5). In the presence of impaired citrate metabolism, a progressively higher calcium infusion rate is required to maintain the systemic ionized calcium concentration within the intended target. When a total-to-ionized-calcium ratio > 2.5 is recorded, any one of the following abnormalities reported concurrently increases the likelihood of citrate accumulation:

A rapid decline in systemic iCa concentration despite adequate calcium compensation
A rapid decrease in pH or a decrease in base excess
A rapid increase in anion gap

In order to avoid metabolic alkalosis, acid-base balance and systemic ionized calcium can be measured using blood gas analysis. If metabolic alkalosis or citrate accumulation is suspected, decrease the citrate dose while tolerating a post-filter ionized calcium of < 0.5 mmol/L. This can be achieved by either decreasing the blood flow rate to decrease the overall citrate load, increasing the dialysate/replacement flow rate (when applicable) to increase the citrate removal, or decreasing the citrate flow to decrease the citrate dose. Dialysate solutions contain bicarbonate below or above physiological range of 22 to 26 mmol/L, and increasing or decreasing the flow rates of the dialysate solutions can impact the acid-base status of the patient.

### Assessment and clinical course of hypocalcemia in critical illness [^1ae3dc43]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypocalcemia is a common derangement in both medical and surgical patients requiring intensive care. The reported prevalence varies significantly between studies due to differences in the population studied and the cutoff values used, with published figures ranging from 15% to 88%.

The etiology of hypocalcemia in critical illness is multifactorial. Abnormalities of parathyroid hormone secretion and action as well as vitamin D deficiency, medication side effects, transfusion of citrated blood and the effect of circulating catecholamines are likely to contribute. Septic patients are at particular risk of hypocalcemia and this has been linked to both the bacteremic state and the effect of inflammatory mediators on parathyroid hormone secretion and function.

A number of studies have reported that hypocalcemia is associated with poor outcome in different populations including medical, surgical and trauma patients on both adult and pediatric intensive care units. However, results from recent large studies suggest that it is only severe hypocalcemia (ionized calcium < 0.8 mmol/L or 0.9 mmol/L) that is independently associated with mortality.

It has been advocated that calcium should be replaced in order to prevent life-threatening complications such as laryngospasm, tetany, seizures and cardiac abnormalities. However, studies using experimental models of sepsis have shown calcium supplementation to provide either no benefit or even to increase mortality.

There is no evidence on the impact of calcium supplementation on outcome in critically ill patients. A recent systematic review failed to identify any studies that evaluated the associations of parenteral calcium supplementation in intensive care patients and outcomes such as length of stay and mortality. In addition, neither the clinical course of hypocalcemia nor the relationship of normalization to outcome has been established. Hence it remains controversial whether or not calcium replacement should be routinely given to critically ill patients and a more complete understanding of both the course of hypocalcemia in relation to outcome and the effect of supplementation is needed.

### Hypercalcemia: a review [^f92ff096]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hypercalcemia affects approximately 1% of the worldwide population. Mild hypercalcemia, defined as total calcium of less than 12 mg/dL (< 3 mmol/L) or ionized calcium of 5.6 to 8.0 mg/dL (1.4–2 mmol/L), is usually asymptomatic but may be associated with constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and constipation in approximately 20% of people. Hypercalcemia that is severe, defined as total calcium of 14 mg/dL or greater (> 3.5 mmol/L) or ionized calcium of 10 mg/dL or greater (≥ 2.5 mmol/L) or that develops rapidly over days to weeks, can cause nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma.

Observations

Approximately 90% of people with hypercalcemia have primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) or malignancy. Additional causes of hypercalcemia include granulomatous disease such as sarcoidosis, endocrinopathies such as thyroid disease, immobilization, genetic disorders, and medications such as thiazide diuretics and supplements such as calcium, vitamin D, or vitamin A. Hypercalcemia has been associated with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 protein inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, denosumab discontinuation, SARS-CoV-2, ketogenic diets, and extreme exercise, but these account for less than 1% of causes. Serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), the most important initial test to evaluate hypercalcemia, distinguishes PTH-dependent from PTH-independent causes. In a patient with hypercalcemia, an elevated or normal PTH concentration is consistent with PHPT, while a suppressed PTH level (< 20 pg/mL depending on assay) indicates another cause. Mild hypercalcemia usually does not need acute intervention. If due to PHPT, parathyroidectomy may be considered depending on age, serum calcium level, and kidney or skeletal involvement. In patients older than 50 years with serum calcium levels less than 1 mg above the upper normal limit and no evidence of skeletal or kidney disease, observation may be appropriate. Initial therapy of symptomatic or severe hypercalcemia consists of hydration and intravenous bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid or pamidronate. In patients with kidney failure, denosumab and dialysis may be indicated. Glucocorticoids may be used as primary treatment when hypercalcemia is due to excessive intestinal calcium absorption (vitamin D intoxication, granulomatous disorders, some lymphomas). Treatment reduces serum calcium and improves symptoms, at least transiently. The underlying cause of hypercalcemia should be identified and treated. The prognosis for asymptomatic PHPT is excellent with either medical or surgical management. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is associated with poor survival.

Conclusions and Relevance

Mild hypercalcemia is typically asymptomatic, while severe hypercalcemia is associated with nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia due to primary hyperparathyroidism is managed with parathyroidectomy or observation with monitoring, while severe hypercalcemia is typically treated with hydration and intravenous bisphosphonates.

### Hidden hypercalcemia and mortality risk in incident hemodialysis patients [^700956f1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Neither uncorrected- nor albumin-corrected total calcium reliably predict ionized calcium in patients with end-stage renal disease. However, little is known about the consequences of inaccurate assessment of calcium concentration using total calcium.

Objective

We hypothesized that hidden hypercalcemia (ie, elevated ionized calcium with normal total calcium) and apparent hypercalcemia (ie, elevated ionized calcium with elevated total calcium) are both associated with increased mortality risk.

Design, Setting, and Patients

We identified 874 incident hemodialysis patients with measured serum ionized calcium, total calcium, albumin, phosphorus, and bicarbonate from October 2007 to December 2011, using data from a large dialysis organization in the United States.

Exposures

Serum concentrations of ionized calcium and total calcium were measured.

Main Outcome Measure

The primary outcome was all-cause mortality.

Results

There was only fair interindex agreement with calcium status between ionized calcium and uncorrected or corrected total calcium (κ = 0.32 and 0.27, respectively). Among patients with high ionized calcium (> 1.32 mmol/liter), 88% and 70% patients were incorrectly categorized as being normocalcemic using uncorrected and corrected total calcium, respectively, and were thus considered to have "hidden hypercalcemia". Compared to patients with low-normal ionized calcium (1.16–1.24 mmol/liter), patients with high ionized calcium had a significantly higher mortality risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.13–2.75). Furthermore, compared to patients with normocalcemia (ionized calcium 1.16–1.32 mmol/liter), those with hidden hypercalcemia by uncorrected and corrected total calcium also had a higher risk for death (adjusted hazard ratio 1.75 [95% confidence interval 1.11–2.75] and 1.80 [95% confidence interval, 1.11–2.90], respectively).

Conclusion

The majority of end-stage renal disease patients with elevated ionized calcium are incorrectly categorized as normocalcemic using conventional total calcium measurements; these patients have a higher death risk. Future research is needed to establish whether reducing ionized calcium concentrations in these patients improves clinical outcomes.

Hyperkalemia represents a widespread and potentially lethal condition that affects millions of people across their lives. Despite the prevalence and severity of the condition, there are no consensus guidelines on the treatment of hyperkalemia or even a standard definition. Herein, we provide a succinct review of what we believe to be the most significant misconceptions encountered in the emergency care of hyperkalemia, examine current available literature, and discuss practical points on several modalities of hyperkalemia treatment. Additionally, we review the pathophysiology of the electrocardiographic effects of hyperkalemia and how intravenous calcium preparations can antagonize these effects. We conclude each section with recommendations to aid emergency physicians in making safe and efficacious choices for the treatment of acute hyperkalemia.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: sixth edition [^9e5a77bf]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Transfusion-induced hypocalcaemia, with ionised Ca²⁺ levels below 0.9 mmol/L or serum total corrected calcium levels of 7.5 mg/dL or lower, should be corrected promptly, as ionised Ca 2+ levels below 0.8 mmol/L are associated with cardiac dysrhythmias. Importantly, however, it should be noted that while an association between admission ionised hypocalcaemia and mortality, increased blood transfusion and coagulopathy has been identified, no data demonstrate that the prevention or treatment of ionised hypocalcaemia reduces mortality in patients with critical bleeding requiring MT.

The preferred agent to correct hypocalcaemia is calcium chloride, 10 mL as a 10% solution contains 270 mg of elemental calcium. In comparison, 10 mL of 10% calcium gluconate contains only 90 mg of elemental calcium. Calcium chloride may also be preferable to calcium gluconate in the setting of abnormal liver function, where decreased citrate metabolism results in the slower release of ionised calcium.

Recombinant activated coagulation factor VII

Recommendation 32

We do not recommend the use of recombinant activated coagulation factor VII (rFVIIa) as first-line treatment (Grade 1B).

We suggest that the off-label use of rFVIIa be considered only if major bleeding and traumatic coagulopathy persist despite all other attempts to control bleeding, systemic homeostasis and best-practice use of conventional haemostatic measures (Grade 2C).

### Hypercalcemia: a review… [^705d10a2]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Hypercalcemia that is severe, defined as total calcium of 14 mg/dL or greater or ionized calcium of 10 mg/dL or greater or that develops rapidly over days to weeks, can cause nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma. Hypercalcemia has been associated with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 protein inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, denosumab discontinuation, SARS-CoV-2, ketogenic diets, and extreme exercise, but these account for less than 1% of causes. Serum intact parathyroid hormone, the most important initial test to evaluate hypercalcemia, distinguishes PTH-dependent from PTH-independent causes. In a patient with hypercalcemia, an elevated or normal PTH concentration is consistent with PHPT, while a suppressed PTH level indicates another cause. Mild hypercalcemia usually does not need acute intervention.

If due to PHPT, parathyroidectomy may be considered depending on age, serum calcium level, and kidney or skeletal involvement. In patients older than 50 years with serum calcium levels less than 1 mg above the upper normal limit and no evidence of skeletal or kidney disease, observation may be appropriate. Initial therapy of symptomatic or severe hypercalcemia consists of hydration and intravenous bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid or pamidronate. In patients with kidney failure, denosumab and dialysis may be indicated. Glucocorticoids may be used as primary treatment when hypercalcemia is due to excessive intestinal calcium absorption. Treatment reduces serum calcium and improves symptoms, at least transiently. The underlying cause of hypercalcemia should be identified and treated. The prognosis for asymptomatic PHPT is excellent with either medical or surgical management.

Hypercalcemia of malignancy is associated with poor survival. Conclusions and Relevance Mild hypercalcemia is typically asymptomatic, while severe hypercalcemia is associated with nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia due to primary hyperparathyroidism is managed with parathyroidectomy or observation with monitoring, while severe hypercalcemia is typically treated with hydration and intravenous bisphosphonates.

### Assessment and clinical course of hypocalcemia in critical illness [^3b63222a]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Hypocalcemia is a common finding in patients admitted to a general ICU. In this large cohort of patients, levels tended to normalize over the early days of admission and this was not associated with outcome. However, patients severely hypocalcemic on admission whose calcium failed to rebound to normal trended towards having a higher mortality and may be a target for intervention. Findings also indicate that calcium supplementation is not associated with calcium normalization or improved outcome, although this study was observational in nature. A large randomized controlled trial of calcium supplementation in critically ill patients with different degrees of hypocalcemia is required to determine the effectiveness and side effects of this treatment and its role in clinical practice.

Normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism is a common biochemical finding, usually identified during an assessment of bone or renal health. Hypercalcaemia must be considered by calculation of adjusted calcium, and a careful history taken to assess dietary calcium intake and for the possibility of a malabsorption syndrome. 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) should be measured and replaced if indicated. The management plan for the patient is influenced by the context in which calcium and PTH were measured. In this brief review we describe the assessment of a patient with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism.

Post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism — incidence variability and definitional criteria are outlined as follows: Hypoparathyroidism is the most common complication of bilateral and re-operative thyroid operations. Reported rates are influenced by different time points after surgery, diverse electrolyte supplementation protocols, variable operation aggressiveness and surgeon expertise, and by variable use of clinical criteria including symptomatic versus asymptomatic hypocalcemia, biochemical criteria (serum parathyroid hormone [PTH] and/or calcium and/or ionized calcium), and treatment criteria (requirement for calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation). According to a recent meta-analysis, the median incidence of temporary and permanent hypoparathyroidism following thyroidectomy ranges from 19% to 38% and 0% to 3%, respectively.

### Health supervision for children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: clinical report [^f39def11]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Summary and recommendations about neurodevelopmental manifestations — 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS): Total and ionized calcium concentrations should be checked and treatment initiated as indicated in any patient with new-onset seizures regardless of age and history of calcium status, and patients with acute or short-term changes in awareness or other cognitive function should be evaluated for seizures. Otherwise standard evaluation with brain MRI and EEG is indicated in patients with seizures, and treatment with standard antiseizure medicines and antiepileptic protocols is useful in seizures not related to hypocalcemia. Hypotonia is an almost universal finding that impacts multiple areas of development. In general, persons with 22q11.2DS are more functional in concrete thinking and receptive language than in abstract thinking and expressive language, and neuropsychiatric or educational testing can identify specific strengths and weaknesses to tailor therapies. Anxiety occurs in about a third (36%) of children with 22q11.2DS and should be managed with standard medications or other therapies. ASD is more common than in the general population, and because generalized neurocognitive impairment can be overinterpreted as ASD, specialized evaluation is recommended.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^3c85291d]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate whether patients presenting with laboratory results consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) are managed in accordance with guidelines.

Methods

The laboratory database at a hospital in Sweden, serving 127,000 inhabitants, was searched for patients with biochemically determined pHPT. During 2014, a total of 365 patients with biochemical laboratory tests consistent with pHPT were identified. Patients with possible differential diagnoses or other reasons for not being investigated according to international guidelines were excluded after scrutinizing records, after new blood tests, and clinical assessments by endocrine surgeons.

Results

Altogether, 92 patients had been referred to specialists and 82 had not. The latter group had lower serum calcium (median 2.54 mmol/L) and PTH (5.7 pmol/L). Out of these 82 cases, 9 patients were diagnosed with pHPT or had some sort of long-term follow-up planned as outpatients.

Conclusion

Primary hyperparathyroidism is overlooked and underdiagnosed in a number of patients in the clinical setting. It is important to provide local guidelines for the management of patients presenting with mild pHPT to ensure that these patients receive proper evaluation and follow-up according to current research.

### Hypocalcemia during sepsis… [^35dfb4d8]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The ionized calcium and parathyroid hormone response to polymicrobial intra-abdominal sepsis and the relationship between IC and hemodynamic alterations with and without crystalloid resuscitation were investigated. Thirty swine underwent cecal ligation and incision or sham laparotomy, with seven animals that had cecal ligation and incision administered Ringer's solution after each set of measurements recorded on days 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8. An early decrease in mean arterial pressure and cardiac index in animals that had cecal ligation and incision reversed with resuscitation. The IC also fell early and parathyroid hormone level increased in both the unresuscitated and resuscitated septic groups. However, correlation coefficients of mean arterial pressure and cardiac index with IC ranged from. 034 to. 287 in the septic animals and were lower in the group that had sham laparotomy.

We conclude that polymicrobial intra-abdominal sepsis results in decreased IC and an elevated parathyroid hormone level. Hemodynamics do not correlate with IC levels, and resuscitation can be achieved without calcium administration. Burchard KW, Simms HH, Robinson A, DiAmico R, Gann DS.

### Abnormal calcium levels during trauma resuscitation are associated with increased mortality, increased blood product use, and greater hospital resource consumption: a pilot investigation [^debc03ba]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Admission hypocalcemia predicts both massive transfusion and mortality in severely injured patients. However, the effect of calcium derangements during resuscitation remains unexplored. We hypothesize that any hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia (either primary or from overcorrection) in the first 24 hours after severe injury is associated with increased mortality.

Methods

All patients at our institution with massive transfusion protocol activation from January 2013 through December 2014 were identified. Patients transferred from another hospital, those not transfused, those with no ionized calcium (Ca) measured, and those who expired in the trauma bay were excluded. Hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia were defined as any level outside the normal range of Ca at our institution (1–1.25 mmol/L). Receiver operator curve analysis was also used to further examine significant thresholds for both hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia. Hospital mortality was compared between groups. Secondary outcomes included advanced cardiovascular life support, damage control surgery, ventilator days, and intensive care unit days.

Results

The massive transfusion protocol was activated for 77 patients of whom 36 were excluded leaving 41 for analysis. Hypocalcemia occurred in 35 (85%) patients and hypercalcemia occurred in 9 (22%). Mortality was no different in hypocalcemia versus no hypocalcemia (29% vs 0%; P = 0.13) but was greater in hypercalcemia versus no hypercalcemia (78% vs 9%; P < .01). Receiver operator curve analysis identified inflection points in mortality outside a Ca range of 0.84 to 1.30 mmol/L. Using these extreme values, 15 (37%) had hypocalcemia with a 60% mortality (vs 4%; P < .01) and 9 (22%) had hypercalcemia with a 78% mortality (vs 9%; P < .01). Patients with extreme hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia also received more red blood cells, plasma, platelets, and calcium repletion.

Conclusions

Hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia occur commonly during the initial resuscitation of severely injured patients. Mild hypocalcemia may be tolerable, but more extreme hypocalcemia and any hypercalcemia should be avoided. Further assessment to define best practice for calcium management during resuscitation is warranted.

### Use of albumin-adjusted calcium measurements in clinical practice [^da9a30f6]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Our study is consistent with and extends the findings of previous reports. For decades, adjustment of total calcium has been entrenched in clinical practice to account for states of altered protein-binding, as an alternative to ionized calcium. However, these adjustment formulas have been repeatedly shown to be unreliable. As previously mentioned, the original correction formula proposed by Payne and colleagues was derived from a single laboratory using an albumin measurement method no longer available today, and never validated against ionized calcium. A modification was subsequently published in 1977, as a practical simplification, but not derived or validated in any patient cohort either. These correction formulas assumed that binding between calcium and albumin remained constant; but in reality, the calcium-albumin binding ratio has been shown to increase with hypoalbuminemia. As such, albumin-adjusted calcium has proven to be insensitive to hypocalcemia in hypoalbuminemic states. Moreover, the accuracy of albumin measurement itself is reduced in the setting of kidney failure. Acknowledging these limitations, new formulas have been proposed (mostly accounting for differences in calcium-albumin binding and kidney function), but for the most part, none of these have significantly improved upon using total calcium alone. Of note, one of the best-performing correction formulas was proposed by Pekar and colleagues, designed to directly estimate ionized calcium, and this showed marginal improvement in the overall correlation between the estimated and actual ionized calcium (R², 74.1%) compared with using total calcium alone (R², 71.7%), but the formula requires 4 laboratory measurements (ie, total calcium, albumin, creatinine, and pH) rather than 1, and is therefore more costly and cumbersome to implement than simply measuring ionized calcium itself (ie, measurement of blood pH would require an analyzer that already directly measures ionized calcium). Finally, it appears that locally derived formulas may offer incremental improvement in accuracy. For instance, the formula proposed by James and colleagueswas derived in the Calgary Health Region and performed the best in our study. However, the modest improvement in correlation shown in this study is unlikely to outweigh the complexity required to routinely implement this labor-intensive strategy of local derivation and validation in other jurisdictions.

### Calcium and phosphate disorders: core curriculum 2024 [^6917125a]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Maintaining normal calcium and phosphate homeostasis is essential for optimal cellular, metabolic, and organ function. Parathyroid hormone, fibroblast growth factor 23, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D regulate calcium and phosphate homeostasis via multiple interlinked feedback loops, receptors, ion channels, and transporters. Following an initial overview of the stimuli and effects of the different hormonal regulators, this installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology reviews the physiology and pathophysiology of calcium and phosphate disorders through the lens of a series of illustrative cases. The cases span clinical conundrums commonly encountered by nephrologists in their daily clinical practice and other less common disorders. Some of the cases present in the outpatient clinic setting and others in the inpatient hospital setting. Patients with normal kidney function, chronic kidney disease, kidney failure, and acute kidney injury are all represented. Some of the disorders are iatrogenic, and some are due to native disease. All demonstrate key aspects of pathophysiology that are essential knowledge for nephrology clinicians of all career stages.

### Management of hypoparathyroidism: present and future [^44ee550f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Conventional management of hypoparathyroidism has focused upon maintaining the serum calcium with oral calcium and active vitamin D, often requiring high doses and giving rise to concerns about long-term consequences including renal and brain calcifications. Replacement therapy with PTH has recently become available. This paper summarizes the results of the findings and recommendations of the Working Group on Management of Hypoparathyroidism.

Evidence Acquisition

Contributing authors reviewed the literature regarding physiology, pathophysiology, and nutritional aspects of hypoparathyroidism, management of acute hypocalcemia, clinical aspects of chronic management, and replacement therapy of hypoparathyroidism with PTH peptides. PubMed and other literature search engines were utilized.

Evidence Synthesis

Under normal circumstances, interactions between PTH and active vitamin D along with the dynamics of calcium and phosphorus absorption, renal tubular handing of those ions, and skeletal responsiveness help to maintain calcium homeostasis and skeletal health. In the absence of PTH, the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and skeleton are all affected, leading to hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, reduced bone remodeling, and an inability to conserve filtered calcium. Acute hypocalcemia can be a medical emergency presenting with neuromuscular irritability. The recent availability of recombinant human PTH (1–84) has given hope that management of hypoparathyroidism with the missing hormone in this disorder will provide better control and reduced needs for calcium and vitamin D.

Conclusions

Hypoparathyroidism is associated with abnormal calcium and skeletal homeostasis. Control with calcium and active vitamin D can be a challenge. The availability of PTH (1–84) replacement therapy may usher new opportunities for better control with reduced supplementation requirements.

Discharge can be considered when patients are asymptomatic and "serum calcium levels are 7.8 mg/dL (1.95 mmol/L) or above and are not falling", while "Low iPTH levels (< 10–15 pg/mL) in the immediate postoperative setting appear to predict symptomatic hypocalcemia and need for calcium and calcitriol (1,25 vitamin D) supplementation". Prophylaxis can use "oral calcium (usually calcium carbonate, 1250–2500 mg) four times daily, tapered by 500 mg every 2 days, or 1000 mg every 4 days as tolerated", and "Postoperative evaluation is generally conducted 1–2 weeks following dismissal with continuation of supplementation based on clinical parameters".

### Comparison of normocalcemic vs hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism in a hypercalciuric renal stone population [^56dcc1ea]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is one of the most common endocrine disorders with increasing prevalence in recent decades due to routine biological screening. The current curative treatment is parathyroidectomy according to guidelines, with beneficial results in the long-term on bones and kidneys targets. Asymptomatic forms are increasingly diagnosed and raise the issue of the therapeutic management. Moreover, normocalcemic forms (normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism, NHPT), currently defined by "a normal total and ionized serum calcium level without any other known etiology for a secondary elevation of parathyroid hormone (PTH)", have been recognized as a singular entity whose natural history and physiopathology remain poorly understood. Indeed, some patients may present long-term asymptomatic normocalcemia altogether with hypercalciuria and renal stones while other patients experience only bone mineral disorders or develop hypercalcemia during follow-up. The diagnosis is flawed by a potential inaccuracy of the measurements of total and ionized serum calcium and serum PTH level. Indeed, a normal ionized calcium serum level in the setting of an increased serum PTH concentration may lead to a diagnosis of NHPT if hypercalcemia is unmasked after a calcium load together with an inadequate serum PTH level inhibition. Alternatively, the persistence after a calcium load test of normal ionized calcium and PTH serum concentration rules out PHPT and drives one to a diagnosis of secondary hyperparathyroidism related to a normal/low ionized calcium serum level in a fasting state.

We took advantage of a routine calcium load test at our center that was carried out in patients with hypercalciuric renal stones to retrospectively compare our populations of normocalcemic vs hypercalcemic PHPT (NHPT vs HPHPT, respectively) to get a better understanding of NHPT pathophysiology.

Indeed, when selecting a stringent criterion for NHPT based upon normal ionized calcium and not total calcium under a 2-day restricted diet and the onset of true hypercalcemia following a calcium load test with inappropriate PTH, our data pinpoint differences between NHPT and HPHPT in calcium homeostasis mainly related to better PTH inhibition and renal calcium excretion with no difference for intestinal calcium absorption or calcitriol regulation. Moreover, among patients who underwent surgery, despite a trend, no significant parathyroidectomy gland weight difference was detected between the 2 groups.

### Zoledronic acid [^e94e17a0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Clinical studies in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM) showed that single-dose infusions of Zoledronic acid Injection are associated with decreases in serum calcium and phosphorus and increases in urinary calcium and phosphorus excretion.

Osteoclastic hyperactivity resulting in excessive bone resorption is the underlying pathophysiologic derangement in hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM, tumor-induced hypercalcemia) and metastatic bone disease. Excessive release of calcium into the blood as bone is resorbed results in polyuria and gastrointestinal disturbances, with progressive dehydration and decreasing glomerular filtration rate. This, in turn, results in increased renal resorption of calcium, setting up a cycle of worsening systemic hypercalcemia. Reducing excessive bone resorption and maintaining adequate fluid administration are, therefore, essential to the management of hypercalcemia of malignancy.

Patients who have hypercalcemia of malignancy can generally be divided into two groups according to the pathophysiologic mechanism involved: humoral hypercalcemia and hypercalcemia due to tumor invasion of bone. In humoral hypercalcemia, osteoclasts are activated and bone resorption is stimulated by factors such as parathyroid hormone-related protein, which are elaborated by the tumor and circulate systemically. Humoral hypercalcemia usually occurs in squamous cell malignancies of the lung or head and neck or in genitourinary tumors such as renal cell carcinoma or ovarian cancer. Skeletal metastases may be absent or minimal in these patients.

Extensive invasion of bone by tumor cells can also result in hypercalcemia due to local tumor products that stimulate bone resorption by osteoclasts. Tumors commonly associated with locally mediated hypercalcemia include breast cancer and multiple myeloma.

Total serum calcium levels in patients who have hypercalcemia of malignancy may not reflect the severity of hypercalcemia, since concomitant hypoalbuminemia is commonly present. Ideally, ionized calcium levels should be used to diagnose and follow hypercalcemic conditions; however, these are not commonly or rapidly available in many clinical situations. Therefore, adjustment of the total serum calcium value for differences in albumin levels (corrected serum calcium, CSC) is often used in place of measurement of ionized calcium; several nomograms are in use for this type of calculation [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic data in patients with hypercalcemia are not available.
