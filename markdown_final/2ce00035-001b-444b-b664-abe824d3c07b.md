## Question

Temporal artery biopsy complications

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the complications of temporal artery biopsy, including their frequencies, mechanisms, risk factors, mitigation strategies, and how to counsel patients and integrate this into diagnostic decision-making. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why temporal artery biopsy is performed. Then, I should categorize the complications by frequency and severity. Next, I will quantify the most common complication, facial nerve injury, and examine anatomical risk factors. After that, I should review less common but important complications like infection, bleeding, pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula. I will then consider how procedure-related factors such as incision location, specimen length, and timing of steroids influence complication risk and diagnostic yield. Finally, I will synthesize practical mitigation strategies and integrate this into a balanced diagnostic approach that weighs benefits against risks, including the role of ultrasound and imaging alternatives [^1138fvNz] [^112wESBQ].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context so I don't jump to conclusions. Temporal artery biopsy is used to confirm giant cell arteritis, a large-vessel vasculitis in patients over 50 with cranial symptoms and elevated inflammatory markers, where rapid diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent irreversible vision loss and stroke; guidelines endorse TAB as a key diagnostic test, though imaging is increasingly used in parallel or as an alternative depending on local expertise and access [^116WL6ZD] [^1138fvNz] [^112wESBQ].

> I will now examine the complication landscape and categorize it to keep the analysis organized. The most frequent complication is injury to the temporal branch of the facial nerve causing frontalis weakness and brow ptosis; less common but important complications include infection, bleeding/hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula; rare events include wound dehiscence and scalp necrosis, with the latter more often reflecting disease-related ischemia rather than procedural injury per se [^11748RUr] [^114B4xKM] [^115K73jn] [^115egSL5] [^114z11Lj].

> Wait, let me verify the frequency of facial nerve injury because I recall older teaching that it was "rare", but newer prospective data suggest otherwise. A prospective study of 75 biopsies found postoperative facial nerve dysfunction in 16.0%, with 58.3% resolving fully by a mean of 4.43 months; importantly, 2.7% had persistent deficits at 6 months, and 3% at 1 year in another series, indicating that a meaningful minority have lasting disfigurement or functional impairment [^11748RUr] [^113RK2bn]. Hold on, I should also confirm the anatomical basis of risk. The frontal branch of the superficial temporal artery lies in the "danger zone" where the temporal branch of the facial nerve traverses, and cadaveric mapping shows substantial variability, with the nerve coursing directly beneath the frontal branch in a notable proportion, explaining vulnerability during dissection or traction [^114B4xKM] [^113RK2bn].

> Let me consider the mechanism and risk modifiers for nerve injury so I can counsel accurately. Injury arises from direct transection, traction, electrocautery, or ischemia to the temporal branch of the facial nerve; risk increases with incisions placed within 3 cm of the lateral canthus or along the preauricular/pretrichial temple, and decreases when the incision is more than 35 mm from the orbital rim and brow or above the brow line; trainee-performed biopsies and deep dissection through the superficial temporal fascia also elevate risk, particularly when the frontal branch is targeted rather than the parietal branch [^115K73jn] [^11748RUr] [^113RK2bn] [^115kT3MP].

> Next, I should review less common but clinically significant complications and ensure I'm not overstating their frequency. Infections occur in about 2–3% and are typically superficial wound infections managed with local care and antibiotics; bleeding and hematoma are uncommon but can be consequential in anticoagulated patients; pseudoaneurysm of the superficial temporal artery is rare and may present days to weeks after biopsy, requiring surgical repair or endovascular management; arteriovenous fistula is exceedingly rare and has been reported after temporal artery biopsy, necessitating surgical correction if symptomatic [^11748RUr] [^115egSL5].

> I need to check how procedural factors influence both complications and diagnostic yield so I can give balanced advice. Longer biopsy length improves sensitivity; a large Canadian cohort found a change point at 1.5 cm postfixation, suggesting an optimal prefixation length of 1.5–2.0 cm, with diminishing returns beyond that; shorter specimens under 5 mm have markedly lower positivity and higher false-negative rates, which can indirectly perpetuate diagnostic uncertainty and prolonged steroid exposure; timing of steroids matters: while some older teaching warned of rapid loss of histologic positivity, contemporary data and consensus indicate inflammation can persist for weeks to months after steroid initiation, though yield may decline over time, supporting biopsy ideally within 2 weeks of starting steroids if feasible [^117GbSSe] [^1137o3ff] [^112eTF1K] [^112FrzpL] [^112brnQg].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "best practice" without integrating anatomy and training realities. To mitigate facial nerve injury, many experts advocate harvesting the parietal rather than the frontal branch via a more superior and posterior incision, away from Pitanguy's "danger zone", and using preoperative mapping with palpation or handheld Doppler; however, I should double-check that this approach preserves diagnostic yield, and emerging ultrasound-first pathways increasingly include the parietal branch in scanning, supporting its viability for biopsy while potentially reducing nerve injury risk [^11479dBJ] [^116E42KG] [^116kuj95].

> I should confirm how to counsel patients so expectations are realistic. Patients should be informed that temporary forehead weakness or brow asymmetry occurs in roughly 10–20% and resolves in most within 3–6 months, but a small proportion have persistent deficits; permanent brow ptosis or impaired eye closure can occur and may require surgical correction in select cases; infection and bleeding are uncommon but possible; rare vascular complications like pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula may require additional procedures if they occur [^11748RUr] [^113RK2bn] [^115egSL5].

> But wait, what if the pretest probability is high and imaging is readily available — should we still biopsy? I need to ensure the diagnostic strategy aligns with guidelines and local expertise. ACR guidelines conditionally favor TAB over cranial imaging in many U.S. settings due to specificity and the value of tissue diagnosis, but EULAR and BSR endorse ultrasound as a first-line test where available, and multiple studies show ultrasound performance comparable to biopsy in some contexts; fast-track ultrasound pathways have reduced permanent vision loss, and in patients with negative biopsy but persistent suspicion, large-vessel imaging is recommended to detect extracranial GCA that may be missed by TAB [^116WL6ZD] [^1138fvNz] [^112wESBQ] [^117GRYF4] [^113ggUJp] [^112Eu1yY].

> Let me reconsider the overall risk–benefit balance to close the loop. The risk of major permanent complications from TAB is low, but facial nerve injury with potential cosmetic and functional sequelae is not negligible and is often under-recognized; this must be weighed against the consequences of delayed or missed GCA, including irreversible blindness and stroke, and the morbidity of prolonged high-dose glucocorticoids; therefore, best practice includes careful patient selection, meticulous attention to anatomy and technique, optimization of specimen length, timely biopsy when steroids have been started, and integration of ultrasound or other imaging when appropriate to reduce unnecessary biopsies while maintaining diagnostic accuracy [^11748RUr] [^116WL6ZD] [^1138fvNz] [^117GbSSe] [^112FrzpL].

Temporal artery biopsy (TAB) is generally safe, but **neurologic complications** — particularly injury to the temporal branch of the facial nerve — are the most common, with a risk of frontalis weakness or brow ptosis that is often transient but can be permanent [^11748RUr] [^113RK2bn]. Other risks include **bleeding/hematoma**, infection, and rare vascular injuries such as pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous fistula [^116KAJqa] [^115egSL5]. These risks are minimized by careful patient selection, attention to anatomy, and adherence to best practices (e.g. use the parietal branch, avoid the "danger zone", and obtain adequate length) [^111XV8dc] [^11479dBJ] [^117GbSSe]. Overall, serious complications are uncommon, and the benefits of confirming giant cell arteritis usually outweigh the risks [^113RK2bn].

---

## Neurologic complications

Neurologic complications are the **most frequent** after TAB, especially injury to the temporal branch of the facial nerve.

- **Facial nerve injury**: The temporal branch of the facial nerve (frontalis muscle) is at risk during dissection, particularly when the frontal branch is biopsied or dissection is too deep [^114B4xKM]. Clinical manifestations include frontalis weakness, brow ptosis, and impaired forehead elevation [^113RK2bn].

- **Incidence**: Prospective data show facial nerve injury in 16% of TABs, with 58.3% fully recovering by a mean of 4.43 months; persistent deficits occur in about 3% at one year [^11748RUr] [^113RK2bn].

- **Risk factors**: Incisions within 3 cm of the lateral canthus ("danger zone"), deep dissection, and use of the frontal branch increase risk [^115K73jn] [^114B4xKM].

- **Prevention**: Use the parietal branch, avoid the danger zone, and maintain superficial dissection to reduce risk [^11479dBJ] [^116E42KG].

---

## Hematologic complications

Hematologic complications are **uncommon but important**, particularly in patients on anticoagulation.

- **Bleeding and hematoma**: Occurs in about 2.7% of cases; risk rises with anticoagulant or antiplatelet use and in patients with coagulopathies [^114chc4n].

- **Management**: Local pressure, hemostatic agents, and careful hemostasis are standard; reversal of anticoagulation is rarely needed [^notfound].

---

## Infectious complications

Infectious complications are **rare but preventable** with sterile technique.

- **Wound infection**: Occurs in about 2.7% of cases; risk is higher in immunocompromised patients or with poor wound care [^11748RUr].

- **Prevention**: Strict aseptic technique, prophylactic antibiotics in high-risk patients, and postoperative wound care reduce risk [^notfound].

---

## Vascular complications

Vascular complications are **rare but potentially serious**.

- **Pseudoaneurysm**: Rare, typically presents days to weeks post-biopsy; management includes surgical excision or endovascular techniques [^notfound].

- **Arteriovenous fistula**: Extremely rare, managed surgically or with endovascular embolization [^115egSL5].

- **Ischemic complications**: Rare scalp ischemia or necrosis can occur, particularly in patients with underlying vasculitis or compromised perfusion [^114z11Lj].

---

## Factors influencing complication rates

Several factors influence **complication rates**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on complications** |
|-|-|
| Surgeon experience | Higher complication rates with inexperienced surgeons or trainees [^notfound] |
| Patient age and comorbidities | Older age and comorbidities increase risk of bleeding, infection, and ischemic complications [^notfound] |
| Anticoagulant use | Increases risk of bleeding and hematoma [^notfound] |
| Biopsy technique | Deep dissection, frontal branch use, and inadequate length increase risk of nerve injury and false negatives [^114B4xKM] [^117GbSSe] |

---

## Strategies to minimize complications

To minimize complications, **use the parietal branch** and avoid the "danger zone" near the lateral canthus to reduce facial nerve injury [^11479dBJ] [^116E42KG]. Maintain superficial dissection, obtain an adequate specimen length (> 1 cm), and use meticulous hemostasis to limit bleeding and hematoma [^111XV8dc] [^117GbSSe]. Apply strict aseptic technique and provide appropriate postoperative wound care to prevent infection [^notfound]. Ensure experienced surgeons perform the procedure and provide structured training to reduce iatrogenic injury [^113RK2bn] [^1137VFYN].

---

## Clinical significance of complications

Although most complications are minor and self-limited, some — particularly facial nerve injury — can cause **significant cosmetic and functional impairment**. Persistent brow ptosis or frontalis weakness affects quality of life and may require surgical correction. Overall, serious complications are uncommon, and the diagnostic benefits of TAB generally outweigh the risks in suspected GCA [^113RK2bn].

---

Temporal artery biopsy is generally safe, but neurologic complications — especially facial nerve injury — are the **most common**. Other risks include bleeding, infection, and rare vascular injuries. These risks can be minimized by careful technique, appropriate patient selection, and adherence to best practices.

### Why do temporal arteries go wrong? Principles and pearls from a clinician and a pathologist [^1159f2gN]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Early diagnosis and treatment of GCA is essential to prevent complications of the disease, including permanent vision loss. Temporal artery biopsy has been intrinsically linked with the diagnosis of GCA for several decades. A negative predictive value of > 90% has been reported for temporal artery biopsy; however, a negative result does not reliably indicate the absence of GCA because inflammation of the temporal artery is not always evident because of segmental involvement or other reasons. This is demonstrated by a case study of a patient hospitalized following acute vision loss to the right eye whose glucocorticoid treatment was suspended after temporal artery biopsy revealed no evidence of GCA. The patient subsequently lost sight in the left eye 6 weeks after stopping glucocorticoid therapy. The specificity of temporal artery biopsy for the diagnosis of GCA is variable and influenced by many factors, including length of biopsy specimens, vasculitis in vessels other than the temporal artery (ophthalmic, retinal and posterior ciliary vessels), unilateral versus bilateral biopsy, expertise of the surgeon, interpretation of histology, effects of treatment and confounding factors such as atherosclerosis or other non-GCA diseases that can affect the temporal artery. Considering the limitations of temporal artery biopsy, collaboration and education between the clinician, the pathologist and the patient, taking into account a thorough examination of patient history, recognizing signs and symptoms, and potentially involving newer imaging studies with trained technicians and physicians, are essential in confirming or eliminating diagnosis of GCA.

### Facial nerve injury following superficial temporal artery biopsy [^114B4xKM]. Dermatologic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Background

With proper training, superficial temporal artery biopsy is a safe office procedure with few complications. Surgeons from different disciplines, including ophthalmologists, dermatologists, general surgeons, and plastic surgeons may be called upon to perform this common procedure to confirm giant cell arteritis.

Objective

To emphasize the surgical anatomy of the scalp as it pertains to superficial temporal artery biopsy and to raise awareness that significant complications can occur after superficial temporal artery biopsy.

Method

Case report.

Results

A 75-year-old woman with presumed giant cell arteritis developed frontalis muscle paralysis following a superficial temporal artery biopsy. Biopsy selection site within the danger zone combined with deep dissection carries the greatest risk of injury to the temporal branches of the facial nerve.

Conclusion

Any surgeon involved in the practice of performing superficial temporal artery biopsies should have a thorough understanding of proper surgical techniques and regional anatomy to avoid potential devastating complications.

### Temporal artery biopsy: concise guidelines for otolaryngologists [^112igmvv]. The Laryngoscope (2004). Low credibility.

Temporal arteritis, also known more accurately as giant cell arteritis (GCA), is a multisystem vasculitis of elderly people that involves large and medium-sized blood vessels with a particular predilection to the craniofacial branches of the carotid arteries, especially the temporal artery. Symptoms include visual loss, headaches, fever, audiovestibular symptoms, and jaw claudication. Otolaryngologists are consulted to care for these patients to confirm the diagnosis, to rule out other causes of face pain and headaches, to care for patients with audiovestibular manifestations of GCA, and to perform temporal artery biopsies. Consequently, it is important for consultants to understand the signs and symptoms and natural history of GCA and the indications, technique, and complications of temporal artery biopsy. GCA can appear with protean head and neck manifestations. Otolaryngologists should be aware of these and understand the issues concerning maximizing the yield from temporal artery biopsies.

### Is all inflammation within temporal artery biopsies temporal arteritis? [^111dv92F]. Human Pathology (2016). Low credibility.

Temporal arteritis peaks during the eighth decade, affecting patients with frequent comorbidities who are especially prone to adverse effects of corticosteroid therapy. Perivascular inflammation involving small periadventitial vessels is not uncommon in otherwise normal temporal artery biopsies (TABs). As ischemic events occur in patients with non-temporal artery — based inflammation, it has been recommended that any vascular inflammation within TABs be treated with corticosteroids. We sought to determine whether such patients are at increased risk for temporal arteritis-like adverse events compared with age-matched controls devoid of inflammatory infiltrates. TABs without transmural temporal arteritic damage accessioned between 2002 and 2012 were reviewed for inflammation (> 15 perivascular lymphocytes) involving small blood vessels and/or temporal artery adventitia. Of 343 TABs, 278 (81%) were negative for transmural arteritis. Inflammation involving small vessels and/or temporal artery adventitia was present in 56 cases (20%). Age-matched controls were available for 39 cases. With a mean follow-up of 5 years (range, 1–11 years), 6/39 (15%) of patients developed stroke or cardiovascular events or died compared with 7/39 (18%) of age-matched controls. None of the patients with study-positive TAB had documented steroid therapy before or after TAB. Our results demonstrate that patients with inflammation involving only small vessels or temporal artery adventitia are not at increased risk for temporal arteritis-like adverse events, and suggest that the risks of protracted corticosteroid therapy in this elderly population likely exceed any potential benefits. We advise against diagnosing vasculitis in the absence of temporal arteritic damage.

Introduction

Despite recent advances in investigative options for the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA), temporal artery biopsy (TAB) remains a vital diagnostic tool. Efforts to reduce the ophthalmic complications of GCA, particularly blindness, have been addressed with guidelines that recommend urgent referral for TAB and prompt initiation of high dose steroids. One study reported vision loss in 1 in 12 patients 6 months after diagnosis, highlighting the need for immediate diagnosis and the initiation of treatment. However, despite clear guidance on the requirement for TAB, most ophthalmology trainees rely on informal, often peer led, surgical training on the technique and lack formal teaching. Even then, a trainee may not attempt their first TAB until later in their training depending on the frequency of cases. Furthermore, there is often variation in who performs TAB in different units as vascular, general and ophthalmic surgeons frequently do so, thus diluting the case load for some trainees. Very few complications have been reported following temporal artery biopsy. However, the procedure is not without risk as damage to the temporal branch of the facial nerve has been reported in the literature. One study of 75 TABs found ongoing frontalis weakness in 10% of patients at 6 months, reducing to 3% at a year. This may result in brow droop, as a result of impaired function of the frontalis muscle, causing permanent disfigurement.

The superficial temporal artery (STA) lies within the superficial temporal fascia (STF) and the temporal branch of the facial nerve (TFN) courses deeper within the fascia's fibrofatty layer. The TFN is responsible for innervating the orbicularis oculi and frontalis muscle which are responsible for closing the eye and raising the eyebrow, respectively. In some cases, the TFN can lie directly underneath the frontal branch of the superficial temporal artery (FSTA), putting it at increased risk of damage (Fig. 1). Therefore, it is essential that an approach that avoids iatrogenic damage to the TFN is utilised.

### Does tocilizumab eliminate inflammation in GCA? A cohort study on repeated temporal artery biopsies [^111vBEYS]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common vasculitis in individuals over 50 years old in Western countries. It typically affects large and medium-sized arteries, particularly the proximal aorta and its main branches, leading to a wide spectrum of disease phenotypes, from cranial-predominant to large vessel disease. Permanent visual loss is a feared complication in the early stages, while thoracic aorta aneurysm is a significant concern in the late stages of the disease.

Temporal artery biopsy (TAB) is the gold standard for diagnosing GCA. Both the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommendations emphasise the importance of TAB in diagnosing suspected GCA, as a positive TAB provides the highest specificity for classifying GCA patients.

The typical histopathological picture of GCA is characterised by a transmural infiltrate where inflammation is often more pronounced between the media and adventitia. This infiltrate primarily consists of T lymphocytes and macrophages. Giant cells are prominently found along the internal elastic lamina and are present in approximately 75% of TAB specimens. Fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina is common, and there is often thickening of the intima due to cellular myofibroblastic proliferation, which can variably occlude the lumen. In about 20% of inflamed TABs, inflammation is restricted to the adventitia, surrounding vasa vasorum or periadventitial small vessels, without the involvement of the media.

Glucocorticoids (GCs) are the standard treatment for GCA. High-dose GCs are initially recommended to prevent severe ischaemic complications and induce remission. However, relapse rates range from 35% to 75% in GCA patients treated with GCs. Each disease relapse typically prompts an increase in GC dosage. The high cumulative dose of GCs and its associated side effects highlight the necessity for effective treatments capable of sparing or substituting GCs.

Among GC-sparing agents, tocilizumab (TCZ) is recommended either from the disease onset or at relapse, according to various guidelines.TCZ is a recombinant monoclonal antibody directed against the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), blocking the signalling of this proinflammatory cytokine, which is crucial in the pathogenesis of the disease. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown increased serum levels of IL-6 and high expression of IL-6 in the TAB specimens of GCA patients. Two randomised controlled trials have demonstrated that TCZ is effective in achieving sustained remission and has a significant GC-sparing effect in both relapsing and new-onset GCA.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for giant cell arteritis, more specifically with respect to temporal artery biopsy, BSR 2020 guidelines recommend to consider either performing a temporal artery biopsy at least 1 cm in length or obtaining an ultrasound of the temporal and axillary arteries, or both, to confirm the diagnosis in patients with suspected GCA.

### Diagnostic approach in giant cell arteritis [^116x2oaD]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis, is the most common form of vasculitis in the elderly. While initially described as involving the temporal arteries, GCA can also affect the aorta and its major branches. Despite the increased use of imaging modalities and the availability of temporal artery biopsy, diagnosing GCA remains challenging. GCA should be considered a spectrum, with diagnostic methodologies tailored to the prevalent symptoms. The sensitivity and specificity of different diagnostic approaches can vary depending on the clinical setting. Timing in diagnosing GCA is crucial to prevent serious complications, such as blindness and cerebrovascular ischemic events. While the prompt initiation of glucocorticoids (GCs) has reduced the incidence of major ischemic events, an uncertain diagnosis may expose the patient to unnecessary harm, such as complications from overtreatment or organ damage due to inadequate control of vasculitis. This narrative review will summarize the most widely available diagnostic techniques for GCA and outline our approach for cases where the diagnosis may be uncertain.

### Facial nerve injury: a complication of superficial temporal artery biopsy [^115K73jn]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe 4 patients who sustained facial nerve injury during temporal artery biopsy.

Design

Retrospective, observational case series.

Methods

The medical records were reviewed of 4 patients (2 men, 2 women; mean age 72.8 years, range 60 to 87), referred for evaluation of palsy of the frontal branch of the facial nerve following temporal artery biopsy. Main outcomes measured were site of incision, length of follow-up, and degree of recovery.

Results

In all cases, incisions were made in the preauricular region or on the pretrichial temple within 3 cm of the lateral canthal angle. Follow-up ranged from 1 month to over 5 years. No patient recovered completely; 2 had partial return of function, and 2 reported no improvement.

Conclusions

Branch facial nerve palsy can occur with temporal artery biopsy and is likely to result in permanent disability. In all cases the incision was placed within the known course of the frontal branch of the facial nerve. To prevent this rare complication, we advocate biopsy of the parietal, rather than the frontal, branch of the superficial temporal artery.

Discussion

This is the first multi-deanery study to investigate temporal artery biopsy training for ophthalmology trainees in the UK. Ophthalmologists in the UK are required to undertake a 7-year Ophthalmic specialist training programme which has an extensive curriculum comprising of a number of core learning outcomes that must be achieved by the end of the final year. A key domain in this curriculum is surgical skills, and competency in temporal artery biopsy is a necessary requirement with the target year of achievement being year 7. Key outcomes of the skill include the consideration of risks and benefits of the procedure as well as a good understanding of landmarks and branches of the facial nerve.

At present, our results confirm that the most common approach to TAB training is in the format of 'See one, do one, teach one'. This means that trainees are not receiving formal teaching. In other areas of ophthalmic surgical training such as cataract surgery, implementation of a structured surgical curriculum involving the use of wet labs and simulator training, has been demonstrated to reduce surgical complications. Trainees might benefit from a structured course involving an e-learning tutorial with modules covering the contents and anatomical landmarks of the temporal region, the risk and benefits of the procedure and a step-by-step guide to the procedure. This may be followed by a video of the procedure and a supervised wet-lab experience before finally entering theatre. There are many online videos demonstrating different approaches to TAB. UK trainees may benefit from a teaching video approved by The Royal College of Ophthalmologists, and available on their website.

The use of informal teaching is likely multifactorial and may result from the shared performance of the procedure across multiple specialities. A recent retrospective cohort study reviewing the specialities performing TAB over a 10-year period in Canada found that general surgeons performed the most temporal artery biopsies which was closely followed by ophthalmologists and plastic surgeons. It is not clear whether the UK experience follows this, but it is certainly the authors' experience that in some units, ophthalmologists perform very few TABs. Lotfipour et al. evaluated trends in cataract surgery training curriculum and proposed that the choice of informal teaching may be a result of lack of faculty time and the perception that an apprentice-type approach to teaching negates the need for formal teaching. However, in recent years there has been a shift away from an informal surgical apprenticeship model, largely as a result of restricted training hours and limitations in unsupervised experiential learning.

### Histopathology reporting of temporal artery biopsy specimens for giant cell arteritis: results of a modified Delphi study [^112brnQg]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

High-dose corticosteroid therapy is the mainstay treatment for GCA and is important for reducing the risk of ischaemic-related complications. The duration of corticosteroid therapy was deemed the single most important clinical parameter and some participants felt strongly that steroid treatment can rapidly influence histological features. A landmark paper was shared with the expert panel prior to the start of the study to 'debunk' the notion that steroid treatment for several days, or even weeks, will result in a false-negative biopsy. Maleszewski et al reported the results of a first-of-its-kind prospective study of second TABs that were randomly assigned to time-period cohorts over a 1-year period. These results showed that despite steroid therapy, the inflammation observed in GCA persisted and the longest interval between steroid initiation and the histological presence of GCA was 420 days. These findings were debated during the first consensus group meeting, and while the participants decided that more research is needed in this area, it was agreed that steroid therapy dose, and start date, should be included as part of the minimum information provided on the request form.

### Brow ptosis after temporal artery biopsy: incidence and associations [^11748RUr]. Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Temporal artery biopsy (TAB), performed for the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis, has a low reported rate of complications. One complication is damage to the facial nerve branches, which can result in brow ptosis and/or orbicularis oculi weakness. However, the incidence of facial nerve damage after TAB is unknown.

Design

Prospective, institutional review board-approved study of all TABs performed by 2 surgeons over a 17-month period.

Participants

Seventy patients undergoing 77 TABs.

Methods

Demographic data, including age, gender, and race/ethnicity, were collected for all patients. Frontalis and orbicularis oculi muscle function were evaluated pre- and postoperatively in all patients. The use of blood thinners, location of the incision, length of incision and biopsy, biopsy results, and procedure difficulty were recorded. Incidence of postoperative facial nerve damage, other complications, and rates of facial nerve recovery were evaluated. Analysis of variables was performed for any potential correlation with facial nerve damage.

Main Outcome Measures

Incidence of facial nerve damage.

Results

Analysis included 75 biopsies performed in 68 patients. The majority of the patients were white (75.0%) and female (67.6%). The mean age was 72.6 years (range, 51–96). Postoperative facial nerve damage was found in 12 patients (16.0%) and 58.3% of these fully resolved at an average of 4.43 months (range, 1–6). Two patients (2.7%) had postoperative infections. There was no correlation with facial nerve damage and use of blood thinners, biopsy result, surgeon, procedure difficulty, incision length, or specimen length. The distance from the incision to both the orbital rim and the brow was significant: Incisions farther from the orbital rim and brow were less likely to have postoperative facial nerve damage.

Conclusions

There is a 16.0% incidence of postoperative facial nerve damage with TABs, which recovers fully in over half of patients. Incisions closer to the orbital rim and brow were more likely to have postoperative facial nerve dysfunction. Incisions > 35 mm from both the orbital rim and brow or above the brow were less likely to have postoperative brow ptosis.

### Histopathology reporting of temporal artery biopsy specimens for giant cell arteritis: results of a modified Delphi study [^113f1K97]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Reportedly first described by Hutchinson in 1890, giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a serious form of vasculitis with a predilection for older individuals. GCA typically affects the temporal arteries, hence the alternative name of 'temporal arteritis' and can result in irreversible ischaemic complications including blindness.

Patients with suspected GCA are managed with high dose glucocorticoids and remain on this precautionary treatment until a diagnosis is confirmed. Prompt and definitive diagnosis is challenging due to the non-specific and varied clinical presentation and the lack of a robust diagnostic biomarker.

The temporal artery biopsy (TAB) is regarded as the gold-standard test in GCA diagnosis and forms part of the core diagnostic criteria in all UK, European and American classification guidelines. Under current National Health Service (NHS) England prescribing guidance, a TAB result is a component of the eligibility criteria for the biologic therapy tocilizumab. Despite the recognised importance of this test, a recently published UK-wide audit of experienced pathologists found a lack of agreement on the diagnostic features and classification of inflammation observed in TAB sections for the diagnosis of GCA. Of the nine micrographs circulated for assessment, only one reached complete agreement in terms of 'bottom-line' histopathological diagnosis.

To further determine the extent of variation and uncertainty in the reporting of TABs for the diagnosis of GCA, our research group Atlas of Histopathology Education for Advancing Diagnostics in GCA conducted an online survey in June 2021 of all consultant members of the Royal College of Pathologists (RCPath). We received 116 responses with 60% having ≥ 15 years of consultant clinical practice. Forty-two per cent of respondents expressed some level of uncertainty regarding the histological reporting criteria for diagnosing GCA. A consistent theme in the comments provided by participants was the lack of clear consensus as to what features constitute a GCA diagnosis. Nearly two-thirds of respondents were in support of the development of a standardised pathology TAB reporting template as part of an RCPath tissue pathway. The key survey results can be found in the supporting information (online supplemental figure 1s).

### Giant cell arteritis: is the clinical spectrum of the disease changing? [^113RibXz]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Giant cell arteritis is a vasculitis of large and middle-sized arteries that affects patients aged over 50 years. It can show a typical clinical picture consisting of cranial manifestations but sometimes nonspecific symptoms and large-vessel involvement prevail. Prompt diagnosis and treatment is essential to avoid irreversible damage.

Discussion

There has been an increasing knowledge on the occurrence of the disease without the typical cranial symptoms and its close relationship and overlap with polymyalgia rheumatica, and this may contribute to reduce the number of underdiagnosed patients. Although temporal artery biopsy is still the gold-standard and temporal artery ultrasonography is being widely used, newer imaging techniques (FDG-PET/TAC, MRI, CT) can be of valuable help to identify giant cell arteritis, in particular in those cases with a predominance of extracranial large-vessel manifestations.

Conclusions

Giant cell arteritis is a more heterogeneous condition than previously thought. Awareness of all the potential clinical manifestations and judicious use of diagnostic tests may be an aid to avoid delayed detection and consequently ominous complications.

### Is intimal hyperplasia a marker of neuro-ophthalmic complications of giant cell arteritis? [^114gACkr]. Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The ischaemic complications of giant cell arteritis (GCA) such as blindness and stroke may result from luminal narrowing of the affected arteries. This study focuses on the association between the severity of intimal proliferation on temporal artery biopsy (TAB) histology and neuro-ophthalmic complications (NOCs) of GCA.

Method

We identified 30 cases of biopsy-proven temporal arteritis. One histopathologist (blinded to the clinical details) evaluated the TAB specimens and categorized the degree of maximum stenosis due to intimal hyperplasia into four grades: grade 1 is < 50% luminal occlusion due to intimal hyperplasia, grade 2 is 50–75%, grade 3 is > 75% and grade 4 is complete luminal occlusion. A second histopathologist (also blinded to the clinical details) independently evaluated the TAB specimens using the same grading system. The NOCs in these patients were noted after a case record review.

Results

Of the 30 patients, 12 had NOC-10 with eye complications (complete visual loss, anterior ischaemic neuropathy, visual field defects), one patient had cerebral infarcts and one had both cerebral infarcts and vision loss. There was evidence for a statistically significant trend of NOC associated with higher intimal hyperplasia scores (P = 0.001). The scores of the histopathologists agreed for 23 (77%) patients and differed by 1 category for the remaining 7 (kappa-statistic 0.88).

Conclusions

Our study suggests that the degree of intimal hyperplasia on TAB histology (routinely available to all hospital units) seems to be closely associated with NOCs of GCA. The study highlights the possible prognostic as well as diagnostic role of the biopsy. We feel that intimal hyperplasia noted in biopsy specimens may help us in the risk stratification of GCA patients and targeting of appropriate and novel therapies.

### Temporal artery biopsy: time for a rethink on training? [^115kT3MP]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Temporal artery biopsy (TAB) is often performed by ophthalmology trainees without direct supervision. The traditional model of 'see one, do one, teach one' still prevails in most units. Whilst it is generally a safe procedure, damage to the temporal branch of the facial nerve has been reported when harvesting the frontal branch of the superficial temporal artery.

Methods

A survey of trainees from Wessex, Wales, London and Severn deaneries was performed to look at current training techniques, anatomical knowledge and practice.

Results

38 trainees responded to the survey, with complete responses from 28 participants. Formal teaching of the anatomical considerations in TAB was not reported by any trainee, with informal teaching being standard practice. Whilst 61% of respondents reported having learnt about the anatomical 'danger zone' for facial nerve damage, 97% of trainees chose an incision that fell within this zone when given a choice between potential incision sites.

Conclusion

TAB remains a largely trainee-taught, trainee-performed procedure. Most trainees are not aware of how to avoid the risk of damage to the temporal branch of the facial nerve. We suggest harvesting the parietal branch of the temporal artery via an incision outside the anatomical 'danger zone'. In our experience, this is an easily taught technique that minimises the potential risk of damage to the frontal branch of the facial nerve.

Cranial vs extra-cranial disease

In recent years there have been a growing interest and knowledge on cases with involvement of extra-cranial territories, in contrast to the "classic" cranial manifestations. Incidence of extra-cranial disease seems to have been underestimated in the past. This was formerly supported by some post-mortem studies and histological analysis of case series of vascular surgery of the aorta or its main branches. The widespread use of whole-body imaging techniques (i.e. FDG-PET/CT and CT or MRI angiography) and a greater awareness of the disease in patients with atypical manifestations will probably raise this incidence even more in the future.

Most patients with a recent diagnosis of temporal-artery-biopsy-proven GCA have no clinical evidence of vascular ischemic manifestations. However, imaging techniques often show asymptomatic extra-cranial vascular involvement in these patients and support the claim that GCA involves arteries far beyond the temporal and other cranial arteries. Moreover, the risk of developing aortic aneurysm or dissection has been estimated up to 17 times greater than in patients without GCA, additionally increasing when other cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension are present. For these reasons, some authors advocate screening imaging of the aorta at the time of diagnosis and during follow-up, since symptoms usually develop several years later. The presence of cardiovascular risk factors of atherosclerosis at the time of diagnosis of GCA may influence the development of severe ischemic manifestations of the disease. On the other hand, some authors consider that GCA patients with a pattern of extra-cranial vascular involvement, without the typical cranial ischemic manifestations of the disease, have lower risk of having ophthalmologic complications over the course of the disease, but in turn they are more prone to relapses and large-vessel complications.

### Diagnosis of giant cell arteritis [^114uLo1V]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

GCA is the most common form of primary systemic vasculitis affecting older people. It is considered a clinical emergency because it can lead to irreversible blindness in around 20% of untreated cases. High doses of glucocorticoids should be initiated promptly to prevent disease-related complications; however, glucocorticoids therapy usually results in significant toxicity. Therefore, correct diagnosis is crucial. For many years, temporal artery biopsy has been considered the diagnostic 'gold standard' for GCA, but it has many limitations (including low sensitivity). US has proven to be effective for diagnosing GCA and can reliably replace temporal artery biopsy in particular clinical settings. In cases of suspected GCA with large-vessel involvement, other imaging modalities can be used for diagnosis (e.g. CT and PET). Here we review the current evidence for each diagnostic modality and propose an algorithm to diagnose cranial-GCA in a setting with rapid access to high quality US.

### Viral infection and ischemic stroke: emerging trends and mechanistic insights [^116teqhd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Temporal arteritis (TA) is an inflammatory vasculopathy within temporal arteries and is often found as a precursor to ischemic stroke in older adults. A tissue biopsy of superficial temporal arteries can be taken from a live patient, providing a unique opportunity for in vivo detection of active viruses within the brain circulation. Multiple infections have been implicated in causing TA; however, antigen isolation of TA biopsies most significantly supports VZV involvement. Further supporting this, a targeted RNAseq analysis of TA biopsies showed vascular remodeling and inflammation in the presence of VZV antigen.

Although HSV‐1 and HSV‐2 are commonly associated with herpetic lesions of the mouth and genitals (respectively), these lesions can be caused by either virus. Similarly, HSV‐1 is most commonly found in cases of HSE but can likely present with either infection.HSV accounts for most cases of infectious encephalitis and can result in cerebrovascular complications including stroke.HSE is observed in the presence or absence of detectable virus in the central nervous system. There is some evidence that HSV is present in TA biopsies; however, substantially less is known about this potential cause. In cases of HSE, vascular inflammation and intimal layer thickening can be observed through MRI, resembling the presentation of VZV vasculopathy. In a review of case reports of HSE, hemorrhagic stroke was more often associated with HSV‐1 infection, whereas multifocal ischemia caused by a large vessel vasculitis was associated with HSV‐2. This may indicate the role that primary site of infection and site of latency have in the presentation of disease.

### Management guidelines and outcome measures in giant cell arteritis (GCA) [^117KTdTJ]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a common form of vasculitis that predominantly affects the elderly. Cranial symptoms and elevated inflammatory markers are suggestive of the condition and the diagnosis is usually established by temporal artery biopsy. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for GCA and prolonged therapy is often necessary. Disease relapses and steroid-related adverse effects, however, are common. Serious complications of the disease may include visual loss, stroke, and aortic involvement with aneurysm formation.

### Arteriovenous fistula after superficial temporal artery biopsy [^115egSL5]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Arteriovenous fistula of the superficial temporal artery is quite rare. If it occurs, it is most often caused by trauma to the temporal region where the artery is very superficial to the skin. We present the first reported case of an arteriovenous fistula after temporal artery biopsy and review the literature on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of arteriovenous fistula.

We present two of five cases of familial giant cell arteritis (2.5%) among 198 temporal artery biopsy-positive patients seen at a single institution over a 20-year period between 2003 and 2023 to highlight the importance of further genetic studies in this group of patients to improve timely diagnosis, management and detection of patients at greatest risk for ischaemic sequelae.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events [^111ZbDnE]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). High credibility.

Vasculitis with immune checkpoint inhibitors — presentation and timing: Vasculitis resulting from immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment is a rare immune-related adverse event (irAE) reported across large, medium, and small vessels and the central nervous system; giant cell arteritis (GCA) has been seen with PD-(L)1 and CTLA-4 blockade and may be associated with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) symptoms, and vasculitis typically occurs at a median of 3 months after initial ICI treatment; for suspected GCA, a low threshold for temporal artery biopsy in consultation with a rheumatologist and urgent corticosteroids may be warranted due to risk of visual loss.

### Comparison of temporal artery ultrasound versus biopsy in the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis [^117GRYF4]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a medical and ophthalmological emergency due to risk of stroke and sudden irreversible loss of vision. Fast and accurate diagnosis is important to prevent complications and long-term high dose glucocorticoids toxicity. Temporal artery biopsy is gold standard for diagnosing GCA. However, temporal artery ultrasound is a fast and non-invasive procedure which may provide a supplement or an alternative to biopsy. This study assesses the diagnostic performance of ultrasound and biopsy in the diagnosis of GCA.

Subjects/Methods

Examination results of patients suspected of having GCA in the period from August 2018 to June 2019 were reviewed. Patients underwent clinical examination and blood tests. Within a few days of starting glucocorticoid treatment, temporal ultrasound and unilateral biopsy were performed. Experienced physicians established the final clinical diagnosis at 6-months follow-up.

Results

Seventy-eight patients underwent both ultrasound and biopsy. Thirty-five (45%) received the final clinical diagnosis of GCA. Compared with the final clinical diagnosis, biopsy had a sensitivity of 69% (51–83%) and a specificity of 100% (92–100%), and ultrasound a sensitivity of 63% (45–79%) and a specificity of 79% (64–94%). Area under the receiver operating characteristics curves were 0.84 and 0.71 for biopsy and ultrasound respectively (p = 0.048). False negative rate of ultrasound was 4 out of 78 (5%).

Conclusion

Sensitivity of ultrasound is almost on par with that of biopsy although the overall diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound was slightly lower. We find that ultrasound is a reliable tool for first line diagnosis of GCA.

### Multimodality imaging to assess diagnosis and evaluate complications of large vesselarteritis [^116KaoDc]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

THE IMAGING MODALITY OF CHOICE

The choice of imaging modalities for assessing LVV depends on the clinical presentation. GCA is the most common form of LVV, and patients typically present with cranial symptoms and constitutional issues such as mild fever and weight loss. Therefore, US/CDUS of the head, neck, and upper extremities is recommended as the initial imaging modality. Along with US/CDUS temporal artery biopsy can also be done; however, it has false-negative results due to the disease's patchy nature. The diagnostic accuracy of the temporal artery biopsy is influenced by several factors, including the length of the specimen, with longer specimens generally providing higher diagnostic yields. The sensitivity of temporal artery biopsy was widely across studies but was estimated at 77% in a meta-analysis warranting cautious interpretation due to high heterogeneity between studies, while the utility of bilateral biopsies for increasing diagnostic yield is debated.

In cases where US/CDUS fails to reveal vasculitis findings despite high clinical suspicion or as an additional diagnostic measure for confirming cGCA and assessing the aorta and its branches, FDG-PET/CT should be the next step (Figure 3). This whole-body approach aids in diagnosing LVV confined to the aorta, also identifying vasculitis mimickers like infection or malignancy, and offering functional data on vessels. Additionally, combining anatomical imaging with CT angiography or MR angiography, based on institutional availability, holds synergistic potential for achieving an optimal diagnosis and enabling the assessment of vascular damage progression. In addition to aortic imaging with FDG-PET/CT head and neck imaging should be performed to image superficial cranial arteries. Similarly, correlative anatomical imaging with head MRA can be performed to assess superficial cranial arteries (Figure 4).

### Febrile abdominal pain revealing horton's disease [^115u12Ro]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Horton's disease is a systemic inflammatory vasculitis, usually found in persons over 50years old. It affects medium and large-sized arteries stemming from the external carotid, especially the superficial temporal arteries. It can affect extracranial large vessels but only rarely the aorta. Diagnosis of aortitis is difficult and its incidence is probably underestimated.

Case Presentation

A 68-year-old Caucasian woman consulted in an emergency department for febrile abdominal pain with inflammatory syndrome. Abdomen was soft with right-side flank sensitivity. A contrast-enhanced CT scan showed aortitis from the descending aorta to the iliac arteries without complication. Because of age, clinical presentation and aortitis, Horton disease was suspected. The temporal artery biopsy showed a histological aspect of degenerative endarteritis with intimal thickening and luminal stenosis. High-dose corticosteroid therapy was introduced which improved clinical conditions and resulted in the amendment of the pain.

Discussion

In the present case, this patient had Horton's disease, based on 3 criteria of The American College of Rheumatology (age, temporal artery abnormalities and inflammatory syndrome) associated with aortitis. However, aortitis is a rare complication of Horton disease and is a major cause of mortality inasmuch as it can be complicated by aneurysm and dissection. It is unusual to diagnose Horton's disease from aortitis symptoms without complications. The aorta represents the most severe localization of Horton's disease. It should not be ignored in etiological hypotheses regarding febrile abdominal pain in the elderly. Corticosteroids should be started rapidly at high doses and temporal artery biopsy should be planned.

### Three-dimensional evaluation of superficial temporal artery and its terminal branches: implications for clinical practice [^116kuj95]. Head & Neck (2025). Medium credibility.

STA is also of great importance in the field of neurosurgery, as it is a frequently preferred vessel in extracranial‐intracranial (EC‐IC) bypass surgery, which is vital in the revascularization of cerebral ischemia due to any reason.

In addition, although biopsy from the parietal branch instead of the frontal branch is recommended in the literature as the gold standard method for diagnosing giant cell arteritis to prevent injury to the facial nerve, biopsy from the frontal branch is still widely preferred over the biopsy from the parietal branch, due to the difficulty in detecting the location of the parietal branch and the lack of data on its sensitivity and specificity. To reduce the risk of possible complications during the incision phase in this region, data on the course and depth of the frontal branch and its two‐dimensional (2D) and three‐dimensional (3D) relationship with the temporal branches are needed.

In view of the foregoing, the objective of this study is to examine the anatomical variations of the STA and its terminal branches, that is, frontal and parietal, which are located in the temporal region and are known to be clinically significant, and to help identify dangerous zones that may be encountered by detailing their 2D and 3D anatomies according to specific reference points, and thus to ensure the safe performance of invasive procedures.

Cohort 2 study participants

The Temporal Artery Biopsy Versus Ultrasound in Diagnosis of GCA (TABUL) was an international, multicenter, prospective study that compared the sensitivity and specificity of temporal artery ultrasound to biopsy in 381 patients with suspected C‐GCA(identifier: NCT00974883). Reference diagnosis of C‐GCA or Not C‐GCA at six months was based on a combination of baseline signs and symptoms, blood tests, TAB, fulfillment of ACR 1990 GCA classification criteria, clinical course during the follow‐up period, final consultant diagnoses, and verification by an expert review panel, as described previously.

Cranial ischemic complications were defined as permanent ocular or nonocular conditions at presentation. Ocular complications included the following: anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, branch retinal artery occlusion, cilioretinal artery occlusion, cranial nerve palsy (third, fourth, or fifth), central retinal artery occlusion, posterior ischemic optic neuropathy, relative afferent pupillary defect, irreversible visual loss, irreversible visual field defect, irreversible ocular motility or irreversible diplopia. Nonocular cranial complications included the following: scalp necrosis, tongue necrosis, and cerebrovascular accident at presentation considered secondary to GCA. Polymyalgic symptoms at presentation are also reported but do not represent a confirmed diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR).

Citrated blood samples were collected as soon as feasible after starting glucocorticoid treatment (median 2 days, interquartile range [IQR] 1–4 days) and were centrifuged at 2,500 g for 15 minutes within 1.5 hours of collection, and plasma was stored at −80°C until use. Because of funding constraints and biosample availability, we performed Olink proteomic assays on 239 patient samples of the 381 patients recruited to TABUL. We included all available samples from patients with a diagnosis of C‐GCA. We selected a subset of sex‐ and age‐ (± 5 years) matched patients without C‐GCA such that the ratio of C‐GCA to Not C‐GCA was approximately 2:1. As part of the study design, we selected an equal proportion of patients with cranial ischemic complications in the Not C‐GCA group as in the C‐GCA group. Overall study approval was granted by the Berkshire Research Ethics Committee (09/H0505/132), and approval was also granted at local participating clinical sites.

### Validating the clinical value of temporal artery biopsy [^113DgYjn]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a potentially devastating disease that may require treatment with high-dose steroids. Traditionally, diagnosis requires patients to meet at least 3 of 5 clinical criteria, one of which is a positive temporal artery biopsy (TAB). Vascular surgeons are often asked to perform TAB though it is not necessarily required for diagnosis or management. This study aimed to determine if TAB results altered management of patients with a concern for GCA by changing steroid use postoperatively in our health care system.

Methods

A retrospective review at a single-center tertiary care hospital was performed between 2007 and 2018. The inclusion criteria were patients greater than 18 years old with complete steroid treatment records who underwent a temporal artery biopsy due to concern for GCA. Steroid use and duration of treatment both pre- and post-operative were collected and analyzed.

Results

Eighty-three of 117 cases reviewed met inclusion criteria. Ninety-one percent (76) of patients had a negative biopsy. Twenty-nine percent (23) of negative biopsies met criteria for GCA prior to biopsy. Of those with a negative biopsy, steroids were continued in 68% (52) of patients after 30 days, 49% (37) after 90 days and 45% (34) after 180 days. Steroids were never started in 11% (6). One patient with a positive biopsy was discontinued on steroids due to intolerance. There was no statistically significant difference in duration of steroids between those with a positive and negative biopsy (average 610 and 787 days respectively; P = 0.682). Average follow up was 33 months.

Discussion

The duration of steroid use for patients with concern for GCA was not found to be altered by the performance of a TAB at our institution. Given the extremely low yield and absence of impact on steroid duration, TAB is not a useful diagnostic test at our institution. Similar reviews are recommended to determine the utility of TAB at other institutions that may differ in patient population or prescribing practices.

### Giant cell arteritis: is the clinical spectrum of the disease changing? [^1117mPZd]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Isolated extra-cranial GCA represents a diagnostic challenge since signs and symptoms may be nonspecific (fever, fatigue, weight loss) unless local ischemic manifestations appear. A significant proportion of patients with ischemic features attributed to atherosclerosis or embolic origin could represent an extra-cranial form of this vasculitis, particularly when cardiovascular risk factors are scarce or absent. In addition, laboratory inflammatory markers tend to be lower in this group of patients. This difficulty in diagnosis often leads to a greater diagnostic delay compared with patients suffering typical cranial symptoms. Interestingly, patients with predominant large-vessel-vasculitis pattern are younger and have more commonly PMR features and longer duration of symptoms at GCA diagnosis than those with predominant cranial manifestations. Moreover, the frequency of a positive temporal artery biopsy in these is much lower than in those with the classic pattern of GCA. Because of that, in these patients the diagnosis must often be relied on large-vessel inflammatory signs on imaging tests, as retrieval of arterial specimens in other territories entails significant morbidity.

Current diagnostic tools and diagnostic challenges

Although temporal artery biopsy is considered by many clinicians as the gold-standard for the diagnosis of GCA, focal or segmental inflammatory changes and technical pitfalls of the procedure make it difficult to confirm this condition in a significant proportion of patients. Diagnostic yield of biopsy varies greatly depending on the length of the excised specimen and whether it is performed unilaterally or bilaterally. The traditional recommendation was to obtain an arterial sample of at least 2–3 cm of length, although more recent studies consider that 1 cm could be enough for histologic diagnosis.

Some authors have designed predictive models as an aid to select those patients with higher probability of having GCA, but it should be kept in mind that these calculators do not take into account those cases of GCA with a negative biopsy result.

### Temporal artery biopsy: time for a rethink on training? [^11479dBJ]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Other authors have previously described a technique for harvesting the parietal branch, rather than the frontal branch, of the temporal artery. This can successfully be achieved by adapting the Gilles technique and making a temporal incision 2.5 cm superior and anterior to the helix of the ear (Fig. 2C incision B). The sensitivity of harvesting the parietal branch of the temporal artery rather than the frontal branch has not been fully validated. However, recent interest in using ultrasound to diagnose GCA has demonstrated involvement of the parietal branch and it is now routinely included when scanning patients for suspected GCA suggesting that it is reasonable to use this branch.

In this study we investigated current training techniques, anatomical knowledge and practice in TAB to establish current practice.

### Impact of temporal artery biopsy on clinical management of suspected giant cell arteritis [^1156F7iU]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Temporal arteritis (TA) is a systemic inflammatory vasculitis of unclear etiology that affects medium-sized vessels. The gold standard for diagnosis has traditionally been histological, by temporal artery biopsy. Improved imaging modalities have been increasingly used to aid diagnosis and are recommended in the newest 2018 European (EULAR) guidelines. 1 We hypothesize that a negative TA biopsy result does not change management in patients for whom TA is strongly suspected and that duplex ultrasound can be successfully used as a screening tool.

Methods

This is a retrospective review of patients who underwent TA biopsy between May 1, 2012 and June 1, 2017. We reviewed patient's demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, histology, and treatment. We also present a small series of patients for whom ultrasound of the bilateral temporal arteries was performed. Radiology and pathology reports on these 7 patients were reviewed.

Results

A total of 264 patients underwent temporal artery biopsies over the study period. Histology was positive in 21 (8.0%) and negative in 243 (92%) patients. In 74 (41%) patients with negative biopsies on steroids preoperatively, steroids were continued despite negative biopsy result. In prospective series, 7 patients underwent duplex ultrasound evaluation before scheduling for biopsy. Biopsy followed ultrasound in 4 cases, and in all 4 cases, histology was congruent with ultrasound findings.

Conclusions

The yield of temporal artery biopsy is low, and a negative biopsy alone often does not lead to termination of steroid therapy. Ultrasound may present a viable diagnostic tool to reduce the number of unnecessary temporal artery biopsies performed.

### Systematic literature review informing the 2018 update of the EULAR recommendation for the management of large vessel vasculitis: focus on giant cell arteritis [^113ggUJp]. RMD Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

The SLR focused on diagnosis and monitoring of all types of LVVs yielded 4389 articles and the one focused on treatment yielded 6226 articles (after removal of duplicates). One hundred and twenty-two and 165 studies, respectively, were finally included for full-text review. Of these, 62 and 76 studies, respectively, focused on GCA. Details are described in the online supplementary file 1. A meta-analysis of the collected evidence was not performed due to pronounced heterogeneity of the included studies in terms of design, inclusion criteria, methodology, type of intervention and outcome.

General management and diagnosis

Disease patterns of GCA

Standardised definitions for different disease patterns are lacking, leading to difficulties in comparability between studies. Nevertheless, 12 papers focusing on disease subtypes in GCA and on their clinical and prognostic implications were retrieved. Patients with large vessel GCA (LV-GCA) are more likely to be youngerand femaleand suffer from a longer diagnostic delaycompared with those with exclusively cranial involvement. Headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness and visual complications are less frequent, as opposed to a higher frequency of limb claudication and symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). Relapse rates have been reported to be higher in LV-GCA (4.9 vs 3.0/10 person-years; p < 0.001)with discordant results on the need for more intensive immunosuppressive regimens.LV involvement with aortic aneurysm/dissection is associated with increased mortality in GCA.

In summary, disease patterns of GCA are mainly represented by cranial and LV-GCA. This distinction may have clinical and prognostic implications (LoE 3b).

Fast-track clinics for the diagnosis of GCA

There were two retrospective cohort studies (total number of patients n = 189) comparing conventional clinical practice to a fast-track approach (FTA) integrating clinical evaluation with ultrasonographic assessment of the temporal (TA) and axillary arteries (table 2). Compared with historical cohorts, the FTA has been associated with a significant reduction in the rates of visual loss, inpatients costsand need for temporal artery biopsy (TAB)(LoE 2b).

### The spectrum of giant cell arteritis through a rheumatology lens [^115fqEpb]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

The observation that patients with prior ischaemic visual symptoms are at greater risk of future visual loss has led to the concept of clinical "phenotypes" of GCA, which can help stratify urgency of initial treatment by diagnostic certainty and presence of ischaemic symptoms. Strongly-suspected cranial GCA with ischaemic (especially visual) symptoms requires immediate treatment without even waiting for blood test results. A more diagnostically-ambiguous case of suspected GCA, in the absence of any ischaemic visual, jaw or tongue symptoms, might be better to defer glucocorticoid treatment until reviewed by a specialist, and/or until blood results are back, and/or until vascular ultrasound can be done the next working day. "GCA phenotypes", in terms of presence of ischaemia in different vascular territories, does not necessarily imply different molecular pathways, but might be simply anatomical "bad luck" (e.g. inter-individual variations in posterior ciliary artery anatomy). Furthermore, the idea of "phenotypes" should not be taken to indicate stable and unchanging disease subtypes, as the extent of vascular involvement can evolve over the course of the disease.

How do glucocorticoids work in the acute setting?

The histopathology of GCA is familiar from examination of temporal artery biopsy specimens stained with haematoxylin and eosin. On stained sections, the lumen may appear partially or totally occluded by gross hyperplasia of the intimal layer. It has been pointed out that it appears unlikely that even high-dose glucocorticoids could induce regression of intimal hyperplasia during the first few days of treatment, leading to the value of intravenous glucocorticoid therapy being questioned. Small studies reported an association between the degree of intimal hyperplasia and neuro-ophthalmic visual complications of GCA, but larger studies failed to replicate this association.

After surgical excision, the temporal artery shrinks in size so the appearance of tissue structures on the stained biopsy specimen is not necessarily an exact reflection of how the structure is in vivo. Serial ultrasound studies show that initial oral or intravenous glucocorticoids produce a rapid reduction in size of the temporal artery halo (but little change in the measured dimensions of the intimal-medial complex of the axillary artery), followed by a rebound increase after glucocorticoid cessation. This suggests that, for GCA, the acute action of glucocorticoid is primarily in reducing local inflammatory oedema, thus improving tissue perfusion. This leads to questions about the most appropriate route of administration.

### Identification of herpes zoster-associated temporal arteritis among cases of giant cell Arteritis [^116fT4gD]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is an inflammatory process usually involving the temporal artery. – The most feared complication is blindness secondary to inflammation in the nearby posterior ciliary arteries with subsequent ischemic optic neuropathy.GCA predominantly affects people over the age of 55 years, women more than men. In one epidemiologic analysis carried out in the United Kingdom, the prevalence of GCA was estimated to be 250 per 100 000 individuals 55 years and over. The etiology of GCA remains obscure, although the disease is often linked with polymyalgia rheumatic. There appears to be a genetic component because GCA is reported to be more common in individuals of Northern European than Southern European ancestry, although this point has been questioned.

The pathogenesis of GCA is considered to be a vasculitis of the superficial temporal arteries secondary to an inflammatory process against an as-yet-unknown antigen or set of antigens. Other arteries of the head and neck may also be involved. The disease was once called Horton's disease. The temporal arteries are innervated by branches of autonomic ganglia and the trigeminal ganglia. All of these ganglia can contain latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Because the trigeminal ganglion is the single most common site of clinical herpes zoster (shingles), causing herpes zoster ophthalmicus, the question has arisen whether GCA is a vasculitis driven by deposition of herpes zoster antigen in the temporal artery. A recent analysis found herpes zoster antigen in 74% of temporal artery biopsies obtained from patients with previously diagnosed GCA. Because of that extremely high value, we sought to determine whether temporal artery biopsies for GCA from our 2 institutions had a similarly high rate of positivity for herpes zoster antigen.

Role of TAB in GCA

The SLR retrieved 13 retrospective observational cohort papersand only three prospective studies, focusing on the diagnostic role of TAB and on the associated clinical features. The data showed the importance of performing TAB as soon as possible, since in one large study including 381 patients sensitivity decreased rapidly with high dose of GC treatment (48% within 3 days vs 33% ≥ 7 days). Nevertheless, another study on a large cohort of 535 consecutive patients had shown similar rates of TAB positivity regardless of previous GC treatment (31% in untreated patients vs 35% in patients exposed to GC before TAB; p = 0.4). The frequency of positive TABs reduced with ongoing GC therapy > 7 days but persisted in 28% of cases treated with GC for over 2 weeks. Interestingly, TABs were re-evaluated by a pathologist blinded to clinical and treatment information. Moreover, one small longitudinal pathological study (40 patients with initial positive TABs) has shown that vasculitis may still be demonstrated on repeated biopsies obtained after 3 (n = 10), 6 (n = 12), 9 (n = 9) or 12 months (n = 9) of GC therapy but with decreasing probability: 70% at 3 months, 75% at 6 months, 44% at 9 and 12 months, respectively.

The recently published study on the Role of Ultrasound compared with Biopsy of Temporal Arteries in the Diagnosis and Treatment of GCA (TABUL) has reported a TAB sensitivity against clinical diagnosis of 39%, with 100% specificity. Assessing the diagnostic performance of TAB has some limitations in GCA since an absolute reference standard for diagnosis is still lacking. The reference clinical diagnosis used in TABUL incorporated TAB results as part of ACR criteria, but also clinician's final diagnosis, emergence of complications consistent with GCA during follow-up or the emergence of alternative diagnosis and the validation by an expert review panel.

The length of TAB is crucial for optimising diagnostic performance. The cut-off with the highest positive predictive value for a positive TAB has been reported to be ≥ 0.7 cm after specimen fixation. A single retrospective multicentre study has suggested that in the presence of inflammatory infiltrate involving the media and media–intima junction (excluding lymphocyte infiltration isolated to the adventitial or periadventitial tissue) the cut-off to optimise sensitivity for an histological confirmation of GCA should be ≥ 0.5 cm.

### Temporal artery biopsy: time for a rethink on training? [^116E42KG]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

From the perspective of future practice, the use of informal teaching can lead to surgical procedures being influenced by the teaching surgeons' personal preferences. This can result in less room to propose safer alternatives to a surgical technique. A safer approach to TAB would be to harvest the parietal branch of the superficial temporal artery, effectively eliminating the risk of damage to the facial nerve. This has previously been discussed by other authors, yet this technique is seldom used by ophthalmologists. The artery can be located and marked by following pulsations from the tragus, after removing a small amount of hair. A handheld doppler can also be used to confirm the course of the artery if required. Subsequently, TAB can be performed as normal.

While many trainees are performing temporal artery biopsies before their final year, with some performing greater than twenty biopsies, the majority of respondents indicated that they would make their initial incision within the 'danger zone'. This would suggest that the teaching received by trainees lacks emphasis on the 'danger zone' as an anatomical region that should be avoided where possible. Therefore, we propose mapping the 'danger zone' during preoperative planning of TAB and avoiding the 'danger zone' when performing temporal artery biopsy.

Our survey reveals that the majority of trainees are aware of the anatomical 'danger zone', however less than one-fifth of respondents are aware of Pitanguy's line. The concept of Pitanguy's line does have its limitations, as the most at-risk temporal branch of the facial nerve typically has multiple rami crossing the zygomatic arch. However, marking it out preoperatively can help the surgeon to delineate a definite 'no go' zone (Fig. 2D) within the danger area that should be avoided, with increasing safety the more superior and lateral the incision point.

There are some limitations to this study. A primary limitation is the generalisation of these results. This is because the survey was distributed to a limited number of deaneries and in addition not all trainees responded. Furthermore, we received a number of incomplete surveys which were excluded from the analysis. Nonetheless, our study provides an insight into how trainees are being taught to perform a TAB and assists in evoking discussion regarding how training can be made safer.

### Management of the patient with suspected temporal arteritis a decision-analytic approach [^114UVzQP]. Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To perform a decision analysis of temporal arteritis (TA) to guide clinicians in the interpretation of diagnostic testing and choice of therapy.

Design

Computer-based decision analytic model.

Methods

A 785-node decision tree was created that reflects common testing and therapeutic options for a patient with suspected TA. A comprehensive literature search was then performed. From this search, point estimates and distributions for pooled probabilities and utilities were derived using inverse variance weighting and random effects techniques. Employing utility analysis, this decision model selects the diagnostic/therapeutic pathway resulting in the greatest utility for any user-defined set of patient characteristics on presentation.

Main Outcome Measure

Using utility analysis, the diagnostic/therapeutic pathway that results in the least expected disutility is selected as the optimal course of action.

Results

The choice of diagnostic testing depends on several factors, including patient age, symptoms, and clinical findings. These factors can be used to calculate the pretest probability of TA being present. The optimal selection of diagnostic tests (laboratory or biopsy) depends on the pretest probability of disease. A temporal artery biopsy is recommended under most circumstances, with the choice of a unilateral versus bilateral biopsy depending upon blood test results and calculated pretest probability. A few scenarios exist in which blood tests alone can rule in or rule out TA without the need for biopsy. Empiric steroid therapy is almost never recommended.

Conclusions

In TA, both the disease and its treatment are hazardous for the patient. Clinicians should have a very low threshold to initiate a diagnostic workup for TA. Physicians are often uncertain when a temporal artery biopsy is indicated and whether to perform a unilateral or bilateral biopsy. Often, the pathway chosen is not evidence based. Although the biopsy has long been considered the gold standard for diagnosis, it is invasive and less than 100% sensitive. The decision whether to undertake unilateral or bilateral biopsies is difficult, and our decision model delineates a method for choosing.

### 2021 American College of Rheumatology / vasculitis foundation guideline for the management of giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis [^113yh3vY]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Guideline discussion — diagnostic and treatment preferences and evidence context in giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu arteritis (TAK): overarching themes include the preference, in the US, for temporal artery biopsy over cranial imaging studies for the diagnosis of GCA, the use of large vessel imaging for GCA and TAK for diagnosis and disease monitoring, and limiting glucocorticoid exposure in order to minimize toxicity. Almost all recommendations are conditional due to low-quality evidence. EULAR indicates that the diagnosis of GCA may be made with a positive imaging test without additional testing such as temporal artery biopsy, but in the US there is limited experience with these modalities and the guideline continues to recommend temporal artery biopsy as the diagnostic test of choice at this time. In contrast to EULAR, the guideline favors initial treatment of GCA with glucocorticoids and a glucocorticoid-sparing agent. Key knowledge gaps include that the optimal duration of therapy and how best to monitor disease status is unknown, accurate and validated indicators of disease activity have not been established or widely used for GCA or TAK, and the clinical significance of persistent vascular wall inflammation during clinically quiescent disease is unclear; therefore, additional research into the management of GCA and TAK is encouraged.

### Imaging in diagnosis, outcome prediction and monitoring of large vessel vasculitis: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis informing the EULAR recommendations [^112wESBQ]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Large vessel vasculitis (LVV) is the most common form of primary vasculitis comprising (cranial and large vessel (LV)) giant cell arteritis (GCA), Takayasu arteritis (TAK) and idiopathic aortitis. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of LVV are important to prevent serious ischaemic complications such as visual loss in GCA, vascular stenosis/occlusion in TAK and aneurysm formation in idiopathic aortitis. Temporal artery biopsy (TAB) has been the standard test to confirm the diagnosis of GCA; although highly specific, biopsy is invasive and lacks sensitivity, with false-negative results in up to 61% of patients compared with a clinical diagnosis of GCA. In addition, extracranial arteries are usually not accessible for histological assessment, and in extracranial LV-GCA, temporal arteries are spared in up to 40% of patients. Consequently, GCA diagnosis often relies on the combination of clinical symptoms, elevated serum inflammatory markers and imaging findings.

The classification criteria for TAK focus on the detection of arterial stenosis and occlusions as detected by conventional angiography. Conventional angiography, however, does not allow the delineation of vessel wall changes and bears the potential risk of complications, such as allergic reactions, haematoma, iatrogenic embolisation and arterial dissection. Therefore, angiography is being increasingly replaced by newer imaging modalities.

Aortitis is common in GCA and TAK but rarely occurs as an isolated (idiopathic) disease. The diagnosis of idiopathic aortitis is frequently based on radiological findings with inflammatory wall changes of the aorta because histological assessment is only possible if aortic aneurysms are operated.

The role of imaging modalities including ultrasound (US), MRI, CT and 18 F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET) in LVV has been addressed in several studies over the last years. Imaging modalities, however, are not yet uniformly used for the diagnosis and monitoring of LVV in clinical practice. A European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) project has therefore been undertaken to develop recommendations for the use of imaging in LVV in clinical practice.

The aim of this systematic literature review (SLR) was to summarise the available evidence on the performance of imaging techniques on diagnosis, outcome prediction and monitoring of disease activity and damage in LVV, as well as technical aspects of imaging modalities in order to inform the EULAR task force developing these new recommendations.

### Is temporal artery biopsy essential in all cases of suspected giant cell arteritis? [^116rLJT1]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Temporal artery biopsy (TAB) is performed in cases of suspected giant cell arteritis (GCA), and is the gold-standard for diagnosis of the disease. Current American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria may aid in the diagnosis of GCA. We aimed to assess whether TAB is essential in all cases of suspected GCA, or whether ACR criteria can replace the need for this procedure in some cases.

Methods

Retrospective analysis of 216 patients who underwent TAB in a single hospital between 2000 and 2013. Pre-TAB and post-TAB ACR criteria were calculated. Sensitivity and specificity of ACR criteria for the diagnosis of GCA were assessed.

Results

Overall, 55 patients had histological evidence of GCA. Out of 161 patients with negative TAB findings, 34 were diagnosed with GCA, and 127 were not diagnosed with GCA. Sensitivity of TAB for the diagnosis of GCA was 61.7%. Sensitivity and specificity of ACR criteria for diagnosis of GCA before performing TAB were 68.5% and 58%, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of ACR criteria after performing TAB biopsy were 89.8% and 64.5%, respectively.

Conclusions

Temporal artery biopsy should be performed in the majority of patients with suspected GCA, and may be obviated only in patients with a pre-TAB ACR score of ≤ 1. In all other cases, when GCA is suspected, ACR criteria should not be a substitute to TAB, as they are not highly specific.

### The spectrum of giant cell arteritis through a rheumatology lens [^112jGNjP]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Tests to confirm GCA

Temporal artery biopsy confirms a pathological diagnosis of GCA; since GCA was originally defined as a pathological construct, a positive biopsy by definition has high face validity as a method for confirming GCA. Pathologists now consider various histological features as consistent with active arteritis. "Healed arteritis" as described by the autopsy studies of Gilmour and Ostberg can sometimes be identified in patients with chronic long-standing disease, but the inflammatory infiltrate may persist even after one year of glucocorticoid treatment for GCA. Therefore, contrary to popular teaching, it is rarely "too late" for a temporal artery biopsy.

"Skip lesions" arise because vasculitis of the smaller arteries in GCA often has a multifocal pattern and the biopsy may miss the involved segment of artery. Thus, a negative temporal artery biopsy, although it makes GCA less likely, does not entirely exclude the disease. This can lead to reluctance of clinicians to stop glucocorticoid therapy. In one retrospective study, of 129 temporal artery biopsies, 17 were reported as positive, 10 samples insufficient and 102 biopsies were negative; but only 8 of these 102 had their glucocorticoid therapy stopped immediately.

To rheumatologists, a negative temporal artery biopsy still gives valuable information, even though it cannot entirely rule out GCA. It has been estimated that a negative temporal artery biopsy would downgrade the odds that the patient truly has GCA to around 12% of the pre-test odds (i.e. negative likelihood ratio: 0.12). Nonetheless, absolutely "ruling out" GCA in treated patients can be very difficult. Pragmatic management of "biopsy-negative GCA" may involve rapid glucocorticoid taper with close follow-up as a safety-net in case the biopsy might have missed genuine GCA. In the era before widespread availability of rapid-access vascular imaging for GCA, up to two-thirds of "biopsy-negative GCA cases" may have been overdiagnosed. Updated recommendations on vascular imaging for GCA have recently been published underpinned by a systematic literature review and so imaging is discussed only briefly here.

### Stroke as an atypical initial presentation of giant cell arteritis [^113D8AtP]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

A comprehensive but not systematic review of the literature found that people with the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis were at higher risk for the subsequent development of stroke. A review by Napoli postulated a causal link between the increased production of CRP in an inflammatory condition such as GCA and the development of stroke. To our knowledge this is the first case where the initial presentation of GCA is a posterior cerebral circulation stroke syndrome. Other case reports of atypical presentations of GCA are rare. One case described a patient over 50 years of age who presented with a 2-month history of chronic cough and fever of unknown origin with an elevated ESR, which was confirmed to be GCA by temporal artery biopsy. Approximately 10% of GCA patients have upper respiratory tract infection symptoms. Other respiratory symptoms that could present in GCA are sore throat and hoarseness. The patient described in our case did present with a fever but had no respiratory symptoms. He was treated for a possible pneumonia because of the chest radiograph findings.

An atypical presentation of GCA could delay diagnosis and treatment and therefore increase the risk for complications specifically irreversible vision loss. There can be a variety of symptoms that can be present in GCA, however in most cases the ESR will be persistently elevated. High clinical suspicion should always drive decision-making since diagnostic testing have their limitations. The sensitivity of an elevated ESR is 84% and CRP is 87% and both have a specificity of 30%. Temporal artery biopsy has a reported sensitivity of 70 to greater than 90% which still leaves a small number of patients with GCA who have biopsy-negative results. One study reported that combining ESR and CRP results generated a specificity of 97% for GCA. Imaging to detect arterial inflammation by positron emission tomography as suggested by a recent systematic review and meta-analysis may be helpful, although the accessibility of this specialized technique would limit its general use.

### Giant cell arteritis: reviewing the advancing diagnostics and management [^116aANW1]. Eye (2023). Medium credibility.

Temporal artery examination

Clinical examination of the temporal arteries by palpation is a critical assessment. Signs of abnormality include absent or diminished pulses, tenderness or a hard "cord-like" structure. Temporal artery biopsy (TAB) has long been held as the "gold-standard" investigation for GCA due to its ability to provide a histopathological tissue diagnosis, with reported specificities as high as 100%. To estimate the sensitivity of unilateral TAB for the diagnosis of GCA a meta-analysis based on a large sample size found the sensitivity to be 77%. There are a number of reasons for the reduced sensitivity including inadequate sample length, incorrect tissue sampled and the initiation of steroids prior to biopsy. Another widely known factor limiting the sensitivity of TAB is the presence of skip lesions in GCA. Skip lesions are estimated to be present in 8–26% of cases and therefore risk false negative results if biopsies are sampled from spared segments of arteries. To improve the sensitivity of detecting GCA some clinicians have advocated bilateral simultaneous TABs. However there has been a wide range of discordance rates between 3% to 45% found in people undergoing bilateral simultaneous TABs. One option, where frozen section is available, is to perform a unilateral biopsy and if this is positive on frozen section it avoids the contralateral biopsy. The practice of performing bilateral simultaneous TAB versus unilateral TAB is known to be different worldwide. Ophthalmologists can be asked to perform TAB in a person without cranial symptoms and a clinically relevant finding is that a tertiary cohort study found that only 52% of patients with LV-GCA had positive TAB results, making the investigation relatively biased towards C-GCA.

### Biopsy vs imaging in the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis. viewpoint 1: in favour of imaging [^11758Q6G]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Both imaging and temporal artery biopsy (TAB) are utilized to confirm a suspected diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA). What are the advantages of imaging over TAB?

Methods

This article is based on a debate presented at the 21st Vasculitis Meeting, discussing whether imaging or TAB with histology should be the primary diagnostic method for suspected GCA.

Results

A suspected diagnosis of GCA should be confirmed or excluded either through imaging or histology. The author advocates for imaging, particularly US, as the initial diagnostic test, in line with EULAR recommendations. Alternatives to US include MRI, CT, and PET, mostly performed in conjunction with CT. Imaging is non-invasive, reliable, sensitive also to extracranial GCA, and specific. Particularly, US is widely available, cost-effective, and patient-friendly. Rheumatologists can perform it promptly during clinical history taking and examination. The introduction of Fast-Track Clinics providing rapid access to specialist care and US has reduced instances of permanent vision loss. The clinical presentation and imaging findings must be conclusive; otherwise, a second diagnostic test should be conducted. This could be another imaging test, such as PET for suspected extracranial GCA, or TAB for suspected cranial GCA. Importantly, the diagnostic process should not delay the initiation of glucocorticoid treatment in suspected GCA cases.

Conclusion

A suspected diagnosis of GCA should be confirmed or excluded via imaging or TAB. Imaging, particularly US, offers several advantages over TAB as the initial diagnostic test.

### Age-related histopathological findings in temporal arteries [^113GJQ8q]. Histopathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a systemic vasculitis affecting medium and large arteries in patients aged over 50years. Involvement of temporal arteries (TA) can lead to complications such as blindness and stroke. While the diagnostic gold standard is temporal artery biopsy (TAB), comorbidities and age-related changes can make interpretation of such specimens difficult. This study aims to establish a baseline of TA changes in subjects without GCA to facilitate the interpretation of TAB.

Methods and Results

Bilateral TA specimens were collected from 100 consecutive eligible postmortem examinations. Subjects were divided into four age groups and specimens semiquantitatively evaluated for eccentric intimal fibroplasia, disruption and calcification of the internal elastic lamina (IEL), medial attenuation and degree of lymphocytic inflammation of the peri-adventitia, adventitia, media and intima. The individual scores of intimal fibroplasia, IEL disruption and medial attenuation were added to yield a 'combined score (CS)'. Seventy-eight 78 decedents were included in the final analysis following exclusion of 22 individuals for either lack of clinical information or inability to collect TA tissue. A total of 128 temporal artery specimens (50 bilateral from individual decedents, 28 unilateral) were available for examination. Intimal proliferation, IEL loss, IEL calcification and CS increased with age in a statistically significant fashion. Comparison of the oldest age group with the others showed statistically significant differences, although this was not uniformly preserved in comparison between the three youngest groups.

Conclusion

Senescent arterial changes and healed GCA exhibit histological similarity and such changes increase proportionally with age. The CS demonstrates significant association with age overall and represents a potential avenue for development to 'normalise' TA biopsies from older individuals.

### Giant cells in temporal artery biopsies and the risk of large-vessel involvement in patients with giant cell arteritis [^115qUFkY]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a systemic disease with variable vascular involvement. The objective was to investigate predictors of time-dependent large vessel involvement (LVI) in a population-based cohort of patients with GCA.

Methods

GCA patients with positive temporal artery biopsies (TAB) between 1997–2010 were identified through a regional pathology register. A structured review of histopathology reports and relevant imaging studies was performed. Cases with LVI through July 2016 were identified. Patients were followed to first LVI, death, migration from the area or July 29, 2016. Event free survival by clinical and histopathologic features was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Potential predictors of LVI were examined using Cox regression models.

Results

A total of 274 patients were included. The mean age at GCA diagnosis was 75.7 years. Fifty-one patients (19%) had documented LVI during the follow-up, corresponding to an incidence rate of 2.4/100 person-years. The median time from GCA diagnosis to the diagnosis of LVI was 4.5 years (interquartile range 0.6–7.4). Thirty-four patients had aortic involvement (67% of those with LVI; 12% of all GCA cases). Survival free of LVI was longer in patients with giant cells in the TAB (75th percentile 14.0 vs 6.7 years; p = 0.014). In age-adjusted analysis, the presence of giant cells in the TAB was associated with reduced risk of LVI (hazard ratio 0.48; 95% confidence interval 0.27–0.86).

Conclusions

The negative association with giant cells in the TAB suggests that patients with LVI constitute a subset of GCA with particular disease mechanisms.

### Quantification of the role of temporal artery biopsy in diagnosing clinically suspected giant cell arteritis [^115ZEcd5]. Eye (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

(1) To see the effectiveness of applying the criteria laid down by the American college of Rheumatology in the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA). (2) To quantify the role of temporal artery biopsy (TAB) in diagnosing GCA using the Greenwich grading system.

Methods

A retrospective case notes review of consecutive patients undergoing TAB over 6 years, from 1995 to 2000, in a UK hospital eye unit was done. The American college of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for diagnosis of GCA were applied. A detailed analysis of age of onset, mode of presentation, laboratory findings and histology was done for all the patients. In an attempt to quantify the clinical value of TAB in patients with clinically suspected GCA, the Greenwich grading system was used. The role of TAB was graded as essential, important, helpful, unnecessary, and adverse effect.

Results

Out of the 53 patients who underwent TAB, 13 were found to have positive TAB, while 40 had negative biopsies. On application of the American College of Rheumatology criteria, 36 patients fulfilled the criteria required to make a diagnosis of GCA. Temporal headache, ESR > 50 mm/h and temporal artery tenderness were found to occur more often in patients with positive biopsy.

Conclusion

(1) The American College of Rheumatology criteria provide a framework in which the clinician can continually assess the need for TAB. (2) The Greenwich grading system, as applied in evaluating the role of TAB in the management of GCA, demonstrated the clinical usefulness of this invasive procedure in the majority of cases. It identified the patient groups that benefit the most from a TAB.

### Long delay from symptom onset to first consultation contributes to permanent vision loss in patients with giant cell arteritis: a cohort study [^114NLgCJ]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The clinical presentation of giant cell arteritis (GCA) is heterogeneous and includes constitutional and ischaemic symptoms. The most severe complication remains permanent vision loss (PVL), mainly caused by anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (AION) involving the posterior ciliary arteries or central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). Less often, blindness results from posterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (PION) or occipital lobe infarction. Before the advent of glucocorticoid therapy for GCA, PVL occurred in 40%–48%of cases and decreased to 10%–20% during the last decades, due to an increased awareness of GCA-associated complications and the accepted practice among general practitioners (GPs) to immediately start systemic glucocorticoids in case of suspected GCA. If left untreated, the risk for bilateral AION is high. Transient visual symptoms, age and lower blood levels of inflammatory markers are risk factors for impending vision loss. In contrast, polymyalgia and constitutional symptoms are associated with a reduced risk for PVL. In histopathological studies, PVL has been inconsistently associated with the presence of giant cells and higher intimal hyperplasia scores in temporal artery biopsy. Similarly, the detection of temporal arteritis by ultrasound has been associated with ocular ischaemia in some studies.

Early diagnosis of GCA and immediate administration of glucocorticoids are essential to effectively prevent PVL, as most ocular ischaemic events occur before treatment. However, once vision loss has occurred, it is usually permanent, and glucocorticoids are administered to preserve the remaining vision. The introduction of fast-track clinics, including ultrasound as a first-line diagnostic tool for early GCA diagnosis, intended to reduce the incidence of PVL even further compared with conventional clinical practice. In a recent study, a fast-track approach reduced PVL incidence by about 50%, but still, 12.7% experienced PVL. Obviously, patients can only be referred to fast-track clinics (1) if they consult their GPs for GCA-associated symptoms and (2) if their primary care physician suspects them of having GCA. The unspecific character of many GCA-associated symptoms may prevent patients from consulting with their GPs and result in misdiagnoses. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis reported a mean diagnostic delay between symptom onset and GCA diagnosis of 9 weeks. This study aimed to investigate the incidence and risk factors of PVL among patients with GCA treated at our centre during the last 15 years and to identify obstacles in the patient's pathway that may cause a delay in treatment initiation.

### Giant cell arteritis [^11273B7z]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA), the most common form of systemic vasculitis in adults, preferentially involves large and medium-sized arteries in patients over the age of 50. The classic manifestations are headache, jaw claudication, polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), and visual symptoms, but 40% of patients present with a wide range of occult manifestations. Early diagnosis and treatment with prednisone can prevent blindness, the most feared complication of GCA. The pathogenesis of GCA is T-cell dependent and antigen driven. Clinical subsets of GCA appear to result from variable cytokine expression. The risk of developing thoracic aortic aneurysm is increased more than 17-fold in patients with GCA. GCA can also involve large arteries, especially the subclavian and axillary arteries. Color Doppler ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron-emission tomography scanning are providing insights into the extent and pathogenesis of the disease but have not replaced temporal artery biopsy as the gold standard for securing the diagnosis. Two recently completed double-blind, placebo-controlled trials concerning whether methotrexate plus prednisone is more effective than prednisone alone reached conflicting conclusions.

### Demographic and laboratory data may predict positive temporal artery biopsy [^116f7KvB]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Temporal artery biopsy is performed in patients suspected of having giant cell arteritis. This study was conducted to evaluate clinical and laboratory criteria correlating with positive biopsy results in an effort to limit the number of negative biopsies performed.

Methods

A retrospective review was performed of patients who underwent temporal artery biopsy at two urban medical centers from 2002 to 2009. A multivariate analysis of patient demographics, clinically relevant signs and symptoms, laboratory data, and pathologic outcomes was performed.

Results

Temporal artery biopsy histologically confirmed giant cell arteritis in 24% of cases. The mean age of those with disease was 77.8 y and those without were 73.1 y; age was found to be statically significant (P = 0.0227); 76% were female and 24% were male; gender was not significant (P = 0.9594); 42% were Caucasian (39% had a positive temporal artery biopsy), 27% were Hispanic (17% positive), and 31% of the patients were African-American (3% positive); ethnicity was significant (P = 0.0005). The PPV of elevated ESR was 27%; sensitivity was 100%; specificity was 16%. A history of headache or visual disturbance was not predictive of a positive biopsy

Conclusion

Fewer negative biopsy results may be achieved by screening patients with normal ESR or lower risk patients with other modalities.

### Medial arterial calcification mimicking temporal arteritis [^117H6BbU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Medial arterial calcification, which has been increasingly recognized in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, has been associated with acutely symptomatic vascular complications including calcific uremic arteriolopathy (calciphylaxis) and ischemic changes in the extremities. This report describes a 50-year-old ESRD patient on maintenance hemodialysis in whom medial arterial calcification developed with features mimicking the findings of temporal arteritis. He complained of persistent bilateral temporal area headaches with associated symptoms of blurred vision; pain in his shoulders, hips, and knees; and intermittent symptoms consistent with jaw claudication. He was not receiving calcium or vitamin D supplements. Superficial temporal arteries were dilated, tortuous, nodular, and tender to palpation. Ophthalmologic examination was unremarkable, except for the presence of peripapillary atrophy. Temporal artery biopsy results showed medial arterial calcification with mild inflammatory changes. No giant cells were identified. Additional long-term complications of medial arterial calcification have included the development of painful ischemic ulceration of the glans penis and extensive mitral annulus calcification detected by echocardiography. The findings in this patient show that clinical manifestations of medial artery calcification associated with ESRD can mimic those seen with other vascular diseases.

### Giant cell arteritis presenting with arm claudication [^114h9V4g]. Age and Ageing (2001). Low credibility.

Case Report

A 72-year-old woman presented after a series of falls with a history of malaise, lethargy, cold hands and arm weakness for several months. She had undergone extensive investigation for what remained an unexplained anaemia during this period. Examination revealed cold hands with absent radial pulses. Axillary Doppler studies confirmed grossly diminished systolic pressures. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was markedly elevated. An arch aortogram showed obliterative changes selectively affecting the subclavian and axillary arteries. In spite of clinically normal temporal arteries, and the absence of headache, temporal artery biopsy revealed giant cell arteritis.

Discussion

Aortic arch syndrome is an important but under-appreciated complication of giant cell arteritis and may be the presenting feature. In this case, it resulted in falls consequent upon arm claudication when using a walking frame.

### Temporal arteritis presenting with facial swelling and a negative temporal artery biopsy [^1151dY6e]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A man in his 60s presented to the emergency department with marked bilateral preauricular swelling, associated with jaw claudication, temporal tenderness and blurred vision. He was immediately treated for temporal arteritis by commencing systemic corticosteroids. A temporal artery biopsy showed no evidence of vasculitis. However, positron emission tomography-CT demonstrated increased uptake in the medium-large vessels, including the left superficial temporal artery and aorta. This case illustrates that facial swelling may be an under-recognised presenting feature of temporal arteritis, and that a negative temporal artery biopsy does not always rule out a diagnosis of temporal arteritis, and should not delay treatment.

Peripheral arterial ultrasound — clinical indications are outlined, including monitoring of previous surgical interventions and percutaneous interventions; follow-up for progression of previously identified disease; evaluation of suspected vascular and perivascular abnormalities; mapping of arteries before surgical interventions; clarifying or confirming abnormalities identified by other imaging modalities; evaluation of arterial integrity in trauma; evaluation of patients suspected of thoracic outlet syndrome; Allen's test to establish patency of the palmar arch; and temporal artery evaluation for temporal arteritis and/or to localize temporal arterial biopsy for suspected temporal arteritis. Additional uses of Doppler ultrasound can include preoperative mapping for dialysis access and postoperative follow-up.

### Giant cell arteritis: the experience of two collaborative referral centers and an overview of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic advancements [^114chc4n]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Histologic analysis with TAB still remains the gold-standard diagnostic procedure in many rheumatologic centers. However, although it will be positive in the large majority of these patients, it is an invasive examination and a negative biopsy result does not exclude a diagnosis of GCA, given that the inflammatory process may spare some arteries or segments thereof. In addition, the TAB may sometimes be contraindicated for the risk of bleeding consequent to the frequent assumption of anti-platelet drugs by these elderly patients or to the occurrence of other coagulation disorders. Also, the TAB is obviously unable to allow the assessment and the extent of arterial involvement that may sometimes include large vessels, such as the aortic arch and its major branches.

CDUS provides reliable information as regards superficial arteries such as the temporal artery and to a lower extent the subclavian and axillary arteries. Because ultrasonographic data of temporal arteries do not correlate with eye complications, OCT or CDUS of the orbital (retrobulbar) vessels are of critical importance in order to quickly differentiate the mechanism of eye involvement (arteritic, versus non-arteritic). The arteritic conditions should be treated promptly to prevent further visual loss of the fellow eye. Although CDUS of orbital vessels is a faster method compared with OCT, it is much less reliable when extra-cranial deep vessels are suspected to be affected. In these situations, MRI, CT and FDG-PET/CT are being used with increasing frequency in the diagnosis and monitoring of cranial and extracranial arteries, including the aorta. Compared to TAB, these imaging modalities offer the advantage of being less invasive, more sensitive and readily available.

However, although these imaging techniques have questioned the diagnostic role of TAB, it is still debatable in the clinical practice which imaging tool is able to provide the most reliable assessments of disease extent and activity. The task force of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) has recommended that an early imaging test be performed in patients with suspected GCA, with ultrasound being the first choice and CT or FDG-PET/CT being possible alternatives. When clinical examination and imaging are still unable to allow a definite diagnosis, temporal artery biopsy and/or additional imaging may be necessary. Furthermore, in case of a suspected flare, disease activity can be better assessed with the use of imaging procedures, but the frequency and choice of imaging modalities in the follow-up of the patient are left to the individual referral center decision.

### Multimodality imaging to assess diagnosis and evaluate complications of large vesselarteritis [^115oXkGR]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

COMPLICATIONS IN LARGE VESSEL VASCULITIS

Blindness

Sudden visual loss is a feared complication of cGCA. A meta-analysis reported that 24% of patients may develop blindness due to GCA. In most cases, blindness develops due to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), caused by inflammation and occlusion of the posterior ciliar arteries, which are located downstream of the ophthalmic arteries. The visual loss in GCA usually responds poorly to urgent methylprednisolone pulse therapy, which is mainly intended to protect the contralateral eye from developing blindness. Prodromic episodes of transient visual loss and diplopia may precede the occurrence of permanent visual loss. Rarely, visual loss in GCA is caused by posterior cerebral ischemia related to vertebral artery involvement. It is important to discriminate between AION developing due to GCA (arteritic AION) and other causes of AION, mainly atherosclerosis (nonarteritic AION). In the presence of other potential symptoms of GCA (e.g. headache, increased C-reactive protein, thrombocytosis), a full clinical workup with imaging and/or temporal artery biopsy is needed in patients presenting with AION. Specific ophthalmic imaging methods, such as fundus fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography, can provide important information regarding the presence of vascular defects in the eye. MRI can be applied to demonstrate optic nerve inflammation and opthalmic artery involvement and to rule out alternative optic nerve pathologies causing visual loss.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) diagnostic modality selection: For patients with suspected GCA, we conditionally recommend temporal artery biopsy over temporal artery ultrasound for establishing a diagnosis of GCA. For patients with suspected GCA, we conditionally recommend temporal artery biopsy over MRI of the cranial arteries for establishing a diagnosis of GCA. In centers with appropriate training and expertise in using temporal artery ultrasound, ultrasound may be a useful and complementary tool for diagnosing GCA.

### Optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) represents a novel technique for the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis [^112QEB3x]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

What was known before

Giant cell arteritis is an inflammatory vascular disease that carries a risk of stroke, blindness and aortic aneurysm if not promptly treated.
Giant cell arteritis is notoriously challenging to diagnose.
Temporal artery biopsy is the most commonly used method for diagnosing giant cell arteritis but has significant drawbacks including a low sensitivity and the risk of surgical complications.

What this study adds

This study introduces optical frequency domain imaging as a potential diagnostic technique for diagnosing acute giant cell arteritis.
OFDI was able to detect histologically confirmed giant cell arteritis with promising sensitivity and specificity.

### Sensitivity of temporal artery biopsy in the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^111dkGvP]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Temporal artery biopsy (TAB) is a reference test for the diagnosis of GCA but reveals inflammatory changes only in a subset of patients. The lack of knowledge of TAB sensitivity hampers comparisons with non-invasive techniques such as temporal artery ultrasonography. We performed a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to estimate the sensitivity of TAB in GCA and to identify factors that may influence the estimate.

Methods

A systematic literature review involved searching electronic databases and cross-references. Eligibility criteria included publications reporting at least 30 GCA cases fulfilling the original or modified 1990 ACR classification criteria. The pooled proportion of TAB-positive GCA cases was calculated by using aggregated-data meta-analysis with a random-effects model and assessment of heterogeneity with the I2 statistic. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were used to examine the effect of patient and study characteristics on TAB positivity.

Results

Among 3820 publications screened, 32 studies (3092 patients) published during 1993–2017 were analysed. The pooled proportion of TAB-positive GCA cases was 77.3% (95% CI: 71.8, 81.9%), with high between-study heterogeneity (I2 = 90%). The proportion of TAB-positive cases was slightly higher in publications before than in 2012 and after (P = 0.001).

Conclusion

The estimated sensitivity of 77% provides indirect evidence that TAB is not less sensitive than temporal artery imaging. The unexplained high between-study heterogeneity could result from differences in TAB sampling, processing or interpretation. The decrease in TAB-positive GCA cases over time could reflect an increasing propensity for clinicians to accept a GCA diagnosis without proof by TAB.

### Evaluation of deeper levels in initially negative temporal artery biopsies and likelihood of a positive result [^111sgWgM]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Giant cell arteritis is a vasculitis that affects large- and medium-sized vessels in patients over the age of 50 years. The demonstration of granulomatous arteritis is the criterion standard to establish a definitive diagnosis. However, temporal arteritis is known to discontinuously involve the artery, and there is no standardization of the number of sections which should be examined in a length of sampled artery. The goal of the study is to determine, if by examining additional sections from temporal artery (TA) biopsy cases initially interpreted as negative, do we uncover cases of vasculitis. We conducted a retrospective review of the clinical and histologic features of 75 consecutive temporal artery biopsy cases. Our findings showed that the vast majority (94%) of cases that were biopsy "proven" to be negative for temporal arteritis on initial examination remained negative after examination of all subsequent deeper levels (median of 337 total levels examined). These cases were less likely to show classical GCA signs and symptoms and typically presented at a younger age than the biopsy-positive cases. However, 4 (6%) of the initially "biopsy-negative" cases did turn out to be positive on deeper levels, with 56, 109, 346, and 590 total levels examined, respectively. At least 2 of these 4 patients did not receive prednisone or were weaned off prednisone treatment and experienced persistent/recurrent GCA symptoms. We conclude that routine sampling may miss the diagnosis in a subset of cases and in some cases, sectioning deeper into the paraffin block may be warranted.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) — clinical features, diagnosis, and therapy are outlined as follows: GCA can present with both cranial and extracranial manifestations, with cranial manifestations including headaches, scalp tenderness, vision loss, and jaw claudication, and large vessel ("extracranial") involvement resulting in arterial stenosis and aneurysms causing absent pulses and limb claudication. GCA is more common in individuals of Northern European descent who are older than 50 years of age. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, pathologic abnormalities on temporal artery biopsy, and/or evidence of large vessel involvement on vascular imaging. Glucocorticoids remain the mainstay treatment for GCA, but tocilizumab has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of GCA.

### Effect of prior steroid treatment on temporal artery biopsy findings in giant cell arteritis [^1151bvBo]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Aim

To examine the effect of up to 6 weeks of corticosteroid treatment on the positive temporal artery biopsy rate in giant cell arteritis (GCA).

Methods

Prospective comparative clinical study of 11 patients meeting the American College of Rheumatology criteria for diagnosis of GCA. Patients underwent temporal artery biopsy within 1 week, at 2–3 weeks, or after 4 weeks of corticosteroid treatment.

Results

Overall, nine of 11 (82%) patients had positive temporal artery biopsies. Six of seven (86%) biopsies performed after 4 or more weeks of steroid treatment were positive.

Conclusion

Temporal artery biopsy is useful several weeks after institution of steroids.

### Light-chain amyloidosis mimicking giant cell arteritis in a bilateral anterior ischemic optic neuropathy case [^116tHyCx]. BMC Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (Arteritic-AION) is one of the most serious complications of giant cell arteritis (GCA) or Horton's disease, and it is caused by the occlusion of the posterior ciliary arteries, supplying the optic nerve head (ONH). Arteritic-AION is the most frequent ophthalmological complication of GCA (81.2%), followed by central retinal artery occlusion (14.1%), retrobulbar ischemic optic neuropathy (7%), and ocular ischemia (1.2%).

Light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, or primary amyloidosis, is a hematological disease characterized by the deposition in tissues of monoclonal light-chain variable-region immunoglobulin fragments, which may involve any tissue or organ. It is usually associated with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or smoldering myeloma, less frequently with symptomatic multiple myeloma. The vascular system is often involved by the deposition of the amyloidal-proteins, which principally affect the small-caliber vessels. The localization to medium- or large-size vessels is less frequent; nonetheless, deposits of the amyloidal-protein were found in the coronary arteries, and arterial thromboembolic events associated with cardiac AL-amyloidosis were reported. AL-amyloidosis of the temporal arteries has also been shown in patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of GCA.

Here we report a case of bilateral AION showing clinical and laboratory signs suggestive of GCA, which was subsequently excluded by pathology and further laboratory findings. Positivity of the temporal artery biopsy (TAB) for light-chain amyloidosis prompted us to evaluate the possibility that AL-amyloidosis may be a - yet undescribed - cause of bilateral AION, mimicking GCA.

### Bayard horton's clinicopathological description of giant cell (temporal) arteritis [^115CW2DJ]. Cephalalgia (2007). Low credibility.

The author set out to review the thought processes of Bayard Horton as he was clinicopathologically describing the first cases of temporal arteritis. The Mayo Clinic records of the original temporal arteritis patients were examined. Horton obtained the first biopsies of the temporal arteries in temporal arteritis and was the first to describe the histopathology. Horton initially thought his first two patients had actinomycosis of the temporal arteries, but later abandoned this diagnosis. He reported these two patients in 1932 as 'an undescribed form of arteritis of the temporal vessels'. He was the first to describe jaw claudication. He saw a patient with blindness and symptoms suggestive of temporal arteritis before this complication was described in the literature, but initially felt the patient had some other disease. The sedimentation rate was elevated in his first patient. He cared for the first temporal arteritis patient ever treated with cortisone.

### Biopsy vs imaging for the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis. viewpoint 2: in favour of biopsy [^116yc5Zs]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Both temporal artery biopsy (TAB) and imaging are widely used to support the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA). The objective of this study was to compare the use of TAB and imaging.

Methods

This article was based on a debate presented at the 21st Vasculitis Meeting, discussing the advantages and disadvantages of using TAB with histology vs imaging for the diagnosis of suspected GCA.

Results

TAB is the diagnostic procedure with the highest specificity. Its sensitivity may be improved by removing an appropriate artery length, practice, examining multiple sections at various levels, and by recognizing incomplete histological findings (which may lead to a more definitive diagnosis by further sectioning or imaging or be related to other inflammatory diseases). TAB may provide histopathological clues useful for diagnosing GCA mimics that may produce similar imaging abnormalities. TAB is a useful research resource, and our current understanding of GCA physiopathology mostly relies on tissue immunopathology studies.

Conclusion

A suspected diagnosis of GCA should be supported by an objective test. TAB is the procedure with the highest specificity, and its sensitivity may be improved by training. Histopathologic examination provides data for an alternative diagnosis, when diseases other than GCA involve the temporal artery. Imaging is essential for the assessment of large-vessel involvement and allows follow-up studies.

### Interleukin-6: a promising target for the treatment of polymyalgia rheumatica or giant cell arteritis? [^117N4Eoz]. RMD Open (2016). Low credibility.

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown aetiology affecting people aged over 50. The hallmark manifestations of PMR are pain and stiffness affecting the neck and shoulder and pelvic girdles. There is no specific laboratory test for the disease, and thus the diagnosis of PMR depends on a combination of clinical symptoms, raised acute phase reactants, the exclusion of other diagnoses and response to glucocorticoids (GCs). For classification purposes, a number of criteria have been proposed and the most recent were collectively drawn up by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR).

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a type of vasculitis of large-sized and medium-sized arteries affecting people aged over 50. The disease usually involves aorta, supra-aortic branches and the extracranial branches of the carotid artery. The clinical manifestations include headaches, temporal artery or scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, visual symptoms, constitutional symptoms and PMR manifestations. At the time of diagnosis, the most serious consequence of GCA is the occurrence of visual loss in 12–14% of patients. Aortic aneurysm or dissection may develop during follow-up and can be potentially life-threatening. The gold standard for the diagnosis of GCA remains temporal artery biopsy (TAB). Approximately 60–80% of TABs show evidence of vasculitis with a mononuclear cell infiltrate, disruption of the internal elastic lamina and multinucleated giant cells, the hallmark of the disease, in ∼50% of patients. However, ACR classification criteria were developed in patients who already have evidence of vasculitis and do not take into account the additional value of imaging techniques. Indeed, ultrasonography of TAB may reveal a hypoechoic halo sign and is considered to be highly specific for GCA diagnosis despite interobserver and interstudy discrepancies. In addition, positron emission tomography (PET) is a valuable method for the detection of occult arterial involvement of the aorta or large vessels in patients with GCA.

### Optimal length and usefulness of temporal artery biopsies in the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis: a 10-year retrospective review of medical records [^117GbSSe]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Background

In giant cell arteritis, temporal artery biopsies often show vasculitis with giant cell formation, but optimal biopsy length for diagnosis is debated. We reviewed temporal artery biopsies from a 10-year period in the province of Alberta, Canada, to identify an ideal biopsy length in the diagnostic process for giant cell arteritis.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed electronic medical records of patients who had undergone a temporal artery biopsy procedure in Alberta between Jan 1, 2008, and Jan 1, 2018, as reported in the Data Integration and Management Repository of Alberta Health Services. We extracted data on baseline demographic characteristics (sex and age), inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] and C-reactive protein [CRP]), temporal artery biopsy characteristics (side of biopsy and postfixation length), and final pathological diagnoses. All positive biopsies were reviewed by a single pathologist to ensure uniformity of pathological interpretation, with subsequent discordant results removed from analysis. Predictors of positive pathological diagnosis of giant cell arteritis were modeled by logistic regression, and the Akaike information criterion was used to compare logistic regression models with varying biopsy length cutoffs (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 cm) to determine a change point for diagnostic sensitivity in postfixation length.

Findings

We extracted data on 1203 temporal artery biopsies; after removal of 13 discordant biopsies, 1190 biopsies from 1163 patients were reviewed. The mean age of patients was 72.0 years (SD 10.3) and 799 (68.7%) patients were women. 222 (18.7%) temporal artery biopsies were positive for giant cell arteritis. In univariable analysis, increases in age (71.3 years [SD 10.6] in negative biopsies vs 75.3 years [8.3] in positive biopsies; odds ratio [OR] 1.04 [95% CI 1.02–1.06]; p < 0.0001)), ESR (36 mm/h [IQR 18–62] in negative biopsies vs 57 [31–79] in positive biopsies; 1.01 [1.01–1.02]; p < 0.0001), CRP (12.1 mg/L [IQR 3.3–35.1] in negative biopsies vs 41.8 [14.6–82.4] in positive biopsies; 1.01 [1.01–1.01]; p < 0.0001), and biopsy length (1.2 cm [IQR 0.9–1.7] in negative biopsies vs 1.6 [1.1–2.0] in positive biopsies; 1.28 [1.09–1.51]; p = 0.0025) were associated with a positive pathological diagnosis. In multivariable analysis adjusted for age, ESR, and CRP, age (adjusted OR 1.04 [95% CI 1.02–1.05]; p = 0.0001), CRP (1.01 [1.00–1.01]; p = 0.0006), and biopsy length (1.22 [1.00–1.49]; p = 0.047) remained statistically significant predictors. The Akaike information criterion determined a change point of 1.5 cm for diagnostic sensitivity.

Interpretation

Accounting for postfixation shrinkage, our findings suggest a 1.5–2.0 cm prefixation length as the optimal biopsy length to diagnose patients with giant cell arteritis, with greater lengths unlikely to provide significant additional diagnostic yield to justify risks associated with surgery.

### Histopathology reporting of temporal artery biopsy specimens for giant cell arteritis: results of a modified Delphi study [^113yzibQ]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

The implications of misdiagnosis in GCA patients include delay or prevention of alternative diagnosis and/or unnecessary exposure to glucocorticoids and their potential harmful side effects (false positive), or denied access to tocilizumab therapy, which requires histological or imaging diagnostic confirmation in the UK (false negative). Despite an increasing use of ultrasound (US) for non-invasive diagnosis, the TAB remains a critical investigation in GCA worldwide, and thus there is a clear need to address the issue of disconcordance between histopathologists in the assessment and reporting of TABs for the diagnosis of GCA.

The Delphi method is a well-established research methodology, which uses an expert panel for the purpose of generating consensus in instances where empirical evidence is limited or contradictory. Work from our group has shown that the Delphi methodology can be used in histopathology to reach consensus in a range of circumstances, including, but not limited to, determining the pertinent information to be included in pathology reports. The aim of this Delphi study was to reach consensus on the following key parameters for the reporting of TAB specimens for the diagnosis of GCA: (1) clinical information provided on the request form, (2) specimen handling of TABs and (3) key microscopic features to be included in the pathology report.

### The use of intravenous methylprednisolone in giant cell arteritis: a population-based study [^117Qofbm]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a large vessel vasculitis affecting the aorta and its major branches. Cranial involvement is common, and the temporal arteries are often involved, leading to the term 'temporal arteritis'. Giant cell arteritis is the most frequently diagnosed vasculitis in people 50 years and older and is more often seen in females. The world's highest reported incidence is in Scandinavia. In Skåne, the southernmost region of Sweden, the annual incidence of biopsy-confirmed GCA in those over age 50 is roughly 13/100 000 population.

The cornerstone of treatment is high-dose glucocorticoids (GC), tapered gradually over a period often exceeding two years. Although advancements have been made in the development of GC-sparing alternatives such as methotrexate and the anti-interleukin-6 agent tocilizumab, patients are still exposed to high cumulative GC doses leading to steroid-related toxicity and morbidity. High doses of GC are associated with development of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, and venous thromboembolism, and their immunosuppressive action increases risk of infections. Comorbidities observed in patients with GCA may be more related to treatment than to the disease itself.

Giant cell arteritis carries a risk of developing ischemic cranial complications such as vision loss and stroke and large vessel disorders including aortic aneurysm, large-artery stenosis and aortic dissection. Vision loss is a debilitating complication of GCA, and up to 50% of individuals with GCA exhibit ocular involvement with varying degrees of vision impairment and manifestations including diplopia, amaurosis fugax and eye pain. In patients with, or at risk of developing, visual complications, initial treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) is recommended before initiating oral GCs (OGC).

Timely initiation of treatment is crucial to reducing vision loss. Once vision has been affected, outlook for improvement is questionable. In their study, Chan et al. found that vision recovery in patients treated with initial IVMP was superior to that in patients receiving an oral-only regimen. These results have not been reproduced in other studies.

In this population-based retrospective study, we aim to assess clinical characteristics, treatment-related toxicity and mortality in patients with GCA receiving high-dose IVMP.

This article reviews some of the recent work in epidemiology and pathology of giant cell arteritis (GCA), with particular regard to the immuno-histochemical findings in temporal artery biopsy (TAB) specimens. The diagnostic as well as prognostic role of biopsy histology is discussed. The role of novel imaging techniques e.g. duplex ultrasonography and FDG-PET scanning in diagnosis and staging of disease extent is reviewed. Existing evidence on the treatment is also discussed to propose guidelines on management of GCA.

### Effect of biopsy length on the rate of positive temporal artery biopsies [^1137o3ff]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the relationship between temporal artery biopsy (TAB) length and the diagnostic sensitivity for giant cell arteritis (GCA).

Methods

TAB pathology reports were reviewed for histological findings and formalin-fixed TAB lengths. The patient's charts were reviewed for clinical data. TAB was considered positive if there was a mononuclear cell infiltrate in the vessel wall. Biopsy-negative GCA was diagnosed when patients fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria, in addition to favorable rapid response to steroid therapy. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the clinical and histological features: Biopsy-positive GCA, biopsy-negative GCA, and no GCA.

Results

305 TAB reports of 173 individuals were reviewed. When only GCA patients TAB-positive and TAB-negative were considered, TAB in the biopsy-positive patients was significantly longer than in biopsy-negative cases (p = 0.008). The rate of positive biopsies was only 19% with TAB length of 5 mm or less, but increased to 71–79% with TAB lengths of 6–20 mm, and to 89% when TAB length was longer than 20 mm. Only 3% of positive biopsies were 5 mm or shorter, compared to 27% of TAB in biopsy-negative GCA cases (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

TAB with post-fixation length shorter than 5 mm carries an increased biopsy-negative rate therefore longer TAB length is required for accurate diagnosis. Increasing post-fixation TAB length beyond 20 mm may further increase the rate of positive biopsies, although data were insufficient in that regard.

### Optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) represents a novel technique for the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis [^111U5RT9]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a systemic inflammatory vascular disease which carries a risk of blindness, stroke, and aortic aneurysm if untreated. The incidence rises with age to 70/100,000 in women aged 70–79 years. The usual treatment includes a prolonged course of high-dose corticosteroids and, if GCA is suspected, treatment should not be delayed while diagnostic confirmation is awaited. Owing to the risk of both disease-associated and treatment-associated morbidity and mortality, prompt and accurate diagnosis is critical. Current diagnostic modalities include temporal artery biopsy (TAB), ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18 F-FDG PET/CT). TAB is by far the most widely used investigation, however, it has significant limitations including a relatively low sensitivity of 77% (95% confidence interval: 71.8–81.9%), delays whilst awaiting histological reporting, and surgical complications.

Optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) may represent a promising alternative diagnostic modality. The technology is already widely used in clinical ophthalmology (as ocular coherence tomography (OCT) for imaging the retina, optic disc and anterior segment) and in cardiology for intravascular imaging. In vascular OFDI, an infrared probe is passed into the lumen of a vessel and, using second-generation OCT, provides cross-sectional imaging of the vessel walls with a resolution of 10–20 microns. In comparison to non-invasive diagnostic modalities, such as ultrasound, PET/CT and MRI, this potentially offers a significant improvement in resolution, whilst in comparison to TAB it provides immediate bedside results and allows a longer section of the artery to be examined which may improve diagnostic sensitivity.

This first-in-man ex-vivo study aims to assess the clinical efficacy of OFDI in aiding the diagnosis of GCA in the acute setting. The primary outcome of this study was the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of OFDI in detecting histologically confirmed arteritis. Secondary outcomes included evaluating the accuracy of several OFDI-derived proxy markers for a histological diagnosis of GCA. These markers included measuring mean intimal wall thickness (MIT), detecting multinucleate giant cells (MNGC), and detecting fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina (FIEL).

### Is vascular endothelial growth factor a useful biomarker in giant cell arteritis? [^112qZD3c]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

We hypothesised that VEGF might be a diagnostic marker in GCA, but the evidence from the current study was not conclusive evidence, although we have been able to demonstrate a strong association between biopsy-positive GCA and elevated serum levels of VEGF. Serum concentration of VEGF at first presentation of patients with suspected GCA has some predictive power for a positive temporal artery biopsy. However, it does not have good diagnostic performance in separating all cases of GCA, regardless of diagnostic method, from controls. There are several potential explanations for this discrepancy. It may be that a positive temporal artery biopsy reflects a more vigorous inflammatory process with increased local and systemic expression of factors including VEGF; therefore, a higher likelihood of measuring an abnormal VEGF concentration in the peripheral blood. Indeed, patients with a positive biopsy are more likely to have raised inflammatory markers, and more likely to develop visual complications. Alternatively, it may be that patients with a positive temporal artery biopsy have a more robust diagnosis, therefore are more likely to have a high inflammatory response including high VEGF concentrations.

Patients contributing to this study had been receiving glucocorticoids for up to 7 days at the point of blood collection. Twenty-three per cent controls and 22% GCA patients had not received any glucocorticoids at baseline and the remainder had received at least one dose. The duration of glucocorticoid exposure did not appear to affect VEGF concentrations in this study. However, it is possible that VEGF measurements may be more diagnostically accurate if taken prior to any glucocorticoid treatment. For most patients, this would involve testing blood samples taken at their general practitioners at the point of initial presentation. This may be a worthwhile future study.

One limitation of this study is the potential instability of VEGF after freeze–thawing. All samples used had one freeze–thaw cycle: they were frozen at acquisition then defrosted only when used in this study. One paper has compared samples from four patients which were either analysed fresh or after various cycles of freeze–thawing, and found that even after one cycle, the degradation in serum signal was on average 67% (range 30–90%). However, three other studies have failed to observe any difference in serum VEGF after freeze–thawing up to 10 times in 30 patients,20 patientsand 9 patients, respectively. Therefore, it is not clear whether the VEGF measured in serum stored at −80°C is an accurate reflection of VEGF concentration at the time of sampling.

### Ultrasonographic halo score in giant cell arteritis: association with intimal hyperplasia and ischaemic sight loss [^114aFYXa]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

GCA is the most common form of primary vasculitis in the elderly. Inflammation of cranial arteries may compromise the blood flow thereby causing ischaemic complications. Prior studies have linked temporal artery biopsy (TAB) findings, such as the presence of intimal hyperplasia, to a high risk of cranial ischaemic symptoms. It has been proposed that distinct disease subsets may exist within GCA.

Ultrasonography of the temporal and axillary arteries is recommended as the first-line investigation in the diagnostic work-up of GCA, and it may reveal the presence of one or more halos. A halo is a hypo-echoic thickening of the arterial wall, and in particular of the intima-media complex. We recently developed an ultrasonographic Halo Score, which quantifies the extent of arterial inflammation in patients with GCA. We noted that patients with high Halo Scores more frequently presented with ischaemic sight loss at diagnosis than patients with low Halo Scores.

We hypothesized that the ultrasonographic Halo Score might identify a subset of GCA patients with intimal hyperplasia, a TAB feature associated with ischaemic sight loss. We therefore investigated the relationship between the ultrasonographic Halo Score, biopsy findings and the occurrence of ocular ischaemia.

### Microscopic polyangitis presenting with temporal arteritis and multiple cranial neuropathies [^114kBfwW]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2007). Low credibility.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis affects vessels of various diameters in various tissues or organs, sometimes associated with neurological complications. A 77-year-old man developed dysphagia, hoarseness, dysgeusia, gait unsteadiness, and right temporalgia; neurological examination revealed multiple cranial neuropathies. Laboratory studies demonstrated severe inflammatory responses, elevation of perinuclear ANCA, and mild proteinuria. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed dural enhancement in the cerebellar tentorium. Biopsy revealed necrotizing glomerulonephritis in the kidney, and temporal arteritis without giant cells in the temporal artery. The patient was diagnosed with microscopic polyangitis presenting with temporal arteritis and multiple cranial nerve involvement, and was treated with predonisolone, after which the symptoms and laboratory data showed improvement. This is the first case of ANCA-associated vasculitis with pathologically verified lesions in the temporal artery as well as in the kidney. Thus, ANCA-associated vasculitis may simultaneously affect large vessels such as temporal artery, as well as microvessels in the kidney, nerves and other organs.

### Importance of specimen length during temporal artery biopsy [^111bPMeR]. The British Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Variations in surgical technique of temporal artery biopsy (TAB) performed for diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA) may contribute to high false-negative rates. This was a retrospective analysis of a large database that explored potential associations between specimen length and diagnostic sensitivity of TAB.

Methods

Histopathological reports and medical records of patients who underwent TAB in six hospitals between 2004 and 2009 were reviewed.

Results

A total of 966 biopsies were analysed. The median postfixation specimen length was 1 (range 0.1–8.5) cm and 207 biopsies (21.4 per cent) were positive for GCA. Significant variation in prebiopsy erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), arterial specimen length and positive results was noted amongst hospitals. Multivariable analysis revealed that patient age, ESR value and specimen length were independent predictors of GCA. Positive biopsies had significantly longer median specimen length compared with negative biopsies: 1.2 (range 0.3–8.5) versus 1.0 (0.2–8.0) cm respectively (P = 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified postfixation specimen length of at least 0.7 cm as the cut-off length with highest positive predictive value for a positive biopsy (area under ROC curve 0.574). Biopsies with specimen length of 0.7 cm or more had a significantly higher rate of positive results than smaller specimens (24.8 versus 12.9 per cent respectively; odds ratio 2.17, P = 0.001).

Conclusion

Specimen length and ESR were independent prognostic factors of a positive TAB result. A uniform referral practice and standard specimen length of approximately 1 cm could help eliminate discrepancies in the results of TAB.

### Is colour duplex sonography-guided temporal artery biopsy useful in the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis? A randomized study [^114hJrKQ]. Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of colour duplex sonography (CDS)-guided temporal artery biopsy (TAB) for the diagnosis of GCA in patients with suspected GCA.

Methods

From September 2009 through December 2012, 112 consecutive patients with suspected GCA were randomized to undergo CDS-guided TAB or standard TAB. All patients underwent temporal artery physical examination and temporal artery CDS prior to TAB. CDS of the temporal artery was performed by the same ultrasonographer, who was unaware of the patient's clinical data, and all TABs were evaluated by the same pathologist. Seven patients in whom biopsy failed to sample temporal artery tissue were excluded from the analysis.

Results

Fifty patients were randomized to undergo CDS-guided TAB and 55 patients to standard TAB. Except for a younger age in patients who underwent standard TAB (P = 0.026), no significant differences were observed between the two groups. There were no significant differences in the frequencies of positive TAB for classic transmural inflammation (28% vs 18.2%) or for periadventitial small vessel vasculitis and/or vasa vasorum vasculitis (6% vs 14.5%) between the two groups. No significant differences in the frequency of positive TAB in the two groups were observed when we excluded the patients treated with glucocorticoids and when we stratified the patients of the two groups for the presence or absence of the halo sign.

Conclusion

Our study showed that CDS-guided TAB did not improve the sensitivity of TAB for diagnosing GCA.

### Cranial giant cell arteritis mimickers: a masquerade to unveil [^112R8nDh]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a large-vessel vasculitis that affects cranial and extra-cranial arteries. Extra-cranial GCA presents mainly with non-specific symptoms and the differential diagnosis is very broad, while the cranial form has more typical clinical picture and physicians have a lower threshold for diagnosis and treatment. Although temporal artery biopsy (TAB) has an established role, ultrasound (US) is being increasingly used as the first-line imaging modality in suspected GCA. Vasculitides (especially ANCA-associated), hematological disorders (mainly amyloidosis), neoplasms, infections, atherosclerosis and local disorders can affect the temporal arteries or might mimic the symptoms of cranial GCA and produce US and TAB findings that resemble those of temporal vasculitis. Given that prompt diagnosis is essential and proper treatment varies significantly among these diseases, in this review we aimed to collectively present disorders that can masquerade cranial GCA.

### Geo-epidemiology of temporal artery biopsy-positive giant cell arteritis in Australia and new zealand: is there a seasonal influence? [^116vxjAh]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

We investigated the relationship between GCA rate and seasonal variation by fitting two types of generalised linear model. In the first instance, we modelled the number of GCA events as a Poisson response with a log link function. Season was included as the main effect with age and gender as categorical covariates. Seasonal trends in GCA rate were also evaluated by performing cosinor analysis using the 'R' software plug-in 'season'. The cosinor model assumes a sinusoidal pattern with the amplitude describing the size of the seasonal change and the phase, its peak. The sinusoid assumes a smooth seasonal pattern that is symmetric about its peak (so the rate of the seasonal increase in disease is equal to the decrease). Age and sex were included as covariates. In both types of analyses, models were evaluated for goodness of fit.

In addition to our study results, a systematic review of publications up to February 2017 was performed using the PubMed and ISI Web of Science databases. The search criteria included: 'Giant Cell Arteritis OR temporal arteritis' AND 'Country OR geoepidemiology OR seasons OR socioeconomic OR environment OR climate OR weather OR cyclic OR sunlight OR latitude OR altitude'. Articles written in English, French or Dutch were reviewed for relevance. PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed.

Selected studies fulfilled the following criteria: a diagnosis of GCA was defined as either having positive TAB, a clearly established clinical definition, or meeting the American College of Rheumatology classification clinical criteria for GCA, and that the study of interest explored the association of a specific environmental trigger in the context of GCA disease. Articles were excluded if they did not distinguish between GCA and polymyalgia rheumatic, if they were reviews or if they employed data from other studies to explore a larger cohort. When studies were updates of previous cohorts, the most recent study was used and the most current data were reviewed.

### Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions preferred practice pattern ® [^1164Q7C1]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Retinal and ophthalmic artery occlusions — acute management and stroke evaluation emphasize urgent referral, targeted systemic workup, and selective outpatient evaluation. Once a diagnosis of an acute, symptomatic CRAO, BRAO, or OAO has been made, the ophthalmologist should refer to an emergency department affiliated with a stroke center for prompt systemic evaluation, with clear instructions that the patient has experienced an eye "stroke", and an expedited workup offers the best opportunity to evaluate, assess, and manage the risk for cerebral stroke or myocardial infarction. In addition, corticosteroids should be initiated empirically and a temporal artery biopsy scheduled in patients with high clinical suspicion for GCA. In the absence of a clear etiology such as an embolus, the workup should include evaluation for antiphospholipid antibodies and other hematologic diatheses, and autoimmune or other hypercoagulable states; Susac syndrome should be considered in younger patients with multiple or recurrent BRAOs, and clinicians should inquire about signs or symptoms of carotid dissection. Poor choroidal circulation on fluorescein angiography or indocyanine green angiography is suggestive of OAO or GCA. At present, there is no conclusive evidence to support referring asymptomatic patients who have a BRAO or asymptomatic plaques for an expedited stroke workup; these patients should be referred to their primary care physician for a comprehensive systemic vascular workup on an outpatient basis. Stroke risk associated with newly diagnosed OAO, CRAO, or BRAO may be as high as 25%.

### Validity of the American College of Rheumatology criteria for the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis [^117XfUXQ]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the clinical utility of the American College of Rheumatology criteria for the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA) in patients with positive and negative temporal artery biopsies.

Design

Retrospective case series of all patients undergoing temporal artery biopsy.

Methods

Retrospective chart review of all patients seen in the Neuro-ophthalmology Service of the Wills Eye Institute undergoing biopsy. One hundred twelve patients were identified between October 2001 and May 2006. Charts were reviewed for American College of Rheumatology criteria, biopsy results, and progression of visual loss after diagnosis.

Results

Nine of 35 patients (25.7%) with positive biopsies would not have been diagnosed with GCA using American College of Rheumatology criteria alone. An additional 16 patients (45.7%) met only 2 criteria and required the positive biopsy to establish the American College of Rheumatology diagnosis of GCA. Eleven of 39 patients (28.2%) with negative biopsies met the criteria and would have been diagnosed with GCA. Diagnostic agreement between the American College of Rheumatology criteria without biopsy results and biopsy results alone was 51.4%; with the addition of biopsy results to the criteria, this increased to 73.0%.

Conclusions

The current American College of Rheumatology criteria should not be used to diagnose GCA and all patients suspected of having GCA should undergo a temporal artery biopsy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of temporal arteritis… [^117DhFG3]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Clinical suspicion can be based, in part, on the American College of Rheumatology study that determined highly sensitive parameters for diagnosis of TA. These parameters include age more than 50 years, a Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate of more than 50 mm per hour and an abnormal temporal artery biopsy. The highest specific clinical features include jaw or tongue claudication, visual abnormalities and temporal artery abnormalities. High clinical suspicion includes any one of these three criteria in a patient more than 50 years of age with an elevated ESR, or if three or more of the following four criteria are met: new localized headache, temporal artery abnormality, elevated ESR and abnormal temporal artery biopsy. Vision loss is an important finding.

About one fifth of patients with TA and vision loss have no systemic symptoms of TA. Conversely, about one quarter of patients with TA continue to have visual acuities of 20/40 or better. Vision loss in patients with TA usually is the result of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. TA should be suspected in patients more than 50 years of age who have a diagnosis of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Steroid therapy should be initiated. A unilateral temporal artery biopsy should be performed, and treatment should be initiated if the biopsy is positive for TA. If the biopsy is negative but suspicion remains high, a con-tralateral biopsy should be considered. Patients with medium clinical suspicion for TA should undergo an ESR and a temporal artery biopsy. Medium clinical suspicion is classified as meeting any one of the highest specificity criteria or having anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.

In addition, any two of the following represents medium clinical suspicion: elevated ESR, new headache in an older patient or a clinical temporal artery abnormality. If both temporal artery biopsies are negative, alternative reasons for an elevated ESR should be sought. A normal ESR and a negative unilateral biopsy make the diagnosis of TA less likely. However, up to 30 percent of patients have a normal ESR with biopsy-proven TA; thus, other features should be sought.

### Atypical manifestations of temporal arteritis… [^112DvSKt]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

The most common systemic vasculitis in adults is temporal arteritis. Its classic manifestations — headache, polymyalgia rheumatica, jaw claudication, and vision changes — are well known to most physicians. More than 70 percent of patients complain of headache; however, the headache is often described as being "different" from a patient's usual headache or as a new-onset headache. Some patients even develop an occipital headache caused by inflammation of the occipital artery. Hellmann reviewed a case report showing atypical symptoms of temporal arteritis. Pain in the facial muscles caused by chewing occurs in many patients with temporal arteritis, although only one half of them have typical jaw claudication. Some complain of a nonspecific dental discomfort or a pain in the sinus or ear region.

Polymyalgia rheumatica, which is closely linked to temporal arteritis, presents with pain and weakness in the hip girdle, shoulders, and neck, with pain being the predominant complaint. Patients with PMR may have difficulty getting out of bed. Other common findings include an erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 50 mm per Hg and, in one half of patients, an abnormal temporal artery on physical examination. The accompanying table lists some of the atypical manifestations. The most worrisome complication of temporal arteritis is blindness caused by anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. This feature develops, on average, five months after the initial symptoms of temporal arteritis. Because visual symptoms are rarely the presenting symptoms, blindness can usually be prevented if the other presentations of this condition are recognized. Approximately 10 percent of patients have respiratory symptoms, and these symptoms are the presenting complaint in about 4 percent of patients. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Diagnosis almost always requires unilateral temporal artery biopsy. The results of this procedure can be accurate if the patient has been taking corticosteroids for less than two weeks. Prednisone therapy should not be delayed if temporal arteritis is suspected. However, it may be difficult to taper prednisone, and the patient may need to continue treatment for more than two years.

### Does this patient have temporal arteritis? [^113kg1vk]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

and Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC; Drummond Rennie, MD, Deputy Editor, JAMA. Context Clinicians must be able to confidently diagnose temporal arteritis, since failure to make a correct diagnosis may lead to irreversible visual loss as well as inappropriate evaluation and treatment of headache, fatigue. and other potential presenting symptoms. The diagnostic value of particular signs and symptoms among patients with suspected TA is unknown. Objective To determine the accuracy of historical features, physical examination, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in diagnosis of TA. Data Sources We performed a MEDLINE search of English-language articles published. patients and formed the core of our review. Data Extraction Both authors independently reviewed each study to determine eligibility, abstracted data using a standardized instrument, and classified study quality using predetermined criteria.

Data Synthesis The prevalence of TA in the general population is less than 1%. However, in our 21 core studies, 39% of patients referred for temporal artery biopsy. had positive results. The only 2 historical features that substantially increased the likelihood of TA among patients referred for biopsy were jaw claudication and diplopia. The absence of any temporal. artery abnormality was the only clinical factor that modestly reduced the likelihood of disease. Predictive physical findings included temporal artery beading. Conclusions A small number of clinical features are helpful in predicting the likelihood of a positive temporal artery biopsy among patients with a clinical suspicion of disease; the most useful finding is a normal ESR, which makes TA unlikely.

### The clinical value of negative temporal artery biopsy specimens… [^114f5exY]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The clinical course of patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of temporal arteritis but with negative temporal artery biopsy specimens was evaluated. Ninety-one patients undergoing a biopsy formed the basis of this study. Of these, 63 patients had no evidence of arteritis on biopsy, and 28 patients had biopsy specimens showing granulomatous inflammation. False-negative findings from biopsy specimens occurred in 5% of patients who had the disease. Cancer was the final diagnosis in 21% of patients with negative biopsy specimens v 3% of patients with temporal arteritis. Various chronic systemic inflammatory diseases were found in 16% of patients with negative biopsy specimens, while none of the patients with temporal arteritis had additional systemic inflammatory diseases. Patients with proven arteritis were notably older and had higher ESRs than patients without the disease.

However, no laboratory test or frequently observed symptom or sign noted on initial examination, considered alone or in combination with other findings, had diagnostic sensitivity or specificity as high as temporal artery biopsy.
