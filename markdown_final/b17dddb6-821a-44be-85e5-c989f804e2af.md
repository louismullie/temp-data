## Question

Thyroid ca chemotherapy options

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about chemotherapy options in thyroid cancer, organized by histology and clinical context, with explicit reasoning and self-verification preserved. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the major thyroid cancer subtypes and their standard first-line therapies. Then, I should verify where cytotoxic chemotherapy fits relative to surgery, radioactive iodine, external beam radiation, and targeted therapies. Next, I will examine disease-specific roles for chemotherapy, including anaplastic thyroid cancer, radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer, and medullary thyroid cancer. After that, I need to check specific regimens, dosing, and the concept of bridging therapy. Finally, I should confirm guideline positions, clinical trial prioritization, and practical implementation details, including multidisciplinary care and shared decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framework and subtypes, because I need to ensure I'm anchoring chemotherapy in the right disease biology and treatment hierarchy. Differentiated thyroid cancer (papillary, follicular, oncocytic) is typically managed with surgery and radioactive iodine, with systemic therapy reserved for radioiodine-refractory, progressive disease; anaplastic thyroid cancer is a highly aggressive, often unresectable entity where multimodal therapy including chemoradiation is standard; medullary thyroid cancer is neuroendocrine and not iodine-avid, so systemic therapy is guided by targeted agents rather than chemotherapy; poorly differentiated thyroid cancer behaves aggressively and often requires multimodality care including chemoradiation in select cases [^112oscjY] [^116mDdBr] [^115VsGK4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about chemotherapy being broadly useful. I should verify its historical role and current positioning. Across thyroid cancer, cytotoxic chemotherapy has limited efficacy and is generally reserved for specific scenarios after or alongside targeted therapies, with kinase inhibitors like lenvatinib and sorafenib demonstrating progression-free survival benefit in radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer, and vandetanib and cabozantinib in medullary thyroid cancer; thus, chemotherapy is typically a later-line or bridging option rather than first-line in most settings [^113MPbvU] [^116ue5xi] [^111DHFdV].

> Now, focusing on anaplastic thyroid cancer, I need to check the strength of evidence for chemoradiation and which cytotoxic backbones are endorsed. The ATA 2021 guidelines strongly recommend definitive-intention radiation with concurrent chemotherapy, commonly a taxane with or without platinum or anthracycline, to improve local control and as a radiosensitizer; NCCN lists paclitaxel/carboplatin, docetaxel/doxorubicin, and weekly paclitaxel or docetaxel as acceptable regimens, and doxorubicin remains the only FDA-approved cytotoxic agent for ATC, though single-agent doxorubicin has modest activity while combinations may increase response rates in small studies [^113SLiSz] [^113W4qYc] [^111gFy5N] [^115FxHiD] [^115SAjKS].

> Wait, let me verify the role of chemotherapy as a bridge in ATC, because timing matters in this rapidly progressive disease. Guidelines suggest initiating cytotoxic chemotherapy early in unresectable or advanced ATC as a bridge while awaiting molecular testing and arranging targeted therapy, particularly BRAF/MEK inhibition for BRAF V600E–mutated disease; this bridging strategy aims to stabilize disease and preserve the airway while precision therapy is organized [^115zYqLW] [^112dXGFX] [^114Hp99b].

> Next, I should review radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer, and I need to ensure I don't overstate chemotherapy's role here. The ATA notes cytotoxic chemotherapy has historically produced disappointing results in RAI-refractory DTC and should be considered only in metastatic, rapidly progressive, symptomatic, or immediately threatening disease that cannot be controlled by other approaches, with use preferably within clinical trials; lenvatinib is the preferred first-line systemic therapy based on superior response rates and progression-free survival, and sorafenib is an alternative, so chemotherapy is reserved for exceptional circumstances or as part of investigational combinations [^116mDdBr] [^116ue5xi] [^111GHSz4].

> I will now examine medullary thyroid cancer, and I should double-check that chemotherapy is not recommended as first-line. The ATA MTC guideline explicitly advises against first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy given low response rates and short duration of benefit; instead, vandetanib or cabozantinib are preferred, with selpercatinib or pralsetinib for RET-altered disease, and cytotoxic regimens such as dacarbazine-based combinations reserved for progression after targeted therapy or when preferred agents are unavailable, ideally in trials [^112oscjY] [^115ZmVnk] [^111DHFdV].

> Let me consider poorly differentiated thyroid cancer, since its management often overlaps with ATC. Although high-quality prospective data are limited, expert consensus supports aggressive multimodal therapy including surgery when feasible, external beam radiation with concurrent chemotherapy in unresectable or high-risk presentations, and early integration of targeted therapies where appropriate; thus, cytotoxic chemotherapy here functions primarily as part of chemoradiation for local control rather than as systemic disease control [^115BH5s9].

> I should confirm specific regimens and dosing details to make this actionable. For ATC chemoradiation, commonly used concurrent regimens include weekly paclitaxel 50 mg/m² with carboplatin AUC 2, weekly docetaxel 20 mg/m² with doxorubicin 20 mg/m², or weekly single-agent paclitaxel 30–60 mg/m² or docetaxel 20 mg/m². Doxorubicin monotherapy at 20 mg/m² weekly or 60–75 mg/m² every 3 weeks is FDA-approved but generally less effective than combinations in small series, and single-agent weekly paclitaxel may benefit select newly diagnosed stage IVB ATC patients [^113W4qYc] [^115FxHiD] [^111gFy5N].

> But wait, what about sequencing and integration with targeted therapies in ATC? I need to ensure I capture that correctly. In BRAF V600E–mutated ATC, combined dabrafenib and trametinib is recommended and can be prioritized over or integrated with chemoradiation depending on clinical urgency and airway risk; for other actionable fusions such as NTRK or RET, TRK or RET inhibitors should be considered, and checkpoint inhibitors may be appropriate in TMB-high or MSI-H/dMMR disease; throughout, cytotoxic chemotherapy can serve as a bridge or as palliative therapy when targeted options are unavailable or trials are not accessible [^114Hp99b] [^113r93kv].

> Next, I should review the overarching principles that guide when to use chemotherapy, because I need to ensure consistency with guidelines. All major guidelines emphasize individualized, multidisciplinary care with early goals-of-care discussions, shared decision-making, and prioritization of clinical trials; cytotoxic chemotherapy is generally reserved for aggressive histologies, symptomatic or rapidly progressive disease, or as a bridge while molecular results are pending, with careful attention to performance status, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^114GCAw1] [^111D7mM2] [^115zYqLW] [^111ACN1e].

> Finally, I should double-check practical implementation details that affect outcomes. Expedited molecular testing, rapid coordination of surgery, radiation, and systemic therapy, and early integration of palliative care are critical in ATC. Cytotoxic chemotherapy can often begin within about a week after surgery when used with radiation, and debulking surgery without curative intent is discouraged if it delays definitive chemoradiation or targeted therapy. Throughout, patients should be counseled on toxicity, financial considerations, and the limited but real role of chemotherapy in this evolving landscape [^111fCraq] [^114emWV6] [^115JL5UJ] [^117DjGaJ].

Chemotherapy has a **limited role** in thyroid cancer and is generally reserved for advanced, aggressive, or radioiodine-refractory cases [^116mDdBr]. For differentiated thyroid cancer, **cytotoxic chemotherapy is rarely used** and is considered only in rapidly progressive, symptomatic, or immediately threatening disease that cannot be controlled by other approaches [^113MPbvU]; doxorubicin is the most commonly used agent, but response rates are low and durability is limited [^116x97oG]. In anaplastic thyroid cancer, **combination regimens** (e.g. paclitaxel/carboplatin, docetaxel/doxorubicin) are used with concurrent radiotherapy for local control and symptom palliation, though prognosis remains poor [^113SLiSz] [^111gFy5N]. For medullary thyroid cancer, chemotherapy is not first-line due to low efficacy; targeted therapies (vandetanib, cabozantinib, selpercatinib) are preferred [^112oscjY] [^111DHFdV]. Overall, chemotherapy is a last-resort option and should be individualized with multidisciplinary care and consideration of clinical trials [^114GCAw1] [^111ACN1e].

## Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC)

### Role of chemotherapy

Cytotoxic chemotherapy has **historically produced disappointing results** in DTC, with low response rates and limited durability [^113MPbvU] [^116x97oG]. It is generally reserved for patients with **metastatic, rapidly progressive, symptomatic, or immediately threatening disease** that cannot be controlled by other approaches [^116mDdBr]. Doxorubicin is the most commonly used agent, but **objective response rates are low** (approximately 20–30%), and responses are typically short-lived [^113MPbvU] [^116x97oG].

---

### Clinical guidelines and recommendations

The American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines recommend that cytotoxic chemotherapy be considered only in **specific clinical scenarios** and preferably within clinical trials [^116mDdBr]. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines similarly emphasize the limited role of chemotherapy in DTC, recommending systemic therapy with kinase inhibitors (e.g. lenvatinib, sorafenib) as preferred options for progressive or symptomatic disease [^111J37B9].

---

## Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC)

### Role of chemotherapy

ATC is a highly aggressive and lethal form of thyroid cancer, and chemotherapy plays a more prominent role in its management [^115VsGK4]. Combination regimens, particularly taxane-based therapies, are commonly used with concurrent radiotherapy to improve local control and survival [^113SLiSz]. The ATA guidelines recommend **early initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy** as an initial and potentially bridging approach until mutational results and targeted therapies become available [^115zYqLW].

---

### Commonly used chemotherapy regimens

| **Regimen** | **Components** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Paclitaxel/carboplatin | - Paclitaxel 50 mg/m² <br/> - Carboplatin AUC 2 (weekly) | Definitive-intention chemoradiation [^113SLiSz] |
| Docetaxel/doxorubicin | - Docetaxel 20 mg/m² <br/> - Doxorubicin 20 mg/m² (weekly) | Definitive-intention chemoradiation [^113SLiSz] |
| Paclitaxel (single agent) | Paclitaxel 30–60 mg/m² (weekly) | Definitive-intention chemoradiation [^113SLiSz] |
| Doxorubicin (single agent) | Doxorubicin 20 mg/m² (weekly) or 60–75 mg/m² every 3 weeks | FDA-approved for ATC [^115FxHiD] |

---

### Clinical outcomes and limitations

Chemotherapy in ATC provides modest benefit, with median overall survival remaining poor (approximately 3–6 months) [^114Z4aqD]. However, **recent advances in targeted therapies** (e.g. BRAF/MEK inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors) have shown promise in improving outcomes for select patients [^113r93kv] [^115L778u].

---

## Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC)

### Role of chemotherapy

Chemotherapy has **limited efficacy** in MTC, with response rates typically below 20% and short-lived responses [^112oscjY]. Current guidelines recommend against the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy as first-line therapy, favoring targeted therapies such as vandetanib, cabozantinib, and selpercatinib [^111DHFdV].

---

### Clinical guidelines and recommendations

The ATA guidelines explicitly state that cytotoxic chemotherapy should not be administered as first-line therapy in MTC due to low response rates and the availability of more effective targeted therapies [^112oscjY]. The NCCN guidelines similarly emphasize the **superior efficacy of targeted therapies** over chemotherapy in MTC [^notfound].

---

## Side effects and limitations of chemotherapy

Chemotherapy in thyroid cancer is associated with **significant side effects**, including:

- Fatigue
- Nausea and vomiting
- Myelosuppression
- Cardiotoxicity (particularly with doxorubicin)
- Mucositis
- Alopecia

These side effects, coupled with limited efficacy, underscore the need for **careful patient selection and individualized treatment plans** [^111J37B9].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Recent advances in molecularly targeted therapies and immunotherapy have significantly impacted the management of advanced thyroid cancer. Agents such as lenvatinib, sorafenib, and selpercatinib have demonstrated efficacy in **progressive or symptomatic disease**, often surpassing traditional chemotherapy [^111GHSz4] [^111J37B9]. Ongoing research and clinical trials continue to explore novel combinations and sequencing strategies to optimize outcomes [^1132L5Y3].

---

Chemotherapy has a **limited role** in thyroid cancer, primarily reserved for advanced, aggressive, or radioiodine-refractory cases. Its use should be individualized, guided by clinical judgment, patient preferences, and available evidence, with a strong emphasis on multidisciplinary care and clinical trial participation [^114GCAw1] [^111ACN1e].

The incidence of thyroid cancer is increasing, whereas mortality remains relatively stable. An increasing body of research supports the use of less-intensive treatment for low-risk thyroid cancer, as the overall prognosis is excellent. Although total thyroidectomy was the gold standard for many years, the options of lobectomy alone, active surveillance, and other ablative modalities are increasingly being used. The clinicohistologic features of any thyroid cancer are important to help determine the optimal management for a given tumor. However, the patient's own desires and goals in their cancer treatment must be evaluated.

### Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma: a contemporary review of challenges and advances [^114xZDAT]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), which accounts for 2% of all thyroid cancers, is a rare aggressive disease with a median survival of less than a year. At diagnosis, all patients with ATC have advanced Stage IV disease reflecting overall poor prognosis. A multidisciplinary approach enables optimal care. Expedited diagnosis with cytology, immunohistochemical, and molecular analyses, as well as early discussion of goals of care, are critical when formulating treatment plans. Prompt evaluation and tissue sampling to assess BRAF status and other targetable mutations permits initiation of personalized therapy when applicable. For disease confined to the neck, upfront surgery followed by adjuvant chemo-radiation therapy can be offered. For locally advanced or metastatic disease, chemo-radiation therapy can be considered if targeted molecular therapy is not possible. Advances in molecular diagnostics continue to expand understanding of the drivers of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, and targeted biologic therapies offer hope for patients diagnosed with this lethal disease. Necessary studies are ongoing to better prognosticate patient outcomes and drive improved therapeutic strategies.

### Surgical options in undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma [^1131qHFL]. World Journal of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Undifferentiated or anaplastic carcinoma is an uncommon histologic type of thyroid cancer. It is one of the most aggressive malignancies associated with a poor prognosis. Most patients are elderly presenting as locally advanced disease with nodal and distant metastases. Complete surgical resection is frequently not possible and there is no effective systemic therapy. Aggressive multimodal therapy including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy is recommended for management. However, because of the rarity of the disease, its aggressiveness and the lack of prospective treatment protocols, nearly all evidence in the literature comes from retrospective case series or cohort studies for selected patients' subgroups treated over a relatively long study period. Evidence of therapeutic benefit of one treatment option over another is lacking. Prognosis remains dismal with a median survival of 2–12 months Surgery remains an important component of the multimodal therapy and is commonly adopted as primary treatment. Although radical resection should be discouraged, resection without inducing significant morbidity can be considered for good risk patients with resectable tumors. It provides an effective form of palliation with potential cure when combined with postoperative radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Patients selected for surgical resection was frequently identified to have improved survival. A regime of preoperative hyperfractionated radiotherapy and doxorubicin followed by surgery when feasible has been documented to achieve local control and avoid tracheostomy for ATC patients. Because of the ineffectiveness of all conventional treatment modalities, novel molecular targeted therapies are being developed to tackling this uniformly fatal disease with promising results.

Good practice statements — radiation and chemotherapy timing and decision considerations in ATC specify that radiation therapy should begin no later than 6 weeks after surgery. Patient goals of care, medical and psychosocial fitness, potential toxicities, financial considerations, and social support must be prominently considered when deciding on aggressive multimodal therapy. Cytotoxic chemotherapy can be initiated within 1 week of surgery, providing sufficient healing, in anticipation of subsequent chemoradiation. In patients of poor performance status, palliative or preventative (no residual disease present) locoregional radiotherapy over high-dose radiotherapy is suggested.

Conclusion

In recent years, the progress in technology, genetic sequencing, and drug development has allowed for significant improvements in the care of patients with advanced thyroid cancer, particularly ATC. Specifically, the dramatic responses in BRAF-mutated ATC and feasibility of less morbid surgical interventions in cases amenable for neoadjuvant approaches have offered better outcomes including improved survival to a population with a highly lethal disease. In addition, combinations of immunotherapy and kinase inhibitors may pose a reasonable alternative for certain ATC cases. Although the data reviewed above demonstrate potential responses upon targeting specific fusions as well as detailing some of the experience with multikinase inhibitors, there is still limited information to provide strong recommendations for some of these therapeutic approaches outside the structure of a clinical trial. Therefore, it is crucial to (a) attempt enrollment in research protocols if possible and (b) if no available trial options, a transparent discussion with patients regarding the latest available evidence in medical and layman terms prior any off-label use of medications. As ATC consist of rapid progressive tumors, many cases warrant a bridging cytotoxic chemotherapy dose while awaiting immunohistochemistry, liquid biopsy, and molecular tumor testing. Multidisciplinary care is essential for determining the best individualized approach to every patient with ATC maximizing efficacy, tolerability, and quality of life. Incorporating molecular testing is key to a personalized approach given the potential to detect an actionable oncogenic alteration, resulting in expanding treatment routes.

### Similarities and differences in follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer management guidelines used in Europe and the United States [^116amF6a]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The management of thyroid cancer has become more refined and complex over the last thirty years. In an effort to provide guidance to both clinicians and patients, several organizations have developed clinical management guidelines that provide specific advice regarding the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of differentiated thyroid cancer. In this review, we compare and contrast the major management recommendations provided in the guidelines of the European Thyroid Association with those published by thyroid cancer specialty organizations in the United States (American Thyroid Association and National Comprehensive Cancer Network). By carefully examining treatment and management approaches that are applied in other areas of the world, we can identify equally effective alternative treatment or follow-up options that may find applicability to specific patients in our own practice. Despite significant difference in cultures, economies, and health care delivery systems, thyroid cancer management recommendations from the European experts and the American experts are far more similar than they are different. Each of the guidelines strongly endorses an initial management approach that is guided by individualized estimates of risk of recurrence and risk of death. Furthermore, follow up and additional therapeutic recommendations are based on revised risk estimates that reflect an individual patient's response to therapy.

### 2021 American Thyroid Association guidelines for management of patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer [^115VsGK4]. Thyroid (2021). Medium credibility.

Background: Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare but highly lethal form of thyroid cancer. Since the guidelines for the management of ATC by the American Thyroid Association were first published in 2012, significant clinical and scientific advances have occurred in the field. The aim of these guidelines is to inform clinicians, patients, and researchers on published evidence relating to the diagnosis and management of ATC. Methods: The specific clinical questions and topics addressed in these guidelines were based on prior versions of the guidelines, stakeholder input, and input of the Task Force members (authors of the guideline). Relevant literature was reviewed, including serial PubMed searches supplemented with additional articles. The American College of Physicians Guideline Grading System was used for critical appraisal of evidence and grading strength of recommendations. Results: The guidelines include the diagnosis, initial evaluation, establishment of treatment goals, approaches to locoregional disease (surgery, radiotherapy, targeted/systemic therapy, supportive care during active therapy), approaches to advanced/metastatic disease, palliative care options, surveillance and long-term monitoring, and ethical issues, including end of life. The guidelines include 31 recommendations and 16 good practice statements. Conclusions: We have developed evidence-based recommendations to inform clinical decision-making in the management of ATC. While all care must be individualized, such recommendations provide, in our opinion, optimal care paradigms for patients with ATC.

### 2015 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer: the American Thyroid Association guidelines task force on thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^113ZFmpz]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) — systemic adjuvant therapy: RECOMMENDATION 61 states there is no role for routine systemic adjuvant therapy in patients with DTC (beyond radioiodine (RAI) and/or TSH suppressive therapy using levothyroxine (LT4)) and is rated as a Strong recommendation, Low-quality evidence. The guideline notes there are no clinical trial data to indicate benefit beyond RAI and/or TSH suppressive therapy using LT4, and in most patients potential toxicities/risks of kinase inhibitor therapies may exceed expected benefit in the adjuvant context. Doxorubicin may act as a radiation sensitizer in some tumors of thyroid origin, and it is unproven whether patients with rising Tg but no identifiable gross disease progression on imaging have sufficiently high future risks to justify adjuvant systemic therapy beyond RAI and/or TSH suppressive therapy using LT4.

### Advancements in the treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer [^116AYDNB]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Although surgery and radioiodine ablation remain the mainstay of DTC therapy, we have become less aggressive in our management of low-risk patients. As our understanding of the natural history and molecular underpinnings of DTC evolves, so might our approach to managing this patient subset, obviating the need for invasive intervention. At the same time, advances in interventional and systemic therapies have greatly expanded treatment options for high-risk surgical candidates and patients with widespread disease, and continue to be areas of active investigation. Continued research efforts are essential to improve our ability to offer effective individualized therapy to patients at all disease stages and to reduce the incidence of recurrent and progressive disease.

Systemic therapy for metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer — Systemic therapeutics in selected clinical contexts appear to provide clinical benefit, with improved progression-free survival shown in three randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trials of vandetanib, sorafenib, and lenvatinib, and durable tumor regression also reported. However, randomized clinical trial data are not yet available to define effects on survival or quality of life or optimal selection and duration of treatment, and to date no clinical trial has demonstrated an overall survival advantage or improved quality of life in RAI-refractory disease. Consequently, therapeutic decisions are presently based on the convergence of expert opinion and patient preference/physician-philosophy, and involvement of highly skilled clinical teams is important until more rigorous data allow definitive guidelines; evidence-based recommendations with expert consensus have been recently published.

### Medullary thyroid cancer in the era of tyrosine kinase inhibitors: to treat or not to treat – and with which drug – those are the questions [^112cem8K]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a rare form of thyroid cancer comprising approximately 4% of all thyroid cancers. The majority of patients have a relatively good prognosis; however, a subgroup of patients will require systemic therapy. Large phase III randomized trials led to the approval of two drugs — vandetanib and cabozantinib — for progressive or symptomatic MTC. The decision regarding which drug to initiate first is not entirely clear and is a common concern amongst treating physicians.

Evidence Acquisition and Synthesis

A review of the literature in English was conducted, and data were summarized and integrated into a decision matrix.

Conclusions

The decision regarding which drug to initiate first for progressive MTC should be based on a careful review of the medical history, physical examination findings, medication list, electrocardiogram, laboratory results, and tumor characteristics. It is necessary to consider the relative contraindications when choosing which drug to initiate first.

Introduction

Thyroid cancer is the most common cancer of endocrine system, with a rapid worldwide increase over recent decades. The disease is classified into three types based on pathological characteristics: papillary carcinoma (PTC), follicular carcinoma (FTC) and anaplastic carcinoma (ATC). About 90% of thyroid cancer are well differentiated, while 10% or less are poorly differentiated or anaplastic subtypes. Of the differentiated carcinomas, 85–90% are PTC and 10–15% are FTC. ATC is a rare, but very aggressive, human malignant tumor. The approximate incidence of ATC is one to two cases per million every year, but the median survival of ATC patients is only about five months. Most thyroid cancer patients become disease-free after initial treatment with surgical resection, radioiodine, and thyroid hormone therapy. However, there are few treatment options available for patients with advanced disease, including radioiodine-resistant and metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). Tumors initially categorized as poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC) or ATC are often highly aggressive and recurrent. In addition to their aggressive growth and metastasis, loss of the capacity to uptake iodine makes both PDTC and ATC difficult to treat, leading to poor prognosis. Moreover, chemotherapeutic treatment has been proved to be largely ineffective against aggressive thyroid carcinomas. These inadequacies of current treatment protocols for PDTC and ATC strongly emphasize the urgent need for novel targeted treatment options.

Over the past few decades, significant advances have been made in the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of thyroid cancer. The pathogenesis of thyroid cancer is thought to involve a multi-step process, in which genetic alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes lead to aberrant proliferation of cells, and alterations in angiogenic genes lead to tumor invasion and spread. Some important tumorigenic factors have been identified as potential therapeutic targets for novel anticancer treatments. Multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors have demonstrated significant antitumor effects in a variety of tumor types, including thyroid cancer, by inhibiting the angiogenic and proliferative signaling. Recently, some kinase inhibitors such as sorafenib, vandetanib and cabozantinib have been proved to be the first-line therapies of advanced thyroid malignancies. In addition, more and more multi-kinase inhibitors are included in clinical trials.

Anaplastic thyroid cancer systemic therapy constructs — concurrent chemoradiation involves chemotherapeutic agents given with radiation that act as radiosensitizers and may require a reduction of the radiation dose; its principal aim is to improve local control with intentions to achieve more rapid tumor cytoreduction and aspirational control of micrometastatic disease. For these guidelines, chemotherapy denotes cytotoxic agents targeting cellular division machinery, DNA repair pathways, or DNA structure. Genomic tumor assessment denotes rigorous analysis of tumor DNA to define altered genes of potential or actual relevance, and targeted therapy denotes systemic treatment directed toward a molecular profile or pathway with agents selected to target a specifically identified driver mutation. Bridging therapy denotes interim approaches intended to contain disease while information is attained to better inform individualization of systemic therapy.

### Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma: biology, pathogenesis, prognostic factors, and treatment approaches [^11371Kyf]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is one of the most aggressive solid tumors known to affect humans and carries a dismal prognosis. Our primary aim was to review its epidemiology, biology, risk factors, and prognostic indicators. We also reviewed the individual and combined roles of surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and newer therapeutic options in the management of ATC.

Methods

An extensive literature review was conducted to include all published reports on ATC. The changing trends in the management of anaplastic thyroid cancer were analyzed to summarize the current practice of management of ATC.

Results

Although ATC is rare, there has been a decline in its incidence worldwide. ATC accounts for more than half of the 1200 deaths per year attributed to thyroid cancer. Long-term survivors are rare, with > 75% and 50% of patients harboring cervical nodal disease and metastatic disease, respectively, at presentation. ATC can arise de novo or from preexisting well-differentiated thyroid cancer. Surgical management has shifted from tracheostomy only for palliation to curative resection when possible. Tracheostomy is performed for impending obstruction rather than for prophylaxis. Radiotherapy has evolved from postoperative administration only to preoperative treatment, combining preoperative and postoperative treatment and using higher doses, along with hyperfractionating and accelerating dose schedules. Chemotherapy has changed from monotherapy to combination therapy, and newer drugs such as paclitaxel show promise. Similarly, novel angiogenesis-inhibiting agents are currently being used, with early reports of some benefit.

Conclusions

Despite multimodality approaches, ATC still carries a dismal prognosis. This should provoke innovative strategies beyond conventional methods to tackle this uniformly lethal disease.

Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) remains one of the most aggressive and deadliest malignancies. Traditionally, treatment consisted of cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation therapy, with or without surgery, although a large proportion of patients were often directed toward palliative/hospice care. In the past decade, significant advances have been made through the advent of targeted therapies and immunotherapy. For patients with targetable disease and considerable treatment response, surgery and other multidisciplinary adjuvant therapies can now be considered. Overall, the era of untreatable ATC is progressively being replaced by highly personalized multidisciplinary therapies, actively shifting the treatment pendulum of this disease.

### New drugs for medullary thyroid cancer: new promises? [^112ZfmTo]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a rare tumor arising from the calcitonin-producing parafollicular C cells of the thyroid gland, occurring either sporadically or alternatively in a hereditary form based on germline RET mutations in approximately one-third of cases. Historically, patients with advanced, metastasized MTC have had a poor prognosis, partly due to limited response to conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In the past decade, however, considerable progress has been made in identifying key genetic alterations and dysregulated signaling pathways paving the way for the evaluation of a series of multitargeted kinase inhibitors that have started to meaningfully impact clinical practice. Two drugs, vandetanib and cabozantinib, are now approved in the US and EU for use in advanced, progressive MTC, with additional targeted agents also showing promise or awaiting results from clinical trials. However, the potential for toxicities with significant reduction in quality of life and lack of curative outcomes has to be carefully weighed against potential for benefit. Despite significant PFS prolongation observed in randomized clinical trials, most patients even with metastatic disease enjoy indolent courses with slow progression observed over years, wherein watchful waiting is still the preferred strategy. As advanced, progressive MTC is a rare and complex disease, a multidisciplinary approach centered in specialized centers providing interdisciplinary expertise in the individualization of available therapeutic options is preferred. In this review, we summarize current concepts of the molecular pathogenesis of advanced MTC and discuss results from clinical trials of targeted agents and also cytotoxic chemotherapy in the context of clinical implications and future perspectives.

### Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma: review of treatment protocols [^111v3yYQ]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is an orphan disease and in most patients fatal. So far no established treatment is available that prolongs survival. Several large retrospective studies have identified negative prognostic markers, analyzed efficacy of multimodal approaches such as radiotherapy with and without concurrent chemotherapy and chemotherapy protocols. Recently, single case reports have suggested some effectiveness of newer therapies targeting single somatic alterations in ATC. Overall, the conclusions that can be drawn from published retrospective studies and the scarce prospective approaches is that new treatment protocols should be developed including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy approaches and combinational therapy with immunotherapies. These protocols then need to be evaluated prospectively to improve ATC patients' outcome in routine care.

### Evolving approaches in managing radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer [^112veMUu]. Endocrine Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss the approach to care of patients with advanced differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), in particular those with radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory disease, and the transition to systemic treatment.

Methods

A PubMed search was conducted using the search terms "radioactive iodine-refractory, differentiated thyroid cancer and treatment" restricted to a 2000–2012 timeframe, English language, and humans. Relevant articles were identified from the bibliographies of selected references. Four patient cases are presented to illustrate the clinical course of RAI-refractory DTC.

Results

The current standard of care for early stage DTC could include surgery, RAI in some cases, and thyroid hormone suppression. For advanced RAI-refractory DTC, clinical practice guidelines established by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the American Thyroid Association recommend, as one option, the use of systemic therapy, including kinase inhibitors. Numerous trials are underway to evaluate the clinical benefit of these targeted therapies.

Conclusion

Preliminary results are encouraging with respect to the clinical benefit of targeted systemic therapies. However, at present there is no consensus on the criteria that define RAI-refractory disease and the optimal timing for transition to systemic therapy. There remains a need to establish common criteria to enhance patient care and enable better comparison across clinical studies.

### American Thyroid Association guidelines for management of patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer [^115j1tQR]. Thyroid (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare but highly lethal form of thyroid cancer. Rapid evaluation and establishment of treatment goals are imperative for optimum patient management and require a multidisciplinary team approach. Here we present guidelines for the management of ATC. The development of these guidelines was supported by the American Thyroid Association (ATA), which requested the authors, members the ATA Taskforce for ATC, to independently develop guidelines for ATC.

Methods

Relevant literature was reviewed, including serial PubMed searches supplemented with additional articles. The quality and strength of recommendations were adapted from the Clinical Guidelines Committee of the American College of Physicians, which in turn was developed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation workshop.

Results

The guidelines include the diagnosis, initial evaluation, establishment of treatment goals, approaches to locoregional disease (surgery, radiotherapy, systemic therapy, supportive care during active therapy), approaches to advanced/metastatic disease, palliative care options, surveillance and long-term monitoring, and ethical issues including end of life. The guidelines include 65 recommendations.

Conclusions

These are the first comprehensive guidelines for ATC and provide recommendations for management of this extremely aggressive malignancy. Patients with stage IVA/IVB resectable disease have the best prognosis, particularly if a multimodal approach (surgery, radiation, systemic therapy) is used, and some stage IVB unresectable patients may respond to aggressive therapy. Patients with stage IVC disease should be considered for a clinical trial or hospice/palliative care, depending upon their preference.

### Contemporary management of thyroid cancer [^115G6tBa]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2005). Low credibility.

Thyroid cancer is a relatively common and frequently curable malignant neoplasm, accounting for nearly 2% of all new cancers diagnosed annually in the United States. The diagnostic and management options have evolved considerably in the past decade, and a current understanding of these trends in the standard of care have assumed an important consideration in the practices of head and neck surgeons and endocrinologists alike. We sought to review the epidemiology and pathology of the several types of thyroid cancer and to present our evidence-based management algorithm. Every effort was made to offer alternative treatment strategies and supporting data where available. In addition to reviewing well-established approaches to diagnosis and management, emphasis is placed on newer techniques, including minimally invasive thyroidectomy, molecular detection of disease propensity, and the use of recombinant thyrotropin prior to radioiodine ablation.

### Evolution of anaplastic thyroid cancer management: perspectives in the era of precision oncology [^115qEdSA]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Anaplastic thyroid cancer is a rare aggressive malignancy resulting in poor outcomes, including significant morbidity and mortality. Historically, the overall survival of patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer has been less than 12 months. Multidisciplinary approaches combining surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy have been implemented to control this ominous disease. The evolution in science and technology has promoted deeper knowledge in the genetic pathways and mechanisms driving advance thyroid cancer. Furthermore, understanding molecular pathways resulted in the application of antineoplastic agents used in other tumors to thyroid cancer and the development of new highly selective drugs. A major landmark in anaplastic thyroid cancer management history was recently reached with the approval of BRAF and MEK inhibitor combination, specifically dabrafenib and trametinib for BRAF-mutated anaplastic thyroid cancer; this treatment has improved survival and outcomes in this population. Similarly, newer kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy are further shifting advanced thyroid cancer management to consider as first-line therapy inhibiting actionable oncogenic alterations. Therefore, newer treatment paradigms are incorporating molecular testing to provide personalized cancer care in anaplastic thyroid cancer. In this review, the principal aim is to provide an overview of the available international data on tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy in the management of anaplastic thyroid cancer.

Metastatic disease and systemic therapy

Patients with thyroid cancer who have locally advanced disease and/or distant metastases, and are not amenable to surgery, minimally invasive locoregional treatments or RAI, may warrant systemic therapy. The choice of whether and when to treat should be individual to each patient, and informed by a range of factors, including patient performance status, clinical manifestations of disease (because side-effects of medicinal therapy may significantly affect daily activities in an otherwise asymptomatic patient), tumour burden and site (with lesions likely to cause signs and symptoms of disease being referred for treatment), documented and significant structural disease progression(as a significant proportion of patients may have spontaneous and prolonged stability of disease), and risk of disease progression based on tumour aggressiveness (poorly differentiated or undifferentiated malignancies).

Thus, the risks and benefits of systemic therapy should be weighed carefully after MDT assessment. The treatment landscape for advanced thyroid cancer has changed significantly in the past decade. A number of MKIs have entered clinical practice for the treatment of DTC (lenvatinib and sorafenib as first-line therapies; cabozantinib as second-line therapy) and MTC (cabozantinib and vandetanib). More recently, the therapeutic options for DTC, PDTC, ATC, and MTC have been further enriched with new drugs, including selective targeted therapies for tumours harbouring driver, actionable mutations (for example mutations in BRAF, NTRK, and RET) and immunotherapy. Currently, the optimal treatment sequence and decision-making algorithm is based on regulatory constraints, expected treatment response, and drug safety profile. It is worth noting that the potential of novel therapies to reduce tumour volume is also paving the way for the use of these drugs in a neoadjuvant setting. Evidence for specific subtypes is discussed in the following sections.

Other novel agents — agents without established efficacy in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) should be used primarily within the context of therapeutic clinical trials (Strong recommendation, Low-quality evidence). At the time of writing, only kinase inhibitors have shown sufficient promise to consider use other than within the context of therapeutic clinical trials. Agents of particular interest include BRAF kinase inhibitors because papillary thyroid cancer frequently harbors the constitutively activating BRAF V600E mutation and these inhibitors have already shown efficacy and been approved for use in BRAF mutant melanoma; however, data developed to date do not yet favor the use of these novel approaches over use of VEGFR-directed kinase inhibitors unless within therapeutic clinical trials or as "salvage" after disease progression despite prior VEGFR-directed kinase inhibitor therapy.

Follicular and papillary thyroid cancers are sometimes treated with radioactive iodine therapy. RAI is taken by mouth and collects in any remaining thyroid tissue, including thyroid cancer cells that have spread to other places in the body. Since only thyroid tissue takes up iodine, the RAI destroys thyroid tissue and thyroid cancer cells without harming other tissue. Before a full treatment dose of RAI is given, a small test-dose is given to see if the tumor takes up the iodine. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. See Drugs Approved for Thyroid Cancer for more information.

### Clinical, safety, and economic evidence in radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer: a systematic literature review [^116x97oG]. Thyroid (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) comprising ~93% of all thyroid cancers. While most cases of DTC are curable with the use of surgery and radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation of the remaining thyroid remnant, prognosis is dire and treatment options limited when DTC becomes RAI-refractory (RAI-R). Standard cytotoxic chemotherapy has limited efficacy, making enrollment in clinical trials of novel targeted therapies the preferred treatment approach. Thus, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review of the clinical trial scientific literature with a focus on efficacy, safety, and economics to identify all potential treatment options that have been or are currently being evaluated for the treatment of RAI-R DTC.

Methods

Embase.com (including Medline), Medline In-Process and other nonindexed citations, the Cochrane Libraries, ClinicalTrials.gov, and relevant recent conference proceedings were searched using predefined search criteria. Important inclusion criteria included English language, randomized controlled studies or interventional single-arm studies only, and studies of drug therapies only. Search results were screened utilizing the discretion of multiple researchers, and key data were abstracted.

Results

Forty-five unique trials (16 full-text, 4 conference abstracts, and 25 ClinicalTrials.gov entries) were included in the clinical review. No studies that met criteria for inclusion in the economic review were identified. Among 20 trials with results available, all were Phase II and only one was randomized. The most commonly studied drugs were tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs); other drugs included celecoxib, doxorubicin with interferon alpha-2b, rosiglitazone, selumetinib (AZD6244), thalidomide, VEGF trap, and vorinostat. Overall, efficacy and safety profiles were specific to treatment regimen, with objective response rates (ORR) ranging from 0% on gefitinib, rosiglitazone, VEGF trap, and vorinostat to 50% on lenvatinib, a TKI.

Conclusions

Limited clinical research and no economic research has been conducted in RAI-R DTC. Certain treatments, notably TKIs, have shown promise in Phase II trials, and two Phase III randomized placebo-controlled trials are ongoing. New research on the economic and humanistic burden of RAI-R DTC must be paired with the clinical evidence currently in development to examine the existing burden and future promise in treating patients with RAI-R DTC.

### Evolving molecularly targeted therapies for advanced-stage thyroid cancers [^111JSHVE]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Increased understanding of disease-specific molecular targets of therapy has led to the regulatory approval of two drugs (vandetanib and cabozantinib) for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), and two agents (sorafenib and lenvatinib) for the treatment of radioactive- iodine refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) in both the USA and in the EU. The effects of these and other therapies on overall survival and quality of life among patients with thyroid cancer, however, remain to be more-clearly defined. When applied early in the disease course, intensive multimodality therapy seems to improve the survival outcomes of patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), but salvage therapies for ATC are of uncertain benefit. Additional innovative, rationally designed therapeutic strategies are under active development both for patients with DTC and for patients with ATC, with multiple phase II and phase III randomized clinical trials currently ongoing. Continued effort is being made to identify further signalling pathways with potential therapeutic relevance in thyroid cancers, as well as to elaborate on the complex interactions between signalling pathways, with the intention of translating these discoveries into effective and personalized therapies. Herein, we summarize the progress made in molecular medicine for advanced-stage thyroid cancers of different histotypes, analyse how these developments have altered - and might further refine - patient care, and identify open questions for future research.

### ASO author reflections: toward better outcomes in poorly differentiated thyroid cancer: evaluating adjuvant radiotherapy, treatment-related morbidity, and future therapeutic directions [^117BLDyN]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Future

Improving outcomes for patients with PDTC requires enhanced understanding of tumor biology, standardization of current treatments, and development of novel therapies. These challenges are similar to the ones faced in the treatment of anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). International consortia could address critical clinical questions through prospective databases and trials, evaluating therapies like IMRT, 131 I, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Although genomic studies exist, comprehensive integrative analyses linking biology to clinical outcomes remain limited. Collaborative research could significantly accelerate clinical trials, optimize existing treatments, introduce new therapeutic options, and ultimately enhance patient outcomes in rare and aggressive forms of thyroid cancer.

Systemic therapy — differentiated thyroid carcinoma: Systemic therapy can be considered for tumors that are not surgically resectable; are not responsive to iodine-131; are not amenable to RT or other local therapies; and have clinically significant structural disease progression during the last 6 to 12 months. Overall, traditional cytotoxic systemic chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin, has minimal efficacy in patients with metastatic differentiated thyroid disease, whereas clinical trials suggest that kinase inhibitors have a clinical benefit (partial response plus stable disease) in 50% to 60% of patients, usually for about 12 to 24 months. Lenvatinib is the preferred systemic therapy option for the treatment of patients with RAI-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer.

### New therapeutic advances in the management of progressive thyroid cancer [^117Qw7CY]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

The spectrum of thyroid cancers ranges from one of the most indolent to one of the most aggressive solid tumors identified. Conventional therapies for thyroid cancers are based on the histologic type of thyroid cancers such as papillary or follicular thyroid cancer (differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC)), medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), or anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). While surgery is one of the key treatments for all such types of thyroid cancers, additional therapies vary. Effective targeted therapy for DTC is a decades-old practice with systemic therapies of thyroid stimulating hormone suppression and radioactive iodine therapy. However, for the iodine-refractory DTC, MTC, and ATC there is no effective systemic standard of care treatment. Recent advances in understanding pathogenesis of DTC and development of molecular targeted therapy have dramatically transformed the field of clinical research in thyroid cancer. Over the last five years, incredible progress has been made and phases I-III clinical trials have been conducted in various types of thyroid cancers with some remarkable results that has made an impact on lives of patients with thyroid cancer. Such history-making events have boosted enthusiasm and interest among researchers, clinicians, patients, and sponsors and we anticipate ongoing efforts to develop more effective and safe therapies for thyroid cancer.

### 2021 American Thyroid Association guidelines for management of patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer [^113r93kv]. Thyroid (2021). High credibility.

Recommendations — targeted systemic therapy in anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC): In NTRK or RET fusion ATC patients with stage IVC disease, we suggest initiation of a TRK inhibitor (either larotrectinib or entrectinib) or RET inhibitor (selpercatinib or pralsetinib), preferably in a clinical trial, if available. In IVC ATC patients with high PD-L1 expression, checkpoint (PD-L1, PD1) inhibitors can be considered first-line therapy in the absence of other targetable alterations or as later line therapy, preferably in the context of a clinical trial. In metastatic ATC patients lacking other therapeutic options including clinical trials, we suggest cytotoxic chemotherapy including a taxane and/or an anthracycline or taxane with or without cis- or carbo-platin.

### Evolution of anaplastic thyroid cancer management: perspectives in the era of precision oncology [^111KMUvZ]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Anaplastic thyroid cancer is a rare aggressive malignancy resulting in poor outcomes, including significant morbidity and mortality. Historically, the overall survival of patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer has been less than 12months. Multidisciplinary approaches combining surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy have been implemented to control this ominous disease. The evolution in science and technology has promoted deeper knowledge in the genetic pathways and mechanisms driving advance thyroid cancer. Furthermore, understanding molecular pathways resulted in the application of antineoplastic agents used in other tumors to thyroid cancer and the development of new highly selective drugs. A major landmark in anaplastic thyroid cancer management history was recently reached with the approval of BRAF and MEK inhibitor combination, specifically dabrafenib and trametinib for BRAF-mutated anaplastic thyroid cancer; this treatment has improved survival and outcomes in this population. Similarly, newer kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy are further shifting advanced thyroid cancer management to consider as first-line therapy inhibiting actionable oncogenic alterations. Therefore, newer treatment paradigms are incorporating molecular testing to provide personalized cancer care in anaplastic thyroid cancer. In this review, the principal aim is to provide an overview of the available international data on tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy in the management of anaplastic thyroid cancer.

American Thyroid Association (ATA) differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) guidelines — aim and scope emphasize adult care, shared decision-making, and multidisciplinary coordination; the objective is to inform stakeholders regarding the diagnosis and treatment of adult patients (over 18 years of age) with DTC, and this document applies only to patients with DTC. In-office decisions are made jointly by patients and clinicians, and when multiple disciplines are involved, a transdisciplinary approach is recommended; however, the guidelines should not be interpreted as a replacement for clinical judgment. The task force decided a priori not to focus on economic resources within specific recommendations but includes financial toxicity as an emerging area. The guideline also notes international variation and highlights the importance of clarifying evidential uncertainties with additional research.

### Improved survival of advanced-stage anaplastic thyroid cancer with systemic therapy [^115L778u]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

ATC represents just 2% of thyroid malignancies yet accounts for 50% of the thyroid cancer mortalities. This aggressive disease frequently presents with advanced metastases and invasion, conferring a dire prognosis. Currently, medical management guidelines are limited for ATC. However, emerging targeted and immunotherapies may provide new avenues for improving ATC outcomes. Our investigation of 41 advanced‐stage ATC patients, with a higher than usual cohort 5‐year survival rate of 23%, helps address potential therapeutic directions; Dabrafenib, Trametinib, Lenvatinib, and Pembrolizumab seem particularly impactful and warrant further study. Finally, this study demonstrated a significant survival benefit with targeted therapy and immunotherapy, supporting consideration of these options alongside conventional treatments.

### Molecularly targeted therapies for thyroid cancers [^111Huqzq]. Endocrine Practice (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the emerging evidence that therapies targeting key oncogenic and signaling kinases can be effective in treatment of advanced thyroid carcinomas.

Methods

With use of PubMed and Google Scholar, a systematic review was performed of publications and scientific presentations summarizing pertinent clinical trials.

Results

Studies of numerous inhibitors of BRAF, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, and RET kinases indicate that patients with progressive or metastatic thyroid carcinoma can benefit from therapy with these novel agents. Severe toxic effects, however, are associated with these treatments, and caution is recommended in their use.

Conclusion

Further trials and identification of improved therapeutic targeting should lead to development of more effective treatments of thyroid carcinomas.

Multidisciplinary team

Optimal advanced thyroid cancer treatment goes way beyond the selection of an optimal surgical operation, leading to a disease-free neck, but also encompasses adjuvant therapy options after operation, and neoadjuvant treatment in some patients. As new therapeutic modalities for advanced thyroid cancer are constantly emerging, the need for evidence-based and competence-based decisions requires the assembly of a MDT to offer an individualized approach for each patient.

A MDT should consist of endocrinologists, endocrine/head and neck surgeons, nuclear medicine physicians, oncologists, radiotherapists, pathologists, and radiologists. For selected patients, thoracic, vascular, and/or other specialists should be invited to participate in the discussion. The MDT should be approved by the hospital and local authorities, and convene on a regular basis.

Tumour board representatives should follow the patient in the preoperative setting, evaluating all the diagnostic and molecular tests, make proposals on optimal treatment strategies, and plan follow-up and adjuvant therapy based on surgical findings, histology results, and patient preferences.

It is proposed that patients with advanced thyroid cancer are referred to tertiary institutions, holding multidisciplinary tumour boards, to be evaluated before any intervention is scheduled.

Statement 12: Patients with advanced thyroid cancer must be evaluated before and after surgery by a MDT, optimally consisting of an endocrinologist, endocrine/head and neck surgeon, nuclear medicine physician, oncologist, radiotherapist, pathologist, and radiologist.

Consensus: Yes (8.12)
Outliers: 3
Evidence level: Low

### Advances in chemotherapy of differentiated epithelial and medullary thyroid cancers [^112hqNzo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Context

Systemic chemotherapies for advanced or metastatic thyroid carcinomas have been of only limited effectiveness. For patients with differentiated or medullary carcinomas unresponsive to conventional treatments, novel therapies are needed to improve disease outcomes.

Evidence Acquisition

The PubMed and Google Scholar search engines were used to identify publications and peer-reviewed meeting presentations addressing chemotherapy and targeted therapy for differentiated or medullary carcinoma.

Evidence Synthesis

Multiple novel therapies primarily targeting angiogenesis have entered clinical trials for metastatic thyroid carcinoma. Partial response rates up to 30% have been reported in single agent studies, but prolonged disease stabilization is more commonly seen. The most successful agents target the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, with potential targets including the mutant kinases associated with papillary and medullary oncogenesis. Two drugs approved for other malignancies, sorafenib and sunitinib, have had promising preliminary results reported, and are being used selectively for patients who do not qualify for clinical trials. Randomized trials for several agents are underway that may lead to eventual drug approval for thyroid cancer.

Conclusion

Treatment for patients with metastatic or advanced thyroid carcinoma now emphasizes clinical trial opportunities for novel agents with considerable promise. Alternative options now exist for use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are well tolerated and may prove worthy of regulatory approval for this disease.

Cytotoxic chemotherapy in RAI-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer — evidence summary: Although doxorubicin was approved for use in thyroid cancer by the US FDA in 1974 and has some utility in anaplastic thyroid cancer, cytotoxic chemotherapy has historically produced disappointing results when used to treat RAI-refractory DTC. Cytotoxic chemotherapy, however, may have selective benefit in patients unresponsive to kinase inhibitors and perhaps also in some patients with poorly differentiated thyroid cancer. Data are limited and primarily anecdotal. Too few data exist to recommend specific cytotoxic regimens, and use within the context of a therapeutic clinical trial is preferred.

### Thyroid cancer [^1169R12u]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Thyroid cancer is the fifth most common cancer in women in the USA, and an estimated over 62000 new cases occurred in men and women in 2015. The incidence continues to rise worldwide. Differentiated thyroid cancer is the most frequent subtype of thyroid cancer and in most patients the standard treatment (surgery followed by either radioactive iodine or observation) is effective. Patients with other, more rare subtypes of thyroid cancer-medullary and anaplastic-are ideally treated by physicians with experience managing these malignancies. Targeted treatments that are approved for differentiated and medullary thyroid cancers have prolonged progression-free survival, but these drugs are not curative and therefore are reserved for patients with progressive or symptomatic disease.

Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) — systemic therapy options and supportive care include pralsetinib (category 2B) for patients with RET-mutation positive disease, while other small-molecule kinase inhibitors (sorafenib, sunitinib, lenvatinib, pazopanib) may be considered if clinical trials or the NCCN-preferred systemic therapy options are not available or are not appropriate. If the patient progresses on a preferred option, systemic chemotherapy can be administered using dacarbazine or combinations including dacarbazine. Pembrolizumab is also an option for patients with TMB-H (≥ 10 mut/Mb) disease and for MSI-H or dMMR tumors that have progressed following prior treatment with no satisfactory treatment options (useful in certain circumstances). EBRT can be used for local symptoms; intravenous bisphosphonate therapy or denosumab can be considered for bone metastases; and best supportive care is also recommended.

More options than ever before are currently available for medical therapy in patients who present with advanced thyroid cancer or develop surgically unresectable recurrences or symptomatic or progressive disease. The newer medical therapies have addressed the need to find effective therapies beyond the conventional treatment with radioactive iodine, thyroid stimulating hormone suppression, and palliative cytotoxic chemotherapy for patients with advanced thyroid cancer. Although tumor responses to these medical therapies vary by type of thyroid cancer and type of therapy selected, they remain encouraging and provide therapeutic options for selected patients while new drugs are in development.

### Targeting BRAF in thyroid cancer [^116i7rQZ]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Thyroid cancer incidence is increasing throughout the world. Although this appears to be due largely to enhanced detection of early thyroid cancers by the more generalised use of thyroid ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration, the number of patients who succumb to this disease is also rising annually. Thyroid cancer therapy is based on a three-pronged approach that includes thyroidectomy, and in more aggressive cases, radioactive iodine therapy and suppression of thyrotropin (TSH) levels using levothyroxine. This regimen achieves outstanding long-term survival rates for most patients with thyroid cancer, particularly for the majority diagnosed with early-stage disease. However, for the subset of patients who do not respond to this treatment paradigm, or who present with aggressive primary tumours, therapeutic options are relatively limited and long-term survival rates are low. Treatment using cytotoxic chemotherapy has been largely unsuccessful and although external beam radiation has been shown to be helpful in palliation, cure is rarely achieved. Therefore, developing new approaches to treating patients with aggressive and/or progressive thyroid cancers is an important avenue of research that requires identification of appropriate molecular therapeutic targets.

Over the past few years, it has become evident that aberrant signalling through the RAS–RAF–MEK cascade is crucial for the development of thyroid cancer. In the case of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), the subtype that accounts for more than 80% of all thyroid cancers, mutations and/or gene rearrangements in cell surface receptors or signalling molecules in this cascade occur in ∼70% of cases and are tumorigenic in vitro and in vivo (reviewed in). Of these abnormalities, activating mutations in BRAF (V600E) are particularly common in adults with PTC, accounting for approximately 45% of cases (reviewed in). Because BRAF is activated through multiple mechanisms in the majority of thyroid cancers (see Figure 1), there has been an interest in targeting BRAF for potential therapeutic benefit in patients with thyroid cancer.

Clinical trial referral in advanced or RAI-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer — Patients should be considered for referral to participate in prospective therapeutic clinical trials, and clinicians should review available treatment options and eligibility criteria with trial centers (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). Participation in a clinical trial should be considered when there is no effective or proven standard of care or when standard care is being compared with a promising investigational therapy; trials may be appropriate for RAI-refractory carcinoma that is locally advanced or metastatic when disease is progressive by RECIST criteria, especially after lenvatinib or sorafenib or when approved therapies are unaffordable; patients with targetable alterations such as BRAF mutations or PAX8/PPARγ or ALK rearrangements can also be considered. However, trial participation should not be considered for patients with stable, asymptomatic metastatic disease unless agents with significant likelihood of complete remission, prolongation of survival, or biologic impact such as redifferentiation are available. The guideline also notes limited evidence that enrollment in clinical trials is associated with lower overall cancer-specific mortality for common cancers, and states there is no evidence that participation is deleterious and it may be beneficial.

### New horizons: emerging therapies and targets in thyroid cancer [^111RJqWT]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The treatment of patients with progressive metastatic follicular cell-derived and medullary thyroid cancers that do not respond to standard therapeutic modalities presents a therapeutic challenge. As a deeper understanding of the molecular drivers for these tumors has occurred and more potent and specific compounds are developed, the number of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatments for thyroid cancer has expanded. In addition, with the advent of disease-agnostic target-directed FDA approvals an ever-broadening number of therapeutic options are available for clinicians and patients. However, to date, complete remissions are rare, the average durations of response are relatively modest, and toxicities are common. These factors accentuate the need for further understanding of the mechanisms of resistance that result in treatment failures, the development of biomarkers that can improve patient selection for treatment earlier in the disease process, and the continued need for new therapeutic strategies. In this article, recent approvals relevant to thyroid cancer will be discussed along with selected new potential avenues that might be exploited for future therapies.

### Thyroid cancer [^117FCR4U]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

The past 5–10 years have brought in a new era in the care of patients with thyroid cancer, with the introduction of transformative diagnostic and management options. Several international ultrasound-based thyroid nodule risk stratification systems have been developed with the goal of reducing unnecessary biopsies. Less invasive alternatives to surgery for low-risk thyroid cancer, such as active surveillance and minimally invasive interventions, are being explored. New systemic therapies are now available for patients with advanced thyroid cancer. However, in the setting of these advances, disparities exist in the diagnosis and management of thyroid cancer. As new management options are becoming available for thyroid cancer, it is essential to support population-based studies and randomised clinical trials that will inform evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of thyroid cancer, and to include diverse patient populations in research to better understand and subsequently address existing barriers to equitable thyroid cancer care.

### Stratified impact of therapies on anaplastic thyroid cancer outcomes in the pre-gene-targeted therapy era [^114Z4aqD]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), characterized by rapid progression and high mortality, presents significant treatment challenges. At diagnosis, 15–50% of patients with ATC present with locoregional invasion and distant metastases. Current therapies, albeit aggressive, yield a median overall survival (OS) of merely 3–5 months and a 20% 1-year survival rate, underscoring an urgent need for more effective interventions. While complete resection is the mainstay of therapeutic approaches for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), it is rarely suitable for patients with ATC at diagnosis, due to the extent of disease and the unfavorable prognosis of incomplete palliative resection.

With regard to therapeutic response for patients with ATC, most published reviews, series, and guidelines from the most updated European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO, 2019)and American Thyroid Association (ATA, 2021) guidelinesall advocate aggressive multimodality therapy in the absence of distant metastases. However, there is a lack of substantial backing evidence for these aggressive interventions, and estimates of their effectiveness remain inaccurate. On the other hand, targeted therapy represents a promising avenue in the treatment of patients with ATC, as it aims to exploit specific molecular abnormalities present within the tumor cells. Targeted inhibitors have shown the best efficacy thus far in a phase II clinical trial, for BRAF-mutated patients with ATC. These targeted inhibitors include dabrafenib and trametinib (D+T), other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), and anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) antibody immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Although targeted therapies have demonstrated potential, their integration into standard treatment algorithms has been slow, hindered by the lack of robust clinical trials and the pressing need for individualized treatment strategies. The absence of significant enhancement in OS rates for patients with ATC has necessitated a critical reassessment of baseline treatment approaches, which have been largely empirical, with limited evidence-based guidelines due to the disease's rapid progression and the challenges inherent in conducting randomized controlled trials.

The objective of this study was to categorize the therapeutic responses of patients with ATC to baseline treatment modalities, including surgery, chemotherapy, external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), and their combinations. By establishing a framework for understanding the response of patients with ATC to baseline treatment regimens, we seek to (1) provide evidence to support the practice of precision medicine in patients with ATC; and (2) build a comparison baseline for the efficacy of novel targeting and immune therapies in the future.

### 2021 American Thyroid Association guidelines for management of patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer [^111fCraq]. Thyroid (2021). High credibility.

American Thyroid Association — key steps in the management of anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) emphasize urgent diagnosis, coordinated multidisciplinary care, required staging, patient-centered counseling, and careful selection of surgical and nonsurgical options. Because ATC is a highly dedifferentiated cancer that retains few characteristics of noncancerous thyroid cells, attaining a definitive diagnosis can be challenging, yet critical, and time is also of the essence because of the very rapid growth rate of ATC and due to the importance of early intervention in minimizing catastrophic airway compromise; differential considerations/mimics can include primary thyroid lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck, and metastatic cancer, and early assessment of tumor mutations is key in expanding therapeutic options. Coordinate early multidisciplinary involvement of surgeons, radiation and medical oncologists, endocrinologists, and palliative care teams. Staging with imaging is required to classify as stage IVA, IVB, IVC; this is best done with FDG PET/CT (fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography) and/or alternately with dedicated body CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), and extent of local invasion must also be evaluated in parallel to assist in surgical decision-making, and requires laryngoscopy. Counseling must be provided by a team/individuals skilled in the surgical, medical, and palliative management of complex thyroid malignancies, and this counseling should involve not only the patient but also involve supportive individuals/family members. The primary goals in stages IVA and IVB ATC patients within an aggressive approach to their care are complete resection and prompt transition to adjuvant definitive-intention therapy, as long-term survival may be attainable; thus, surgical procedures should not generate a wound or result in complications that would prevent chemotherapy and radiation onset. In IVC ATC, the limited benefit resulting from surgery must be carefully tempered in consideration of other available palliative approaches, including radiation and systemic therapy. Given the historically dire prognosis of ATC, especially if stage IVC, hospice should always be presented among care options, and for some patients, hospice may be preferable — even from the outset — in comparison with other alternative care options.

### Systemic therapies for medullary thyroid carcinoma: state of the art [^114RNVSb]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

The epidemiology of MTC reflects its rarity among thyroid malignancies. In the United States, it is estimated that approximately 1200 new cases of MTC are diagnosed each year and account for less than 5% of all thyroid cancers. Despite its low prevalence, MTC is responsible for 13% of deaths attributed to thyroid cancer, highlighting its aggressive nature and significant impact on mortality within the thyroid cancer population. Furthermore, approximately 10.5% of patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma have MTC.– The prognosis for patients with MTC is generally poor, particularly for those with metastatic disease. The 10-year survival rate for patients with metastatic MTC is only 21%.

Over the past decade, the landscape of systemic treatment for MTC has evolved significantly with the introduction of several targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). These agents, which include the FDA-approved multikinase inhibitors (MKI) vandetanib, cabozantinib, and the highly selective RET inhibitor, selpercatinib, have demonstrated improved progression-free survival (PFS) and, in some cases, overall survival compared to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. The approval of these TKIs has provided clinicians with more effective systemic treatment options for patients with advanced, progressive, or metastatic MTC. Despite the progress made with targeted therapies, the management of MTC remains challenging, and the prognosis for patients with advanced disease remains guarded. Ongoing research is focused on identifying additional therapeutic targets, exploring combination strategies, and optimizing the use of existing treatments to further improve outcomes for patients with this rare and aggressive form of thyroid cancer.

This review will provide a comprehensive overview of the current systemic treatment options for MTC, focusing on the efficacy, safety, and practical considerations for utilizing these therapies in clinical practice. By summarizing the available evidence and highlighting the evolving treatment landscape, this review aims to assist clinicians in the optimal management of patients with advanced, progressive, or metastatic MTC.

Introduction

Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy and consists of a diverse group of histological entities. Although ranging from indolent and well differentiated to aggressive and rapidly developing carcinomas, advanced disease may present in each histological subtype. Even though the characteristics of advanced thyroid cancer are recognized intuitively by experienced surgeons in the field, a common definition among scientific societies is yet to be reached. General definitions of advanced disease are included in the broader management guidelines for each cancer subtype, such as the American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). In the European setting, the 2019 European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelineon thyroid cancer includes a subsection on the management of advanced disease for each thyroid cancer type. Given the recent progress and new developments in targeted therapy, depending on the genetic alterations of the tumour, new interest has emerged in better defining advanced thyroid disease and selecting candidates for tailored therapy, either in an adjuvant systemic or neoadjuvant setting. This is reflected in the most recent published position statement by the American Head and Neck Society (AHNS) and International Thyroid Oncology Group, as well as the clinical practice guidelines update by ESMO for the use of systemic therapy in advanced thyroid cancer. Nevertheless, existing efforts to define advanced thyroid cancer and to produce management guidelines have been burdened by a common denominator, the lack of high-quality evidence, especially regarding definitions and surgical management.

In May 2023, the European Society of Endocrine Surgeons (ESES) organized the 10th biennial conference with the topic 'Consensus meeting on advanced endocrine malignancies', in Mainz (Germany). One working group was tasked to evaluate the current evidence on advanced thyroid carcinoma, and to produce a position statement to be discussed and voted for by the ESES assembly at the Mainz conference. The members of this working group are the authors of the present manuscript.

Good practice statements — advanced disease management and clinical trials in ATC state that patients with BRAF wild-type (BRAF "negative" or unknown mutation status) IVB unresectable or metastatic ATC not receiving chemoradiation should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials. Therapeutic decision-making in progressive disease after initial therapy is very complex and not easily defined by an algorithmic approach; in this setting, care guided by an expert in ATC therapeutics is best pursued. As prognosis is dire in metastatic and progressive ATC, best supportive care (hospice) should also be discussed as an option.

Systemic therapy

Systemic therapy might be considered after surgical and radiation therapy options have been exhausted. Although doxorubicin and other chemotherapy agents have been used in advanced DTC, they have been largely replaced by newer kinase inhibitors. The molecular pathways involved in DTC pathogenesis forms the basis of multikinase inhibitor therapy. Sorafenib and lenvatinib are US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive radioiodine refractory (RAIR) DTC. Although the DECISION trial reported no significant difference in overall survival between the sorafenib treatment and placebo groups, there was an objective response rate of 12.2%, and median progression-free survival of 10.8 months in the treatment group compared with 5.8 months in the placebo group. Results of the SELECT trial demonstrated a 64.8% response rate and a median progression-free survival of 18.3 months in the lenvatinib treatment group compared with 3.6 months in the placebo group. – More recently, selpercatinib was approved by the FDA for patients 12 years of age and older with advanced or metastatic RET fusion-positive RAIR thyroid cancer requiring systemic therapy. The LIBRETTO-001 trial showed a 79% objective response rate for selpercatinib in 19 previously treated RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer patients, with a 1-year progression-free survival rate of 64%. Because RET mutations occur rarely in DTC, the majority of patients in this study (n = 162) had a diagnosis of medullary thyroid cancer. Other agents under investigation include axitinib, pazopanib, and sunitinib. Kinase inhibitor therapy is often limited by its side-effect profile, which includes nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, hand-foot syndrome, hypertension, and QTc prolongation, so medical comorbidities should be assessed prior to therapy. Although significant, treatment-emergent hypertension in lenvatinib therapy has been correlated with improved outcomes. Moreover, tumors eventually develop resistance to kinase inhibitor therapy through an escape mechanism, reducing the efficacy of therapy. Kinase inhibitors should therefore be discontinued once there is no longer a net benefit. Immune checkpoint blockade is also being explored in advanced DTC. Active interventional clinical trials investigating the role of anti-PD-1 inhibitors alone or in combination with other agents include [identifier: NCT02628067]: Pembrolizumab (KEYNOTE 158), [identifier: NCT03360890]: Pembrolizumab + Docetaxel (iPRIME), and [identifier: NCT03914300]: Cabozantinib + Nivolumab + Ipilimumab (CaboNivoIpi).

### Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma: an overview [^111eAfC5]. Current Oncology Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Thyroid cancer is an uncommon malignancy that accounts for roughly 1% of all new cancers. Although anaplastic lesions constitute fewer than 5% of thyroid cancers, they represent over half of thyroid cancer-related deaths. The relative rarity of anaplastic thyroid cancer, its aggressive nature, and its rapidly fatal course have contributed to the difficulty in developing effective treatment for this disease. Radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery are rarely curative, but combinations of these modalities appear to offer greater benefit than any single treatment. New treatment modalities are desperately required, and promising molecular-based therapies are being investigated.

### Thyroid carcinoma [^114dnTDM]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Thyroid carcinomas are fairly uncommon and include disease types that range from indolent localised papillary carcinomas to the fulminant and lethal anaplastic disease. Several attempts to formulate a consensus about treatment of thyroid carcinoma have resulted in published guidelines for diagnosis and initial disease management. Multimodality treatments are widely recommended, although there is little evidence from prospective trials to support this approach. Surgical resection to achieve local disease control remains the cornerstone of primary treatment for most thyroid cancers, and is often followed by adjuvant radioiodine treatment for papillary and follicular types of disease. Thyroid hormone replacement therapy is used not only to rectify postsurgical hypothyroidism, but also because there is evidence to suggest that high doses that suppress thyroid stimulating hormone prevent disease recurrence in patients with papillary or follicular carcinomas. Treatment for progressive metastatic disease is often of limited benefit, and there is a pressing need for novel approaches in treatment of patients at high risk of disease-related death. In families with inherited thyroid cancer syndromes, early diagnosis and intervention based on genetic testing might prevent poor disease outcomes. Care should be carefully coordinated by members of an experienced multidisciplinary team, and patients should be provided with education about diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options to allow them to make informed contributions to decisions about their care.

### Standard and emerging therapies for metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer [^114rUV2H]. The Oncologist (2010). Low credibility.

Differentiated thyroid cancer accounts for > 90% of cases of thyroid cancer, with most patients having an excellent prognosis. Distant metastases occur in 10%-15% of patients, decreasing the overall 10-year survival rate in this group to 40%. Radioactive iodine has been the mainstay of treatment for distant metastases, with good results when lesions retain the ability to take up iodine. For patients with metastatic disease resistant to radioactive iodine, treatment options are few and survival is poor. Chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy have been used in these patients, but with disappointing results. In recent years, our understanding of the molecular pathways involved in thyroid cancer has increased and a number of molecular targets have been identified. These targets include the proto-oncogenes BRAF and RET, known to be common mutations in thyroid cancer; vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor, associated with angiogenesis; and the sodium-iodide symporter, with the aim of restoring its expression and hence radioactive iodine uptake. There are now multiple trials of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, angiogenesis inhibitors, and other novel agents available to patients with metastatic thyroid cancer. This review discusses both traditional and novel treatments for metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer with a particular focus on emerging treatments for patients with radioactive iodine-refractory disease.

### Screening for thyroid cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114yDPY4]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Harms and treatment — The USPSTF found inadequate direct evidence to assess the harms of screening for thyroid cancer in asymptomatic persons and found adequate evidence to bound the magnitude of the overall harms of screening and treatment as at least moderate, based on adequate evidence of serious harms of treatment of thyroid cancer and evidence that overdiagnosis and overtreatment are likely consequences of screening. Surgery (ie, total or partial thyroidectomy, with or without lymphadenectomy) is the main treatment for thyroid cancer; additional treatment, including radioactive iodine therapy, may be indicated depending on postoperative disease status, tumor stage, and type of thyroid cancer, and external-beam radiation therapy and chemotherapy are not generally used to treat early-stage, differentiated thyroid cancer.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: thyroid carcinoma, version 1.2025 [^111GHSz4]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Thyroid carcinoma — systemic therapy selection for progressive or symptomatic metastatic disease. For clinically progressive or symptomatic disease, systemic therapy should be considered, with options including lenvatinib (preferred) or sorafenib, clinical trials, other small-molecule kinase inhibitors if a trial is not available, or resection of distant metastases and/or EBRT or IMRT. Lenvatinib and sorafenib are category 1 options based on phase 3 randomized trials, and lenvatinib is the preferred agent based on a response rate of 65% compared with 12% for sorafenib, although these agents have not been directly compared; choice should be individualized, and efficacy for brain metastases has not been established so consultation with neurosurgeons and radiation oncologists is recommended.
