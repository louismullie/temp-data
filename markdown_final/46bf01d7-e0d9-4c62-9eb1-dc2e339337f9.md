## Question

Can topical corticosteroids be used for otomycosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether topical corticosteroids can be used for otomycosis and, if so, under what circumstances they should be used safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what current guidelines and systematic reviews say about first-line therapy for otomycosis. Then, I should verify any theoretical or symptomatic rationale for adding a steroid and weigh it against immunological risks in fungal disease. Next, I will examine direct evidence specific to steroid use in otomycosis. After that, I need to check anatomic and safety considerations such as tympanic membrane status and systemic absorption. Finally, I will synthesize scenario-based recommendations and confirm whether commonly available combination otic products are appropriate for fungal disease before concluding with a cautious, evidence-based bottom line.

> Let me first confirm the foundational management of otomycosis. Otomycosis is most often due to Aspergillus or Candida species, typically presents with pruritus, otorrhea, and discomfort, and is managed with meticulous aural toilet plus topical antifungals or boric acid solutions as the cornerstone of therapy, with no corticosteroid requirement in guideline statements for noninvasive Aspergillus otitis externa; this is specifically recommended in the 2016 IDSA aspergillosis guideline and supported by clinical reviews and a Cochrane review of topical azoles in otomycosis [^115GTyMD] [^115YTLxE] [^117RDHee].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about steroids before articulating the proposed rationale. The theoretical appeal is that a topical steroid could reduce canal edema, pruritus, and pain, potentially improving patient comfort and facilitating antifungal penetration, which aligns with the general anti-inflammatory use of topical corticosteroids in inflammatory dermatoses and other inflammatory otolaryngologic conditions, although that rationale does not automatically translate into safety or efficacy in fungal disease and needs careful verification against infection-control principles [^116gbFE5] [^114U9KpW].

> Wait, let me verify the cautions specific to fungal infections. A high-credibility 2024 clinical guideline on fungal keratitis explicitly advises that topical steroids should be avoided because they diminish antifungal efficacy and, if used alone, can worsen the condition, underscoring the broader immunologic concern that local steroids suppress cell-mediated defenses needed for fungal clearance; likewise, the FDA label for prednisone lists systemic fungal infection as a contraindication, reinforcing the general principle that corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression can exacerbate fungal disease, even though the anatomic site differs between cornea and ear canal [^113b5uuW] [^114TWGY7].

> Next, I should review direct evidence in otomycosis specifically. There is a prospective study comparing a steroid–antifungal combination, triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% with econazole 1% cream, against nystatin suspension in 786 patients; the combination reported higher clinical cure and better tolerability, but this is a single study with methodological limitations and low credibility grading in the provided materials, and notably evaluates steroid use only in combination with an active antifungal rather than as monotherapy, while older retrospective series and comparative reports emphasize topical antifungals without steroids as effective first-line therapy [^1159dXzQ] [^113pdmjK] [^117Qd7Q6].

> I need to check safety and anatomical considerations before recommending any steroid in the ear. If the tympanic membrane is perforated or tympanostomy tubes are present, non-ototoxic preparations should be selected, as recommended by AAO-HNSF for acute otitis externa, and one must be cautious that any topical steroid can be systemically absorbed across thin canal skin or via middle ear exposure, with FDA labeling for topical corticosteroids documenting risk of HPA axis suppression when barriers are compromised; additionally, prolonged topical anti-infective use can select for fungal overgrowth, so monitoring and timely reassessment are essential if symptoms persist [^114C4PPy] [^113gdoEf] [^111MLkBM].

> Let me synthesize this into clinical scenarios while I double-check the balance of benefits and risks. In immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated otomycosis and an intact tympanic membrane, the evidence-based baseline remains aural toilet plus a topical antifungal such as an azole, reserving any steroid exposure for severe inflammation only if combined with an effective antifungal, used briefly, and monitored closely; in immunocompromised hosts or when malignant fungal otitis externa or otomastoiditis is suspected, steroids should be avoided and aggressive antifungal therapy with debridement and, when indicated, systemic azoles is prioritized; if mixed bacterial and fungal infection is suspected, antibacterial therapy may be co-administered with antifungals, but steroid addition still requires caution and ongoing reassessment of fungal control [^115GTyMD] [^117RDHee] [^112GadBU].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought common otic steroid–antibiotic combinations might be helpful for symptomatic relief in otomycosis because they are standard for bacterial acute otitis externa; but hold on, I should verify the indication boundaries. Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension is supported for bacterial acute otitis externa and acute otitis media with tympanostomy tubes, with no evidence base for pure fungal otitis externa and no approval for otomycosis, so extrapolating these products to fungal disease would be a mistake without concomitant antifungal coverage and a specific rationale, reinforcing that if a steroid is considered at all in otomycosis, it must be paired with a proven topical antifungal and used for the shortest necessary duration [^1139wMdZ] [^115o9R8F].

> I should conclude clearly and verify alignment with the highest-quality sources. Topical corticosteroids are not recommended as first-line therapy or monotherapy for otomycosis; the mainstay is canal debridement plus topical antifungal therapy, with conditional, short-course use of a low-to-medium potency topical steroid considered only in immunocompetent patients with intact tympanic membranes when inflammation is severe and always in combination with an active antifungal, acknowledging this is off-label and supported by limited, low-credibility data; broadly, the risk that steroids can impair fungal clearance and obscure treatment failure argues for sparing use and close follow-up, and in high-risk scenarios such as perforation or immunocompromise, steroids should be avoided in favor of definitive antifungal management [^115GTyMD] [^117RDHee] [^113b5uuW].

No, topical steroids should **not be used alone** in otomycosis [^115N9TDv] because they suppress local immunity and can worsen fungal growth [^113b5uuW]. They may be used **only as adjuncts** to topical antifungals to reduce inflammation and pruritus, and should be avoided in immunocompromised patients or with tympanic membrane perforation. The primary treatment is mechanical debridement [^115GTyMD] and topical antifungals [^117RDHee]; steroids are not first-line [^115YTLxE] and should be used cautiously and briefly if needed.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

**IDSA guidelines** [^115GTyMD] recommend mechanical cleansing and topical antifungals or boric acid for noninvasive Aspergillus otitis externa (otomycosis) [^115N9TDv]. Steroids are **not recommended as primary therapy**; if considered, they should be used adjunctively with antifungals to reduce inflammation and pruritus.

---

## Risks and complications associated with topical steroids

Topical steroids can cause **significant complications** in otomycosis:

- **Immunosuppression**: Local suppression can worsen fungal growth [^113b5uuW] and delay healing.

- **Secondary infections**: Increased risk of bacterial superinfection.

- **Tympanic membrane perforation**: Higher risk with prolonged use.

- **Systemic absorption**: Potential HPA axis suppression [^113gdoEf], especially with prolonged use or large areas [^1169Qd1m].

---

## Clinical evidence and studies

- **Fungal keratitis**: Steroids reduce antifungal efficacy and worsen outcomes when used alone [^113b5uuW].

- **Ocular surface disease**: Prior steroid use [^1143SvTo] is linked to worse outcomes and more treatment failures.

- **Otomycosis**: No strong evidence supports steroids as primary therapy; antifungals remain first-line [^117RDHee] [^115YTLxE].

---

## Patient populations and clinical scenarios

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Avoid steroids due to higher risk of invasive disease and complications.

- **Tympanic membrane perforation**: Avoid steroids to prevent ototoxicity and further damage.

- **Refractory inflammation**: Consider short-term adjunctive steroids only with antifungals and close monitoring.

---

## Recommended treatment protocol

| **Step** | **Treatment** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Mechanical debridement | Remove fungal debris and improve drug penetration [^115GTyMD] |
| 2 | Topical antifungals (clotrimazole, miconazole, ketoconazole) | Primary therapy to eradicate fungi [^115GTyMD] [^117RDHee] |
| 3 | Adjunctive topical steroids (short-term, low-potency) | Reduce inflammation and pruritus only if needed |
| 4 | Patient education and follow-up | Prevent recurrence and monitor for complications [^115o9R8F] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Topical steroids are **not recommended as primary therapy** [^115N9TDv] for otomycosis because they cause local immunosuppression and increase the risk of complications [^113b5uuW]. They may be used short term as adjuncts to antifungals for severe inflammation, but should be avoided in immunocompromised patients or when the tympanic membrane is perforated. The **primary approach** is **mechanical debridement plus topical antifungals** [^117RDHee] [^115GTyMD]; use steroids cautiously and only when necessary.

### Fungal keratitis: Diagnosis, management, and recent advances [^113b5uuW]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

- **Medical therapy**: The use of antifungal medications is considered the main treatment for fungal keratitis. It is recommended to start antifungal therapy after confirmation of the clinical diagnosis with a smear or positive cultures. Topical application of antifungal medications is a mainstay for the treatment of fungal keratitis; however, systemic, intra-stromal, or intra-cameral routes may be used. Topical broad-spectrum antibiotics should be added to guard against superadded bacterial infection. Additionally, cycloplegic eye drops may be given to decrease pain and relieve associated iridocyclitis. In case of elevated intraocular pressure, anti-glaucoma medications should be added. Topical steroids should be avoided in fungal keratitis as they decrease the efficacy of antifungal medication when given together, and if used alone, they worsen the condition.

- **Topical antifungal agents**: Natamycin 5% is considered the first-line treatment for fungal keratitis and is the first approved antifungal medication. Initially, it should be given hourly until improvement is noticed by partial resolution of infiltration, then the frequency is reduced to two-hourly. After the resolution of the infection, natamycin should be continued for 2 weeks.

	- Voriconazole is an azole drug that is derived from fluconazole. It is proven to be a broad-spectrum antifungal for both filamentous and yeast fungi. Topical voriconazole 1% is not commercially available but may be prepared in the pharmacy. The minimal inhibitory concentration of voriconazole is 0.5 μg/mL, which is less than other imidazole drugs.

It is very important to use the ear drops for as long as the doctor has instructed, even if the symptoms improve. If ofloxacin otic solution ear drops are not used for the full course as instructed, the infection may be more likely to return.

- **Missed doses**: In patients with an ear canal infection ("Swimmer's Ear"), it is important that you take the drops every day. If you miss a dose, which may have been scheduled for earlier in the day (for example, 8 AM), you should take that day's dose as soon as possible and then return to your regular daily dosing schedule. In patients with a middle ear infection, if a dose of ofloxacin otic solution is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and resume the regular dosing schedule. Do not use a double dose unless the doctor has instructed you to do so. If the infection is not improved after one week, you should consult your doctor. If you have two or more episodes of drainage within six months, it is recommended that you see your doctor for further evaluation.

- **Activities to avoid**: It is important that the infected ear(s) remain clean and dry. When bathing, avoid getting the infected ear(s) wet. Avoid swimming unless the doctor has instructed otherwise.

### The development of antibiotic resistant organisms with the use of ototopical medications [^111dsHrJ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

There is growing concern over the use of systemic antibiotics and the development of bacterial resistance. The question remains as to whether ototopical medications may also promote antibiotic-resistant organisms, either on a local level (in the ear) or in other areas of the aerodigestive tract. We performed an evidence-based review to answer the following clinical question: "Do antibiotic ototopical medications induce antibiotic-resistant organisms?"

- **Study design**: We performed a MEDLINE search of the published literature from 1966 to the present. We used appropriate search terms to identify pertinent articles:
	- **Ototopical medications**: "ototopical antibiotics", "ototopical drops"
	- **Antibiotic resistance**: "antibiotic resistance", "otitis externa and resistant organisms", "otitis media and resistant organisms", "chronic suppurative otitis media and resistant organisms"
	- **Otitis externa**: "topical antibiotics and otitis externa", "otitis externa and treatment", "otitis externa and antibiotic drops", "otitis externa and ototopical drops"
	- **Otitis media**: "otitis media", "otitis media and treatment", "otitis media and antibiotic drops"
	- **Chronic suppurative otitis media**: "chronic suppurative otitis media", "chronic suppurative otitis media and treatment", "chronic suppurative otitis media and antibiotic drops"
	- **Other relevant terms**: "ophthalmic antibiotic drops", "draining ear", "P.E. tube otorrhea", "pressure equalizing tube otorrhea", "pressure equalizing tube otorrhea and treatment", "pressure equalizing tube otorrhea and ototopical therapy"

	These articles were reviewed and graded according to the evidence quality.

- **Results**: After an initial screening of over 2,500 articles, 38 articles were identified as relevant.

### Scedosporium apiospermum: A rare cause of malignant otitis externa [^115HtKMF]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

A 79-year-old man with a history of well-controlled diabetes mellitus presented with left-sided otalgia. Initially diagnosed with simple otitis externa, he was discharged on topical drops. He returned 2 months later with worsening otalgia and discharge. A diagnosis of malignant otitis externa was made based on clinical and radiological findings. Intravenous Tazocin and Gentamicin were administered based on previous bacterial culture from ear swabs.

The patient failed to improve and developed left-sided facial nerve palsy. His condition stabilized following a change in antimicrobial therapy, and his management continued in the community on intravenous Meropenem with twice-weekly aural toilet. Repeated nuclear medicine imaging failed to demonstrate resolution. A bony sequestration was removed from the external auditory canal in the outpatient clinic, which, following extended culture, grew Scedosporium apiospermum; his management was subsequently changed to oral Voriconazole. This led to rapid clinical improvement and disease resolution over a 6-week period.

### Topical versus systemic antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^1138CiiD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media, is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterized by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Antibiotics are the most common treatment for CSOM and aim to kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be administered both topically and systemically and can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as ear cleaning (aural toileting).

This is the first update of a review published in 2021. The update found no new studies. It is one of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of topical versus systemic antibiotics for people with CSOM.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). The latest search date was 15 June 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving adults and children who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The studies compared topical antibiotics versus systemic (oral, injection) antibiotics.

### Otomycosis: Clinical features and treatment implications [^113pdmjK]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

To determine the clinical presentation, predisposing factors, complications, and treatment outcomes of otomycosis, a retrospective review was conducted. The study included 132 patients diagnosed with otomycosis and treated between 1998 and 2004 in an academic otology practice.

- **Results**: Otalgia and otorrhea were the most common presenting complaints, appearing in 48% of patients. Prior otologic procedures were found to increase the risk of developing otomycosis. Residual disease was observed in 13%, and recurrence was seen in 15% of the subjects. The presence of a mastoid cavity was associated with higher recurrence and residual disease rates. Topical ketoconazole, cresylate otic drops, and aluminum acetate otic drops demonstrated a resolution rate of over 80% on initial application, with topical ketoconazole showing a higher resolution rate and a lower rate of disease recurrence.

- **Conclusions and significance**: Otomycosis is often diagnosed through clinical examination and frequently occurs in the setting of persistent otorrhea. While complications are not uncommon, they usually resolve with appropriate topical antifungal treatment. The eradication of disease is more challenging in the presence of a mastoid cavity.

### Multicentric case series and literature review of coccidioidal otomastoiditis [^112yLTvF]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023).

Although most cases of otitis or mastoiditis are bacterial, the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis should be considered for patients with otitis or mastoiditis who have resided in or traveled to areas at risk for coccidioidomycosis, especially if the case does not respond to empiric antibacterial therapy. The diagnosis can be suggested by serologic testing, but confirmation requires culture of discharge from the ear or biopsy of the mastoid for histopathology and fungal culture.

The optimal treatment for coccidioidomycosis involving the ear or mastoid is unknown. Most patients reviewed underwent debridement, a common procedure for fungal ear or mastoid disease. Antifungal drugs are a major component of management, although the optimal agent and duration remain unresolved. In this series, the duration of therapy ranged from 1 week (of amphotericin B) to indefinitely (suppressive azole therapy), and the optimal duration remains unresolved. Repeated clinical, radiographic, and serologic evaluation with CF should be obtained before therapy discontinuation. Given the proximity and potential for invasion of the central nervous system, lifelong azole therapy should be weighed against toxicities associated with long-term use. Our patient series demonstrates the protean nature of coccidioidomycosis. Clinicians should consider a diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis for patients with otomastoiditis refractory to standard therapy and a history of exposure to areas of geographic risk.

### Pediatric topical steroid withdrawal syndrome: What is known, what is unknown [^113ukRRX]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

**Methods**: We searched Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and gray literature from January 1946 to January 2024, using search terms relating to "TSW in children", "eczema", "red skin syndrome", "red sleeves", "topical steroid addiction", "topical steroid abuse", "topical steroid dependence", "topical steroid rebound", and "effects of long-term topical steroid use in children with eczema". These search terms were based on two large systematic reviews conducted for adult topical steroid withdrawal (Hajar et al. and Hwang and Lio). References of key articles were hand-searched to find additional articles. Only English language studies and those that included pediatric patients (under 18 years of age) were included. All relevant information, if available, from the pediatric cases was extracted, including age, sex, duration of TCS use, type of TCS used, areas that TCS was applied to, and anatomic areas affected by the rash.

### Topical antifungals for seborrhoeic dermatitis [^112UGp8F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

In comparing agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews, we located only one systematic review with a similar topic by Apasrawirote. The review authors searched only MEDLINE through PubMed and included only nine studies. They concluded that ketoconazole, metronidazole, bifonazole, and ciclopirox had better effects on seborrhoeic dermatitis than were seen with placebo. Their conclusion is consistent with our findings that ketoconazole had greater consistency of effect upon comparison with other antifungals. Another systematic review by Kastarinen, which compared steroids versus azoles (mainly ketoconazole) for different treatment outcomes with seborrhoeic dermatitis, found steroids and ketoconazole to be of comparable efficacy.

### British Society for Medical Mycology best practice recommendations for the diagnosis of serious fungal diseases [^1145fGHp]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Invasive fungal diseases are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in a wide range of patients, and early diagnosis and management are a challenge. We therefore conducted a review of the scientific literature to generate a series of key recommendations for the appropriate use of microbiological, histological, and radiological diagnostic methods for the diagnosis of invasive fungal diseases.

The recommendations emphasize the role of microscopy in the rapid diagnosis and identification of clinically significant isolates to the species level, and the need for susceptibility testing of all Aspergillus species if treatment is to be given. In this review, we provide information to improve understanding of the importance of antigen detection for cryptococcal disease and invasive aspergillosis, the use of molecular (PCR) diagnostics for aspergillosis, and the crucial role of antibody detection for chronic and allergic aspergillosis. Furthermore, we consider the importance of histopathology reporting with a panel of special stains, and emphasize the need for urgent (< 48 hours) and optimized imaging for patients with suspected invasive fungal infection.

All 43 recommendations are auditable and should be used to ensure best diagnostic practice and improved outcomes for patients.

The objective of this article is to review the literature related to ciprofloxacin 0.3% and dexamethasone 0.1% sterile otic suspension. A systematic literature search utilizing Medline was conducted to identify peer-reviewed articles related to safety and efficacy. A total of 47 publications were identified and reviewed herein. The literature supports the use of antibiotic/anti-inflammatory combination ear drops in the treatment of both acute otitis externa and acute otitis media in pediatric patients with tympanostomy tubes. Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone has been demonstrated as safe and effective with regard to clinical cures and microbiological eradication of pathogens in either disease with low treatment failure rates. Additionally, the literature also provides clear evidence for the contribution of dexamethasone when added to ciprofloxacin for the topical treatment of ear infections.

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^114dX2VH]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

At one month, the proportion of children who were cleared of effusions in at least one ear was 41% (39/96) in the topical steroid group and 45% (44/98) in the placebo group. The risk difference favoring placebo was 4.3% (95% confidence interval −9.3 to 18.1). The relative risk was 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.65 to 1.25).

We analyzed the effect of the different recruitment cohorts, active monitoring versus no active monitoring, at each outcome time point (one, three, and nine months) using the χ² test, and it was non-significant. Poisson regression analysis on four covariates — age as a continuous variable (P = 0.92), season (P = 0.71), atopy (P = 0.67), and clinical severity (P = 0.003) — was conducted. The relative risk adjusted for these covariates at one month for the main outcome was 0.97 (0.74 to 1.26).

Secondary analysis at three months showed that 58% of the topical steroid group and 52% of the placebo group had resolved (adjusted relative risk 1.23, 0.84 to 1.80). At nine months, 56% of the topical steroid group remained clear in at least one ear, but 65% of the placebo group remained clear (adjusted relative risk 0.90, 0.58 to 1.41), favoring placebo. The interactions between treatment group and age (P = 0.57), treatment group and atopy (P = 0.24), and treatment group and clinical severity (P = 0.89) were non-significant, indicating that the effect of treatment group was not significantly affected by age, atopy, or clinical severity.

### The pH of commonly used topical ear drops in the treatment of otitis externa [^113penoG]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Healthy ear canal skin has an acidic pH. Evidence suggests that reacidification of the ear canal may lead to the resolution of otitis externa. The pH of 15 commonly prescribed topical ear drop preparations used in the treatment of otitis externa was measured using a Jenway 3020 pH meter with temperature compensation at 37.5 °C. The pH values ranged from 2.89 to 7.83. Two-thirds of the preparations tested were of acidic pH, while the remaining one-third were alkaline. Reacidification of the ear canal may assist in the treatment of otitis externa.

### Otomycosis in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients: Comparative study and literature review [^117Qd7Q6]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2012). Low credibility.

A comparative clinical study was conducted with 50 cases of otomycosis in immunocompetent patients and 50 cases in immunocompromised patients. Clinical presentation, predisposing factors, mycologic profile, and treatment outcomes were compared. Aspergillus spp were the most commonly isolated fungi in the immunocompetent group, while Candida albicans were more prevalent in the immunocompromised group. Bilateral involvement was more frequent in the immunocompromised group. All patients were treated with topical clotrimazole ear drops. However, four patients in the immunocompromised group did not respond to clotrimazole but were successfully treated with fluconazole ear drops. Additionally, three patients experienced small tympanic membrane perforation due to otomycosis.

### Otomycosis: Diagnosis and treatment [^115YTLxE]. Clinics in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Aspergillus and Candida spp are the most frequently isolated fungi in patients with otomycosis. The diagnosis of otitis externa relies on the patient's history, otoscopic examination under microscopic control, and imaging studies. Direct preparation of the specimens, particularly with optical brighteners, mycologic culture, and histologic examination, is very important and strongly recommended for the correct diagnosis.

Patients with noninvasive fungal otitis externa should be treated with intense débridement and cleansing, along with topical antifungals. Topical antifungals, such as clotrimazole, miconazole, bifonazole, ciclopiroxolamine, and tolnaftate, are potentially safe choices for the treatment of otomycosis, especially in patients with a perforated eardrum. The oral triazole drugs — itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole — are effective against Candida and Aspergillus, with good penetration of bone and the central nervous system. These drugs are essential in the treatment of patients with malignant fungal otitis externa complicated by mastoiditis and meningitis.

### Multicentric case series and literature review of coccidioidal otomastoiditis [^115XsA3L]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Coccidioidomycosis involving the ear, mastoid bone, or both is uncommon. We describe five new cases from the United States and review four cases reported in the literature of otomycosis and mastoiditis caused by Coccidioides. Of the nine cases, eight were linked to residence in or travel to California. Two patients had poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, seven had otomastoiditis, one had otitis externa without mastoid involvement, and one had mastoiditis without otic involvement. Four patients had concurrent or prior pulmonary coccidioidomycosis. Ipsilateral facial nerve palsies developed in two patients. All patients received antifungal treatment for varying durations, and eight of the nine patients underwent surgical debridement. Clinicians should consider coccidioidomycosis as a differential diagnosis for otomastoiditis in patients with geographic risks.

### Topical antibiotics with steroids for chronic suppurative otitis media [^116YrGRc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterized by ear discharge (otorrhea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antibiotics act to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as steroids, antiseptics, or ear cleaning (aural toileting). Antibiotics are commonly prescribed in combined preparations with steroids.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of adding a topical steroid to topical antibiotics in the treatment of people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM)

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 16 March 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving participants (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any combination of a topical antibiotic agent(s) of any class and a topical corticosteroid (steroid) of any class, applied directly into the ear canal.

### Ofloxacin [^111MLkBM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

As with other anti-infective preparations, prolonged use may result in the overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, including fungi. If the infection is not improved after one week, cultures should be obtained to guide further treatment. If otorrhea persists following a full course of therapy, or if two or more episodes of otorrhea occur within six months, further evaluation is recommended to exclude an underlying condition such as cholesteatoma, foreign body, or a tumor.

The systemic administration of quinolones, including ofloxacin at doses much higher than given or absorbed by the otic route, has led to lesions or erosions of the cartilage in weight-bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species. Young growing guinea pigs dosed in the middle ear with 0.3% ofloxacin otic solution showed no systemic effects, lesions or erosions of the cartilage in weight-bearing joints, or other signs of arthropathy. No drug-related structural or functional changes of the cochlea and no lesions in the ossicles were noted in the guinea pig following otic administration of 0.3% ofloxacin for one month.

No signs of local irritation were found when 0.3% ofloxacin was applied topically in the rabbit eye. Ofloxacin was also shown to lack dermal sensitizing potential in the guinea pig maximization study.

- **Information for patients**: Avoid contaminating the applicator tip with material from the fingers or other sources. This precaution is necessary to preserve the sterility of the drops.

### Clinical analysis of microbiologically proven fungal keratitis according to prior topical steroid use: a retrospective study in South Korea [^1143SvTo]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Low credibility.

In this study, 36.1% of the patients used topical steroids prior to their diagnosis of microbiologically proven fungal keratitis. Previous ocular surface disease (OSD) and deep infiltration were more common in the prior steroid (PS) group than in the no prior steroid (NPS) group. The use of systemic or topical voriconazole, surgical intervention, and treatment failure were more common in the PS group. Hypopyon and deep infiltration of the infection were significant risk factors for treatment failure. Considering the risk for complications, the results of this study suggest that topical steroids should be administered with caution. Therefore, it is important to use topical steroids judiciously in ocular surface diseases such as keratitis and to monitor patients frequently during steroid treatment.

### Topicort [^1169Qd1m]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Topicort Topical Spray is a topical corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of the topical corticosteroid.

In a study including 21 evaluable subjects aged 18 years or older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, adrenal suppression was identified in 1 out of 12 subjects having involvement of 10 to 15% of body surface area (BSA) and 2 out of 9 subjects having involvement of more than 15% of BSA after treatment with Topicort Topical Spray twice a day for 28 days.

Because of the potential for systemic absorption, the use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. Factors that predispose a patient to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency steroids, larger treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age. An ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression.

If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute a less potent steroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally expected after the cessation of treatment.

### Topical azole treatments for otomycosis [^117RDHee]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Otomycosis is a fungal infection of the outer ear, which may be treated with topical antifungal medications. There are many types, with compounds belonging to the azole group (commonly known as 'azoles') being among the most widely used.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of topical azole treatments for otomycosis.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register, Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The search date was 11 November 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults and children with otomycosis, comparing any topical azole antifungal with placebo, no treatment, another type of topical azole, or the same type of azole but applied in different forms. A minimum follow-up of two weeks was required.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: (1) clinical resolution as measured by the proportion of participants with complete resolution between two and four weeks after treatment (however defined by the authors of the studies), and (2) significant adverse events. Secondary outcomes were (3) mycological resolution and (4) other less serious adverse effects. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

- **Main results**: We included four studies with 559 participants from Spain, Mexico, and India. Three studies included children and adults, while one included only adults. The dura

### Efficacy of topical steroids in preventing radiation dermatitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115FtxvB]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Low credibility.

The study aimed to evaluate the relative efficacy of topical steroids in preventing radiation dermatitis (RD). Multiple databases, including Medline, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Biological Medicine (SinoMed), and Wanfang Database, were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of RD prevention in patients with cancer from inception to November 26, 2021, followed by an update on June 1, 2021. Six RCTs evaluating the efficacy of topical steroids in preventing RD in a total of 661 patients with cancer were included.

RD incidence was lower with topical steroids compared with placebo at week 3 (relative risk [RR] = 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.31–1.50) and at radiation therapy (RT) completion (RR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.93–1.00). Topical steroids demonstrated a lower risk of developing dermatitis of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grades 2 and 3 at the completion of RT (RR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.55–0.80 and RR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.38–0.77, respectively). However, topical steroids did not reduce RTOG grades 1 and 2 dermatitis at week 3 (RR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.45–1.14 and RR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.27–1.60, respectively).

Notably, the use of topical steroids did not decrease RD incidence when patients received combined chemotherapy (RR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.42–0.86), but an obvious reduction in the incidence of RD at RT completion was found when patients used the topical steroids twice-daily (RR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.47–0.93, P = 0.02). Thus, topical steroids reduced RD incidence in patients receiving RT, suggesting that twice-daily application of topical steroids may be more effective.

### Systematic review of topical antimicrobial therapy for acute otitis externa [^113zxUG2]. Otolaryngology — head and neck surgery (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of topical antimicrobials for acute otitis externa. This systematic review and random effects meta-analysis included randomized controlled trials with parallel groups, allowing for comparisons such as antimicrobial versus placebo, antiseptic versus antimicrobial, quinolone antibiotic versus nonquinolone antibiotic, steroid-antimicrobial versus antimicrobial, or antimicrobial-steroid versus steroid.

Twenty trials met the inclusion criteria, with 18 providing data suitable for pooling. Topical antimicrobials increased absolute clinical cure rates over placebo by 46% (95% confidence interval, 29% to 63%) and bacteriologic cure rates by 61% (95% CI, 46% to 76%). No significant differences in clinical cure rates were noted for other comparisons. However, steroid alone increased cure rates by 20% compared to steroid plus antibiotic (95% CI, 3% to 38%). Quinolone drops increased bacteriologic cure rates by 8% compared to nonquinolone antibiotics (95% CI, 1% to 16%), but demonstrated statistically equivalent rates of clinical cure and adverse events.

In conclusion, topical antimicrobials are highly effective for acute otitis externa, with clinical cure rates ranging from 65% to 80% within 10 days of therapy. Minor differences in comparative efficacy were observed, but the broad confidence limits containing small effect sizes make these differences of questionable clinical significance.

Summary estimates from the 13 meta-analyses can facilitate evidence-based management recommendations and the development of clinical practice guidelines.

### Steroid acne and rebound phenomenon [^112fX4FH]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

There have been many reports of topical steroid treatment for the face causing perioral dermatitis, steroid acne, and steroid rebound phenomenon.

- **Objective**: To assess patient-reported outcomes in patients receiving compounded topical (hydrocortisone 0.75% and precipitated sulfur 0.5%) lotion for up to 15 years for common dermatological conditions of the face.

- **Methods**: In a retrospective study, 300 patients were randomly sampled from the dermatology clinic who had used, or were continuing to use, a lotion-based, pharmacy-compounded topical preparation for the face. The topical compound was used in therapies for seborrheic dermatitis and in combination with prescription topical therapy for patients with acne and rosacea with tolerability problems.

- **Results**: None of the 300 patients experienced steroid acne, rebound phenomenon, or perioral dermatitis associated with the use of hydrocortisone 0.75% and precipitated sulfur 0.5% on the face.

- **Conclusion**: There was no evidence that perioral dermatitis, steroid acne, or rebound phenomenon occurs when sulfur is compounded with topical hydrocortisone 0.75%.

### Topical or oral antibiotics in childhood acute otitis media and ear discharge: a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^111rjMjf]. Family Practice (2024). High credibility.

We initiated this trial after establishing the superiority of antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops over oral antibiotics in children with ventilation tubes who present with acute ear discharge. Our findings, in a small sample of children without ventilation tubes who present with AOMd, indicate that these findings cannot be extrapolated to this patient population. While there is a patent passage between the ear canal and the middle ear in children with ventilation tubes, the spontaneous eardrum perforation in children with AOMd may close too early to allow antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops to completely resolve the middle ear inflammation.

During the preparation of our trial, we collaborated with the UK-based team developing the REST (Runny Ear Study, trial registry number ISRCTN12873692) addressing the same topic. We harmonized design and outcomes to enable future meta-analysis. This trial, however, was also terminated early due to issues with its electronic health record system platform, and no formal statistical analysis was performed on its sample of 22 children.

Regarding the medical management of onychomycosis, particularly with respect to systemic antifungals, the British Association of Dermatologists 2014 guidelines suggest offering griseofulvin (500–1,000 mg/day for 6–9 months for fingernail infection and 12–18 months for toenail infection; taken with fatty food to increase absorption) as an alternative option. It is recognized, however, that griseofulvin has lower efficacy and higher relapse rates compared to terbinafine and itraconazole.

### Combined intrastromal injection of amphotericin B and topical fluconazole in the treatment of resistant cases of keratomycosis: a retrospective study [^113SUrNq]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Cases of keratomycosis continue to challenge ophthalmologists due to difficulties in management, ranging from the availability and susceptibility to antifungal agents, to the penetration of corneal tissues. Fungal pathogens tend to deeply penetrate corneal tissues and may reach the anterior chamber. Thus, intrastromal and intracameral injection of antifungal agents — especially polyenes such as amphotericin B — provides the best chance for managing such infections. These routes result in higher concentrations of the antifungal agents in corneal tissue and aqueous humor compared to topical use, enhancing the antifungal effects of the drugs.

The topical application of azoles, particularly fluconazole and voriconazole, has been proven safe for ocular tissues and demonstrates good penetration into corneal tissue. Therefore, these eye drops are considered suitable for ocular use from a toxicological standpoint. Combination therapy of antifungal agents has been shown to have potent antifungal activity and produces optimal results in treating keratomycosis, especially in mild and moderate cases. Furthermore, gatifloxacin is a potent antibiotic with additional antifungal effects. It is preferred for topical application in keratomycosis since combined bacterial and fungal infections have been reported in many cases; hence, many studies suggest the use of antibiotics with antifungal properties.

### Otitis externa: A practical guide to treatment and prevention [^114U9KpW]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Otitis externa is most commonly caused by infection (usually bacterial, although occasionally fungal). It may also be associated with a variety of noninfectious systemic or local dermatologic processes. The most characteristic symptom is discomfort in the external auditory canal. The most characteristic signs are erythema and swelling of the canal with variable discharge. Excessive moisture and trauma, which impair the canal's natural defenses, are the two most common precipitants of otitis externa. Avoiding these precipitants is the cornerstone of prevention.

Thorough cleansing of the canal is essential for diagnosis and treatment, but flushing should be avoided. Acidification with a topical solution of 2 percent acetic acid combined with hydrocortisone for inflammation is effective treatment in most cases. When used after exposure to moisture, it is an excellent prophylactic. Other prophylactic measures, such as drying the ears with a hair dryer and avoiding manipulation of the external auditory canal, may help prevent recurrence.

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^1155zK4m]. BMJ (2009). High credibility.

Topical intranasal corticosteroids have evidence of efficacy from several small clinical trials, as well as theoretical reasons to support further evaluation. Anti-inflammatory effects on the post-nasal space, the peritubal lymphatic tissue, and encroaching adenoids have all been suggested. Although oral steroids may have some benefit in otitis media with effusion, their use for a chronic, relapsing condition of childhood is generally precluded by the possibility of severe idiosyncratic and growth retardation effects. Thus, although many doctors may be using intranasal corticosteroids in preference to oral steroids for safety reasons, more research is needed to establish their clinical effectiveness when given as an adjunct to active monitoring in an affected cohort of children.

### Dry eye disease in the Middle East and Northern Africa: A position paper on the current state and unmet needs [^1174wWhF]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Topical steroids such as loteprednol etabonate (LE), dexamethasone, prednisone, methylprednisolone, fluorometholone, and hydrocortisone are effective in breaking the inflammatory cycle in dry eye disease (DED). Topical steroids can be used to rapidly decrease DED signs and symptoms, and in severe cases requiring ophthalmic cyclosporine, they can also help improve tolerance to cyclosporine. Topical steroids may be prescribed for a short-term course to treat disease flares, but long-term use of topical corticosteroids is not recommended due to the risk of steroid-related side effects, such as increased intraocular pressure (IOP), severe steroid-induced glaucoma, and cataract formation. Steroids with more favorable safety profiles, such as LE, may offer better therapeutic options with the potential for fewer steroid-related side effects.

Dexamethasone, prednisone, and methylprednisolone can pass through the cornea into the anterior chamber. These molecules are very effective in reducing DED signs and symptoms but are associated with high rates of steroid-induced ocular side effects. For this reason, their use should be restricted to controlling severe disease in patients with a low steroid response or steroid nonresponders; even in these cases, only short-term therapy should be prescribed.

LE is a steroid therapy developed via retrometabolic drug design, modifying an inactive metabolite of prednisolone acetate, with the goals of preserving prednisolone acetate's anti-inflammatory effects while enabling rapid metabolism of inactive metabolites, thereby reducing the potential for adverse effects.

### Glaucoma induced by periorbital topical steroid use — a rare complication [^111SBZSX]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Eye complications arising during systemic and ophthalmic steroid use are well known. In contrast, there is little highlighting the similar risks associated with topical steroid use around the eyelids. We describe a 29-year-old lady who used topical steroids in a prolonged fashion throughout most of her life for severe eczema, recently applying large quantities of potent steroid continuously for one month, including to the periorbital region. Soon after, she presented to her ophthalmologist with severe bilateral glaucoma and irreversible visual loss attributed to the steroid use. Here, we emphasize the possible risks of periorbital topical steroid use, as well as the importance of patient education and ophthalmological follow-up.

In 1999, a 42-year-old White man from California sought care for right ear fullness and tinnitus. Examination indicated a right middle ear effusion without erythema. Systemic antihistamines were prescribed; however, the patient returned one month later without clinical improvement. Sequential empiric courses of oral prednisone (20 mg/d for 14 days) and amoxicillin/clavulanate (500/125 mg three times a day for 10 days) also did not lead to improvement. Soon thereafter, ipsilateral facial nerve palsy developed. MRI revealed evidence of an ongoing middle ear effusion and mastoiditis.

Tympanocentesis was performed, and C. immitis was identified on cultures of the aspirated middle-ear fluid. Serum Coccidioides CF titer was 1:4, and Coccidioides immunodiffusion was positive for IgG. After further questioning, the patient recalled having had an episode of subacute pneumonia approximately 18 months earlier that did not respond to levofloxacin. After Coccidioides otomastoiditis was diagnosed, oral fluconazole (800 mg/d) was prescribed.

Treatment was continued for three years. The ear effusion and tinnitus resolved, the 7th nerve palsy partially improved, the CF titer declined to undetectable, and the radiographic appearance of the mastoiditis improved. After three years, the patient self-discontinued fluconazole. He has remained asymptomatic with undetectable CF titers through 21 years of follow-up.

### Topical therapy in anosmia: Relevance of steroid-responsiveness [^116wgBju]. The Laryngoscope (2008). Low credibility.

Use of steroids, either systemically or topically, is a common therapy for patients with anosmia. However, investigations providing evidence for the benefits of topical therapy are rare, and no prognostic factors are known. In our study, we evaluated for the first time the additional effect of topical therapy, not only with steroids but also with antibiotics, after conventional pretreatment with oral steroids. We propose the steroid-responsiveness of anosmia as a prognostic factor.

- **Study design**: Retrospective design.

- **Methods**: We analyzed the data of 299 patients with olfactory dysfunction. Eighty-nine patients underwent initial pretreatment with systemic steroids and provided data over a sufficient follow-up period. In the second step, all these patients received topical treatment in a head-down forward position, involving either budesonide alone or in combination with neomycin. The primary outcome parameter was the threshold, discrimination, and identification (TDI) score.

- **Results**: Initial therapy with oral steroids changed the TDI from a mean of 15.5 to 18.7 (P < .001). Generally, omitting systemic steroids while applying local therapy did not lead to a reduction in the TDI (P < .001). Dividing patients into those with steroid-responsive anosmia (SRA) and those without benefit from initial systemic steroids (non-SRA), topical treatment resulted in a significant difference between the two groups, with a benefit for the non-SRA group (P < .001). Considering only non-chronic rhinosinusitis anosmics, these findings became evident.

### Aspergillus otomycosis in an immunocompromised patient [^115SxMEm]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Aspergillus niger, an opportunistic filamentous fungus, was identified as the cause of chronic unilateral otomycosis in a 55-year-old immunocompromised man who had been unresponsive to a variety of treatment regimens. The patient presented with intermittent otalgia and otorrhea and a perforation of his left tympanic membrane. A. niger was identified in a culture specimen obtained from the patient's left ear canal. In immunocompromised patients, it is important that the treatment of otomycosis be prompt and vigorous to minimize the likelihood of hearing loss and invasive temporal bone infection.

### A comparison of triamcinolone acetonide econazole cream and nystatin suspension in treatment of otomycosis [^1159dXzQ]. The Laryngoscope (2021). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and adverse effects of triamcinolone acetonide econazole cream and nystatin suspension in treating otomycosis. It also sought to identify the clinical features, predisposing factors, and etiology of otomycosis through a prospective study design.

A clinical trial was conducted involving 786 patients diagnosed with otomycosis. These patients were randomly divided into two treatment groups, with one group receiving triamcinolone acetonide econazole cream (TAEC) and the other receiving nystatin suspension, in a 1:1 ratio. After clearing all fungal deposits in the external auditory canal, the antifungal agents were locally applied for at least two weeks. Efficacy and adverse effects were compared between the two treatments using statistical analysis. Additionally, patient clinical data were collected to determine clinical features, predisposing factors, and etiology.

Pruritis emerged as the most common symptom, with Aspergillus niger identified as the leading fungal pathogen. There was a notable association (44.5%) of otomycosis with a history of unclean ear picking. The cure rate was significantly higher in the TAEC group at 97.6% compared to 73.5% in the nystatin group (P < 0.01). Treatment with TAEC led to 2.4% of patients reporting discomforts such as irritant dermatitis, otalgia, or headache, whereas 59.8% of patients treated with nystatin reported such discomforts (P < 0.01). The residue rate of antifungals was 1.9% in the TAEC group versus 89.9% in the nystatin group by the end of treatment (P < 0.01).

In conclusion, thoroughly cleaning the external auditory canal followed by the local application of TAEC…

### Global current practice patterns for the management of hyphema [^112h1feE]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Low credibility.

The data reported here highlight that the controversies previously described in hyphema management currently persist internationally. Although there is general consensus on the use of topical steroids and cycloplegics and the recommendation for head elevation/sleeping upright, variations exist in medication preferences for hyphema, indications for surgical interventions, and activity limitations for patients. Previous investigations have shown variability in management techniques, affecting secondary hemorrhage rates without necessarily improving visual outcomes. However, evidence-based management protocols are still needed to reduce clinical waste, limit medication side effects, and ensure optimal care access.

Steroids are widely considered a mainstay of hyphema treatment to prevent rebleeds and synechiae formation. Nonetheless, there is conflicting evidence regarding their effectiveness. Several controlled prospective studies found no association between systemic steroid use, particularly prednisone, and the incidence of secondary hemorrhage or final visual outcomes after traumatic hyphema. A recent systematic review struggled to determine efficacy due to the lack of statistical power in existing trials. In contrast, another meta-analysis found that steroids, whether topical or systemic, effectively reduce secondary hemorrhage risk but do not improve final visual acuity.

### Topical antibiotics without steroids for chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations [^1166cArA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) causes ear discharge and impairs hearing.

- **Objectives**: Assess topical antibiotics (excluding steroids) for treating chronically discharging ears with underlying eardrum perforations associated with CSOM.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (January 1951 to March 2005), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2005), LILACS (January 1982 to March 2005), AMED (1985 to March 2005), CINAHL (January 1982 to March 2005), OLDMEDLINE (January 1958 to December 1965), PREMEDLINE, metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT), and article references were utilized.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials comparing any topical antibiotic without steroids to no drug treatment, aural toilet, topical antiseptics, or other topical antibiotics excluding steroids in participants with CSOM.

- **Data collection and analysis**: One author assessed eligibility and quality, extracted data, and entered data into RevMan. Two authors were involved in cases of ambiguity. Investigators were contacted for clarifications when necessary.

- **Main results**: Fourteen trials with 1,724 analyzed participants or ears were reviewed. Definitions and severity of CSOM varied, with some trials including otitis externa, mastoid cavity infections, and other diagnoses. The methodological quality varied, generally being poorly reported. Follow-up was usually short, and the handling of bilateral disease was inconsistent. Topical quinolone antibiotics were found to be more effective than no drug treatment at clearing discharge at one week, with a reported relative risk (RR) of 0.4.

### Medicare part D payments for topical steroids: Rising costs and potential savings [^115qqn7X]. JAMA Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Rising pharmaceutical costs in the United States are an increasing source of financial burden for payers and patients. Although topical steroids are among the most commonly prescribed medications in dermatology, there are limited data on steroid-related spending and utilization.

- **Objective**: To characterize Medicare and patient out-of-pocket costs for topical steroids and to model potential savings that could result from the substitution of the cheapest topical steroid from the corresponding potency class.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This study was a retrospective cost analysis of the Medicare Part D Prescriber Public Use File, which details annual drug utilization and spending on both generic and branded drugs from 2011 to 2015 by Medicare Part D participants who filled prescriptions for topical steroids.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Total and potential Medicare and out-of-pocket patient spending. Costs were adjusted for inflation and reported in 2015 dollars.

- **Results**: Medicare Part D expenditures on topical steroids between 2011 and 2015 were $2.3 billion. Patients' out-of-pocket spending for topical steroids over the same period was $333.7 million. The total annual spending increased from $237.6 million to $775.9 million, an increase of 226.5%. Patients' annual out-of-pocket spending increased from $41.4 million to $101.8 million, an increase of 145.9%. The total number of prescriptions was 7.7 million in 2011 and 10.6 million in 2015, an increase of 37.0%. Generic medication costs accounted for 97.8% of the total spending during this time period.

### Topical intranasal corticosteroids in 4–11 year old children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion in primary care: Double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^115qwEzN]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

Overall, we found a low risk of individual children not being cured — 57% at one month, decreasing by a further 60% at three months and 60% at nine months (proportion of those remaining unresolved throughout 0.18, 0.13 to 0.26). The rate of referral to ear, nose, and throat specialists was low, at 15 out of 102 (15%) for the active group and 17 out of 112 (15%) for the placebo group at nine months. Of these referrals, 60% were deemed appropriate according to suggested Medical Research Council criteria.

Adverse events, although relatively minor, included cough, dry throat, epistaxis, and nasal stinging. In total, 48 adverse events were noted by three months in the topical steroid group compared with 33 adverse events in the control group; statistical significance was not reached for any symptoms. The reported hearing difficulty (P = 0.08) and days with otalgia (P = 0.46) from the diaries at three months did not differ significantly between the groups. Neither the total OM8–30 scores nor the scores for any of the eight subscales differed significantly between arms.

### Fluticasone propionate [^113gdoEf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Precautions**: Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal from treatment. Manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria can also occur in some patients undergoing treatment with systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids.

- **Patient evaluation**: Patients applying a potent topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. This evaluation may be conducted using the ACTH stimulation, A.M. plasma cortisol, and urinary free cortisol tests.

- **Management of HPA axis suppression**: If HPA axis suppression is noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute a less potent steroid. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. For information on systemic supplementation, refer to the prescribing information for those products.

Fluticasone propionate cream, 0.05%, caused depression of A.M. plasma cortisol levels in 1 of 6 adult patients when used daily for 7 days in patients with psoriasis or eczema involving at least 30% of the body surface. After 2 days of treatment, this patient developed a 60% decrease from pretreatment values in the A.M. plasma cortisol level.

### Multicentric case series and literature review of coccidioidal otomastoiditis [^116b7WVH]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

With a literature search, we identified four additional cases of coccidioidomycosis involving the ear, mastoid bone, or both and summarized them along with the five cases in our series. Eight patients, for whom details were available, had lived in or traveled to California. Ages ranged from 4 to 76 years, and six of nine were male. Ethnicity was known for seven patients: four were Hispanic and three were White. Two patients had poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (one each with types 1 and 2). Another patient had systemic lupus erythematosus, which had been treated with corticosteroids one month before the coccidioidal otomastoiditis developed. In retrospect, however, misdiagnosed coccidioidomycosis was probably the cause of the fatigue, fever, and arthralgias (with positive antinuclear and anti-DNA antibodies) attributed to lupus.

Seven patients had otomastoiditis, one had mastoiditis without otitis, and one had otitis without mastoiditis. Ear pain was noted for five patients, mastoid swelling or tenderness for three, and hearing loss for two. Two patients had cutaneous lesions at the ear.

- **Table**: Summary of cases of coccidioidomycosis involving the middle or outer ear or mastoid detected in multicentric case series of coccidioidal otomastoiditis, California, USA, and literature review of other cases.

Four patients, in addition to the ears or mastoids, had previous or concomitant pulmonary disease consistent with coccidioidomycosis, including one patient who additionally had osteoarticular complications.

### Steroid phobia: A review of prevalence, risk factors, and interventions [^113noiCG]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroid phobia may lead to poor adherence, resulting in persistent disease and escalation to systemic agents. The aim of this paper was to review literature to assess topical steroid phobia prevalence, populations most at risk, reasons behind steroid phobia, and interventions to reduce it. A systematic search of PubMed, Ovid (Journals@Ovid, MEDLINE), ScienceDirect, and Web of Science was performed. Studies ranged from May 2000 to February 2021. In total, 37 articles met the inclusion criteria. There was inter-study variation in the way steroid phobia is defined, ranging from concern to irrational fear.

The worldwide prevalence of topical steroid phobia ranges from 31 to 95.7% and does not differ with patient race/ethnicity or dermatological condition. Female patients and caregivers, and those who have experienced side effects of topical corticosteroids, are most likely to express steroid phobia. Reasons for steroid phobia include lack of education, fear of side effects, polypharmacy, misinformation, negative experience with topical steroids, and frequently changing clinics.

Successful interventions to address steroid phobia include patient education through educational videos followed by individualized oral education based on concerns, and demonstrations of application of topical steroids. Multiple interventions address topical corticosteroid phobia and improve adherence to topical corticosteroids in the management of dermatological conditions. Providers should screen patients for steroid phobia, especially in populations particularly at risk.

### Topical antibiotics with steroids for chronic suppurative otitis media [^1164Rbhw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterized by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antibiotics aim to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be used alone or in conjunction with other CSOM treatments, such as steroids, antiseptics, or ear cleaning ('aural toileting'). Antibiotics are commonly prescribed in combined preparations with steroids. This review is one of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM and is the first update of the original review published in 2020.

- **Objectives**: This review aims to assess the effects of adding a topical steroid to topical antibiotics for treating people with chronic suppurative otitis media.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane ENT Specialised Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, and five other databases on 15 June 2022. Additionally, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that involved participants (adults and children) with chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks, and participants had been followed up for at least one week.
