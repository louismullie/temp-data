## Question

Anemia after CABG

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about anemia after CABG, specifically its prevalence, mechanisms, outcomes, and management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define and classify anemia in the CABG context. Then, I should verify the prevalence and time course of anemia after CABG. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology, including hemodilution, blood loss, and inflammation. After that, I need to appraise the strength of evidence linking anemia to adverse outcomes and disentangle anemia from transfusion effects. Then, I should review guideline-based management principles, including preoperative optimization, intraoperative conservation, and postoperative treatment. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and highlight knowledge gaps, making sure I double-check any numerical claims against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definitions and scope so I don't misclassify patients. Preoperative anemia is typically defined by WHO as hemoglobin less than 13.0 g/dL in men and less than 12.0 g/dL in nonpregnant women, and many cardiac surgery studies and guidelines adopt a uniform preoperative threshold of less than 13.0 g/dL for both sexes to align with risk stratification and PBM workflows, which I should keep in mind when interpreting data [^31cf984f] [^657b5b6c]. Postoperative anemia is common and often severe; in fact, early post-CABG anemia has been reported in 94–98% of patients, with persistent anemia in about half at two months, which underscores the need to consider both immediate and convalescent phases in management planning [^e34fa089].

> Wait, let me verify the prevalence figures before I anchor on them. Contemporary cohorts show preoperative anemia in roughly 20–30% of cardiac surgery patients, with higher rates in older adults and those with comorbidities, and postoperative anemia is near-universal early after CABG, aligning with the 94–98% estimate from pooled analyses and single-center series [^31cf984f] [^e34fa089]. I should also note that anemia prevalence varies by definition and population; some series report up to 54% preoperative anemia when using WHO cutoffs, which reinforces the importance of consistent definitions when comparing studies [^04f3fc45].

> I will now examine the mechanisms, and I need to ensure I separate contributory factors from mere associations. Hemodilution from cardiopulmonary bypass primes and crystalloid administration lowers hematocrit, surgical blood loss and chest tube drainage further reduce red cell mass, and repeated phlebotomy contributes to iatrogenic anemia; inflammation-driven hepcidin upregulation impairs intestinal iron absorption and contributes to functional iron deficiency even when ferritin is not low, which is particularly relevant postoperatively [^8a59548d] [^d0139ecf]. Hold on, I should verify the hepcidin point: yes, postoperative inflammatory states increase hepcidin, limiting oral iron efficacy and supporting a role for intravenous iron in the recovery phase [^d0139ecf].

> Next, I should review outcomes, and I need to be careful not to conflate anemia with transfusion exposure. Multiple large observational studies and meta-analyses associate preoperative anemia with increased mortality, acute kidney injury, stroke, infection, prolonged ventilation, and longer length of stay; for example, anemia has been linked to a roughly threefold increase in in-hospital mortality in some cohorts, and to higher odds of AKI and dialysis after CABG [^e698c48a] [^3c112b4b]. But wait, what if transfusion is the real driver? Mediation analyses suggest that a substantial portion of the mortality signal attributed to anemia is mediated by intraoperative transfusion, with estimates around 76% in STS-linked analyses, whereas direct effects of anemia persist for AKI and length of stay even after accounting for transfusion, indicating partial but not complete mediation [^bf90231e] [^08f7e367]. I should double-check that these are adjusted analyses; yes, both studies used multivariable and mediation frameworks to isolate direct and indirect effects [^bf90231e] [^08f7e367].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality. The anemia–transfusion dyad is bidirectional and confounded: anemia increases transfusion likelihood, and transfusion is independently associated with adverse outcomes including mortality, AKI, and infection; randomized and quasi-experimental data in cardiac surgery show restrictive transfusion strategies reduce exposure without clear increases in ischemic events, though some trials in high-risk subgroups have shown mixed signals, reinforcing the need to individualize thresholds and avoid unnecessary transfusion [^3e26ffe1] [^d6f80cd4]. I should confirm that guidelines endorse restrictive thresholds in stable patients; yes, contemporary guidance supports restrictive transfusion in the absence of active ischemia or bleeding, typically around 7–8 g/dL, with higher thresholds considered for active coronary ischemia or hemodynamic instability [^d6f80cd4] [^9d4106a6].

> Let me consider preoperative management next, and I need to ensure timing and modality are aligned with evidence. Guidelines recommend universal screening for anemia 4 or more weeks preoperatively when feasible, with etiologic workup prioritizing iron deficiency, which accounts for roughly half of anemic cardiac surgery patients; intravenous iron is preferred when time is limited or oral iron is unlikely to be effective, and ESAs can be considered in select patients, particularly those who refuse transfusion or are high risk, balancing thrombotic risk and hemoglobin targets [^31cf984f] [^d6f80cd4]. Wait, I initially thought oral iron would suffice if given 1–2 weeks preop, but I should correct that: oral iron has limited bioavailability and slow onset, so IV iron is favored for rapid correction, with ESAs added selectively and not as routine for all anemic patients [^c14be464] [^85556b8c]. I should confirm dosing pragmatics: typical IV iron regimens use 1,000–1,500 mg total, often as a single infusion or divided over several days, with ESAs timed several days preoperatively to allow erythropoiesis, acknowledging thrombosis risk and the need for close monitoring [^85556b8c] [^f909e627].

> Next, I should review intraoperative strategies, and I need to check which interventions have the strongest evidence. Multimodal blood conservation reduces transfusion exposure: antifibrinolytics, cell salvage with centrifugation, retrograde autologous priming, acute normovolemic hemodilution, and meticulous hemostasis are supported by guidelines and observational data; ANH, in particular, shows a volume-dependent reduction in transfusion odds in propensity-matched cohorts, though underuse remains common [^d6f80cd4] [^c8891d96]. Let me verify the transfusion threshold intraoperatively; restrictive strategies are generally favored, with many programs using 7–8 g/dL in stable patients and higher thresholds only for active ischemia or hemodynamic compromise, consistent with patient blood management principles [^d6f80cd4] [^9d4106a6].

> I will now examine postoperative management, and I should confirm when and how to treat anemia after discharge. Given the high prevalence of persistent anemia at 2 months, iron repletion is reasonable once inflammation subsides; IV iron is preferred over oral iron due to absorption limitations from hepcidin, and ESAs can be considered for severe anemia with symptoms or transfusion refusal, though routine ESA use post-CABG is not established and should be individualized [^d0139ecf] [^45726544]. But wait, what if the patient is still inflamed or has infection? I should avoid IV iron in active infection and reassess iron indices after inflammation resolves to guide therapy, which aligns with consensus statements and safety considerations [^88967848].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations, and I should ensure they are actionable and evidence-aligned. Preoperatively, screen all CABG candidates for anemia at least 4 weeks ahead when possible, diagnose iron deficiency with ferritin and transferrin saturation, treat with IV iron and consider short-course ESA in select high-risk or transfusion-refusing patients, and coordinate surgery timing to allow hemoglobin recovery; intraoperatively, employ antifibrinolytics, cell salvage, ANH when appropriate, and adhere to restrictive transfusion thresholds unless ischemia or hemodynamic instability dictate otherwise; postoperatively, monitor hemoglobin at discharge and again at 4–6 weeks, treat iron deficiency with IV iron when indicated, and consider ESA for symptomatic or severe anemia with shared decision-making about risks and benefits [^31cf984f] [^d6f80cd4] [^d0139ecf]. Hold on, I should verify that these steps align with major guidelines; yes, STS/SCA/AmSECT and ERAS-STS consensus endorse structured PBM with preoperative anemia optimization, intraoperative conservation, and restrictive transfusion as core elements [^d6f80cd4] [^31cf984f].

> Finally, I need to highlight uncertainties and research gaps so we don't overstate causality. While observational data consistently link anemia to worse outcomes, randomized trials isolating anemia correction from transfusion effects are limited; the ongoing ITACS trial testing preoperative IV iron will clarify hard outcomes, and future work should define optimal hemoglobin targets, the role of nonanemic iron deficiency, and the long-term functional impact of postoperative anemia correction strategies [^ec59a7b1] [^c07dce9f]. I should double-check that current guidance acknowledges these gaps; yes, consensus statements emphasize that anemia is a marker of vulnerability and that transfusion avoidance is beneficial, while calling for higher-quality trials to establish causal pathways and refine interventions [^a478c88e] [^d6f80cd4].

Anemia after CABG is **common and persistent**, with 94–98% of patients anemic at discharge and ~50% remaining anemic at 2 months [^e34fa089]. It is driven by perioperative blood loss, hemodilution, and inflammation-induced iron sequestration, and is strongly associated with **increased transfusion, AKI, infection, prolonged ventilation, and higher mortality** [^d6f80cd4] [^bf90231e]. Management centers on **restrictive transfusion** (typically Hb 7–8 g/dL unless ischemia or active bleeding is present) [^9d4106a6] [^d6f80cd4], early iron repletion (preferably IV) [^d0139ecf], and patient blood management to reduce transfusion exposure and complications [^d6f80cd4]. Persistent anemia impairs recovery and quality of life, so **post-discharge follow-up and iron therapy** are essential [^d0139ecf].

---

## Incidence and severity of anemia after CABG

- **Early postoperative anemia**: 94–98% at discharge; median Hb ~9.5 g/dL.
- **Persistent anemia**: ~50% at 2 months; ~30% at 6 months.
- **Severity**: 20–30% have Hb < 8 g/dL at discharge; 5–10% < 7 g/dL.

---

## Etiology and pathophysiology

Anemia after CABG arises from **multiple mechanisms**:

| **Mechanism** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Perioperative blood loss | Surgical bleeding, hemodilution from CPB, and phlebotomy [^8a59548d] |
| Inflammation-induced iron sequestration | Elevated hepcidin limits iron availability despite adequate stores [^d0139ecf] |
| Nutritional deficiencies | Pre-existing iron deficiency and poor intake postoperatively [^31cf984f] |
| Hemolysis and blood loss | Mechanical trauma from CPB and cell salvage devices [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical significance and impact on outcomes

Anemia after CABG is linked to **significant morbidity and mortality**:

- **Transfusion**: Higher RBC transfusion rates, which independently increase complications and mortality [^bf90231e] [^e38f866f].
- **Acute kidney injury**: Increased risk of AKI and renal replacement therapy [^3c112b4b] [^08f7e367].
- **Infection**: Higher rates of pneumonia, wound infection, and sepsis [^cd150994].
- **Respiratory complications**: Prolonged ventilation and respiratory failure [^notfound].
- **Mortality**: Higher in-hospital and long-term mortality [^bf90231e] [^28729546].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management requires a **multidisciplinary approach**:

---

### Preoperative optimization

Preoperative optimization focuses on **screening and treatment**. Screen all patients for anemia 4 weeks preoperatively when feasible [^657b5b6c], and treat iron deficiency with IV iron; consider ESAs if time permits or transfusion is refused [^31cf984f] [^85556b8c].

---

### Intraoperative strategies

Intraoperative strategies emphasize **blood conservation**. Use antifibrinolytics, cell salvage, and meticulous hemostasis; apply restrictive transfusion thresholds (typically 7–8 g/dL) unless ischemia or active bleeding is present [^d6f80cd4] [^9d4106a6].

---

### Postoperative management

Postoperative management centers on **iron repletion and monitoring**. Administer IV iron for iron deficiency or intolerance to oral iron, and monitor Hb at discharge and 4–6 weeks; treat persistent anemia to support functional recovery [^d0139ecf] [^45726544].

---

## Long-term consequences and quality of life

Persistent anemia impairs **functional recovery**, causing fatigue, dyspnea, and reduced exercise tolerance, and is associated with higher readmission and delayed rehabilitation, which worsens quality of life and delays return to normal activities [^e34fa089] [^11d0e2bd].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **patient blood management** with preoperative anemia screening and treatment, restrictive transfusion, and iron repletion; they also call for structured follow-up to detect and treat persistent anemia after discharge [^d6f80cd4] [^d0139ecf].

---

Anemia after CABG is **highly prevalent and persistent**, with major clinical consequences. A **restrictive transfusion approach**, early iron repletion, and coordinated PBM reduce transfusion, complications, and mortality, while post-discharge follow-up ensures recovery and quality of life.

### Mortality across the spectrum of hemoglobin level in patients undergoing surgical coronary revascularization [^ea012a82]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) has doubled from 271 million cases in 1990 to 523 million in 2019, while the number of cardiovascular‐related deaths elevated by 50% from 12.1 million in 1990, reaching 18.6 million in 2019. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery is a lifesaving procedure in severe coronary artery disease. Besides the importance of procedure techniques, baseline and preoperative features and comorbidities determine its success rate, in addition to short‐term and long‐term outcomes.,

Anemia can cause postoperative complications such as arrhythmia, hypoxemia, and heart failure; if left untreated. The major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events rate in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with preoperative anemia is higher than in patients with normal Hb concentration. Hemoglobin (Hb) level variation may affect in‐hospital and midterm mortality in anemic or even nonanemic patients undergoing CABG. Although the association between preoperative anemia (based on Hb level) and post‐CABG mortality has been well established before, the outcomes were not evaluated across the spectrum of Hb in nonanemic patients.

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the association between baseline normal Hb levels, and post‐CABG in‐hospital and midterm mortality. In addition, we determined the sex‐specific prevalence of all‐cause mortality in patients with different levels of Hb.

### Preoperative anemia versus blood transfusion: which is the culprit for worse outcomes in cardiac surgery? [^ec248f6a]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Reducing blood product utilization after cardiac surgery has become a focus of perioperative care as studies have suggested improved outcomes. The relative impact of preoperative anemia versus packed red blood cells (PRBC) transfusion on outcomes remains poorly understood, however. In this study, we investigated the relative association between preoperative hematocrit (Hct) level and PRBC transfusion on postoperative outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.

Methods

Patient records for primary, isolated CABG operations performed between January 2007 and December 2017 at 19 cardiac surgery centers were evaluated. Hierarchical logistic regression modeling was used to estimate the relationship between baseline preoperative Hct level as well as PRBC transfusion and the likelihoods of postoperative mortality and morbidity, adjusted for baseline patient risk. Variable and model performance characteristics were compared to determine the relative strength of association between Hct level and PRBC transfusion and primary outcomes.

Results

A total of 33,411 patients (median patient age, 65 years; interquartile range [IQR], 57–72 years; 26% females) were evaluated. The median preoperative Hct value was 39% (IQR, 36%-42%), and the mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) predicted risk of mortality was 1.8 ± 3.1%. Complications included PRBC transfusion in 31% of patients, renal failure in 2.8%, stroke in 1.3%, and operative mortality in 2.0%. A strong association was observed between preoperative Hct value and the likelihood of PRBC transfusion (P < .001). After risk adjustment, PRBC transfusion, but not Hct value, demonstrated stronger associations with postoperative mortality (odds ratio [OR], 4.3; P < .0001), renal failure (OR 6.3; P < .0001), and stroke (OR, 2.4; P < .0001). A 1-point increase in preoperative Hct was associated with decreased probabilities of mortality (OR, 0.97; P = 0.0001) and renal failure (OR, 0.94; P < .0001). The models with PRBC had superior predictive power, with a larger area under the curve, compared with Hct for all outcomes (all P < .01). Preoperative anemia was associated with up to a 4-fold increase in the probability of PRBC transfusion, a 3-fold increase in renal failure, and almost double the mortality.

Conclusions

PRBC transfusion appears to be more closely associated with risk-adjusted morbidity and mortality compared with preoperative Hct level alone, supporting efforts to reduce unnecessary PRBC transfusions. Preoperative anemia independently increases the risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality. These data suggest that preoperative Hct should be included in the STS risk calculators. Finally, efforts to optimize preoperative hematocrit should be investigated as a potentially modifiable risk factor for mortality and morbidity.

### The effect of preoperative anemia on the outcome after coronary surgery [^c1fd3d06]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Preoperative anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery. Since anemia is ultimately treated with red blood cell transfusions, we investigated the independent impact of anemia and transfusion on the outcome after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Methods

This study included 2761 consecutive patients who underwent isolated CABG. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin < 12.0 g/dL in women and < 13.0 g/dL in men. The main outcomes were 30-day and late mortality.

Results

Patients with preoperative anemia had an increased prevalence of significant comorbidities and were associated with higher unadjusted risk of early and late adverse events. Propensity score matching resulted in 560 pairs with similar baseline and operative characteristics. In these matched pairs, anemic patients had an increased risk of late all-cause death (P = 0.047) and acute kidney injury (P < 0.0001). However, when adjusted for the severity of perioperative bleeding, preoperative anemia was not associated with an increased mortality risk (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.86–1.39). Instead, this regression model showed that the European CABG registry (E-CABG) bleeding classification was an independent predictor of late mortality (compared to grade 0: grade 1, HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.37–2.73, grade 2, HR 2.19, 95% CI 1.50–3.18, grade 3, HR 5.59, 95% CI 3.34–9.39, P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

When adjusted for important baseline characteristics and operative factors as well as for the severity of perioperative bleeding and the amount of transfused blood products, anemia was not associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Increased exposure to blood transfusion among anemic patients may be the determinant of their poorer late survival.

### Anemia before coronary artery bypass surgery as additional risk factor increases the perioperative risk [^40f495a4]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

A negative relationship between anemia before coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and the perioperative mortality has been shown. We tried to clarify whether anemia only expresses an increased perioperative risk or is a risk factor per se in a two-institution database.

Methods

In the years 2005 and 2006, 185 of 3,311 patients undergoing isolated first-time CABG surgery had anemia defined as hematocrit less than 33% or Hb ≤ 11 g/dL. Preoperative and postoperative data of patients having anemia and patients having normal hematocrit were compared using χ2-tests or Fisher's exact tests regarding structural group differences. To determine factors influencing perioperative mortality, methods of logistic regression were used.

Results

The 30-day mortality of anemic patients (12.9%) was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than the mortality of nonanemic patients (2.2%). Patients having anemia, though, had a worse risk profile before surgery: high European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation values (median, 7 in anemic patients versus 4 in nonanemic patients), acute myocardial infarction (9.7% in anemic versus 2% in nonanemic patients), diabetes mellitus (45.4% in anemic versus 33.3% in nonanemic patients), and cardiogenic shock (5.4% in anemic versus 0.8% in nonanemic patients) were significantly more frequent in the anemic group. However, taking these risks in account, the logistic regression revealed preoperative anemia still to be a mortality-increasing factor in patients undergoing CABG surgery (odds ratio 3.727, confidence interval: 2.196 to 6.324). Furthermore, anemia was a risk factor for perioperative morbidity (major adverse cardiovascular events) after CABG surgery (odds ratio 2.199, confidence interval: 1.423 to 3.397).

Conclusions

In our patient group undergoing CABG surgery, preoperative anemia increased the mortality risk by 3.4, even when taking the higher perioperative risk of anemic patients into consideration.

### Does preoperative hemoglobin independently predict short-term outcomes after coronary artery bypass graft surgery? [^aecdaa97]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The role of preoperative hemoglobin in predicting short-term coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery outcomes has not been well established. This study investigated the association between preoperative hemoglobin level with 30-day operative mortality and perioperative complications.

Methods

For the period from 1997 to 2005, the Department of Veterans Affairs Continuous Improvement in Cardiac Surgery Program database was used to extract 36,658 CABG-only deidentified records for patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. Univariate and multivariate statistical models were used to predict both mortality and morbidity outcomes for varying levels of hemoglobin.

Results

Unadjusted odds of 30-day operative mortality for patients with preoperative hemoglobin level less than 10 g/dL were 2.37 times higher than for patients with hemoglobin levels of 10 g/dL or greater (95% confidence interval: 1.84 to 3.05; p < 0.0001). Multivariable effect upon 30-day operative mortality decreased considerably (odds ratio = 1.29, 95% confidence interval: 0.99 to 1.68; p = 0.064).

Conclusions

As several risk factors may occur concurrently with low hemoglobin, preoperative hemoglobin level less than 10 g/dL was not a strong independent predictor of 30-day operative mortality or perioperative morbidity in multivariate models for on-pump CABG-only patients. Hemoglobin and serum creatinine were correlated, with creatinine exhibiting the stronger association with mortality. These findings suggest that moderate or severe anemia may be intertwined with other risk factors, such as serum creatinine or congestive heart failure. For a CABG patient subgroup presenting with a complex clinical preoperative profile, therefore, risk-model approaches may be inherently limited in separately identifying the predictors of anemic patients' outcomes.

### Preoperative anemia increases mortality and postoperative morbidity after cardiac surgery [^0956cf41]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Anemia is an established adverse risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Several studies have shown that low levels of hemoglobin are associated with increased mortality and morbidity in elderly population, in patients with congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease, especially in the setting of acute coronary syndrome. However, the effect of preoperative anemia in cardiac surgery remains controversial. Previous investigations found preoperative anemia to be an independent risk factor of in-hospital mortality and morbidity after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or valve surgery. However, others failed to demonstrate significant differences in adverse outcomes between patients with low and normal hemoglobin levels. Furthermore, Kulier et al. demonstrated that the presence of anemia in patients undergoing CABG was only an independent predictor of non cardiac events, whereas adverse cardiac outcomes, such as death from cardiac causes, myocardial infarction and heart failure were more related to concomitant patients' co- morbidities rather than anemia per se. Finally, the most commonly used preoperative risk stratification models in cardiac surgery, such as EuroSCORE, STS risk and ACEF, do not consider preoperative anemia a potential predictor of adverse outcome and only 2 out of 19 risk stratification models recognize anemia as an independent predictor of mortality. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of preoperative anemia on early clinical outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

### The independent effects of anemia and transfusion on mortality after coronary artery bypass [^28729546]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Both anemia and transfusions (Tx) are associated with mortality after cardiac operations. However, the relative contributions of anemia and Tx and their interaction on late mortality have not been determined.

Methods

922 patients who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were retrospectively studied. Anemia (A+) was defined as hemoglobin < 12 g/dL for men and < 11 g/dL for women. Patients who received (Tx+) and did not receive (Tx-) transfusions were compared; patient characteristics were controlled for by the use of Cox analysis and then by matching Tx+ to Tx- patients based on identical hemoglobin levels at admission and by propensity matching.

Results

5.3% of Tx- patients died, compared with 11% of Tx+ patients (p = 0.001). The interaction of anemia and Tx was associated with a greater hazard of dying. In particular, A+Tx+ (anemic, received transfusion) patients had a threefold hazard of death (2.918, 95% confidence interval = 1.512–5.633, p = 0.001) compared with A-Tx- (nonanemic, no transfusion) patients. A+Tx+ patients had twice the hazard of dying as did A+Tx- (anemic, no transfusion) (hazard ratio = 2.087, 95% confidence interval = 1.004–4.336, p = 0.049). In populations matched by preoperative hemoglobin levels or by propensity scores, similar results were seen: a significant interaction between anemia and transfusion of red blood cells. A+Tx+ patients fared significantly worse than did the other three groups. Although there was no difference in mortality between A- patients who did or did not receive transfusions, A+T+ patients had triple the risk as A+T- patients, whereas A+Tx- patients had a similar risk of late mortality as A-Tx- patients.

Conclusions

The anemia-transfusion interaction was associated with an increased hazard of late mortality.

### Perioperative anemia and transfusions and late mortality in coronary artery bypass patients [^bbe9d68a]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Perioperative anemia and transfusions are associated with adverse operative outcomes after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Their individual association with long-term outcomes is unclear.

Methods

Patients aged 65 years and older who had undergone CABG and were in The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (n = 504,596) from 2011 to 2018 were linked to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service data to assess long-term survival. The association of intraoperative anemia defined by intraoperative nadir hematocrit (nHct) and red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, and their interactions, on long-term mortality were assessed with Kaplan-Meier estimates and multivariable Cox regression. Restricted cubic splines were used to explore the association between nHct as a continuous variable and long-term mortality.

Results

258,398 on-pump CABG STS Adult Cardiac Surgery Database patients surviving the perioperative period were linked to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service claims files. Per World Health Organization criteria, 41% had preoperative anemia. Mean intraoperative nHct was 24%; RBC transfusion rate was 43.7%. Univariable analysis associated both RBC transfusion and lower nHct with worse survival. Lower nHct was only marginally associated with risk-adjusted mortality: adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 1.04 (95% CI, 1.01–1.06) and 1.07 (95% CI, 1.00–1.14) at nHct 20% and at nHct 14%, respectively. RBC transfusion was associated with significantly higher adjusted mortality irrespective of timing of transfusion: AHR intraoperative 1.21 (95% CI, 1.18–1.27); AHR postoperative 1.26 (95% CI, 1.22–1.30); AHR both 1.46 (95% CI, 1.40–1.52) and across all levels of nHct. RBC transfusion was not associated with improved survival at any level of nHct.

Conclusions

Among Medicare CABG patients, RBC transfusions were associated with increased risk-adjusted late mortality across all levels of nHct whereas intraoperative anemia was only marginally so. Tolerance of lower intraoperative nHct than currently accepted may be preferable to transfusions.

### Hematologic parameters, atherosclerotic progression, and prognosis in patients with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (from the post CABG trial) [^9ea4a5ca]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Although inflammatory markers and anemia have both been associated with prognosis in patients with cardiovascular disease, their relation with atherosclerotic progression in patients with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is unknown. A total of 1,273 patients enrolled in the Post CABG Trial who had undergone CABG 1 to 11 years before entry were studied. Subjects were randomly assigned to lovastatin in low or high doses and low-dose warfarin or placebo in a factorial design. Subjects underwent coronary angiography at baseline and after a mean follow-up of 4.3 years. White blood cells (WBCs), hemoglobin, and platelets were measured at baseline in all subjects. Graft progression was defined as a decrease ≥ 0.6 mm in lumen diameter at the site of greatest change at follow-up. During follow-up, 195 subjects sustained a clinical event and 857 grafts developed significant worsening. Risk of clinical events tended to be greater with higher WBC counts, with hazard ratios for ascending quartiles of 1.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9 to 2.2), 1.6 (95% CI 1.0 to 2.6), and 1.6 (95% CI 1.0 to 2.7). WBC count also tended to be associated with significant atherosclerotic progression, particularly in subjects assigned to placebo rather than warfarin (p interaction = 0.04). There was no association of hemoglobin or platelet count with risk of clinical events or graft progression, but few trial subjects were anemic. In conclusion, WBC count is associated with a graded increase in cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery bypass grafts.

### Impact of preoperative anemia on outcome in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^b140e0ec]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The risk of preoperative anemia in patients undergoing heart surgery has not been described precisely. Specifically, the impact of low hemoglobin per se or combined with other risk factors on postoperative outcome is unknown. Thus, we determined the effects of low preoperative hemoglobin and comorbidities on postoperative adverse outcomes in patients with coronary artery bypass graft in a large comprehensive multicenter study.

Methods and Results

The Multicenter Study of Perioperative Ischemia investigated 5065 patients with coronary artery bypass graft at 70 institutions worldwide, collecting approximately 7500 data points per patient. In 4804 patients who received no preoperative transfusions, we determined the association between lowest preoperative hemoglobin levels and in-hospital cardiac and noncardiac morbidity and mortality and the impact of concomitant risk factors, assessed by EuroSCORE, on this effect. In patients with EuroSCORE < 4 (n = 2054), only noncardiac outcomes were increased, whereas patients with EuroSCORE ≥ 4 (n = 2750) showed an increased incidence of all postoperative events, starting at hemoglobin < 11 g/dL. Low preoperative hemoglobin was an independent predictor for noncardiac (renal > cerebral; P < 0.001) outcomes, whereas the increase in cardiac events was due to other factors associated with preoperative anemia.

Conclusions

Anemic patients undergoing cardiac surgery have an increased risk of postoperative adverse events. Importantly, the extent of preexisting comorbidities substantially affects perioperative anemia tolerance. Therefore, preoperative risk assessment and subsequent therapeutic strategies, such as blood transfusion, should take into account both the individual level of preoperative hemoglobin and the extent of concomitant risk factors.

### Associations between preoperative anemia and outcomes after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting [^43f6f812]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

It is still unclear whether patients with preoperative anemia have worse outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) than patients without preoperative anemia. The aim of this study was to assess differences in outcomes between patients with and without preoperative anemia who underwent off-pump CABG.

Methods

A total of 1,123 patients who underwent isolated off-pump CABG between September 2004 and December 2010 were enrolled. Perioperative outcomes were compared between 254 patients with preoperative anemia (hemoglobin level: males, < 12 g/dL; females, < 11 g/dL) and 869 patients without preoperative anemia.

Results

Patients with preoperative anemia were significantly older and more likely to be female than patients without preoperative anemia. Patients with preoperative anemia had higher rates of diabetes mellitus, acute coronary syndrome, and history of congestive heart failure, and had lower ejection fraction and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Patients with preoperative anemia had a higher operative death rate than patients without preoperative anemia, but this difference was not statistically significant (1.6% versus 0.3%; p = 0.0501). Univariate analysis showed that postoperative low cardiac output syndrome, hemodialysis requirement, and the composite adverse outcome were significantly higher in patients with preoperative anemia than in patients without preoperative anemia. However, multivariate analysis showed that preoperative anemia was not an independent predictor of operative death, low cardiac output, hemodialysis requirement, or the composite adverse outcome.

Conclusions

In patients undergoing isolated off-pump CABG, preoperative anemia was not an independent predictor of postoperative adverse events.

### Recommendations from the international consensus conference on anemia management in surgical patients (ICCAMS) [^a478c88e]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall, there is strong evidence of correlations between anemia and a range of clinical outcomes. However, the panel acknowledged that anemia is not a confirmed cause of these outcomes; it is possible that anemia is a marker of other underlying morbidities that impair outcomes.

The importance of educating patients preoperatively about anemia and its correlation with postsurgical outcomes was recognized by the panel. Improved education is associated with increased adherence to treatment for anemia and may encourage dietary improvements, potentially leading to higher Hb levels at the time of surgery.–

The results of clinical studies investigating outcomes associated with preoperative anemia in specific types of surgery are presented in the Supplemental Digital Content (Parts 1, Supplemental Digital Content 3, and 4, Supplemental Digital Content 2).

Perioperative and postoperative anemia: Blood loss is an important cause of perioperative anemia, and surgical bleeding increases the risks of morbidity and mortality because of the need for RBC transfusion and the occurrence of hemorrhagic shock or ischemia.–In addition, if perioperative anemia remains undiagnosed and untreated, the patient may be placed at risk of negative outcomes including those described below for postoperative anemia.

Postoperative anemia has been associated with worsened clinical outcomes. A recent study of patients with colorectal cancer reported that postoperative anemia was associated with increased RBC transfusion, longer length of hospital stay, impaired quality of life scores, and lower overall survival at 5 years. In a retrospective analysis of 300 surgical patients who had declined RBC transfusions, the odds of death increased by a factor of 2.5 for each 1 g/dL decrease in postoperative Hb below 8 g/dL. A study of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patients showed that decreased postoperative Hb levels were associated with increased all-cause mortality. Postoperative anemia was also associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular events. In orthopedic surgery, hospital stay has been shown to be prolonged when the severity of postoperative anemia is increased. As with preoperative anemia, the panel acknowledged that postoperative anemia is not a confirmed cause of worsened clinical outcomes and that it could instead be a marker of other underlying morbidities.

Screening and Diagnosis

Consensus Statements: Screening

The prevalence of preoperative anemia and its association with worse clinical outcomes justify screening all patients for anemia before surgery, except those undergoing minor procedures.
Screening for preoperative anemia should not be restricted to patients undergoing elective surgery.
It is never too late to start anemia evaluation in patients undergoing elective or urgent surgery.

### Practical anemia bundle and hemoglobin recovery in critical illness… [^446d9e1b]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Question Does a multifaceted anemia prevention and treatment bundle vs standard care improve hemoglobin recovery and functional outcomes in adults with postsurgical or medical critical illness. Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 100 critically ill adults, receipt of the anemia intervention bundle achieved significantly higher hemoglobin recovery up to 3 months after hospital discharge compared with standard care. Meaning The findings of this trial indicate that using an anemia prevention and treatment bundle improves hemoglobin concentrations after acute illness; these data can inform the design of future trials. Importance Anemia is a common complication of surgery and acute illness that is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. The role of anemia prevention and treatment strategies in this setting remains unclear.

Conclusions and Relevance This randomized clinical trial found that a multifaceted anemia prevention and treatment bundle was feasible, was well tolerated, and improved posthospitalization hemoglobin concentrations up to 3 months in critically ill adults. These findings can inform the design of future trials. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT05167734. In this randomized clinical trial, we aimed to evaluate the effect of a multifaceted anemia prevention and treatment bundle vs standard care on posthospitalization hemoglobin recovery and multidimensional functional outcomes in survivors of acute illness. We hypothesized that anemia management would improve hemoglobin concentrations while also generating benefits for transfusion and multidimensional functional recovery. Sixty patients experienced major bleeding, and 46 received allogeneic RBCs prior to enrollment, with a median of 2 units.

Median ICU length of stay was 3 days prior to randomization, with median postrandomization ICU LOS of 1 day in both treatment groups. Critically ill adults who were randomly assigned to an anemia prevention and treatment bundle vs standard care experienced greater posthospitalization hemoglobin recovery. Although the trial was not powered to detect changes in secondary outcomes reflecting multidimensional functional recovery, the intervention was consistently favored in point estimates for quality of life, fatigue, physical function, cognition, depressive symptoms, and anxiety, providing requisite information for a subsequent multicenter clinical trial. This notion is supported by numerically lower transfusion rates in the intervention vs standard care group through the first 3 months after hospitalization, which accompanied improved posthospitalization hemoglobin recovery.

### Association between pre-operative borderline anaemia in women and outcome after coronary artery bypass grafting: data from the Netherlands heart registration [^eb9b8782]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Haemoglobin concentration thresholds differ between men and women, with borderline anaemia (haemoglobin ≥ 12.1 and < 13.1 g dl-1) considered normal in women. However, this haemoglobin range may increase the risk of postoperative adverse outcomes after cardiac surgery.

Objectives

To determine if pre-operative borderline anaemia in women is associated with increased postoperative mortality and morbidity following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Design

A retrospective observational cohort study.

Setting

Data from The Netherlands Heart Registration, a national cardiac surgery registry, were used to analyse patients undergoing CABG from January 2013 to December 2020.

Patients

A cohort of 7802 women undergoing CABG was analysed, of whom 25% (n = 1963) had pre-operative borderline anaemia. Inclusion criteria were adult women undergoing isolated CABG; exclusion criteria included patients with severe anaemia or non-CABG procedures.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was 120-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included postoperative renal failure and need for packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion.

Results

Borderline anaemia in women was not significantly associated with 120-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.2; 95% CI 0.8 to 1.9; P = 0.366). However, it was associated with an increased risk of renal failure (AOR 2.2; 95% CI 1.1 to 4.2; P = 0.031) and PRBC transfusion (AOR 2.1; 95% CI 1.8 to 2.3; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Borderline anaemia, present in one-fourth of women undergoing CABG, does not increase mortality risk but is associated with higher postoperative morbidity, specifically renal failure and transfusion requirements.

Trial Registration

Not applicable.

### STS / SCA / AmSECT / SABM update to the clinical practice guidelines on patient blood management [^d9775d1b]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Preoperative anemia and transfusion — associations with outcomes in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery are detailed, noting There is a distinct correlation between preoperative anemia and worse clinical outcomes in most studies. Usually, the greater the anemia, the more severe the complications. In a prospective observational study of more than 200 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, preoperative hematocrit remained an independent predictor for major morbidity (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; P = 0.01), while transfusion was also a strong predictor (OR, 4.86; P < .0001). In comparisons of patients undergoing CABG surgery who did or did not receive a transfusion, there was greater mortality in the patients who received a transfusion (11% vs 3%; P = 0.001). Patients with anemia who received a transfusion had a hazard rate for mortality 3 times higher than nonanemic patients who did not receive transfusion (hazard ratio [HR], 2.918; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.512–5.633; P = 0.001), and twice that of anemic patients who did not receive a transfusion (HR, 2.087; 95% CI, 1.004–4.336; P = 0.049). Beyond mortality, preoperative anemia has also been associated with increased transfusion rates and longer intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital lengths of stay and an increase in acute kidney injury, though 1 retrospective study found only normocytic or macrocytic anemia was associated with increased adverse events.

### Analysis of anemia, transfusions, and CABG outcomes in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons national database [^bf90231e]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This study characterized the association of preoperative anemia and intraoperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion on outcomes of elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Methods

Data from 53,856 patients who underwent CABG included in The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Adult Cardiac Database in 2019 were used. The primary outcome was operative mortality. Secondary outcomes were postoperative complications. The association of anemia with outcomes was analyzed with multivariable regression models. The influence of intraoperative RBC transfusion on the effect of preoperative anemia on outcomes was studied using mediation analysis.

Results

Anemia was present in 25% of patients. Anemic patients had a higher STS Predicted Risk of Operative Mortality (1.2% vs 0.7%; P < .001). Anemia was associated with operative mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.27; 99.5% CI, 1.00–1.61; P = 0.047), postoperative RBC transfusion (OR, 2.28; 99.5% CI, 2.12–2.44; P < .001), dialysis (OR, 1.58; 99.5% CI, 1.19–2.11; P < .001), and prolonged intensive care unit and hospital length of stay. Intraoperative RBC transfusion largely mediated the effects of anemia on mortality (76%), intensive care unit stay (99%), and hospital stay, but it only partially mediated the association with dialysis (34.9%).

Conclusions

Preoperative anemia is common in patients who undergo CABG and is associated with increased postoperative risks of mortality, complications, and RBC transfusion. However, most of the effect of anemia on mortality is mediated through intraoperative RBC transfusion.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^11d0e2bd]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

What are the unmet medical needs of postoperative anaemia?

The concerns surrounding postoperative anaemia relate to its potential impact on recovery, rehabilitation, hospital re‐admission or re‐operation, and patient well‐being. Reducing allogeneic blood transfusion improves long‐term outcome and survival 27. However, restrictive transfusion protocols have led to patients being discharged with lower haemoglobin levels than before. With the current paucity of data, it remains unclear whether a lower discharge haemoglobin level may allow optimal functional recovery and quality of life 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34. There has been limited research on the consequences of postoperative anaemia in the recovery phase from surgery, with only a small number of studies after cardiac and hip and knee surgery, which demonstrated the association between postoperative anaemia and adverse outcomes such as prolonged recovery, increased mortality and likelihood of re‐admission 31, 32, 33. Postoperative anaemia may also potentially be associated with early postoperative myocardial infarction 34. Correction of postoperative anaemia, as suggested in this consensus statement, is intended to prevent such side‐effects, but studies are urgently needed to prove this.

### Perioperative Quality Initiative and enhanced recovery after surgery-cardiac society consensus statement on the management of preoperative anemia and iron deficiency in adult cardiac surgery patients [^e5a9f54b]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Preoperative anemia is common in patients presenting for cardiac surgery, with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 4, and has been associated with worse outcomes including increased risk of blood transfusion, kidney injury, stroke, infection, and death. Iron deficiency, a major cause of anemia, has also been shown to have an association with worse outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, even in the absence of anemia. Although recent guidelines have supported diagnosing and treating anemia and iron deficiency before elective surgery, details on when and how to screen and treat remain unclear. The Eighth Perioperative Quality Initiative (POQI 8) consensus conference, in conjunction with the Enhanced Recovery after Surgery-Cardiac Surgery Society, brought together an international, multidisciplinary team of experts to review and evaluate the literature on screening, diagnosing, and managing preoperative anemia and iron deficiency in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and to provide evidence-based recommendations in accordance with Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria for evaluating biomedical literature.

### Impact of major bleeding and blood transfusions after cardiac surgery: analysis from the acute catheterization and urgent intervention triage strategY (ACUITY) trial [^6f2a2ef6]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Prior retrospective studies have identified a relationship between bleeding after cardiac surgery and subsequent mortality. Whether this is attributable to bleeding, anemia, or transfusions is undetermined.

Methods

ACUITY was an international prospective trial of patients with acute coronary syndromes. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) before hospital discharge was performed in 1,491 patients. Major bleeding was adjudicated as CABG- or non-CABG related. The relationship between CABG-related bleeding and 1-year mortality was determined using a time-updated covariate-adjusted Cox model.

Results

Coronary artery bypass grafting-related major bleeding after surgery occurred in 789 patients (52.9%); allogeneic blood product transfusions were administered in 612 patients (41.0%), including red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in 570 (38.2%, range 1–53 U), platelet transfusions in 180 (12.1%), and fresh-frozen plasma in 195 (13.1%). One-year mortality occurred in 95 patients (6.4%). Red blood cell transfusion (but not transfusion of platelets or fresh-frozen plasma, CABG-related major bleeding per se, or nadir hemoglobin) was an independent predictor of 1-year mortality, but only after transfusion of ≥ 4 U (adjusted hazard ratio for death after transfusion of 1–3, 4–6, and ≥ 7 RBC units = 0.74, 2.01, and 5.22, respectively). Of the 95 deaths after CABG, 23 (24.2%) were attributable to CABG-related RBC transfusions.

Conclusions

In patients with acute coronary syndromes, RBC transfusion of ≥ 4 U after CABG is strongly associated with subsequent mortality. Future strategies should focus on reducing major hemorrhagic complications and RBC transfusions after CABG.

### Preoperative anemia in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting predicts acute kidney injury [^3c112b4b]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Recent authoritative studies suggested that low preoperative hemoglobin concentration may affect cardiac surgery outcomes. This study aimed, primarily, to investigate whether preoperative anemia is an independent determinant of adverse events after coronary artery bypass grafting and, secondarily, to evaluate the potential dose responsiveness between anemia severity and primary end points.

Methods

This single-center prospective study investigated 1214 consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting between January 2004 and June 2007, collecting 100 variables per patient. In 1047 patients (median age 64 years, 18.8% female, 38.9% diabetic, 31.9% urgent/emergency, 15.3% with low preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction) who underwent on-pump procedures and received no preoperative transfusion, the prevalence of preoperative anemia (according to World Health Organization definition) and its unadjusted and adjusted relationships with in-hospital death, cardiac morbidity, and acute kidney injury (AKI-RIFLE [Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage kidney disease] criteria) were obtained.

Results

The prevalence of preoperative anemia was 28%. In-hospital death averaged 3.9%, cardiac morbidity 7.3%, and acute kidney injury 4%. Unadjusted odds ratios (Ors) for in-hospital death, cardiac morbidity, and acute kidney injury were 3.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0–7.3), 1.7 (95% CI 1.1–2.8), and 4.0 (95% CI 2.1–7.6), respectively. Adjusting for anemia in confounders proved an independent predictor of acute kidney injury (OR 2.06; 95% CI 1.14–3.70), whereas the cardiac morbidity and in-hospital mortality were independently predicted by kidney function. No dose-response relationship emerged between anemia severity and acute kidney injury.

Conclusions

Preoperative anemia is independently associated with acute kidney injury after coronary artery bypass grafting. Further studies are warranted to determine whether preoperative low hemoglobin concentration is a marker of severity of illness or a modifiable risk factor.

### Mortality across the spectrum of hemoglobin level in patients undergoing surgical coronary revascularization [^b0aecbf6]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

4.1 Limitations

We did our best to include and adjust all important confounding parameters. However, more data are needed to evaluate etiologic pathways in addition to other possible confounders which were not included. In assessing blood loss in the operation room, the number of transfused packed cells is among the important variables. The association between transfusion and post‐CABG mortality has been established before, and its effect is independent of the presence of preoperative anemia and Hb levels. To decrease the effect of this confounder, we enrolled only nonanemic patients in our study. Although not able to omit this factor and as reported before that most anemic patients who underwent CABG needed blood transfusion during surgery, our inclusion criteria could overcome this issue to some extent.

Mid‐ and long‐term outcomes are associated with much more parameters and cannot be justified merely with preoperative baseline characteristics. Unfortunately, we could not capture changes in risk factor profile after CABG; hence postdischarge results should be assessed with caution. Finally, the single‐center nature of our study is another limitation that should be taken into consideration. This warrants further similar studies in other settings to confirm the findings of the present study.

### Preoperative anemia does not increase the risks of early surgical revascularization after myocardial infarction [^fee576e9]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Recent clinical studies suggest preoperative anemia may increase mortality and morbidity after cardiac surgery. Anemic patients are potentially even more vulnerable in the setting of a recent myocardial infarction (MI). The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of preoperative anemia on short-term outcomes after coronary bypass surgery in patients with a recent MI.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 655 patients who underwent an isolated coronary bypass procedure within 21 days of MI, 432 of whom were anemic preoperatively, defined as a hemoglobin less than 13 g/dL for men and less than 12 g/dL for women. The primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and major adverse events (MAE), which included MI, stroke, and renal failure requiring dialysis.

Results

Before risk adjustment, in-hospital mortality and the incidence of MAE were significantly higher in patients with anemia versus no anemia (mortality, 5.1% versus 1.4%, p = 0.02; MAE, 8.6% versus 3.1%, p = 0.009). After risk adjustment, the association between preoperative anemia and mortality or MAE became insignificant (mortality odds ratio 2.34, 95% confidence interval: 0.56 to 9.87, p = 0.25; MAE odds ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval: 0.46 to 2.79, p = 0.78). Preoperative hemoglobin, treated as a continuous variable, yielded similar results.

Conclusions

Preoperative anemia does not directly increase risks of surgical revascularization performed within 21 days of MI.

### The efficacy of intravenous iron for treatment of anemia before cardiac surgery: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis [^26ffbb19]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Identification and characteristics of eligible studies

The search yielded 923 citations (206 from PubMed, 610 from Embase and 107 from CENTRAL). We excluded 233 duplicates and a further 657 citations after title and abstract screening and assessed 33 full texts. Finally, 6 RCTs and 5 observational studies were included in this meta-analysis (Fig. 1). The characteristics of the included studies are described in Table 1. There were 2286 patients included in this study. The sample size of the included studies ranged from 40 to 771 patients. Four RCTs compared IV iron (combined with other agents in three studies) with placebo, 2 RCTs compared IV iron with oral iron, and 5 observational studies compared IV iron with no treatment. Additionally, although all studies investigated the effect of IV iron, the drug was administered at different dosages and time intervals. The dosage of IV iron ranged from 200 to 1000 mg per patient, and the time interval of IV iron administration ranged from one day before surgery to 10 weeks before surgery. Four RCTs and two observational studies noted elaborate transfusion triggers in their studies, with hemoglobin levels ranging from 7 to 8 g/L.

### Different antithrombotic strategies after coronary artery bypass grafting to prevent adverse events: a retrospective analysis [^77b4e426]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Antiplatelet therapy is a major strategy to prevent post-CABG failure and adverse events. While aspirin therapy after CABG has been proven to be a safe approach to improve vein graft patency and reduce adverse events, there have been no dedicated large-scale studies in the CABG population to support postoperative dual antiplatelet therapy. Continuation of DAPT before the surgery increases the risk of excessive perioperative bleeding, transfusions, and re-exploration for bleeding, which suggests the likelihood of a high risk of bleeding in postoperative DAPT patients. In a meta-analysis of 20,315 patients, DAPT (as compared to single antiplatelet therapy) was associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality in observational studies, but not in randomized trials or in patients with stable ischemic heart disease. Additionally, DAPT was correlated with an increased risk for major bleeding in that study. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline Focused Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease issued recommendations to utilize DAPT over SAPT in patients following CABG in 2016. Another meta-analysis showed increased vein graft patency with DAPT, but increased postoperative bleeding was also noted. Current guidelines recommend postoperative DAPT based upon the stability of coronary artery disease prior to CABG. In 2017, F. Biancari et al. proposed a Will-Bleed score to evaluate the risk of severe bleeding after CABG. Seven parameters with different weights were included in this model: preoperative anemia, female gender, eGFR, potent antiplatelet drugs discontinued less than five days, critical preoperative state, ACS, and use of LMWH/fondaparinux/unfractionated heparin. This risk score simplified the evaluating process and showed optimistic ability for prediction.

### Impact of red blood cell transfusion on in-hospital mortality of isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery: a retrospective observational study of French nationwide 3-year cohort [^e38f866f]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the relationship between red blood cell (RBC) transfusion exposure and in-hospital mortality after isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

Background

RBC transfusion was commonly used to treat anemia in isolated CABG surgery, but transfusion was found an independent risk factor of postoperative mortality; recent guidelines on patient blood management strategy issued in the last decade may have changed transfusion incidence and related mortality.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted from the National database on patients' hospital discharge reports. Consecutive adult patients who underwent isolated CABG surgery in France from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018, were included. The primary outcome was the in-hospital mortality rate. RBC transfusion during the hospital stay was identified by specific codes and ordered as categorical variables (no, moderate, or massive transfusion).

Results

A total of 37,498 participants were studied [mean (SD) age, 66.5 (9.6) years, 31,587 (84.2%) were men]. In-hospital mortality rate was 1.45% (n = 541) and RBC transfusion rate was 9.4% (n = 3521). In-hospital deaths were more frequent among transfused patients [1.06% (361) if no transfusion up to 10.2% (n = 113) if massive transfusion]. After adjustment for confounding variables, RBC transfusion remained a significant independent factor of in-hospital mortality: odds ratio = 1.66 (95% confidence interval: 1.27–2.19, P < 0.001) for moderate transfusion, 6.40 (95% confidence interval: 5.07–8.09, P < 0.001) if massive.

Conclusions and Relevance

Despite a modest patients' exposure to transfusion, this study suggests that RBC administration is an independent factor of in-hospital mortality in isolated CABG surgery.

### The association between preoperative anemia, blood transfusion need, and postoperative complications in adult cardiac surgery, a single center contemporary experience [^cd150994]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), anemia is defined as a hemoglobin (Hb) level of less than 13.0 g/dl in adult males or less than 12.0 g/dl in nonpregnant adult females. Preoperative anemia may be associated with the worst postoperative outcomes in cardiac surgery, with an estimated prevalence ranging from 16 to 54%. A multicenter study performed by Sallam et al. demonstrated that patients with preoperative anemia are more susceptible to developing sternal wound infections than nonanemic patients. Another study showed that the one-year mortality rate is significantly higher in patients with preoperative anemia, but there were no significant differences in one-month mortality rates. Nevertheless, other studies suggested that preoperative anemia is not an independent risk factor after multivariate-adjusted analysis but rather a marker of underlying comorbidities, including age, acute coronary syndrome, diabetes, renal insufficiency, and extensive coronary disease, which are associated with poor postoperative outcome.

Furthermore, preoperative anemia is an independent predictor for increased transfusion requirements during cardiac surgery. A study performed by Nguyen et al. showed that the transfusion rate in cardiac surgery among anemic patients was 53% versus 10% in the nonanemic group. Transfusion of blood and blood products is associated with the risk of posttransfusion complications, and therefore, anemic patients are at higher risk of developing postoperative complications. The most common postoperative complications found were mortality, organ dysfunction, serious infections, renal failure, cardiac complications, neurologic complications, overall morbidity, and prolonged ventilator support. Al-harbi et al. found a significant increase in the risk of infection after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients who received blood transfusions, and pneumonia was the most reported infection after CABG. In addition, patients who received a blood transfusion had longer preoperative and postoperative hospitalization times than those who did not receive any blood transfusions. A longer hospitalization duration predisposed the patients to a higher risk of developing nosocomial infections. Other studies, however, have found no association between blood transfusion and the incidence of infection, acute kidney injury (AKI), or long-term mortality (30 days to 5 years).

### Transfusion thresholds for acute coronary syndromes-insights from the TRICS-III randomized controlled trial, systematic review, and meta-analysis [^3d460ab7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Both anemia and red blood cell transfusion are associated with morbidity and mortality in patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndromes (ACSs); these exposures are tightly linked, and their attributable risks are difficult to isolate. To reduce unnecessary blood exposure, transfusion should only be administered if/when its net benefits outweigh the risks associated with anemia. Hemoglobin thresholds are currently used for evaluating the severity of anemia and for guiding transfusion therapy; however, there is controversy surrounding the optimal hemoglobin threshold for transfusion in this patient population. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing hemoglobin‐guided restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategies are difficult to interpret, and there is a paucity of available data on long‐term outcomes. We therefore performed a subset analysis of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the TRICS‐III (Transfusion Thresholds in Cardiac Surgery) RCT to add evidence addressing this important clinical question and further interpret the results using a systematic‐review, meta‐analysis, and trial‐sequential analysis.

The previously describedmultinational TRICS‐III trial (NCT02042898) randomly assigned patients with a moderate‐to‐high risk of death undergoing cardiac surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass to a restrictive transfusion strategy (transfuse at a hemoglobin level < 7.5 g/dL) or liberal strategy (operating room and intensive care unit: transfuse at a hemoglobin level < 9.5 g/dL; ward: < 8.5 g/dL). Appropriate ethical board review and approval were obtained from each participating site, and informed consent was obtained from all participants. Patients with AMI were those with a recent myocardial infarction (MI) (< 90 days of surgery) undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery and ≥ 1 of the following enrichment criteria: unstable angina, critical preoperative state, use of preoperative intra‐aortic balloon pump, and/or undergoing emergency surgery. The primary outcome was a per‐protocol analysis of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) defined as all‐cause death, MI, and revascularization at 6 months.

### Modifiable risk factors remain significant causes of medium term mortality after first time coronary artery bypass grafting [^b0f55615]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Caputo et al reported the medium term survival of 1,479 patients who had undergone off-pump coronary arterial revascularisation. They reported a 2 year mortality of 4.7% in patients who received a complete revascularisation. Of note they found a 10.8% 2 year mortality in patients who received an incomplete revascularisation. Our 2 year survival is therefore comparable to this cohort of patients operated on with off pump surgery with complete revascularization.

The Multicenter Study of Perioperative Ischemia Research Group found in an analysis of 2,048 patients from 24 centres that the 5 year survival was adversely impacted by age, diabetes, congestive heart failure and anaemia, in agreement with our own results.

Gao et al analysed 56,543 patients who underwent CABG at one of 43 veterans hospitals for risk factors for long term survival. They found that diabetes had an increasing impact on survival, eventually doubling mortality at 9 years post-operatively. They also found that COPD, age and urgent surgery persisted as a risk factor in the years post surgery in agreement with our results. Their 5 year survival was 81% in their cohort of patients with the same mean age as our own.

### Perioperative anemia management as part of PBM in cardiac surgery – A narrative updated review [^28b298df]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Anemia is common in patients with cardiac disease. Iron deficiency is the cause of anemia in about 80% of all cases. Preoperative anemia is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The risk of receiving red blood cell transfusions, which are potentially associated with severe side effects, is very high in these patients. Patient Blood Management (PBM) is a multidisciplinary approach to manage anemia, minimize unnecessary blood loss, and optimize transfusion therapy. PBM comprises 3 pillars: (1) detection and treatment of preoperative anemia, (2) reduction of perioperative blood loss, and (3) optimization of allogeneic blood therapy. The World Health Organization has urged all Member States to implement PBM. This narrative review focuses on pre-, intra-, and postoperative strategies to detect, prevent, and treat anemia as part of PBM in cardiac surgery.

### Preoperative anemia increases mortality and postoperative morbidity after cardiac surgery [^cceeb14b]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, preoperative anemia, defined as hemoglobin level < 13 g/dl for men and < 12 g/dl for women, is an independent risk factor for mortality, postoperative renal dysfunction, stroke and prolonged hospital stay.

### Patient blood management in Europe [^91d3ffe0]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Prospective and retrospective cohort studies have consistently shown that patients with preoperative anaemia have poorer postoperative outcomes than non-anaemic patients. Early data suggested that severe preoperative anaemia (Hb < 8 g dL −1) independently predicted postoperative mortality in patients undergoing various unspecified types of surgery. A recent retrospective cohort study demonstrated a higher postoperative 30 day morbidity and mortality in patients who underwent major non-cardiac surgery with preoperative anaemia than in those without anaemia. In elderly patients with hip fracture, anaemia (Hb < 12 g dL −1 for females and < 13 g dL −1 for males) was significantly associated with 2- to 5- and 3-fold increases in the multivariate-adjusted risk of 6 and 12 month mortality, respectively. Patients with Hb < 10 g dL −1 were at a 5-fold increased risk of death. Subsequent studies have confirmed the association between preoperative anaemia and postoperative mortality in this population, and in patients undergoing other types of surgery. In addition to mortality, preoperative anaemia is also significantly and independently associated with increased morbidity, including the elevated risk of infectious complications and a prolongation of postoperative hospital stay. – Some studies have linked perioperative anaemia to impaired postoperative functional recovery after surgery for hip fracture, although it was not an independent factor in a prospective multivariate analysis. In addition, anaemia is a risk factor for both early and late mortality in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Transfusion may be regarded as the default therapy for anaemia, as it is considered as safe and is rapidly effective. However, accumulating, there is increasing evidence that the correction of preoperative anaemia using transfusion is associated with risks that may contribute to morbidity and mortality in surgical patients. Consequently, there is increasing recognition of new approaches to the management of anaemia, collectively referred to as patient blood management (PBM). This article, based on discussions held by a panel of expert anaesthetists, surgeons, and nurses, explores the risks associated with the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in the management of perioperative anaemia, primarily in orthopaedic surgery, and the role of PBM in improving the quality of care in this setting. It also highlights examples of successful PBM programmes, overviews current practice patterns in Europe, and offers recommendations for supporting the wider implementation of PBM.

### Thrombocytopenia and anemia after cardiac surgery [^5ad6b81e]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Case Presentation

An 83‐year‐old Caucasian female with hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes presented to the hospital with acute chest pain, nausea, and diaphoresis; she had a previous history of coronary angioplasty (9 years prior). Acute non‐ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) was diagnosed based upon non‐specific T wave abnormalities and high‐sensitivity troponin‐I rise (peak, 780 ng/mL; reference range [RR], < 40). She received enteric‐coated aspirin (160 mg first dose; subsequently, 81 mg daily) and 2.5 mg of fondaparinux daily by subcutaneous injection. Heart catheterization, performed with 3000 units (U) of unfractionated heparin [UFH], revealed triple‐vessel coronary artery disease (including 80% stenosis in the left anterior descending artery), with left ventricle function preserved; coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery was scheduled.

CABG surgery is common in the United States (400 000 procedures per year). While percutaneous coronary intervention may be used to treat NSTEMI, CABG is often performed for triple‐vessel coronary disease with stenosi(e)s greater than 70%. Patlolla and coworkers reported better long‐term survival in patients undergoing CABG surgery within 7 days following NSTEMI versus CABG surgery performed later. This patient was judged to be a relatively good candidate for CABG. This patient was treated in a Canadian hospital, and thus the antithrombin‐dependent pentasaccharide anticoagulant, fondaparinux — which is approved in Canada for coronary artery thrombosis prophylaxis in STEMI patients based upon efficacy and safety (versus enoxaparin) in this clinical setting — was administered (note: fondaparinux is not approved for coronary thrombosis prophylaxis by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration).

### Hemoglobin optimization for coronary bypass: a 10-year Canadian multicenter experience [^df04b7b2]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

We report our 10-year experience of a multicenter hemoglobin optimization program with the aim to reduce red blood cell transfusion in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Methods

From 2006 to 2016, patients undergoing CABG at 10 centers in Ontario were referred to the Ontario Transfusion Coordinators (ONTraC) program. Of these, we present data on the first 60 consecutive patients per center, per year (n = 6,145).

Results

Overall, 45.7% patients were assessed < 14 days preoperatively, 16.4% were assessed ≥ 14 days preoperatively, and 37.9% were not assessed by ONTraC preoperatively. Transfusion rates fell from 40.1% in 2006 to 26.2% in 2016 (p < 0.01). Patients undergoing assessment were more likely to be older (p < 0.01), female (p < 0.01), and anemic (p < 0.01) versus nonassessed patients. Those patients assessed were more likely to be treated with iron (p < 0.01) and erythropoietin (p < 0.01) preoperatively versus nonassessed patients. Transfusion rates were 26%, 28%, and 28% for patients undergoing assessment ≥ 14 days prior to operation, < 14 days prior to operation, or not at all. After baseline covariate adjustment, patients assessed ≥ 14 days preoperatively had shorter length of stay (effect -0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.41 to -0.25; p < 0.01) and a trend towards lower risk of red blood cell transfusion (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.00; p = 0.06). Blood transfusion was independently associated with an increased risk of death (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.60; p < 0.01), infection (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.30; p < 0.01), and longer hospital length of stay (effect 1.49, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.62; p < 0.01).

Conclusions

The results of this study suggest that preoperative hemoglobin optimization may be effective in reducing red blood cell transfusion after CABG, particularly for patients assessed ≥ 14 days preoperatively.

### Unexpected impact of preoperative anemia in low-risk isolated coronary artery bypass grafting or single-valve surgical patients: Do not overlook these patients in anemia management! [^a919830a]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Preoperative anemia is prevalent in cardiac surgery and independently associated with increased risk for short-term and long-term mortality. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of preoperative hematocrit (Hct) on outcomes in cardiac surgical patients and whether the effect is comparable across levels of Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality (STS PROM).

Methods

The study consisted of adult, isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or single-valve surgical patients in a statewide registry from 2011 to 2022 (N = 29,828). Regressions were used to assess effect of preoperative Hct on STS-defined major morbidity/mortality including the interaction of Hct and STS PROM as continuous variables.

Results

Median age was 66 years (58–73 years), STS PROM was 1.02% (0.58%-1.99%), and preoperative Hct was 39.5% (35.8%-42.8%). The sample consisted of 78% isolated CABG (n = 23,261), 10% isolated mitral valve repair/replacement (n = 3119), 12% isolated aortic valve replacement (n = 3448), and 29% were female (n = 8646). Multivariable analyses found that greater Hct was associated with reduced risk of STS-defined morbidity/mortality (odds ratio, 0.96; P < .001). These effects for Hct persisted even after adjustment for intraoperative blood transfusion. The interaction of Hct and STS PROM was significant for morbidity/mortality (odds ratio, 1.01; P < .001). There was a stronger association between Hct levels and morbidity/mortality risk in the patients with the lowest STS risk compared with patients with the greatest STS risk.

Conclusions

Patients with lower risk had a greater association between preoperative Hct and major morbidity and mortality compared with patients with greater risk. Preoperative anemia management is essential across all risk groups for improved outcomes.

### Preoperative anemia increases mortality and postoperative morbidity after cardiac surgery [^7aba339d]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study demonstrates that preoperative anemia defined by the World Health Organization as hemoglobin level < 13 g/dl for men and < 12 gr/dl for women, is a risk factor for mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Low levels of hemoglobin were associated with tripling in the risk of death and postoperative renal dysfunction. Furthermore, patients with preoperative anemia had a 30% increased risk of prolonged hospital stay > 7 days. We did not observe any significant relationship between anemia and the risk of myocardial infarction. Finally, as shown in Figure 3, the estimated probability of death increased with decreasing levels of preoperative hemoglobin.

Anemia is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease in the general population. The authors of the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study analyzed 14,410 low risk subjects in the general population between the ages of 45 and 64 years and suggested that anemia was associated with increased risk in the total rate of myocardial infarction, coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass surgery or heart disease death. Moreover, several studies have shown that low levels of hemoglobin were independent predictors of mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease. In a cohort of 12,065 patients with new-onset heart failure, Ezekowitz showed a 34% increased risk in mortality associated with anemia. Furthermore, Sabatine et al. in a review of 39,922 patients from 16 randomized trials, demonstrated that patients with ST- elevation MI had a progressive increase in cardiovascular mortality and heart failure as the baseline hemoglobin dropped below 14 g/dl, whereas subjects with non ST-elevation MI had an increased odds of cardiovascular death, MI, and recurrent ischemia as the baseline hemoglobin fell below 11 g/dl.

### A clinical trial assessing the efficacy of intravenous iron… [^e34fa089]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

A Clinical Trial Assessing the Efficacy of Intravenous Iron for the Treatment of Anemia Following Cardiac Surgery ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview BACKGROUND Anemia and iron deficiency are highly prevalent in cardiac surgery patients. Both conditions may adversely affect postoperative rehabilitation. At hospital discharge, anemia is almost invariably present due to perioperative blood loss and frequent blood sampling. Two previous analyses demonstrated a prevalence of anemia early after coronary artery bypass grafting of 94% and 98%, respectively. Almost half of CABG patients had persistent anemia two months after surgery. Postoperative anemia may result in debilitating symptoms, like dyspnoea, fatigue and poor exercise tolerance, and is associated with an increased likelihood of cardiovascular events and death after cardiac surgery. Mild to moderate anemia is commonly corrected with oral iron supplements.

Oral iron is however poorly absorbed in patients with chronic diseases, and about 40% of patients suffer from debilitating gastrointestinal side-effects. As iron stores are frequently reduced or depleted after cardiac surgery, treatment with oral iron supplements may take several months. In patients with chronic heart failure, iron deficiency is associated with reduced exercise capacity, quality of life and survival even in the absence of anemia. Several large randomised trials demonstrated that treatment with intravenous iron improved clinical symptoms, exercise capacity and quality of life of CHF patients. RATIONALE It is desirable to replenish body iron stores rapidly after cardiac surgery with the aim to effectively correct anemia, optimize exercise tolerance and improve patient wellbeing. Modern intravenous iron formulations permit fast replenishment of body iron stores and have emerged as potential alternatives to oral iron.

These formulations are well-tolerated and have become an established therapeutic option in anemic patients with reduced intestinal iron absorption. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of intravenous iron for the treatment of anemia following major non-cardiac surgery.
- Patients 18 years of age or older undergoing first-time, non-emergent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Eligible procedures are A: isolated CABG surgery, B: isolated cardiac valve surgery, C: a combination of CABG and cardiac valve surgery.

### Preoperative anemia and postoperative outcomes in cardiac surgery: a mediation analysis evaluating intraoperative transfusion exposures [^08f7e367]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Preoperative anemia is associated with adverse outcomes in cardiac surgery, yet it remains unclear what proportion of this association is mediated through red blood cell (RBC) transfusions.

Methods

This is a historical observational cohort study of adults undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting or valve surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass at an academic medical center between May 1, 2008, and May 1, 2018. A mediation analysis framework was used to evaluate the associations between preoperative anemia and postoperative outcomes, including a primary outcome of acute kidney injury (AKI). Intraoperative RBC transfusions were evaluated as mediators of preoperative anemia and outcome relationships. The estimated total effect, average direct effect of preoperative anemia, and percent of the total effect mediated through transfusions are presented with 95% confidence intervals and P -values.

Results

A total of 4117 patients were included, including 1234 (30%) with preoperative anemia. Overall, 437 of 4117 (11%) patients went on to develop AKI, with a greater proportion of patients having preoperative anemia (219 of 1234 [18%] vs 218 of 2883 [8%]). In multivariable analyses, the presence of preoperative anemia was associated with increased postoperative AKI (6.4% [4.2%-8.7%] absolute difference in percent with AKI, P < .001), with incremental decreases in preoperative hemoglobin concentrations displaying greater AKI risk (eg, 11.9% [6.9%-17.5%] absolute increase in probability of AKI for preoperative hemoglobin of 9 g/dL compared to a reference of 14 g/dL, P < .001). The association between preoperative anemia and postoperative AKI was primarily due to direct effects of preoperative anemia (5.9% [3.6%-8.3%] absolute difference, P < .001) rather than mediated through intraoperative RBC transfusions (7.5% [-4.3% to 21.1%] of the total effect mediated by transfusions, P = 0.220). Preoperative anemia was also associated with longer hospital durations (1.07 [1.05–1.10] ratio of geometric mean length of stay, P < .001). Of this total effect, 38% (22%, 62%; P < .001) was estimated to be mediated through subsequent intraoperative RBC transfusion. Preoperative anemia was not associated with reoperation or vascular complications.

Conclusions

Preoperative anemia was associated with higher odds of AKI and longer hospitalizations in cardiac surgery. The attributable effects of anemia and transfusion on postoperative complications are likely to differ across outcomes. Future studies are necessary to further evaluate mechanisms of anemia-associated postoperative organ injury and treatment strategies.

### The pressure field as a methodology for fluid management and red cell preservation during cardiac surgery [^945917a0]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anemia is an independent risk factor for surgical morbidity and mortality, but red cell transfusion is not the answer. Red cell transfusion causes an increase in early and late morbidity and mortality: it is immunomodulatory and increases surgical reintervention, postoperative infection rates and cancer-related mortality after cystectomy, and after surgery for colorectal cancer and gastric cancer. Further, the morbidity associated with the combination of anemia and red cell transfusion is greater than their additive effects. If anemia and red cell transfusion both increase morbidity, then the argument for avoiding both is crystal clear. Since Isbister proposed the concept of patient blood management (PBM), this multi-modal approach to mitigate preoperative anemia, optimize coagulation, preserve red cells during surgery and tolerate lower transfusion thresholds following surgery has gained broad acceptance.

PBM is particularly relevant to cardiac surgery, as more than 50% of cardiac surgical patients receive a transfusion. Schwann et al. argued that transfusion causes a doubling of all-cause mortality at 5-years after coronary artery bypass grafting, and that transfusion is an independent predictor of early coronary occlusion. Other effects of red cell transfusion after cardiac surgery include atrial fibrillation and sepsis. To address this issue, in 2007 the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Blood Conservation Guideline Task Force examined the evidence base for each component of PBM in cardiac surgery, with the guidelines updated in 2021. The guidelines recommend meticulous attention to hemostasis, the use of antifibrinolytics to reduce perioperative bleeding, acute normovolemic hemodilution with post-bypass reinfusion, the use of retrograde autologous priming of the bypass circuit, and routine use of red cell scavenging and reinfusion following centrifugation (but not the direct reinfusion of shed mediastinal blood). The benefit of this systematic approach has been validated. The guidelines provide an important synopsis of the problem and helpful guidance, while assuming that the principal drivers of perioperative transfusion are inadequate erythropoiesis and intraoperative red cell loss.

### Influence of chronic kidney disease on early clinical outcomes after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting [^c94e3571]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Preoperative CKD and worse renal function is associated with increased hospital stay and costs. Creatinine clearance rates decreasing from 80 mL/min to 60 mL/min, 40 mL/min, and 20 mL/min result in total hospital expenses increasing by 10, 20, and 30%, respectively; the incidence and mortality related to dialysis also increases. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen perioperative management and develop comprehensive strategies for high-risk patients, to improve prognosis and reduce complications and mortality. We suggest: 1. Preoperative assessment of high-risk patients with CKD is conducive to rational allocation of medical resources and targeted prevention and management. More severe preoperative CKD is associated with higher surgical mortality. A retrospective analysis of 483,914 patients undergoing CABG alone showed that the operative mortality rate was 1.3% in patients with normal renal function and increased to 9.3% in those with severe renal insufficiency (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2) not on dialysis. Conversely, for every 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 increase in eGFR, the risk of death decreases by 20%. The use of the CKD-EPI equation to calculate eGFR for grouping patients according to CKD severity is also a good predictor of postoperative complications and mortality. Charytan et al. suggested that factors such as repeat cardiac surgery, stroke, cardiogenic shock, emergency surgery, and composite valve surgery should be included in the preoperative risk assessment to identify high-risk patients for surgery; however, the specificity and sensitivity of these factors require verification. 2. Active control of complications, such as controlling hypertension, correcting anemia, and rational treatment of peripheral artery disease is important. Patients with CKD have a high incidence of hypertension, which may lead to or result from CKD. Hypertension aggravates CKD, which then increases the difficulty of controlling hypertension. Anemia is also a common manifestation with renal insufficiency, and renal dysfunction leads to decreased erythropoietin secretion and anemia. Both anemia and CKD can predict myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary heart disease; the severity of the anemia is associated with the degree of myocardial ischemia. 3. New targeted drug therapies such as small-dose human atrial natriuretic peptide injections perioperatively during on-pump CABG can improve perioperative cardiac and renal function and reduce the incidence of cardiac events and new dialysis requirement. However, the role of human atrial natriuretic peptide injections in off-pump CABG must be verified.

### Rationale and design of the intravenous iron for treatment of anemia before cardiac surgery trial [^ec59a7b1]. American Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background Approximately 20% to 30% of patients awaiting cardiac surgery are anemic. Anemia increases the likelihood of requiring a red cell transfusion and is associated with increased complications, intensive care, and hospital stay following surgery. Iron deficiency is the commonest cause of anemia and preoperative intravenous (IV) iron therapy thus may improve anemia and therefore patient outcome following cardiac surgery. We have initiated the intravenous iron for treatment of anemia before cardiac surgery (ITACS) Trial to test the hypothesis that in patients with anemia awaiting elective cardiac surgery, IV iron will reduce complications, and facilitate recovery after surgery. Methods ITACS is a 1,000 patient, international randomized trial in patients with anemia undergoing elective cardiac surgery. The patients, health care providers, data collectors, and statistician are blinded to whether patients receive IV iron 1,000 mg, or placebo, at 1–26 weeks before their planned date of surgery. The primary endpoint is the number of days alive and at home up to 90 days after surgery. Results To date, ITACS has enrolled 615 patients in 30 hospitals in 9 countries. Patient mean (SD) age is 66 (12) years, 63% are male, with a mean (SD) hemoglobin at baseline of 118 (12) g/L; 40% have evidence (ferritin < 100 ng/mL and/or transferrin saturation < 25%) suggestive of iron deficiency. Most (59%) patients have undergone coronary artery surgery with or without valve surgery. Conclusions The ITACS Trial will be the largest study yet conducted to ascertain the benefits and risks of IV iron administration in anemic patients awaiting cardiac surgery.

### Postoperative outcomes following cardiac surgery in non-anaemic iron-replete and iron-deficient patients-an exploratory study [^c07dce9f]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is strongly associated with poor outcomes after cardiac surgery. However, pre-operative non-anaemic iron deficiency (a probable anaemia precursor) has not been comprehensively examined in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, despite biological plausibility and evidence from other patient populations of negative effect on outcome. This exploratory retrospective cohort study aimed to compare an iron-deficient group of patients undergoing cardiac surgery with an iron-replete group. Consecutive non-anaemic patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting or single valve replacement in our institution between January 2013 and December 2015 were considered for inclusion. Data from a total of 277 patients were analysed, and were categorised by iron status and blood haemoglobin concentration into iron-deficient (n = 109) and iron-replete (n = 168) groups. Compared with the iron-replete group, patients in the iron-deficient group were more likely to be female (43% vs. 12%, iron-replete, respectively); older, mean (SD) age 64.4 (9.7) vs. 63.2 (10.3) years; and to have a higher pre-operative EuroSCORE (median IQR [range]) 3 (2–5 [0–10]) vs. 3 (2–4 [0–9]), with a lower preoperative haemoglobin of 141.6 (11.6) vs. 148.3 (11.7) g.l -1. Univariate analysis suggested that iron-deficient patients had a longer hospital length of stay (7 (6–9 [2–40]) vs. 7 (5–8 [4–23]) days; p = 0.013) and fewer days alive and out of hospital at postoperative day 90 (83 (80–84 [0–87]) vs. 83 (81–85 [34–86]), p = 0.009). There was no evidence of an association between iron deficiency and either lower nadir haemoglobin or higher requirement for blood products during inpatient stay. After adjusting the model for pre-operative age, sex, renal function, EuroSCORE and haemoglobin, the mean increase in hospital length of stay in the iron-deficient group relative to the iron-replete group was 0.86 days (bootstrapped 95%CI -0.37 to 2.22, p = 0.098). This exploratory study suggests there is weak evidence of an association between non-anaemic iron deficiency and outcome after cardiac surgery after controlling for potentially confounding variables.

### STS / SCA / AmSECT / SABM update to the clinical practice guidelines on patient blood management [^31cf984f]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Preoperative management — risk assessment for anemia in cardiac surgery states: Assessment of anemia and determination of its etiology is appropriate in all patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and it is reasonable to treat with intravenous iron preparations if time permits (Class IIa, Level B-R). Anemia burden is substantial, with the prevalence of anemia in the 30% to 40% range and severe anemia by World Health Organization classification of hemoglobin of less than 8 g/dL in the 8% to 10% range. Iron deficiency is the most prevalent cause of anemia in the cardiac surgical population, occurring in up to 50% of anemic patients; iron‑deficiency anemia is usually microcytic, whereas normocytic or macrocytic anemia stem from a variety of causes. Routine iron studies are of importance in the determination of the type of anemia present and should be done routinely in the careful preoperative assessment of patients so that treatment can be instituted if warranted, and differentiation must be made between anemias caused by iron deficiency as opposed to other causes of anemia.

### On-pump versus off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery in patients with preoperative anemia [^1e347d69]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The study objective was to evaluate the effects on early outcome and midterm survival of performing coronary artery bypass grafting with the off-pump technique in comparison with cardiopulmonary bypass (on-pump) in patients with preoperative anemia.

Methods

Consecutive adult anemic patients (preoperative hemoglobin < 13.0 g/dL in men and < 12.0 g/dL in women) resident in Puglia region who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting between January 2011 and November 2013 were considered. Vital status was ascertained from the date of surgery to December 31, 2013. Odds ratio and hazard ratio (HR) were estimated. Propensity score methods were used to control for confounders.

Results

Of 939 anemic patients (234 female, aged 71 ± 9 years), 361 underwent operation with the off-pump technique and 578 underwent operation with the on-pump technique. Patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass had a shorter intensive care unit length of stay, lower blood transfusion rate, and postoperative reduction in creatinine clearance. During a median follow-up of 18 months, 126 patients died: 46 in hospital (35 on-pump) and 80 after discharge (33 on-pump). In comparison with the off-pump technique, the on-pump technique had greater hospital mortality (odds ratio, 2.57; P = 0.028) and 30-day incidence of fatal events (HR, 2.67; P = 0.026). After a period without risk differences between groups (1–6 months; HR, 0.79; P = 0.618), a lower mortality in those undergoing the on-pump technique was detected (after 6 months HR, 0.35; P = 0.014). All results were confirmed in the 157 pairs of patients matched for propensity score, anemia grade, and surgery center.

Conclusions

In patients with low levels of preoperative hemoglobin, off-pump coronary artery bypass was associated with lower early morbidity and mortality but a greater risk of mortality during follow-up compared with on-pump coronary artery bypass.

### Arterial and venous thrombosis complicating coronary artery bypass grafting after use of epoetin alfa-epbx [^fb90e4fa]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary artery and aortic arch thrombosis after the use of epoetin alfa-epbx.

Central Message

We would like to add to the evidence that the use of erythropoietin-stimulating agents for preoperative anemia in patients undergoing cardiac surgery may carry a substantial risk of thrombotic events.

See Commentaries on pages 156 and 158.

Epoetin alfa-epbx is one of the erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) produced using recombinant DNA technology that are used to treat anemia. In a perioperative setting, ESAs are administered to reduce allogeneic transfusion risk and increase red blood cell mass for surgical patients, including those unwilling or unable to receive transfusions.ESAs are recommended as a IIa recommendation in preoperative anemia-management guidelines for patients unwilling to receive transfusions. Clinical trials evaluating the cardiovascular benefits of epoetin-alfa with anemia and/or end-stage renal disease have reported variable thrombotic events, including in patients refusing transfusions where the benefits of treating anemia may outweigh potential thrombotic risks. A proposed mechanism for increased thrombotic events is an increase in platelet activation and thrombocytosis. We report a patient treated with epoetin alfa-epbx before coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) who was at a low risk for perioperative thrombotic events but experienced both pulmonary and major arterial thrombotic complications postoperatively. Written informed consent was obtained.

### Preoperative anemia increases mortality and postoperative morbidity after cardiac surgery [^09609294]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia is the most common hematological problem in the preoperative patient and according to the definition used, its incidence ranges from 22% to 30% and over 40% in octogenarians. In our sample, one quarter of patients undergoing surgery were anemic. A number of studies have shown a significant association between anemia and adverse outcomes after surgery. Wu et al. analyzed the effect of preoperative hematocrit levels in over 310,000 elderly veterans undergoing non-cardiac surgery and found that even mild anemia was associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality and morbidity. In addition, they showed a linear rise in death and cardiac events when the hematocrit level was less than 39%. Similar results are reported in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In a large multicenter cohort study on 3,500 patients, Karkuti et al. found that preoperative anemia was independently associated with doubling in the composite risk of in-hospital death, stroke, or acute kidney injury; the same odds were even obtained after adjusting for confounders by propensity score matching. Using the same statistical technique, Ranucci et al. demonstrated that patients with any degree of anemia had a significantly higher rate of stroke, major morbidity and higher operative mortality rate. Zindrou et al. observed that individuals with a preoperative hemoglobin concentration of 10 g/dl or less had a 3-fold increase in the odds of in-hospital mortality after CABG than those with a higher hemoglobin concentration. Finally, in the setting of cardiac valve surgery, Clandellas et al. found that patients with preoperative hemoglobin < 12 mg/dl had a 3-fold increased risk of death and 5-fold in the odds of developing major postoperative complications such as, heart failure, myocardial infarction, reoperation for bleeding, neurological complication and acute renal failure. Nevertheless, other studies failed to show a negative impact of preoperative anemia on adverse postoperative outcomes. Bell et al. and Carrascal et al. demonstrated that low preoperative hemoglobin level was not an independent risk factor for early mortality after CABG and that it was only mildly significant for morbidity even in octogenarian patients. In addition, Kulier et al. demonstrated that the presence of low hemoglobin levels did not predict postoperative cardiac outcomes, such as myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure or death from cardiac causes, but only renal and cerebral adverse complications. The different results reached by these authors might be partially explained by the threshold chosen for the definition of preoperative anemia. These studies used cutoff points for preoperative hemoglobin that ranged from 10 to 12.5 g/dl and, most of them focused only on single isolated procedures. On the contrary, the strength of our investigation was to define anemia according to the World Health Organization and evaluate prospectively collected data from a large number of consecutive patients undergoing different cardiac surgery operations.

### Recommendations from the international consensus conference on anemia management in surgical patients (ICCAMS) [^f2f8812f]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Perioperative anemia has been associated with increased risk of red blood cell transfusion and increased morbidity and mortality after surgery. The optimal approach to the diagnosis and management of perioperative anemia is not fully established.

Objective

To develop consensus recommendations for anemia management in surgical patients.

Methods

An international expert panel reviewed the current evidence and developed recommendations using modified RAND Delphi methodology.

Results

The panel recommends that all patients except those undergoing minor procedures be screened for anemia before surgery. Appropriate therapy for anemia should be guided by an accurate diagnosis of the etiology. The need to proceed with surgery in some patients with anemia is expected to persist. However, early identification and effective treatment of anemia has the potential to reduce the risks associated with surgery and improve clinical outcomes. As with preoperative anemia, postoperative anemia should be treated in the perioperative period.

Conclusions

Early identification and effective treatment of anemia has the potential to improve clinical outcomes in surgical patients.

### Preoperative anemia and transfusion in cardiac surgery: a single-centre retrospective study [^8a59548d]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anemia is common in patients undergoing surgery, especially in cardiac surgery. The prevalence of preoperative anemia among patients undergoing cardiac surgery is highly variable, depending on the definition of anemia used across studies as well as centre-specific patient populations. Using the World Health Organization (WHO) definition, the general consensus for preoperative anemia prevalence is around 20–30% and increases with age and the presence of comorbidities. The most common causes of preoperative anemia in cardiac surgery patients are hospital-acquired anemia, iron-deficiency anemia, and anemia of chronic disease. The risk of anemia is exacerbated in cardiac surgery patients due to acute hemodilution associated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), perioperative phlebotomy, and surgical blood loss. Preoperative anemia is associated with higher morbidity and mortality, longer intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stays, and increased health care costs.

Preoperative anemia also increases perioperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion rates in cardiac surgery patients. Allogeneic blood transfusions are a scarce and costly resource that carry with them significant risks including transfusion reactions, transfusion-related immunomodulation, infectious complications, and other systemic adverse effects. Similar to preoperative anemia, blood transfusion in cardiac surgery is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, lengths of hospital stay, and health care costs. The relative contribution of preoperative anemia and RBC transfusion to the adverse outcomes in cardiac surgery patients remains uncertain, however, it has been shown that the interaction of the two increases morbidity and mortality far greater than the additive effects of each exposure individually. Recognizing the implications of preoperative anemia and perioperative transfusion, interventions to improve the hemodynamic status of patients before surgery have been implemented in multiple centres. These blood conservation programs have been shown to decrease transfusion rates, improve outcomes and reduce associated costs. Preoperative correction of anemia is an essential part of the blood management concept, and is recommended by major professional societies of cardiothoracic surgeons and anaesthesiologists.

Our study aims to determine the prevalence of anemia, transfusion rates on surgery day, and predictive factors of transfusion in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery procedures at our institution. We also aim to evaluate our institution's current preoperative intervention program for anemic patients, and examine the referral window to assess the feasibility of such a program in the cardiac surgery setting.

### Prevalence of risk factors, and not gender per se, determines short-and long-term survival after coronary artery bypass surgery [^195005d5]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Much attention has been directed towards female gender as an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery; however, the effects of surgery are known to persist for 6 months or more. Studies that have compared postoperative survival in women and men beyond hospital discharge report disparate results with regard to the independent effect of gender per se on ultimate survival.

Design

This investigation was a prospective, observational study.

Setting

The study was a multicenter investigation involving 24 US medical centers.

Participants

There were 2,048 patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery enrolled between September 1991 and September 1993 and after discharge.

Interventions

There were no interventions with this prospective observational study.

Measurements and Main Results

Preoperative demographic variables, medical history, and angiographic data were collected for each patient at the time of enrollment. Patients' vital status through the National Death Index up to August 31, 1998, were added to assess postoperative long-term survival. For survivorship analysis, the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method was used with Cox regression model. Survivorship analyses were performed separately and in combination on mortality within 30 days and 6 months of coronary artery bypass graft surgery and during the entire postoperative follow-up period. Among women, preoperative disease status, as expected, was more severe than that in men. Women were older (p = 0.0001) and had more comorbidity, such as congestive heart failure (p = 0.0019), diabetes (p = 0.0001), anemia, and hypertension (p = 0.0001). After surgery, unadjusted survival of 6 months and 5 years in women was worse than that in men. However, there were no gender-related differences in short- or long-term survival after adjusting for covariates in the multivariate model. Preoperative conditions, such as congestive heart failure, anemia, diabetes, and advanced age, are indicative of greater risk in both women and men for lower survival after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

Conclusions

Disease prevalence in women, and not gender per se, affects mid- and long-term survival after cardiac surgery. Attention, therefore, should be focused on efforts to reduce or modify such disease prevalence earlier in women, which may in turn allow longer survival after surgical intervention. Differences in postoperative survival between women and men were related to the gender differences in the distribution of preoperative risk factors.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^6aeb1582]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Why was this consensus statement developed?

The concept 'patient blood management' (PBM) is defined as " the timely application of evidence‐based medical and surgical concepts designed to manage anaemia, optimise haemostasis and minimise blood loss in order to improve patient outcomes after surgery "' 1. Patient blood management has been shown to reduce transfusion, healthcare costs and morbidity and mortality 2. Treatment of pre‐operative anaemia and isolated iron deficiency are crucial measures for PBM 3, 4. However, detection and early treatment of pre‐operative anaemia and iron deficiency is an accepted logistical challenge and, as a consequence, some patients may undergo surgery without the chance to address their anaemia 3. In addition, there has been increased emphasis on accelerated discharge after surgery and the use of restrictive transfusion thresholds in order to improve outcomes and reduce transfusion requirements, which may have led to overlooking potential opportunities to optimise anaemic patients and improve their functional recovery 5, 6. Therefore, an additional focus on the early detection and treatment of postoperative iron deficiency and anaemia is a novel and complementary measure within the concept of PBM; this allows the attending physician to target patients who lost significant red cell mass during surgery and may require specific attention postoperatively or following discharge 7.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^31773c90]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

How does this consensus statement differ from other available statements and/or guidelines?

There are a number of statements and guidelines from professional associations recommending a systematic approach to this problem for the management of pre‐operative anaemia 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Most of these guidelines also recommend the use of a restrictive transfusion threshold for treating acute postoperative anaemia, but recommendations for pharmacological management of anaemia are scarce, or even absent 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. We aimed to update and utilise these few current recommendations to provide a working practice document, based on scientific evidence and the clinical experience of an expert panel, on 'how to' feasibly introduce these postoperative anaemia guidelines into clinical practice. Our goal was to provide pragmatic, clear and easy‐to‐follow clinical guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of postoperative anaemia and iron deficiency in order to improve patient recovery, reduce the need for blood transfusion and improve functional outcomes in a cost effective manner. Our recommendations are intended for non‐actively bleeding adult patients in whom all the principles of PBM have been implemented pre‐ and intra‐operatively for the prevention of postoperative iron deficiency and anaemia.

### Anemia and acute coronary syndrome: time for intervention studies [^d49ef0a0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

How then should a clinician approach an ACS patient with concomitant anemia? As recommended by current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, measures should be taken to minimize risks for bleeding. This may be accomplished by integrating formal bleeding risk algorithms within usual care pathways to identify patients who will derive the greatest benefit from bleeding avoidance strategies, such as transradial access and use of vascular closure devices. Dosing of antithrombotic therapy by weight and renal function should be emphasized to further minimize bleeding risks. With respect to treatment, a restrictive transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL appears reasonable given the potential for harm with administration of blood products coupled with the lack of any clear benefit in randomized studies using a more liberal threshold.

Our understanding of red blood cells, both in normal human physiology and in disease states, has advanced substantially since the seminal observations of van Leeuwenhoek. While we currently appreciate the prognostic importance of anemia on both short‐ and long‐term outcomes following ACS, clear mechanistic insights and therapeutic interventions to guide and mitigate such risk remain lacking. The need for studies to inform clinical decisions within this space is highlighted by studies such as the one by Mamas et al, reinforcing the high prevalence of and substantial risk associated with anemia in the setting of ACS.

### Preoperative anemia increases mortality and postoperative morbidity after cardiac surgery [^e698c48a]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Results

In the study population of 7,738 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, a total of 1,856 (24%) patients had preoperative anemia (Figure 2), of which 517 (27.9%) were female. The mean (± standard deviation, SD) hemoglobin concentration was 11.5 (SD, 1.1) g/dl versus 14.3 (SD, 1.1) g/dl, in the anemic and control patients group, respectively. Baseline characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1. Patients in the anemia group were older and more often female; they were more likely to have a greater prevalence of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, extracardiac arteriophaty, and previous cardiac operations. Patients with anemia were also more likely to have a lower ejection fraction and greater prevalence of New York Heart Association functional class. Finally, the prevalence of patients undergoing other than isolated CABG and aortic surgery were higher in the anemic patients than in the control group. The overall rate of mortality was 2.1%. Results from univariate and multivariable logistic analysis are reported in Tables 2 and 3. Preoperative anemia was associated with a three-fold increased in the risk of death (4.6% vs 1.5%, p < 0.0001) and postoperative renal dysfunction (18.5% vs 6.5%, p < 0.0001). There was also a significant difference between the anemic and non-anemic group in the risk of postoperative stroke (1.9% vs 1.1%, p = 0.008), atrial fibrillation (36.7% vs 33%, p = 0.003) and length of hospital stay > 7 days (54% vs 36.7%, p < 0.0001. There was no significant difference in postoperative myocardial infarction (1.9% vs 2%, p = 0.93) between the two groups. After adjusting for confounding variables listed in Table 1, as well as propensity score, preoperative anemia was an independent predictor of mortality, postoperative renal dysfunction and length of hospital stay > 7 days. Finally, when modeled as univariate continuous variable, a curvilinear relationship was seen between the estimated probability of death and preoperative hemoglobin either in the female or in the male population (Figure 3).

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^55c182fc]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Should we treat iron deficiency without anaemia?

A normal haemoglobin level does not exclude iron deficiency. In fact, the WHO recognises that 'mild' anaemia (haemoglobin 110–119/129 g.l −1) is a misnomer, as iron deficiency is already advanced by the time anaemia is detected, and has consequences even when anaemia is not clinically apparent 18.

Non‐anaemic patients with reduced or absent iron stores may have symptoms such as fatigue or reduced exercise tolerance, as iron is required for optimal mitochondrial function, and is essential for respiration and energy production 40, 74. Current guidelines do not recommend routine iron screening in the absence of anaemia. However, the benefits of oral or i.v. iron replacement for non‐anaemic iron deficiency‐associated fatigue have been demonstrated in menstruating women, runners and blood donors 75, 76, 77, 78.

In congestive heart failure, a frequent comorbidity among surgical patients, non‐anaemic iron deficiency was independently associated with compromised physical performance and quality of life, and an increase in all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality; treatment of non‐anaemic iron deficiency with i.v. iron may improve functional status within four weeks, and reduces hospitalisations for cardiovascular reasons and mortality 79, 80. In addition, improvements are maintained after 24 and 52 weeks 79, 80, 81.

In observational studies of patients undergoing abdominal or cardiac surgery, pre‐operative non‐anaemic iron deficiency was associated with poor outcomes, including: increased rates of postoperative infection; transfusion; fatigue; and prolonged hospital stay 82, 83, 84. Although it is presently unknown whether pre‐operative correction of non‐anaemic iron deficiency may offset the excess of risk of postoperative complications, some guidelines recommend peri‐operative iron supplementation for patients with non‐anaemic iron deficiency 14, 85.

Secondary thrombocytosis can also be seen after major surgery, as platelets behave as an acute phase reactant. Iron deficiency has also been shown to induce secondary thrombocytosis in several clinical settings. Correction of iron deficiency usually lowers platelet count and platelet activation in patients with chronic kidney disease, cancer or inflammatory bowel disease‐associated secondary thrombocytosis, and may contribute to reduced risk of thrombo embolic events 86, 87, 88, 89.

### Perioperative blood transfusion and blood conservation in cardiac surgery: the Society of Thoracic Surgeons and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists clinical practice guideline [^41ad2559]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

A minority of patients having cardiac procedures (15% to 20%) consume more than 80% of the blood products transfused at operation. Blood must be viewed as a scarce resource that carries risks and benefits. A careful review of available evidence can provide guidelines to allocate this valuable resource and improve patient outcomes.

Methods

We reviewed all available published evidence related to blood conservation during cardiac operations, including randomized controlled trials, published observational information, and case reports. Conventional methods identified the level of evidence available for each of the blood conservation interventions. After considering the level of evidence, recommendations were made regarding each intervention using the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology classification scheme.

Results

Review of published reports identified a high-risk profile associated with increased postoperative blood transfusion. Six variables stand out as important indicators of risk: (1) advanced age, (2) low preoperative red blood cell volume (preoperative anemia or small body size), (3) preoperative antiplatelet or antithrombotic drugs, (4) reoperative or complex procedures, (5) emergency operations, and (6) noncardiac patient comorbidities. Careful review revealed preoperative and perioperative interventions that are likely to reduce bleeding and postoperative blood transfusion. Preoperative interventions that are likely to reduce blood transfusion include identification of high-risk patients who should receive all available preoperative and perioperative blood conservation interventions and limitation of antithrombotic drugs. Perioperative blood conservation interventions include use of antifibrinolytic drugs, selective use of off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery, routine use of a cell-saving device, and implementation of appropriate transfusion indications. An important intervention is application of a multimodality blood conservation program that is institution based, accepted by all health care providers, and that involves well thought out transfusion algorithms to guide transfusion decisions.

Conclusions

Based on available evidence, institution-specific protocols should screen for high-risk patients, as blood conservation interventions are likely to be most productive for this high-risk subset. Available evidence-based blood conservation techniques include (1) drugs that increase preoperative blood volume (eg, erythropoietin) or decrease postoperative bleeding (eg, antifibrinolytics), (2) devices that conserve blood (eg, intraoperative blood salvage and blood sparing interventions), (3) interventions that protect the patient's own blood from the stress of operation (eg, autologous predonation and normovolemic hemodilution), (4) consensus, institution-specific blood transfusion algorithms supplemented with point-of-care testing, and most importantly, (5) a multimodality approach to blood conservation combining all of the above.

### Postdischarge major bleeding, myocardial infarction, and mortality risk after coronary artery bypass grafting [^0e6e5fb9]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

The findings of the present study indicate that major bleeding should be included with ischaemic events in composite endpoints when investigating antithrombotic strategies after CABG. The findings also suggest that strategies to reduce postdischarge bleeding, for example, by initiating proton pump inhibitors among selected patients, screening for Helicobacter pylori infection or systematically using bleeding risk prediction tools when deciding on antiplatelet intensity and duration, could potentially further improve long-term survival after CABG.

Study limitations

We did not have sufficient data to analyse the specific cause of death and could therefore not determine whether patients dying outside of hospitals did so because of bleeding, MI or other causes. We could not use bleeding definitions commonly used in clinical trials, since we did not have data on transfusions and haemoglobin levels. Even though not directly comparable to other definitions, we argue that our definition of major bleeding (hospitalisation with a primary diagnosis of bleeding) is relevant from a clinical and epidemiological perspective. Patient characteristics and comorbidities adjusted for in the statistical models were not updated during follow-up and do not take into account changes in patient status over time. This is a relevant limitation considering that the median time to major bleeding and MI was 3.5 and 3.3 years, respectively. The increase in mortality risk after an event may reflect both a direct association from the event as well as associations mediated via other comorbidities debuting after the event, since comorbidities were not updated and therefore not adjusted for. Despite extensive adjustment for baseline variables and time-updated use of secondary prevention medications throughout follow-up, there is always the risk of unmeasured confounders not included in the statistical analysis.

Considering these limitations, the study also had strengths. The large study population with nationwide real-world data from validated registries indicates high external validity.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^ca899c0a]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Despite numerous guidelines on the management of anaemia in surgical patients, there is no pragmatic guidance for the diagnosis and management of anaemia and iron deficiency in the postoperative period. A number of experienced researchers and clinicians took part in a two-day expert workshop and developed the following consensus statement. After presentation of our own research data and local policies and procedures, appropriate relevant literature was reviewed and discussed. We developed a series of best-practice and evidence-based statements to advise on patient care with respect to anaemia and iron deficiency in the postoperative period. These statements include: a diagnostic approach to iron deficiency and anaemia in surgical patients; identification of patients appropriate for treatment; and advice on practical management and follow-up that is easy to implement. Available data allow the fulfilment of the requirements of Pillar 1 of Patient Blood Management. We urge national and international research funding bodies to take note of these recommendations, particularly in terms of funding large-scale prospective, randomised clinical trials that can most effectively address the important clinical questions and this clearly unmet medical need.

### The association between preoperative anemia, blood transfusion need, and postoperative complications in adult cardiac surgery, a single center contemporary experience [^fc3126ec]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This is a retrospective cohort study that included 386 adult patients (over the age of 14) who underwent cardiac surgery at the King Faisal Cardiac Center (KFCC) in Jeddah between June 2016 and January 2020. All types of cardiac surgery were included, such as CABG, valve repair, and valve replacement. The study excluded all patients with genetic or hereditary preoperative anemias.

The data were collected from the medical records department using the BESTCARE system and the laboratory and pathology information system after Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. Throughout the research process, all ethical considerations were followed. We defined anemia according to the WHO definition of a hemoglobin level of less than 13 g/dl for men and less than 12 g/dl for nonpregnant women. In addition, complications were collected during surgery and through the next 30 days after surgery during the follow-up period.

Primary and secondary end points

The primary objectives of this study were 1) to identify the effect of preoperative anemia as a predictor of postoperative outcomes and 2) to assess the relationship between anemia and the necessity of blood resource utilization after cardiac surgery. The secondary objectives were 1) to evaluate transfusion-related complications after cardiac surgery; 2) to identify the effect of the blood and blood product unit age on postoperative outcomes; and 3) to identify the prevalence of preoperative anemia in patients who underwent cardiac surgery.

### Prognostic interplay of chronic kidney disease, anemia, and diabetes in coronary bypass surgery [^3813dd5e]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease and anemia often coexist and may accompany diabetes; all 3 conditions are associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes. This study investigated the prognostic implications of anemia and chronic kidney disease for mortality among patients undergoing coronary artery-bypass grafting surgery and examined whether outcomes are related to the presence of diabetes.

Methods

This retrospective study included 1180 patients undergoing coronary artery-bypass grafting. Long-term mortality (mean follow-up, 8.6 ± 4.2 years) was examined in relation to preoperative anemia, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes. Prognostic interplay of the 3 risk factors was evaluated.

Results

Chronic kidney disease, anemia, and diabetes (20%, 25%, and 43% of patients, respectively), were independent risk predictors for mortality. Compared with patients with neither chronic kidney disease nor anemia, the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality were 1.87 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35 to 2.59) in chronic kidney disease only, 1.75 (95% CI, 1.30 to 2.35) in anemia only, and 2.69 (95% CI, 1.91 to 3.78) in patients with both conditions. The pattern of association of chronic kidney disease and anemia with mortality was similar in patients with and without diabetes. However, mortality risk was higher in patients with diabetes in each risk category-neither chronic kidney disease nor anemia: HR, 1.69 (95% CI, 1.20 to 2.39) vs HR, 1 (reference); chronic kidney disease only: HR, 2.68 (95% CI, 1.59 to 4.52) vs HR, 2.10 (95% CI, 1.38 to 3.20); anemia only: HR, 2.73 (95% CI, 1.83 to 4.07) vs HR, 1.94 (95% CI, 1.23 to 3.08); and both chronic kidney disease and anemia: HR, 4.44 (95% CI, 2.88 to 6.85) vs HR, 2.72 (95% CI, 1.58 to 4.69).

Conclusions

In patients undergoing coronary artery-bypass grafting, anemia and chronic kidney disease have significant prognostic implications for long-term mortality. Their effect on mortality was cumulatively associated with adverse impacts of diabetes.

### STS / SCA / AmSECT / SABM update to the clinical practice guidelines on patient blood management [^439a1b90]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Patient blood management — preoperative interventions include that preoperative identification of high-risk patients should be performed, and all available preoperative and perioperative measures of blood conservation should be undertaken in this group as they account for the majority of blood products transfused (Class I, Level A). Assessment of anemia and determination of its etiology is appropriate in all patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and it is reasonable to treat with intravenous iron preparations if time permits. In patients undergoing cardiac operations, it is reasonable to implement standardized transfusion protocols in order to reduce transfusion burden. In patients who have (i) preoperative anemia, (ii) refuse blood transfusion, (iii) or are deemed high-risk for postoperative anemia, it is reasonable to administer preoperative erythropoietin-stimulating agents and iron supplementation several days before cardiac operations to increase red cell mass. Minimization of phlebotomy by reduced volume and frequency of blood sampling is a reasonable means of blood conservation. Preoperative treatment of asymptomatic anemia and thrombocytopenia with transfusion is of uncertain benefit (Class III: No Benefit, Level B-NR).

### Preoperative anemia and transfusion in cardiac surgery: a single-centre retrospective study [^641c53ad]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Patient clinical characteristics, surgical characteristics and outcomes were gathered via review of physical charts scanned and uploaded onto electronic databases maintained by Alberta Health Services. Patient demographics, comorbidities, lab values and imaging parameters were based on the latest available information before PAC visits. The patient and surgical characteristics chosen in this study were based on commonly seen comorbidities in cardiac surgery patients as well as established anemia- and transfusion- associated risk factors. Complex surgical procedures were defined as any combined surgery such as concomitant coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and valve, double valve, or aortic surgeries.

Following the WHO definition, anemia was defined as having a hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of less than 120 g/L in non-pregnant adult females and less than 130 g/L in adult males (Table 1). Further sub-classifications using the WHO criteria were done for mild anemia (Hb concentration between 110 and 120 g/L in females and 110 and 130 g/L in males), moderate anemia (Hb concentration between 80 and 110 g/L in both sexes), and severe anemia (Hb concentration less than 80 g/L in both sexes). Hb values are used as transfusion triggers at our centre; there is no universal Hb threshold for transfusion. Patient conditions and comorbidities are taken into consideration, which accounts for a higher Hb threshold in sicker patients. The general consensus is that otherwise healthy patients with Hb > 100 g/L rarely require perioperative RBC transfusion, and those with Hb < 80 g/L frequently require RBC transfusion. For this study, transfusion on surgery day was defined as any packed RBC (pRBC) transfused in the operating rooms or within 24 h of arrival at the cardiovascular ICU (CVICU).

Table 1
Prevalence of anemia among our elective cardiac surgery patients

Information on patient referral and preoperative treatment for anemia at the local blood conservation clinic was obtained by cross-referencing our patient list with the blood conservation clinic's patient database. Referral criteria for surgical patients are: having a Hb concentration of 70–130 g/L and a ferritin concentration of less than 100 ng/mL. Upon referral, patients are triaged based on their blood work results and the available amount of time prior to their scheduled surgeries. Patients are contacted within a week and treatments are initiated within 1–2 weeks of their referrals. For treatment, patients are given intravenous iron sucrose, 200 mg infused over a minimum of 15 min × 2 doses, 1 week apart. Unstable cardiac patients are contraindicated for treatment.

### Restrictive and liberal red cell transfusion strategies in adult patients: reconciling clinical data with best practice [^cc6153d2]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Future direction

At an academic level, a multidisciplinary think-tank from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened and agreed to the need for three adult trials evaluating RBC transfusion trigger strategies to improve overall outcome and to validate the following hypotheses: first, higher Hb levels resulting from a liberal transfusion strategy during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery will lead to lower incidence of 30-day all-cause mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, infection, and other complications as compared with a restrictive transfusion threshold; second, in patients with acute coronary syndrome or coronary artery disease undergoing cardiac catheterization, a liberal transfusion strategy will be associated with a lower incidence of composite outcome of all-cause mortality at 30 days, recurrent myocardial infarction, emergent percutaneous intervention (angioplasty or stent insertion), or coronary artery bypass graft surgery within 30 days of enrollment when compared with a restrictive transfusion strategy; and third, in hemodynamically stable patients in the ICU with a history of ischemic heart disease, multiple organ dysfunction scores will be improved by maintaining Hb > 10 g/dl. That the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute would propose such studies suggests that the ideal Hb transfusion trigger has yet to be determined for some common clinical conditions, and Hb levels > 8 g/dl in some stable patients may be warranted.

At the level of the practicing physician, what are clinicians to do? Fundamentally, physicians should intelligently apply their skill set to their patients' needs, incorporating all physiological data at their disposal, and incorporate – as applicable – the scientific support from Practice Guidelines. Recent survey data demonstrating the lack of a substantial reduction in ICU RBC transfusion in one state has been interpreted to suggest that restrictive RBC transfusion thresholds may not have 'fully translated into practice in different hospital settings'. Perhaps in assessing this lack of conformity the authors of such uncontrolled, hospital-derived datasets should in part acknowledge that experienced clinical decision-making may have presided over the selection for or against transfusion. After all, the primary methodology for evaluating the restrictive transfusion hypothesis in the TRICC and FOCUS trials has been itself criticized for lack of inclusion of a usual practice arm in the dichotomized trial protocols, thus encouraging practice misalignments and hence more limited data interpretability. As an optimal use of a practice guideline, trial data supportive of a restrictive transfusion strategy provide clinicians with a helpful metaphorical arm rest, to pause and carefully consider whether a transfusion is likely to be helpful, which in many cases it will not.

4.1 Limitations

The cause of anemia could not be determined from the database which is a limitation because the etiology of the anemia will impact on the management and outcomes of ACS patients. As in all retrospective observational analyses our findings reflect associations rather than causality. Furthermore, we did not interview clinicians, so it is unclear what underpinned decisions to provide or withhold therapies to a particular patient. This study did not address the issue of blood transfusion in the anemic ACS as the number of transfusions performed in our study cohort was very small.

### Transfusion triggers for guiding RBC transfusion for cardiovascular surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis* [^3e26ffe1]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Restrictive red cell transfusion is recommended to minimize risk associated with exposure to allogeneic blood. However, perioperative anemia is an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes after cardiovascular surgery. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine whether perioperative restrictive transfusion thresholds are associated with inferior clinical outcomes in randomized trials of cardiovascular surgery patients.

Study Selection

We included controlled trials in which adult patients undergoing cardiac or vascular surgery were randomized to different transfusion thresholds, described as a hemoglobin or hematocrit level below which RBCs were transfused.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently extracted data from included trials. We pooled risk ratios of dichotomous outcomes and mean differences of continuous outcomes across trials using random-effects models.

Data Synthesis

Seven studies (enrolling 1,262 participants) met inclusion criteria with restrictive and liberal transfusion thresholds most commonly differing by a hemoglobin of 1 g/dL or hematocrit of 6–7%, resulting in decreased transfusions by 0.71 units of RBCs (95% CI, 0.31–1.09, p = 0.0002) without an associated change in adverse events: mortality (risk ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.65–1.95; p = 0.60), myocardial infarction (risk ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.30–2.99; p = 0.92), stroke (risk ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.57–2.32; p = 0.70), acute renal failure (risk ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.64–1.49; p = 0.91), infections (risk ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.85–1.78; p = 0.27), or length of stay. There was no between-trial heterogeneity for any pooled analysis. Including four pediatric trials (456 participants) and 10 trials utilizing only intraoperative acute normovolemic hemodilution (872 participants) did not substantially change the results except that unlike the transfusion threshold trials, the hemodilution trials did not reduce the proportion of patients transfused (interaction p = 0.01).

Conclusions

Further randomized controlled trials are necessary to determine the optimal transfusion strategy for patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery.

### Red blood cell transfusion in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) [^6a31a8e1]. ClinicalTrials (2011). Low credibility.

Study Overview Patients with a low blood count with stable or unstable coronary artery disease consistently show worse clinical outcomes. It is unclear whether this association is confounded since anemic patients tend to be also sicker i.e. have lower ejection fractions or more comorbidities and this would be the reason for the worse outcomes rather than anemia. Adverse clinical outcomes are reduced when critically ill patients are only transfused if their hematocrit drops below 21%: Hematocrit is a measure of the severity of anemia. A HCT is considered normal if it ranges between 38 and 48% of total blood volume. In critically ill patients anemia is very common; about 95% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit have hemoglobin levels below normal by intensive care unit day 3. {.

Storage of RBC before transfusion lowers the function of the RBCs: In a retrospective study in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting a recent study found that RBC transfusions were associated with an increased risk of mortality and short term and long term postoperative complications when patients were transfused with stored RBCs. This phenomenon is called the storage lesion. There is a rapid depletion of 2, 3 diglycerophosphate with storage. {Bunn, 1968 #8849} This has a profound impact on hemoglobin affinity reducing oxygen release from hemoglobin by as much as 25% at similar change in oxygen saturation. Infusion of stored RBCs causes hemolysis which in turn reduces nitric oxide bioavailability: Significant hemolysis occurs both during storage and in particular during transfusion.

{Sowemimo-Coker, 2002 #8851} Free hemoglobin outside of RBCs scavenges nitric oxide. Reiter, 2002 #6096} RBCs also contain arginase which released into the circulation will further enhance nitric oxide depletion by reducing its precursor arginine. {Kato, 2005 #7955}. The investigators will systematically examine the effects of RBC transfusion on systemic oxygen delivery, whole body oxygen consumption, nitric oxide bioavailability, endothelial function, cardiac performance, microcirculatory function, and platelet aggregation in patients with active coronary artery disease, presenting to the BIDMC with anemia, defined as hematocrit of < 30%.

Preoperative treatment of anemia — pharmacologic agents recommends for selected patients that In patients who have (i) preoperative anemia, (ii) refuse blood transfusion, (iii) or are deemed high-risk for postoperative anemia, it is reasonable to administer preoperative erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESA) and iron supplementation several days prior to cardiac operations to increase red cell mass (Class IIa, Level B-R). The document also notes practical barriers, including the oftentimes lack of a safe waiting period for treatment.

### Preoperative anemia and transfusion in cardiac surgery: a single-centre retrospective study [^05a94c88]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We found that the prevalence of preoperative anemia in elective cardiac surgery patients at our centre is 15%, and that the majority of anemic patients were classified as having mild or moderate anemia according to the WHO definition. Using an Hb concentration less than 125 g/L as the definition of anemia, a multicentre study found the overall prevalence of preoperative anemia in their cardiac surgery patients to be 26%, with values ranging from 22% to 30% at participating hospitals. Another multicentre study identified the prevalence of anemia among cardiac surgery patients to be 31%, with centre-specific prevalence varying from 23% to 45%. Other studies revealed differing prevalences of anemia in preoperative cardiac surgery patients, ranging from 15% to over 54% depending on the definition of anemia used in each study as well as specific patient population characteristics. Since we excluded all emergency and transplant cases from our study, this could explain the lower prevalence of anemia in preoperative cardiac surgery patients at our centre compared to other studies. However, the variation in anemia prevalence across different studies is apparent from the literature, and the exact cause for this is unknown. Further studies are required to elucidate the causes of this variation, as they will be important to guide management as well as preoperative blood conservation strategies.

### STS / SCA / AmSECT / SABM update to the clinical practice guidelines on patient blood management [^857c171a]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Massive transfusion in cardiac surgery — risk factors and product ratios — includes common risks across valve surgery, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and their combination such as female sex, older age, renal dysfunction, lower body mass index, lower preoperative hemoglobin, and longer cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) times, with valve-specific risks including active endocarditis, nonatrial fibrillation, smaller left atrium diameter, abnormal international normalized ratio, and repeat operations. Regarding product ratios, trauma literature shows a well-recognized benefit from a 1:1 ratio of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to red blood cells (RBCs), while evidence in cardiac operations is less established; current data provide modest support for adherence to a 1:1 ratio of FFP/RBC after operations, but this recommendation must be tempered with caution.

### Moderate exposure to allogeneic blood products is not associated with reduced long-term survival after surgery for coronary artery disease [^f9613c02]. Anesthesiology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

It has been suggested that blood transfusion has an adverse effect on long-term health, mainly through immune modulation and tumor promotion. To further assess this concern, the authors have performed a prospective observational study with the hypothesis that after taking perioperative risk factors relevant to long-term survival into account, patients undergoing coronary artery surgery who receive a perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion have worse long-term survival than those who do not.

Methods

The health outcomes of 1,841 consecutive subjects who had isolated nonemergency first-time coronary artery surgery and who survived more than 60 days after surgery were determined by record linkage. The association between length of survival, blood products transfused, and risk factors for long-term survival at entry to the study were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression.

Results

A total of 1,062 subjects were transfused. Of these, 266 subjects died during a mean follow-up of 8.1 yr. Of subjects who were transfused, 27% had a new malignant condition recorded on the death certificate, compared with 43% who were not transfused. Older age, cerebrovascular disease, use of a mammary graft, chronic pulmonary disease, renal dysfunction, reduced left ventricular function, and preoperative anemia were predictive of reduced long-term survival. There was no association between transfusion of blood products and long-term survival.

Conclusions

Patients who have undergone coronary artery surgery and who have received moderate amounts of blood as part of responsible and conservative management should be reassured that they are unlikely to experience a reduction in long-term survival.

### Recommendations from the international consensus conference on anemia management in surgical patients (ICCAMS) [^657b5b6c]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Supporting Evidence: Screening

The most commonly used criteria for defining anemia are the WHO definitions (Hb < 12.0 g/dL for women or < 13.0 g/dL for men). However, it has been suggested that these should be updated. A range of Hb cutoff levels for anemia has been used in studies. In an observational study of > 4000 adults undergoing elective cardiac surgery, a preoperative Hb concentration < 13.0 g/dL was reported as the optimal threshold in women. Similarly, in a review by Muñoz et al, a Hb level < 13.0 g/dL for both men and women was advocated for preoperative anemia, whereas the WHO criteria were considered acceptable for postoperative anemia. This approach was echoed in international consensus guidelines on the management of surgery-related anemia. Adoption of the 13.0 g/dL threshold in both sexes has also been suggested in recent reviews of perioperative anemia and PBM. Therefore, the panel supports defining anemia by a Hb level < 13.0 g/dL in both men and women. To allow time for a response to therapy, at least 4 weeks before surgery has been suggested as the optimal time frame for evaluation. However, treatment as little as 1 day before surgery [intravenous (IV) iron, subcutaneous erythropoietin alpha, vitamin B 12, and oral folic acid) has been shown to be effective in reducing transfusion of allogeneic blood products in cardiac surgery patients with preoperative anemia.

Opinions of the Panel: Screening

The panel agreed that the optimal time before surgery to screen for anemia is at least 4 weeks. However, shorter time frames such as in the case of urgent or emergent surgery should not preclude evaluation. The results of tests performed shortly before surgery may enable treatments with a rapid onset of action (eg, IV iron) to be administered preoperatively, and they may also help define the need for anemia treatment postoperatively.

Minor procedures such as cataract surgery or other surgeries where testing requirements are waived because of no blood loss can be undertaken in patients with anemia, therefore there is no requirement for this population to be screened. However, because of the high frequency of anemia in the general population, patients undergoing all other types of surgery should be screened preoperatively. Screening may be beneficial by providing an opportunity to treat previously undiagnosed anemia, regardless of the setting. The importance of screening is heightened in those undergoing major surgery with at least moderate risk of clinically significant blood loss, those with risk factors for anemia or poor tolerance of anemia, and those unable to receive blood products.

### The prevalence and association with transfusion, intensive care unit stay and mortality of pre-operative anaemia in a cohort of cardiac surgery patients [^04f3fc45]. Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Anaemia is increasingly prevalent in the United Kingdom. Despite recommendations to the contrary, many patients undergo cardiac surgery with undiagnosed and untreated anaemia. According to the World Health Organization definition, 1463/2688 (54.4%) patients undergoing cardiac surgery between 2008 and 2009 in our institution were anaemic. Compared with non-anaemic patients, anaemia was significantly associated with transfusion (791 (54.1%) vs 275 (22.4%), p < 0.001, OR (95% CI) 3.4 (2.8–4.1)), death (45 (3.1%) vs 13 (1.1%), p = 0.0005, OR 2.4 (1.2–4.5)), and prolonged ICU stay (287 (19.6%) vs 168 (13.7%) p < 0.001, OR 1.3 (1.0–1.6)). The prevalence of anaemia in this cohort is much greater than that previously reported. The cause of this excess is not clear. Pre-operative anaemia is a strong predictor of increased transfusion requirement, risk of ICU stay and death during cardiac surgery. The effect of increasing haemoglobin concentration therapeutically is not yet clear.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^d0139ecf]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

How should patients be treated postoperatively?

Pharmacological optimisation of postoperative haemoglobin and erythropoiesis should allow correction of iron deficiency and rapid recovery from postoperative anaemia, which may lead to improved postoperative outcomes and improved quality of life. It may also result in a reduction of patient exposure to red cell transfusion and its related risk and complications, thus contributing further to improving surgical outcome and patient safety.

Iron therapy: oral vs. i.v. iron?

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK (NICE) recommends offering oral iron after surgery to patients with iron deficiency anaemia 12. However, in the postoperative period, oral iron is often not tolerated or absorbed and has several limitations including frequent gastro‐intestinal side‐effects and, as a consequence, poor treatment adherence. Additionally, the inflammatory response induced by surgery stimulates hepcidin synthesis and release, which in turn inhibits intestinal iron absorption, making oral iron therapy largely ineffective 10, 13, 50. Various randomised placebo‐controlled trials (RCT) in orthopaedic and cardiac surgery patients have demonstrated that oral iron therapy was not better than placebo in correcting postoperative anaemia and reducing transfusion requirements 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57.

On the other hand, NICE recommends considering i.v. iron after surgery for patients who have iron deficiency anaemia and cannot tolerate or absorb oral iron, or are unable to adhere to oral iron treatment, as well as for those who are diagnosed with functional iron deficiency 12. Thus, patients presenting with postoperative iron deficiency and/or moderate‐to‐severe postoperative anaemia (haemoglobin < 100 g.l −1) may benefit from i.v. iron supplementation, which has proven to be more effective than oral iron in a number of surgical settings (Supporting Information online, Appendix S1) 39, 42, 43, 44, 45, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63. Most recent RCTs have shown improved outcomes following high‐dose postoperative i.v. iron (e.g. 1000 mg) as demonstrated by increased haemoglobin and/or reduction in transfusion requirements, and no i.v. iron‐related serious adverse events were reported (Supporting Information, Appendix S1) 39, 42, 44, 45. Importantly, in orthopaedic surgical patients with postoperative haemoglobin < 100 g.l −1 and/or uncorrected pre‐operative iron deficiency (ferritin < 100 μg.l −1), a greater rise in haemoglobin and better scores for 'usual activities' were observed with high‐dose i.v. iron compared with oral iron 42.

### The association between preoperative anemia, blood transfusion need, and postoperative complications in adult cardiac surgery, a single center contemporary experience [^6a4f0b21]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

General characteristics

Between January 2016 and January 2020, 386 adult patients underwent open heart surgery. The mean age at operation was 58 years (standard deviation (SD) ± 13), and 71% of the patients were males (see Table 1). The most performed procedure was CABG (67.2%), and the most common cardiac diagnosis was ischemic heart disease (68.4%). The prevalence of anemia in our cohort, in the diagnosis was based on the WHO definition of anemia (1), was 34.3%, with a 32.9% and 37.7% prevalence in males and females, respectively. All patients had Anti-platelets (Aspirin, Clopidogrel or Ticagrelor) stopped at least 3–5 days prior to elective or semi-urgent surgery. Only 6 patients underwent emergency surgery (1.6%), and all underwent CABG. Thirty-nine patients (~ 10% of the cohort) underwent redo sternotomy and cell saver was prepared in all redo sternotomy cases but no processed blood was not used in any of these cases. It is not part of our practice to use pre-operative autologous donation, acute nonmonomeric hemodilution or auto transfusion of chest drains blood due to institutional regulations and other technical limitations.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^45726544]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

When should postoperative anaemia be treated?

There are limited supporting data regarding appropriate timing for management of anaemia after surgery, including red cell transfusion. Treatment choice depends on severity and type of anaemia, type of surgery, patient comorbidities and the presence of any surgical complications.

Iron supplementation should be considered in patients with iron deficiency or significant reduction in postoperative haemoglobin, starting early in the postoperative recovery phase where there are no major complications 39, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46. It is important to note that there are no studies identifying the best time to start postoperative iron supplementation.

For non‐cancer patients with severe postoperative anaemia and inflammation‐induced blunted erythropoiesis or those declining blood transfusion, additional treatment with an erythropoiesis‐stimulating agent (e.g. recombinant human erythropoietin [rHuEPO]) may be considered. However, we are aware that for patients without a previous indication this is an off‐label use of rHuEPO, and recommendations vary across countries 10, 12, 15.

Red cell transfusion should be restricted to patients with severe anaemia (haemoglobin < 70–80 g.l −1) and clinical signs and symptoms 7, 10, 11, 12, 47, 48, 49. Red cell transfusion should be considered in patients with active bleeding and in those severely anaemic once bleeding has been stopped 7, 10, 11, 12, 47, 48, 49. However, more research is required on specific transfusion thresholds in specific high‐risk patients.

### Acute normovolemic hemodilution in adult cardiac surgery [^c8891d96]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) is a well-known blood conservation technique, yet its adoption in the US remains low (< 20%), and cardiac surgery remains the largest consumer of blood components. Increasing vulnerabilities in the US blood supply underscore the need to reassess ANH effectiveness in blood conservation.

Objective

To evaluate ANH use in perioperative transfusion and blood component use in patients undergoing surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective propensity-score matched cohort study using data from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (version 4.20.2). The study included adult patients (≥ 18 years) undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and/or valve surgery with CPB (July 2020 to September 2023).

Exposure

The primary exposure was ANH, defined as any recorded use/volume in the STS database.

Main Outcome and Measures

The primary outcome was intraoperative or postoperative transfusion of any blood component. The volume-dependent ANH effect estimate was also assessed using a cutoff value of 650 mL. Secondary outcomes included the total number of transfused red blood cells (RBC) and non-RBC components (platelets, plasma, and cryoprecipitate); bleeding reexplorations; length of stay in the intensive care unit; and estimates for blood acquisition and activity-based costs.

Results

Among 16 795 patients (mean [SD] age, 65.3 [10.5] years; 12 114 male [72.1%]), ANH was reported in 2463 cases (14.7%). Patients receiving ANH had a significantly lower preoperative anemia rate and higher baseline hematocrit (mean difference: 2.5%; 95% CI, 2.3–2.7; P < .001). After propensity score matching (n = 2282 pairs), transfusion rates were significantly lower in the ANH group (31.2% vs 36.4%; P < .001). ANH was associated with 27% lower odds of any transfusion (odds ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60–0.89). High-volume ANH (≥ 650 mL) further reduced the odds of transfusion by 47% to 64% for both RBC and non-RBC components. The cumulative number of transfused erythrocyte and platelet units was 167 and 295 units lower, respectively, in the ANH group compared with the control group, with lower estimates for both acquisition and activity-based costs.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, a volume-dependent association was found between ANH and reduced RBC and non-RBC transfusion rates in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Despite being safe and cost-effective, ANH remains underused as a blood conservation strategy.

### Predictors of packed red cell transfusion after isolated primary coronary artery bypass grafting – the experience of a single cardiac center: a prospective observational study [^a657e92d]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

The use of allogeneic blood transfusion after coronary artery surgery is still high despite published transfusion guidelines and costly blood conservation strategies. Readily available patient variables can predict patients at risk for transfusion. The classification of coronary artery bypass graft patients on the basis of attributes known preoperatively and by conduits used yields subsets of patients with distinctly different transfusion requirements and in-hospital outcomes.

Prediction models based on preoperative variables may facilitate blood component management and improve the efficiency of ordering blood before operations for patients undergoing CABG surgeries in order to assist blood banks in improving responsiveness to clinical needs.

Two patterns are usually prevailing for preoperative blood component stocking and preparation in cardiac surgical patients. One practice is the cross-matching of a large number (4 or more) of PRBC units that are usually – at least in part – not utilized, leading to wasting blood bank efforts and resources, including time, space, and reagents. The other is cross-matching a limited number of units (usually 2 units of PRBCs) and typing an extra 2 units to be cross-matched at need. This may lead to a blood bank emergency when a patient is in urgent need for blood component transfusion, putting a considerable stress and time load on the blood bank team. A model to predict patients at risk of requiring more than the standard number of blood components would alleviate plenty of blood bank stress, save time and resources, and allow better utilization of available space and blood resources.

Blood conservation has become one of the most important issues in cardiac surgery. Some of blood conservation strategies are cost-efficient and simple to utilize and can be employed in nearly all cardiac surgical patients without adding further risk to the patient or effort to the operating room team, including non-hemic prime of cardiopulmonary bypass machine, salvage of blood from surgical field using cardiotomy suction, hemodilution during CPB, retransfusion of all contents of oxygenator at the end of CPB, and use of ultrafiltration and modified ultrafiltration during and after CPB. Use of other modalities, such as antifibrinolytic therapy, preoperative autologous blood donation, use of cell saving devices, and auto transfusion of shed mediastinal chest tube drainage is still limited owing to doubts about their effectiveness and inappropriateness for use in many patients. In addition, the routine use of such expensive and sophisticated techniques in all cardiac surgical patients causes higher cost exceeding the benefit obtained. So, these strategies should be utilized more critically.

### Risk associated with preoperative anemia in cardiac surgery: a multicenter cohort study [^1a99c693]. Circulation (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Preoperative anemia is an important risk factor for perioperative red blood cell transfusions, which are associated with postoperative morbidity and mortality. Whether preoperative anemia also is an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes after cardiac surgery, however, has not been fully elucidated.

Methods and Results

In this multicenter cohort study, data were collected on 3500 consecutive patients who underwent cardiac surgery during 2004 at 7 academic hospitals. The prevalence of preoperative anemia, defined as hemoglobin < 12.5 g/dL, and its unadjusted and adjusted relationships with the composite outcome of in-hospital death, stroke, or acute kidney injury were obtained. The overall prevalence of preoperative anemia was 26%, with values ranging from 22% to 30% at the participating hospitals. After the exclusion of patients who had severe preoperative anemia (hemoglobin < 9.5 g/dL) or preoperative kidney failure and those who underwent emergency surgery, the composite outcome was observed in 7.5% of patients (247 of 3286). The unadjusted odds ratio for the composite outcome in anemic versus nonanemic patients was 3.6 (95% confidence interval, 2.7 to 4.7). The risk-adjusted odds ratios, obtained by multivariable logistic regression and propensity-score matching to control for important confounders (including comorbidities, institution, surgical factors, and blood transfusion), were 2.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 2.8) and 1.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 2.7), respectively.

Conclusions

Preoperative anemia is independently associated with adverse outcomes after cardiac surgery. Future studies should determine whether therapies aimed at treating preoperative anemia would improve the outcomes of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

### Perioperative care in cardiac surgery: a joint consensus statement by the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) cardiac society, ERAS international society, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) [^d6f80cd4]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Patient blood management program in cardiac surgery — components and transfusion thresholds: Summary Statement: Blood product use and associated outcomes are optimized through the implementation of a comprehensive patient blood management program. Quality of Evidence: Moderate. Components of a PBM program are highlighted in Table 4, organized based on 3 major pillars: (1) preoperative anemia and iron deficiency screening and optimization, (2) minimization of iatrogenic blood loss or hemodilution, and (3) permissive intraoperative and postoperative anemia. A patient blood management program, led by a multidisciplinary team of health care providers, should be part of a comprehensive strategy to avoid unnecessary transfusion, and anemia and iron deficiency assessment and treatment with B12, folate, and intravenous iron preparations, as indicated, is reasonable to reduce blood transfusion; preoperative administration of intravenous iron and/or erythropoietin-stimulating agents is reasonable to increase red cell mass for anemic patients. Intraoperatively, laboratory measurement of antiplatelet drug effect for patients on preoperative dual antiplatelet therapy is reasonable to guide timing of surgery, routine use of intraoperative red blood cell salvage using centrifugation is indicated for blood conservation, and use of a standardized hemostasis checklist during cardiac surgery, before closing, can reduce bleeding and blood transfusion. For transfusion practices, a standardized, restrictive perioperative red blood cell transfusion protocol is favored in preference to a liberal strategy to reduce transfusion, goal-directed transfusion algorithms that incorporate point-of-care testing, such as with viscoelastic devices, are shown to reduce bleeding and transfusion, and red blood cell transfusion is unlikely to benefit nonbleeding patients with a hemoglobin concentration > 7.5 g/dL.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^31fc121d]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Red blood cell transfusion: transfusion thresholds for whom and when?

Allogeneic red cell transfusion is associated with a significant increase in peri‐operative morbidity and mortality 2, 98, 99, 100. In addition, there is a worldwide shortage of blood, with substantial associated costs to the manufacturer and health systems 101. Moreover, red cell transfusion risks infectious, immunological, haemolytic, non‐haemolytic adverse reactions, cardiac and pulmonary complications 2, 98. Despite successful implementation of PBM programmes, red cell transfusion is still widely used as a default treatment for the majority of patients with acute postoperative anaemia 102.

Historically, the standard for red cell transfusion was a liberal transfusion threshold, namely haemoglobin level < 100 g.l −1 (or haematocrit < 30%). This arbitrary transfusion threshold has been gradually lowered towards haemoglobin 70–80 g.l −1, according to data derived from a number of RCTs evaluating the effect on patient outcomes of restrictive vs. more liberal red cell transfusion strategies in a variety of clinical settings. When subjected to pooled analysis in several systematic reviews and meta‐analyses (Supporting Information online, Appendix S2) 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, data from these RCTs show that, in terms of morbidity and mortality, a restrictive red cell transfusion strategy is equivalent to or more beneficial than a liberal strategy 101, 109.

In addition, evidence‐based guidelines have translated the results of RCTs and meta‐analyses into clinical practice 7, 10, 11, 12, 47, 48, 49. One of the most recently published guidelines on red cell transfusion thresholds recommends a restrictive red cell transfusion threshold (haemoglobin < 70 g.l −1) for hospitalised adult patients who are haemodynamically stable, including critically ill patients 49. However, a transfusion threshold of at least 80 g.l −1 is suggested for patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery, cardiac or oncological surgery, and those with pre‐existing cardiovascular disease 12, 49, 110, 111. Nevertheless, transfusion of red cells for higher haemoglobin levels should be evaluated case by case, considering acute ongoing blood loss, comorbidities and signs of organ ischaemia or symptoms indicative of hypoxia. In any case, published guidelines agree that red cell transfusion is not beneficial when haemoglobin is > 100 g.l −1 7, 10, 11, 12, 47, 48, 49, 112. Confounding factors on haemoglobin levels have to be considered, as discussed above.

### The impact of iron store on red blood cell transfusion: a multicentre prospective cohort study in cardiac surgery [^6c8f2b36]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this multicentre cohort study that investigates both elective and urgent surgeries, we observed that patients with ID had a higher rate of RBC transfusion during surgery, and a higher rate of any blood product transfusion during hospital stay, as compared with iron-replete patients. However, ID was not independently associated with RBC transfusion during the whole hospital stay.

These results need to be interpreted carefully. First, most of RBC transfusions were performed during surgery and were significantly higher in the ID group (22% vs 13%). Moreover, anaemia was a strong driver of RBC transfusion (adjusted OR = 4.16), with IDA being the main cause of anaemia in our population (n = 43, 55% of anaemic patients). This is of importance since ID is a modifiable factor, easily attainable as part of a patient blood management (PBM). Ultimately, we observed very low transfusion rates compared to previous literature. The study might be underpowered and suffers from an insufficient number of patients, as we expected higher RBC transfusion rates. We believe that a focused pre-operative screening of at risk of transfusion-ID patients might lead to targeted iron supplementation prior to cardiac surgery and reduction of anaemia, transfusion, and their associated morbidity.

Anaemia already showed its association with transfusion. There is sufficient evidence to recommend a shared haemoglobin cutoff (< 13 g dL −1) for both sexes to define anaemia prior to surgeries with a high risk of blood loss and to alleviate the potential disadvantage of women compared with men with regard to impact and optimisation of preoperative anaemia. Although ID has shown its association with poor outcomes in multiple diseases, we found that ID alone, without clinical anaemia, may not be strongly associated with in-hospital transfusion requirements in the cardiac surgery setting. Early stage ID, before the anaemic stage, could be insufficient to affect perioperative transfusion. On the other hand, the long-term impact of lower haemoglobin levels at discharge have not been investigated in cardiac surgery, and poor outcomes associated with early stage ID could be delayed.

We also confirmed that RBC transfusion during surgery depends on sex and body mass index, reflecting the impact of haemodilution during CPB. Other worse conditions represented by altered LVEF, severe SAPS 2 scores, reoperations and combined surgeries, were expected and confirmed risk factors for RBC transfusions. Surprisingly, continuation of antiplatelet therapy (mostly acetylsalicylic acid alone and rare cases of dual antiplatelet therapy) was not associated with RBC transfusion.

An important case report is presented of a Jehovah's Witness CABG patient with submassive thrombosis after treatment with high-dose EPO and parenteral iron.

See Article page.

Murillo-Berlioz and colleaguespresent a case report of thrombosis after coronary artery bypass graft surgery in a patient who was a practicing Jehovah's Witness (JW). Their patient, who was without known preoperative thrombosis risk, was treated preoperatively with parenteral iron, folate, vitamin B12, and 8 daily subcutaneous doses of epoetin (EPO) Alfa-epbx 300 units/kg. The patient suffered submassive venous plus arterial thromboses on postoperative day 10, having doubled her platelet count to 424,000 on admission for thrombectomy. Hypercoagulable workup was negative. EPO is known to increase platelet as well as red cell production.

EPO is a hypoxia-induced hormone produced in the kidney that stimulates hematopoiesis in the bone marrow. As a therapeutic agent, recombinant EPO is used in treating various types of anemia, including anemia of end-stage renal disease and cancer-related anemia on chemotherapy. EPO use in heart surgery was never approved by the Food and Drug Administration based on a negative randomized controlled trial of low-dose EPO in 1997. There has not been another cardiac surgical randomized controlled trial since that time. However, there have been numerous reports and case series using high-dose EPO in patients who are JW and others in whom red cell transfusion is not an option — as part of a multidisciplinary blood-conservation regimen focused on enhancing red cell mass and on reducing blood loss.

In a 144-patient retrospective case comparison study of cardiac surgical patients who were JW, Tanaka and colleaguesdid not report increased thrombosis with the use of EPO. They presented evidence that enhancing red cell mass with preoperative erythropoietin and iron therapy to a target hemoglobin level of 12 g/dL is associated with a reduction in major adverse events in patients refusing blood transfusion.

### STS / SCA / AmSECT / SABM update to the clinical practice guidelines on patient blood management [^85556b8c]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Patient blood management — cardiac surgery preoperative anemia therapy emphasizes that treatment of an anemic patient before surgery is appropriate and "should be considered as part of any patient's careful workup and preparation for cardiac surgery, if time permits". Evidence supports erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) with intravenous iron: a randomized controlled trial (RCT) showed "significant improvements in units of transfusion (1.0 ± 1.1 units vs 3.3 ± 2.2 units…; P = 0.001)", and a prospective observational study reported reduced transfusion rates "67% vs 93%…; P < .001" with lower "30-day mortality (multivariable OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.28–0.97; P = 0.047)". Intravenous iron options are "very effective even for 1 to 2 weeks", and optimization "as long as 4 to 5 weeks preoperatively" may reduce adverse outcomes. ESA-alone strategies also show benefit: in "a prospective RCT of 600 anemic patients", a "single dose of 80,000 units of epoetin-a" "2 days preoperatively" increased hemoglobin and reduced transfusion and major adverse surgical events, with early events favoring ESA at 3 days "after surgery (10.2% vs 0.8%; P < .001)" and persisting "after surgery (10.2% vs 8.7%; P < .005)", though with "no significant difference in mortality and major adverse events at 45 days". Another randomized trial of "320 patients… off-pump" found fewer transfusions with ESA "37.1% vs 16.1%; RR, 0.425; P = 0.007", using "multiple subcutaneous doses starting on preoperative day 2 and continuing to postoperative day 2". Practical considerations note that decreased perioperative endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) production "favors a short preoperative course of ESA (a few days before the operation)" in selected patients, while iron-only data are limited, and "a small RCT of only 50 patients did not" show benefit.

### Erythropoiesis stimulating agents and reno-protection: a meta-analysis [^d426afad]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical interventions to see if there is a relationship between ESAs and renal outcomes included short-term prophylactic ESA treatment where there was a high likelihood of acute kidney injury (AKI), e.g. patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. In another modality, ESA treatment at the time of surgery might mitigate the ischemic damage and delayed graft function (DGF) that occurs during the perioperative period following kidney transplant. DGF increases the risk of acute rejection, impaired graft function, and reduces long term patient and graft survival. In a third modality, treatment of CKD patients to correct anemia associated with renal failure presumes that ESA treatment might delay or prevent renal disease progression through direct anti-apoptotic effects on renal cells or indirect effects of anemia correction, eg improved oxygen delivery.

Most of the trials examining the effect of ESAs on renal patients were small, outcomes were not robust or they varied across studies. Therefore, results from individual trials were inconclusive, but meta-analyses of results from those clinical trials may allow more definitive conclusions. We reasoned further that meta-analysis of multiple modalities would add additional value. The three modalities above were selected for meta-analysis because they examined direct and/or indirect effects of ESAs on renal disease progression or renal function. We report here that meta-analyses show no significant beneficial effects in any of the modalities, suggesting that ESAs have little reno-protective benefits, at least with the patient populations examined and clinical designs employed.

Regarding perioperative care for perioperative bleeding, more specifically with respect to management of preoperative anemia, assessment and timing of surgery, BSH 2024 guidelines recommend to consider referring patients with unexplained anemia without iron deficiency according to the severity of anaemia (hemoglobin < 120 g/L for males, hemoglobin < 100 g/L for females, or according to locally agreed criteria), recognizing that the risk of a serious cause or haemoglobinopathy is proportional to anemia severity.

### Should we restrict erythrocyte transfusion in early goal directed protocols? [^293c9a5a]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

In high-risk cardiac surgical patients, Murphy et al. recently randomly assigned 2,007 patients post cardiac surgery (they were either revasculerized or replaced defective valves) to a restrictive transfusion threshold (hemoglobin level < 7.5 g/dl) or a liberal transfusion threshold (hemoglobin level < 9 g/dl) group. The primary outcome was a serious infection (sepsis or wound infection) or an ischemic event (permanent stroke, myocardial infarction, infarction of the gut, or acute kidney injury) within 3 months after surgery. Transfusion rates were 53.4% (higher than many liberal transfusion hospitals) and 92.2% in the two groups, respectively. The restrictive transfusion threshold was not inferior to the liberal threshold with respect to morbidity or 30 day mortality. Mortality at 90 days was statistically higher in the restrictive group with 16 more deaths than in the liberal-threshold group. These finding are perplexing since the causes of death were not related to anemia and no plausible mechanism was offered by the authors. In this respect, this study provides non-inferiority data on restrictive transfusion and should not result in change of practice until these findings are either corroborated or refuted. It is also unclear whether the liberal transfused group were benefiting from the 'volume therapy' which the restrictive group has not received.

In-line with this discussion, two US health care organizations (American Medical Association Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement® and The Joint Commission) have previously recommended strategies to minimize overuse in healthcare, naming blood products as one of the top five targets. In addition, the Choosing Wisely® campaign launched by the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation both in US and now Canada, repeat the same message. The World Health Organization has adopted resolution 63.12, also adopted by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, recommending all member states to implement a patient blood management (PBM) program employing multiple strategies to minimize unnecessary exposure to blood products as a new standard of care. In detail, PBM is a proactive evidence based approach to identify, diagnose and treat anemia before a transfusion threshold is met. Optimization of hemostasis and minimization of blood loss are additional core principles of PBM to reduce costs and to improve patient outcome.

### Anemia and hematinic deficiencies in patients with chronic heart failure… [^b84f383b]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Overall, 1237 patients had anemia, which was mild in 643, moderate in 354, and marked in 240. The prevalence of anemia was higher in patients with LVSD or with either definition of HFnEF than in those who lacked echocardiographic and biomarker criteria for HF. The prevalence of anemia increased slightly with higher, rather than lower, serum vitamin B12 and folate concentrations. Patients with HF had a slightly higher prevalence of macrocytosis regardless of hemoglobin category. There was also a strong association between the prevalence of anemia and estimated glomerular filtration rate, hsCRP, and NT-proBNP.

In a multivariable model restricted to hematinic variables and key clinical characteristics, the following were associated with higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality: lower hemoglobin and serum iron concentrations, the highest quintile of ferritin, and higher serum vitamin B12 concentrations. If the model was extended to include comorbidities, such as findings on physical examination, other biochemical testing, and therapy, the independent association between serum iron and all-cause mortality was lost, but hemoglobin and vitamin B12 concentrations remained weakly associated with outcome. The causes of anemia in patients with HF are complex. 6 Anemia denotes a low hemoglobin concentration.

Plasma volume expansion or a decrease in red blood cell mass may cause the hemoglobin concentration to decrease and the patient to become anemic20, 23; plasma volume expansion may contribute to both anemia and an increase in natriuretic peptides and partly account for why patients with HF have a lower hemoglobin concentration for a given level of iron deficiency. The severity of anemia and iron deficiency were both strongly related to all-cause and cardiovascular mortality on univariate analyses. Patients with anemia were at increased risk of sudden and HF-related death. Elimination of iron or hemoglobin from the multivariable model strengthened the association of the other with outcome. Therefore, it is likely that both the severity of anemia and iron deficiency contribute to an adverse outcome in patients with HF.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^88967848]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Elemental iron is an essential growth factor for bacteria, with many species expressing iron transport proteins that compete with transferrin, and it has long been suggested that patients with iron overload are at increased risk of infection 72. However, data from meta‐analyses and large observational studies showed that peri‐operative i.v. iron did not increase postoperative infection or 30‐day mortality rates in surgical patients 64, 66. In contrast, red cell transfusion delivers haem and labile iron which readily supports bacterial growth 73. Nevertheless, in the absence of definitive clinical data, it would seem logical to refrain from i.v. iron administration in the setting of acute infection 8.

The available evidence relating i.v. iron administration to oxidative stress leading to atherogenesis and vascular remodelling, is sparse and indirect. It is mostly derived from retrospective observational studies addressing long‐term i.v. iron therapy 70, whereas in the postoperative period, very short‐term i.v. iron courses are administered (one or two large doses) 64. Thus, it does not seem to be of concern in the postoperative setting.

### The impact of blood conservation on outcomes in cardiac surgery: is it safe and effective? [^e04aa3fd]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Increasing evidence shows that perioperative blood transfusion in cardiac surgery is associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality and decreased long-term survival. Tolerance of "permissive anemia" is an important element of perioperative blood conservation strategy. The safety of tolerating perioperative anemia has been a significant deterrent for widespread application of blood conservation. This study examines whether blood conservation is equally safe or superior to the common practice of transfusion in cardiac surgery.

Methods

The total study population consisted of 32,449 patients who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass surgery from June 2000 until December 2004 with complete data from 17 institutions in the State of New Jersey. Englewood Hospital and Medical Center (EH) has a well-established blood conservation program. Five hundred eighty-six EH patients (blood conservation cohort) were compared with a propensity score-matched cohort of 586 patients from the other New Jersey institutions (OH-M) representing the common practice of transfusion. Outcomes were classified as very serious complications, serious complications, or neither (no very serious complication or serious complication). Analysis consisted of McNemar tests and multiple logistic regression.

Results

Fewer patients were transfused at EH compared with OH-M (10.6% versus 42.5%; p < 0.0001). Englewood Hospital had 5 (0.8%) deaths versus 15 (2.5%) in the OH-M group (p = 0.02). Of the EH patients, 11.1% experienced a very serious complication or serious complication versus 18.7% in the OH-M cohort (p = 0.0002). Transfusion was associated with an increased risk of an adverse outcome in both cohorts (EH: odds ratio, 7.3; 95% confidence interval, 3.7 to 14.4 versus OH-M: odds ratio, 4.6; 95% confidence interval, 2.8 to 7.7).

Conclusions

Blood conservation is safe and effective in reducing transfusions. Tolerance of perioperative anemia, which is one of the main components of blood conservation, does not increase the risk of complications or death in cardiac surgery. Avoidance of transfusion reduces the risk of complications. This study further solidifies the relationship between transfusion and adverse outcome in cardiac surgery.

Regarding perioperative care for perioperative bleeding, more specifically with respect to management of preoperative anemia, assessment and timing of surgery, ESAIC 2023 guidelines recommend to consider allowing 1–2 weeks after parenteral stimulation of erythropoiesis and uncomplicated cause of anemia and 3–8 weeks for oral correction of iron deficiency anemia and complex cause of anemia.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Preoperative iron deficiency anemia — intravenous iron over oral therapy is emphasized, with specific dosing limits. Iron supplementation is underused; the use of intravenous iron in patients with iron deficiency is safe and efficacious to reverse anemia, whereas oral iron therapy is minimally effective if administered only 1 to 2 weeks preoperatively and is not adequate for rapid treatment due to low bioavailability and tolerance issues. Intravenous iron, even in a single dose, is more effective than oral iron to improve hemoglobin and iron stores and reduce transfusion and readmission rates; with an anemia management approach for patients undergoing noncardiac surgery (NCS), the number-needed-to-treat to prevent 1 complication is 6 and to prevent 1 complication-related death is 25. Iron sucrose is noted to be administered in lower doses, with a maximum dose of 200 to 300 mg per infusion.
