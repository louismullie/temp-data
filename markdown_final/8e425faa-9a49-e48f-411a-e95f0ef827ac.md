## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about toxic shock syndrome (TSS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining TSS and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and etiologies, including staphylococcal and streptococcal forms. Next, I will review clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria, including pitfalls and differentials. After that, I need to examine evidence-based management, including antibiotics, source control, IVIG, and supportive care. Finally, I should consider special populations, prevention, and synthesize a practical algorithm with quality of evidence and limitations.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology. TSS is an acute, toxin-mediated illness characterized by fever, hypotension, and multisystem organ involvement, driven by superantigenic exotoxins that bypass normal antigen processing and provoke a cytokine storm with TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-2 as key mediators, leading to vascular leak, DIC, and organ dysfunction [^10645976] [^8c84d22b].

> I need to check the epidemiology and etiologies carefully. Historically, menstrual TSS linked to TSST-1–producing Staphylococcus aureus dominated, but nonmenstrual TSS now predominates in many regions, with sources including burns, skin and soft tissue infections, surgical wounds, and respiratory infections; streptococcal TSS (STSS) is less common but carries higher mortality, and its incidence has risen in some settings [^78b57801] [^43524bab] [^c65f065b]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric data: in the US, pediatric TSS incidence is about 1 per 100,000 and stable, with staphylococcal cases more frequent than streptococcal, though streptococcal disease tends to be more severe [^ce05d07d] [^8334b638].

> Next, I should review the clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria. Classic features include high fever, diffuse erythroderma, hypotension, and multisystem involvement (GI, muscular, mucous membranes, renal, hepatic, hematologic, CNS), with desquamation 1–2 weeks later; however, rash may be absent early or throughout, especially in STSS, and children may present atypically, complicating diagnosis [^76f624e6] [^43524bab]. Wait, let me verify the diagnostic challenge: CDC criteria exist but were designed for surveillance and may miss early or atypical cases; in ICU cohorts of menstrual TSS, none met confirmed criteria at admission, underscoring the need for clinical judgment rather than rigid algorithms [^28ba3b12] [^76f624e6].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis. Septic shock, Kawasaki disease with shock, MIS-C, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, and anaphylaxis can mimic TSS; distinguishing features include the superantigen-driven cytokine storm physiology, the timing of desquamation, and the identification of a focal source or toxin-producing organism, though cultures can be negative in staphylococcal TSS [^43524bab] [^44dc115b] [^76f624e6]. Hold on, I should verify that MIS-C typically follows COVID-19 exposure and shows different cardiac phenotypes, which helps differentiate it from bacterial TSS in children [^44dc115b].

> Now, I need to ensure management is evidence-aligned. The cornerstone is early recognition, aggressive hemodynamic support, source control, and antibiotics that include a bactericidal agent plus a protein synthesis inhibitor to suppress toxin production; clindamycin is consistently recommended for its antitoxin effect, and IVIG is considered for severe or refractory cases, particularly in STSS, though pediatric RCT data are limited and guidelines vary [^b16e810c] [^10645976] [^2336c181]. Let me double-check pediatric guidance: the Surviving Sepsis Campaign advises against routine IVIG in streptococcal TSS due to insufficient evidence, yet observational pediatric data and case series suggest potential benefit, so I should frame IVIG as reasonable in severe or refractory cases after source control and antibiotics are optimized [^2336c181] [^32ff035a] [^57f22163].

> For antibiotics, I should confirm specifics. For suspected staphylococcal TSS, use a beta-lactamase–resistant antistaphylococcal agent (e.g., nafcillin, oxacillin, or vancomycin if MRSA risk) plus clindamycin; for streptococcal TSS, use penicillin plus clindamycin, with consideration of adding a beta-lactam with broader Gram-negative coverage if sepsis source is unclear; early surgical source control is critical when necrotizing infection is suspected [^e5707e59] [^3907f21f]. Wait, I initially thought carbapenems were standard for STSS, but I should correct that: penicillin plus clindamycin is the backbone, with carbapenems reserved for broader coverage when the source or organism is uncertain or when polymicrobial infection is suspected [^notfound].

> Supportive care must be aggressive and early. I need to ensure rapid fluid resuscitation, early vasopressor support to maintain perfusion, and ICU-level monitoring for multiorgan failure; in children, follow pediatric sepsis protocols with 20 mL/kg boluses and early inotropes as indicated, and escalate to ECMO if refractory shock with cardiac failure persists despite maximal therapy [^2336c181] [^6d0a92fa]. Let me reconsider adjuncts: therapeutic plasma exchange has case-level evidence in refractory septic shock, including some TSS cases, but remains investigational and should be individualized [^6a73ea54].

> Special populations require tailored vigilance. In pediatrics, TSS accounts for a meaningful fraction of septic shock cases; streptococcal TSS is rarer but deadlier, and antitoxin therapies are underused, so I should maintain a low threshold for clindamycin and IVIG in severe presentations [^8334b638] [^20bc49ae]. In burns, even small injuries can precipitate TSS, so I should monitor closely and consider prophylactic antibiotics in high-risk scenarios, acknowledging limited but supportive evidence [^06a594f6] [^8e58adfb]. In pregnancy and postpartum, consider TSS with retained products or surgical sites and prioritize source control and multidisciplinary care [^notfound].

> Prevention and public health aspects matter. I should confirm that menstrual TSS risk is mitigated by using lower-absorbency tampons, changing them frequently, and avoiding overnight use; regulatory labeling reflects this, and clinicians should counsel patients accordingly [^7febc7a2]. For recurrent or high-risk settings, consider screening for S. aureus colonization and decolonization strategies, and in outbreaks, coordinate infection control and chemoprophylaxis for close contacts when indicated [^b16e810c].

> Finally, I need to synthesize a practical algorithm. Suspect TSS in any patient with fever, hypotension, and multisystem involvement, especially with a compatible source or rash; initiate sepsis protocols, obtain cultures from the source site even if blood cultures are negative, start antistaphylococcal or antistreptococcal therapy plus clindamycin early, pursue urgent source control, and add IVIG for severe or refractory cases; escalate to ICU care, vasopressors, and ECMO as needed, and reassess frequently for evolving organ dysfunction and response to therapy [^b16e810c] [^2336c181] [^3907f21f]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: always keep mimics in mind, but in suspected TSS, do not delay antibiotics or source control while awaiting confirmatory testing, as mortality rises with each hour of delay [^notfound].

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a **life-threatening toxin-mediated illness** caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, characterized by rapid-onset fever, hypotension, diffuse rash, and multiorgan dysfunction [^10645976]. Early recognition and **aggressive management** — including prompt antibiotics with clindamycin, source control, and IVIG for severe cases — are critical to reduce mortality, which can exceed 50% in streptococcal TSS [^8c84d22b] [^b16e810c]. TSS can occur in menstrual and nonmenstrual settings, and clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion in patients with shock, rash, and organ failure [^78b57801] [^43524bab].

---

## Etiology and pathophysiology

TSS is primarily caused by **superantigen toxins** produced by Staphylococcus aureus (notably TSST-1) and Streptococcus pyogenes (notably streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins A and C) [^10645976]. These toxins bypass normal antigen processing, causing massive T-cell activation, cytokine release, vascular leakage, and multiorgan dysfunction [^8c84d22b].

---

## Clinical presentation

TSS presents with **rapid-onset fever, hypotension, and a diffuse macular erythroderma** that later desquamates, particularly on the palms and soles [^76f624e6]. Multiorgan involvement is common, including:

- **Gastrointestinal**: vomiting, diarrhea.
- **Muscular**: severe myalgia, elevated CPK.
- **Mucous membranes**: vaginal, oropharyngeal, or conjunctival hyperemia.
- **Renal**: elevated BUN/creatinine, pyuria without UTI.
- **Hepatic**: elevated bilirubin, AST/ALT.
- **Hematologic**: thrombocytopenia.
- **Central nervous system**: disorientation or altered consciousness without focal deficits [^76f624e6].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

The CDC provides **case definitions** for TSS, including confirmed, probable, and suspected categories, based on clinical and laboratory findings [^notfound]. Key criteria include fever, rash, hypotension, and multiorgan involvement, with negative cultures for other pathogens [^76f624e6].

---

## Epidemiology

TSS incidence varies by etiology and population. Streptococcal TSS has a **mortality rate of 30–70%**, whereas staphylococcal TSS has a lower mortality but remains significant [^8c84d22b]. Pediatric TSS accounts for approximately 11% of pediatric septic shock cases, with staphylococcal TSS being more common and streptococcal TSS carrying higher mortality [^8334b638].

---

## Management

Management centers on **early recognition, aggressive supportive care, and targeted therapy**:

- **Supportive care**: aggressive fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, and ICU monitoring [^3907f21f].
- **Antibiotics**: clindamycin plus a beta-lactam (e.g. penicillin for streptococcal TSS; nafcillin or vancomycin for staphylococcal TSS) to inhibit toxin production and eradicate infection [^e5707e59].
- **Source control**: removal of tampons, drainage of abscesses, or surgical debridement of necrotic tissue [^b16e810c].
- **Adjunctive therapy**: intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for severe cases, particularly streptococcal TSS, to neutralize toxins and modulate the immune response [^3aac4698].

---

## Prevention

Prevention focuses on **patient education** on tampon use, wound care, and early recognition of symptoms. Regulatory measures, such as tampon labeling and removal of high-absorbency tampons, have reduced menstrual TSS incidence [^7febc7a2].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on **early recognition and aggressive management**. Streptococcal TSS has higher mortality, whereas staphylococcal TSS generally has better outcomes with timely treatment [^8334b638].

---

TSS is a **medical emergency** requiring rapid diagnosis and aggressive management. Early antibiotics, source control, and supportive care are essential to reduce mortality and morbidity.

### Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome: a case series emphasizing the urgency of recognition and tailored treatment [^056a5ab3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a rare but lethal condition associated with Streptococcus Pyogenes Group A (GAS). With rising incidence and high mortality, timely recognition and management are crucial. This case series presents two adult TSS cases caused by invasive GAS, highlighting the importance of early identification and multidisciplinary management.

Case Presentations

The first case involves a 42-year-old male who presented with fever, dizziness, and a tender, erythematous olecranon following an elbow laceration. Despite negative imaging for necrotizing fasciitis, a positive throat swab for GAS prompted immediate broad-spectrum antibiotics and aggressive resuscitation. Clindamycin and intravenous immunoglobulin were administered. The patient developed TSS and acute kidney injury, requiring intensive care and hemodialysis. The second case features a previously healthy 43-year-old female presenting with systemic symptoms and a rash, without trauma history. Positive GAS blood cultures confirmed TSS, leading to similar management and subsequent renal complications requiring hemodialysis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? These cases highlight the evolving epidemiology of invasive GAS infections and the associated risk of TSS. Early identification and appropriate tailored treatment are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality, especially given the recent surge in invasive GAS. Clinical vigilance for skin changes and thorough laboratory investigations, including non-sterile site cultures, are critical. Early identification enables the use of adjunctive treatments like clindamycin and IVIG, and facilitates appropriate de-escalation of antibiotics. Prompt consultation with infectious disease, intensive care, and surgical teams is necessary to ensure optimal treatment.

### Treatment of toxic shock in children [^f0249091]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2025). Medium credibility.

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a life-threatening complication of infection typically caused by one of two bacterial species: Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes The outcomes in children with TSS can be devastating. Careful consideration of TSS is required as a potential differential diagnosis of children presenting with sepsis or severe illness associated with fever and rash.

### Toxic shock syndrome: still a timely diagnosis [^be5a35b0]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an acute, severe, toxin-mediated disease, characterized by fever, hypotension, and multiorgan system involvement. Toxic shock syndrome has made headlines because of its high associated morbidity and mortality rate in previously healthy young females. Incidence peaked in the early 1980s owing to increased usage of ultra-absorbent tampons. After improved patient education and tampon labeling, the incidence of menstrual TSS has declined.

Case

A previously healthy 14-year-old girl presented to an urgent care center with a 2-day history of fever, erythematous maculopapular rash, vomiting, diarrhea, and malaise. She was found to be tachycardic and hypotensive. Investigations revealed thrombocytopenia, an elevated white count and lactate, and acute kidney injury, consistent with septic shock. Recent tampon usage with menstruation was reported, and a pelvic examination revealed purulent vaginal discharge. The patient was transferred to a pediatric intensive care unit for antibiotic and vasopressor therapy. Vaginal swabs later tested positive for Staphylococcus aureus and TSS toxin-1.

Conclusions

Although the incidence of TSS has decreased in recent years, it is crucial that clinicians rapidly recognize and treat this life-threatening condition. Emergency physicians should always have a high index of suspicion for TSS in young females presenting without another obvious cause of shock. A pelvic examination should always be completed in these cases.

### Toxic shock syndrome-the seven Rs of management and treatment [^b16e810c]. The Journal of Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Staphylococcal and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. There has been considerable progress in understanding the pathophysiology and delineating optimal management and treatment. This article reviews the management of TSS, outlining the 'Seven Rs of Managing and Treating TSS': Recognition, Resuscitation, Removal of source of infection, Rational choice of antibiotics, Role of adjunctive treatment (clindamycin and intravenous immunoglobulin), Review of progress and Reduce risk of secondary cases in close contacts.

### Gram-positive toxic shock syndromes [^10645976]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2009). Medium credibility.

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an acute, multi-system, toxin-mediated illness, often resulting in multi-organ failure. It represents the most fulminant expression of a spectrum of diseases caused by toxin-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus). The importance of Gram-positive organisms as pathogens is increasing, and TSS is likely to be underdiagnosed in patients with staphylococcal or group A streptococcal infection who present with shock. TSS results from the ability of bacterial toxins to act as superantigens, stimulating immune-cell expansion and rampant cytokine expression in a manner that bypasses normal MHC-restricted antigen processing. A repetitive cycle of cell stimulation and cytokine release results in a cytokine avalanche that causes tissue damage, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and organ dysfunction. Specific therapy focuses on early identification of the illness, source control, and administration on antimicrobial agents including drugs capable of suppressing toxin production (eg, clindamycin, linezolid). Intravenous immunoglobulin has the potential to neutralise superantigen and to mitigate subsequent tissue damage.

### Manifestations of toxic shock syndrome in children, Columbus, Ohio, USA, 2010–2017 [^43524bab]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a severe acute illness caused by toxin-producing strains of Streptococcus pyogenes (streptococcal TSS [STSS]) and Staphylococcus aureus (nonstreptococcal TSS [NSTSS]). Data are limited on the incidence, management, and outcomes for children with TSS. Most epidemiologic and clinical studies of TSS have reported predominantly streptococcal cases. The incidence of severe streptococcal infections, including TSS, has been increasing in North America since the 1990s. Studies from the United States and Canada report incidence rates of 3.8–10.24 invasive group A Streptococcus (GAS) cases per 100,000 persons per year. Reported death rates vary from 4.2% to 56% for STSS (,–) and are up to 22% for NSTSS.

The uncontrolled cytokine stimulation by bacterial toxins results in several clinical manifestations of TSS, such as hypotension, fever, rash, and organ dysfunction. On the basis of these clinical signs, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined criteria for TSS and updated these criteria in 2010 for STSS and in 2011 for NSTSS. Despite recognition of illness and CDC disease definitions, TSS diagnosis remains challenging because some clinical findings, such as hypotension, could be transient and some, such as rash, might be absent.

CDC criteria do not differentiate between children and adults. In children, differentiating TSS from septic shock, Kawasaki disease with shock, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome poses additional challenges. In addition to these diagnostic difficulties, challenges and controversies exist for managing TSS. Our objective was to differentiate the clinical patterns of TSS in children in a large tertiary center as they relate to published criteria, diagnostic decisions, and treatment options.

### Early diagnosis and treatment of toxic shock syndrome in paediatric burns [^92d2f9ee]. Burns (2005). Low credibility.

Young children with burns are at risk of developing toxic shock syndrome (TSS), which is an exotoxin mediated disease usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). The diagnosis of TSS is difficult because in the early stages the signs and symptoms resemble other common childhood illnesses such as scarlet fever. If the condition is not treated promptly it has a high mortality. The South West Regional Paediatric Burns Unit at Frenchay Hospital admits 150–200 burns per year. We have designed a protocol to facilitate the early diagnosis and treatment of TSS. We report our experience over a 3-year period in which almost one quarter of cases of TSS were admitted from home or another hospital. During this period all children with TSS survived and none needed ventilatory support. Typical cases presented within 2 days of thermal injury, in a child under 2 years old with a burn of less than 10% of body surface area (BSA).

### Toxic shock syndrome due to Streptococcus pyogenes: case report [^d60c41bb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is one of the most devastating clinical manifestations of Streptococcus pyogenes (also known as Group A Streptococci or GAS), characterized by an overwhelming production of toxins. The incidence of TSS is increasing worldwide, and the mortality rate remains unacceptably high. Due to the rapid progression of infection, rapid diagnosis is crucial, as early initiation of aggressive supportive measures, along with antibiotics, source control, immunoglobulin, and steroids, can improve patient outcomes. IgM- and IgA-enriched immunoglobulins represents a new therapeutic option, as highlighted in the case reported here.

Case Report

A 66-year-old man was admitted for cellulitis of the right arm with shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), renal and hepatic compromise, suggestive of toxic shock syndrome (TSS). Blood cultures revealed S. pyogenes, confirming the diagnosis. The patient was treated with combination antibiotic therapy (clindamycin, piperacillin/tazobactam), steroids and enriched immunoglobulins in addition to vasopressor and high flow oxygen. He was discharged home with complete recovery after 1 month. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? In the emergency department, the primary goals of management of TSS include aggressive resuscitation, prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics, source control if feasible, and early intensive care unit admission.

### Recurrent nonmenstrual toxic shock syndrome: clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment [^0dea6f7a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

We report 3 cases of recurrent nonmenstrual toxic shock syndrome (TSS) and review the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment. The primary sites of infection were the genital tract (in a patient who underwent cesarean delivery), the upper respiratory tract, and a breast abscess. In all 3 patients, the initial illness was not recognized to be TSS; only after development of recurrent illness with desquamation was this diagnosis entertained. Strains of Staphylococcus aureus that were isolated from 2 patients produced TSS toxin-1, whereas the third strain produced staphylococcal enterotoxin B. All 3 patients lacked antibody to the implicated toxins at the time of presentation with recurrent illness. Nonmenstrual TSS can occur in a variety of clinical settings and may be recurrent. The presence of desquamation during a febrile, multisystem illness could suggest this diagnosis and should prompt the clinician to obtain appropriate cultures for S. aureus.

### Epidemiology and clinical relevance of toxic shock syndrome in US children [^8334b638]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

It is important for clinicians to recognize the contribution of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) to the overall burden of pediatric septic shock because the clinical features, optimal therapy and prognosis differ from non-TSS septic shock.

Methods

We analyzed cases of pediatric septic shock reported to the Pediatric Health Information Systems database between 2009 and 2013 to define the clinical and demographic characteristics of pediatric TSS in the United States. Using a validated International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, coding strategy, we identified patients with infectious shock among inpatients age 1–18 years and classified cases of staphylococcal and streptococcal TSS for comparison with non-TSS cases.

Results

Of 8,226 cases of pediatric septic shock, 909 (11.1%) were classified as TSS and 562 (6.8%) were possible TSS cases. Staphylococcal TSS represented the majority (83%) of TSS cases and occurred more commonly in females and at an older age. Compared with non-TSS septic shock, TSS had significantly lower fatality rates, disease severity and length of hospital stay and was present more often at the time of admission (P < 0.001 for each). Streptococcal TSS was associated with poorer outcomes than staphylococcal TSS. Treatment for TSS differed from non-TSS septic shock in use of more clindamycin, vancomycin and Intravenous Immunoglobulin and less need for vasopressors.

Conclusions

Results demonstrate a significant contribution of TSS to the burden of pediatric septic shock in the United States. The findings emphasize the importance of inclusion of TSS diagnostic and therapeutic considerations in sepsis treatment protocols for children.

### Infectious shock and toxic shock syndrome diagnoses in hospitals, Colorado, USA [^672955c4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

First described in 1978, toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a severe febrile illness now confirmed to be caused by exotoxin-producing strains of Staphyloccocus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Investigations based on extensive chart review and/or microbiology laboratory data suggest little or no decrease in overall TSS incidence and an increase in streptococcal TSS. Given the persistence and severity of TSS and the differences in its treatment from other causes of septic shock, its evolving epidemiology needs to be accurately monitored. To this end, we assessed International Classification of Diseases, Ninth revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)–coded TSS cases in Colorado, USA.

### Infectious shock and toxic shock syndrome diagnoses in hospitals, Colorado, USA [^33f0c4e1]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

In Colorado, USA, diagnoses coded as toxic shock syndrome (TSS) constituted 27.3% of infectious shock cases during 1993–2006. The incidence of staphylococcal TSS did not change significantly overall or in female patients 10–49 years of age but increased for streptococcal TSS. TSS may be underrecognized among all ages and both sexes.

### Toxic shock syndrome in Australian children [^32ff035a]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There are limited data describing the epidemiology, management and outcomes of children with toxic shock syndrome (TSS), a potentially life-threatening illness. Here, we describe the incidence, clinical features, treatment and outcome of children with staphylococcal and streptococcal TSS in Victoria, Australia.

Methods

Retrospective chart review of children admitted between 2003 and 2014 to two tertiary paediatric referral centres who fulfilled the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definition of TSS.

Results

There were 62 cases over the 11-year period; 43 staphylococcal TSS and 19 streptococcal TSS. The majority (46 (74%)) of cases were admitted to an intensive care unit and 44 (71%) required inotropic support. Compared with those with staphylococcal TSS, patients with streptococcal TSS were younger, more unwell and more likely to have residual morbidity. Adjunctive therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin or clindamycin was used in 58 (94%) of cases and fresh frozen plasma was used in 15 (24%). Seven patients received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. All patients survived.

Conclusions

This study highlights the importance of early recognition of TSS and supports rapid tertiary referral and intensive care management, which includes the use of adjunctive therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin and clindamycin.

### Toxic shock syndrome in burns: diagnosis and management [^06a594f6]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2007). Low credibility.

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS), a toxin-mediated disease, is the most common cause of unexpected mortality in children with small burns. It is a diagnosis that is often missed because of non-specific signs and an ability to mimic other childhood illnesses. Any child with a pyrexia greater than 38.9 degrees C, a rash, or a sudden change in clinical condition within a few days of a burn injury should be monitored closely for TSS. If there is co-incident hyponatraemia or lymphopaenia, or if there is any deterioration in clinical condition, the child should be managed with anti-staphylococcal and streptococcal antibiotics and passive immunity for toxins provided by fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). It is essential that all paediatric and emergency departments accepting children with burns are aware of the symptoms, signs and early management of TSS.

### Atypical presentation of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome with uterine necrosis [^210320b8]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a fulminant disease characterised by rapid progression to multiorgan failure. However, streptococcal TSS manifesting as uterine necrosis (UN) is unusual. Here, we present a case of a woman in her 30s with a constellation of symptoms, including abdominal pain, fatigue and fever. Despite an initially unclear clinical picture, she rapidly developed shock with radiographical evidence of intrabdominal arterial narrowing with spurious multiorgan infarctions and ischaemic colitis. Exploratory laparotomy uncovered unexpected UN requiring hysterectomy. Multiple complications ensued, marked by shock liver, acute renal failure, cutaneous desquamation and distal gangrene. This case highlights a unique presentation of streptococcal TSS as UN and emphasises the rapidly deteriorating nature of the disease.

### The use of etanercept for treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis when toxic shock syndrome is in the differential [^ce271036]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) can sometimes mimic Steven Johnsons syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN). Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of both TSS and SJS/TEN. Etanercept, a TNF-alpha inhibitor has been recently shown to treat and decrease mortality of SJS/TEN. We report a 51-year-old female with history of SJS presenting with painful skin and bullae 2 days following cystoscopy with botulinum toxin injection into the bladder. Due to initial concern for SJS/TEN, the patient was treated with 50mg of subcutaneous etanercept. Punch biopsies were not consistent with SJS, and the patient fulfilled five out of five criteria for a confirmed case of TSS. The patient ultimately had a favorable outcome despite etanercept treatment. Ultimately, TNF-alpha antagonists are an emerging therapy to treat SJS/TEN, and are unlikely to worsen TSS prognosis. Given that etanercept can be used to successfully treat SJS/TEN and TNF-alpha levels are elevated in TSS, if a dermatologist chooses to treat TEN with etanercept, consideration of TSS on the differential should not necessarily exclude etanercept as a reasonable treatment option.

### A rare case of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome after abdominoplasty [^7fd3b321]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a serious, potentially life-threatening condition resulting from an overwhelming immunological response to an exotoxin released by Staphylococcus aureus. TSS has rarely been described as a complication after elective aesthetic plastic surgery. We present here the case of a patient who underwent abdominoplasty after massive weight loss and had a near-fatal case of TSS 6 weeks after surgery. Prolonged use of closed suction drains may have been the ultimate source of virulent bacterial growth leading to systemic toxicity. To our knowledge, TSS has not been reported as a complication after abdominoplasty, nor has a case with such a delayed presentation of the disease been described.

### Toxic shock syndrome in paediatric thermal injuries: a case series and systematic literature review [^04b57d0d]. Burns (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a rare, but potentially life-threatening complication of thermal injuries in children. The study objective was to systematically review the literature on paediatric TSS after burns or scalds, and describe our experience with this condition in Switzerland.

Methods

All tertiary paediatric healthcare centres managing burns and scalds in Switzerland were inquired. A systematic literature review was performed using EMBASE (1947–2016), MEDLINE (1946–2016), Web of Science (1900–2016) and Google Scholar in October 2016. Data on patient characteristics, symptoms, laboratory parameters, management and outcome were extracted from paper and electronic patient charts. Descriptive statistics were performed.

Results

The literature review revealed 25 articles describing 59 cases observed in 10 countries (UK, USA, Hungary, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, Israel, Japan, Spain, Switzerland) from 1985 to 2016. The patient age ranged from 8 months to 8 years at the time point of TSS-diagnosis. The injured total body surface area ranged from < 1% to 41%. Forty-one patients suffered from scalds, 6 from burns and in 12 cases the type of injury was not specified. The TSS-diagnosis was made 1-7days after thermal injury. Nineteen children underwent admission to the Intensive Care Unit. Six children died from TSS. In Switzerland, we identified 11 consecutive cases between 07/2001 and 06/2011 (median age 15 months, range 9 months-14 years; 9 male, 2 female; 3 burns, 8 scalds; 7% median total body surface area (TBSA), range 2–30%). Diagnosis of TSS was made on day 5 after injury in median (range 3–34 days). Eight of eleven patients received intensive care. Survivors (10/11) suffered no long-term sequelae besides scars. One 13-month old boy died 3days after a 7%-TBSA scald.

Conclusions

Toxic shock syndrome is an important complication of paediatric burns in Switzerland and several other countries world-wide. Diagnosis and management remain challenging. Awareness among treating clinicians is crucial for a favourable outcome.

### Toxic shock syndrome originating from the foot [^6d33500a]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The most familiar etiology of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is that of menstruation and tampon use. Nonmenstrual TSS has been described in all types of wounds including postsurgical, respiratory infection, mucous membrane disruption, burns, and vesicular lesions caused by varicella and shingles. A case of TSS occurring in a diabetic male patient with foot blisters is presented. Early recognition by an infectious disease specialist and appropriate medical management led to complete recovery. There have been no reported cases of Staphylococcus aureus TSS originating in the foot to date.

### Toxic shock syndrome complicated by co-infection with multidrug-resistant [^c4a6ecb5]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

This report describes the occurrence of toxic shock syndrome in a teenage girl. She presented with fever, rash, vomiting, dyspnoea and drowsiness. Examination showed a strawberry tongue and suppurative lymphadenitis in the right axilla with hypotensive shock. Abdominal examination confirmed hepatomegaly. Laboratory evaluation confirmed sepsis. The clinical presentation and evaluation suggested the possibility of toxic shock syndrome (TSS). Culture of her axillary lymph node abscess was positive for Acinetobacter baumannii The child was managed with supportive therapy including high flow oxygen, fluid resuscitation, inotropes and antibiotics. She recovered within a week and was reviewed 1week later. She was found to have skin desquamation on her palms and soles. TSS should be considered in the differential diagnosis in a child presenting with fever, rash and hypotension. It requires thorough examination and evaluation to identify the condition and focus of infection and prompt aggressive management which can bring best outcomes.

### High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin versus albumin 4% in paediatric toxic shock syndrome: a randomised controlled feasibility study [^242deef6]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2024). Medium credibility.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a rare disease responsible for significant morbidity and mortality.
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IG) in paediatric TSS could improve shock and organ failure.
Data are needed to evaluate efficacy and safety of IGs, but randomised clinical trial seem to be very difficult to conduct in this indication.

### Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children [^44dc115b]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a newly recognized condition affecting children with recent infection or exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MIS-C has symptoms that affect multiple organs systems, with some clinical features resembling Kawasaki disease (KD) and toxic shock syndrome (TSS).

Objective Of The Review

Our goal was to review the current literature and describe the evaluation and treatment algorithms for children suspected of having MIS-C who present to the emergency department.

Discussion

MIS-C has a wide clinical spectrum and diagnosis is based on a combination of both clinical and laboratory findings. The exact mechanism of immune dysregulation of MIS-C is not well understood. Physical findings may evolve and do not necessarily appear at the same time. Gastrointestinal, cardiac, inflammatory, and coagulopathy manifestations and dysfunction are seen frequently in MIS-C.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of MIS-C is based on clinical presentation and specific laboratory findings. In the emergency setting, a high level of suspicion for MIS-C is required in patients exposed to COVID-19. Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of therapy offer the best chance for optimal outcomes.

### Manifestations of toxic shock syndrome in children, Columbus, Ohio, USA, 2010–2017 [^d3adc7e4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Our study had several limitations. Although Nationwide Children's Hospital serves almost all of central Ohio's children, our data were not population based and were from 1 pediatric center. We might not have identified all patients with NSTSS because we were unable to review individual charts for patients with staphylococcal bacteremia if they did not have additional diagnoses of sepsis or septic shock. Despite our efforts to capture the clinical and laboratory changes at the time of initial evaluation, the duration of illness, as well as rapidly changing signs such as rash, might not have been accurately recorded in the patient charts, which would affect the overall diagnosis and possibly lead to misclassification of patients. In addition, because of the retrospective nature of our study, none of the bacterial isolates were archived for further typing or microbiological analysis.

Our findings indicate organ system involvement in TSS beyond that predicted by existing CDC criteria. Because clinicians appear to rely on archetypal presentations of TSS (e.g. fever, hypotension, and rash) to diagnose TSS, updated clinical and diagnostic criteria would facilitate early accurate diagnosis and treatment. Physicians should be aware of TSS presentations without rash. Furthermore, the updated criteria may benefit from a unifying definition.

### Delayed development of toxic shock syndrome following abdominal tissue expansion in a pediatric reconstruction patient: case report [^c787054e]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a potentially fatal postoperative complication, and even more so if the diagnosis is delayed. We present the case of a 7-month-old male infant who developed TSS as a complication of tissue expansion using an external port device. There have been 5 documented cases of TSS after tissue expander or breast prosthesis placement occurring in the adult population, however, there has not been a reported case of TSS in an infant. The long interval to development of TSS like symptoms, 4 months in this case, should not exclude TSS from the differential diagnosis. In a pediatric patient, a diffuse macular rash without the severe systemic symptoms on initial presentation can present as a diagnostic challenge. New diagnosis techniques are discussed that can shorten the time to a diagnosis of TSS. In this case, because the local bacterial count was low, the expanded tissue was transferred without complication.

### Bacterial toxicosis / toxic shock syndrome as a contributor to morbidity in children with burn injuries [^ac6f4748]. Burns (2003). Low credibility.

When a child with a thermal injury suddenly becomes unwell, it is often difficult to obtain an accurate diagnosis in the early stages of the illness. Out of 71 children admitted to our burns unit over a 15-month period, 13 became acutely toxic. Most of the cases had relatively small burns and the exact reason for their sudden deterioration was not apparent in the immediate stages. Several children required admission to the intensive therapy unit and there was one death. The number of children experiencing this significant morbidity over a relatively short period of time prompted us to perform a detailed retrospective study to ascertain the exact cause of the deterioration and to identify any patterns in their presenting signs and symptoms. There was considerable variation in the clinical picture of the children who developed the toxicosis, however, several features were frequently observed which resembled those seen in the toxic shock syndrome (TSS). In order to be more specific, we applied the criteria for TSS as defined by the Centres for Disease Control (CDC) to each of the 13 children. All of the criteria were noted in six children and the majority in the other seven. This was a much higher incidence than we would normally have expected. The clinical features of children with TSS are not always easy to distinguish from those observed in other illnesses. We therefore explored the possibility of alternative diagnoses that may have caused the toxicosis in these children. The mortality associated with TSS can be high, especially if there is a delay in recognition and subsequent management of the disease. Clinicians should be alerted to the fact that TSS is probably more prevalent than previously thought and should practise with a high index of suspicion in any child with a burn whose clinical condition suddenly deteriorates.

### Superantigens and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome [^8c84d22b]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Since the 1980s, a marked increase has occurred in highly invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) infections, in particular streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) associated with necrotizing fasciitis or myositis. The classical case definition for STSS is similar to staphylococcal toxic shock, caused by Staphylococcus aureus, but the outcome is more serious in STSS, with a reported death rate of 30% to 70%.

The multiorgan involvement in STSS suggests that a toxin produced by GAS might be involved in pathogenesis. Prime candidates are the streptococcal superantigens (SAgs), a family of highly mitogenic proteins secreted individually or in certain combinations by many Streptococcus pyogenes strains, although other virulence factors, such as Streptolysin O and various cell wall antigens can also cause toxic shock. Superantigens simultaneously bind to major histocompatibility complex class II molecules and T-cell receptor molecules bearing a particular V-β region. This binding results in the activation of a large proportion of antigen-presenting cells and T cells, with subsequent release of high systemic levels of cytokines.

Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis of SAg involvement in STSS. Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) toxin, produced by S. aureus, has been associated with most menstrual TSS cases. TSS toxin is a typical SAg that is functionally and structurally related to the staphylococcal and streptococcal SAgs. Moreover, animal models have shown that TSS toxin and other SAgs induce TSS-like symptoms in rabbits and rodents. The lack of neutralizing anti-SAg antibodies appears to be a key risk factor for the development of staphylococcal and streptococcal toxic shock.

The major cytokines released from antigen-presenting cells and T cells after activation by SAgs are tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), tumor necrosis factor beta (TNF-β), interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-2. TNF-α is the prime mediator of shock; anti–TNF-α has been shown to inhibit the progression of SAg-driven shock in mice and baboons.

### High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin versus albumin 4% in paediatric toxic shock syndrome: a randomised controlled feasibility study [^cc63358f]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality, with a fatality rate that could reach 28% in children with streptococcal TSS. In TSS, superantigen-related toxins are produced by bacteria, foremost among them Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, but also viruses.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines advise against the routine use of intravenous immunoglobulins (IGs) in TSS children with streptococcal aetiology. Many intensivists declared having used intravenous IG for TSS management, while their efficacy is questionable. Pathophysiology of TSS in children differs from adults: (1) immunological response varies with age, (2) the alterations of innate immunity in response to sepsis are more pronounced in children compared with adultsand (3) clinical and biological presentations are different. By blocking superantigenic activity and owning anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, intravenous IG could decrease the initial inflammatory storm of TSS, thus limiting shock intensity and organ failure.

In adults, one randomised controlled trial (RCT) stopped early due to lack of recruitmentreported a 3.6-fold higher mortality rate in the placebo group. A second RCT that enrolled less than 50% TSS patients reported inconclusive results on mortality or organ failure and physical functioning. A recent literature review, however, mixing adult and paediatric data, suggested intravenous IG efficacy. Ig M-enriched immunoglobulin (IgGAM) could be an alternative to intravenous IG as it has been reported to improve survival in adult septic shock. Data on the use of IgGAM in children with TSS are scarce. Cryoprecipitate has also been proposed in septic shock without significant effect. The last surviving sepsis campaign guidelines do not suggest its use in adults.

Because the evidence on intravenous IG is expensive with limited supply, and its benefit-risk balance in children with TSSstems from observational studies, as underlined by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, conducting an RCT seems justified.

Before launching such an RCT, we conducted a pilot study to assess its feasibility.

### Neonatal toxic shock syndrome-like exanthematous disease: a report of two cases [^2a0d9b7e]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Neonatal toxic shock syndrome (TSS)-like exanthematous disease is characterized by exanthema, thrombocytopenia and fever in neonates infected with TSS toxin-1 producing Staphylococcus aureus. Although the disease is rare, it should be known to neonatologists as it represents a differential diagnosis in neonates with exanthema and thrombocytopenia. Two presented neonates with Neonatal TSS-like exanthematous disease are rare European cases of this specific neonatal disease.

### Clinical presentation, diagnosis and management of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C): a systematic review [^4adfb4b2]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 as a novel coronavirus that swiftly reached pandemic proportions, leading to > 750 million cases and approximately 7 million deaths, globally. Initially, COVID-19 was thought to present as a mild respiratory infection in the paediatric population. However, it soon became apparent that some children can present with severe illness with features of hyperinflammatory shock and multi-organ involvement, after several reports from different countries (including the UK, the USA and Italy). This condition was termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) or paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS). Since then, MIS-C has been reported from different parts of the world with a varied presentation and has been likened to other diseases, including Kawasaki disease (KD), toxic shock syndrome (TSS), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), haemophagocytic lymphocytic histiocytosis, and even appendicitis, due to overlapping clinical manifestations which complicated the diagnosis.

Due to a varied disease presentation, multiple case definitions have been suggested by entities like WHO, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), to help guide clinicians towards the diagnosis. The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists and CDC have recently provided an updated case definition that is more specific and aligned with the evolving knowledge of this syndrome.MIS-C primarily affects children and young adults up to 21 years of age, and presents as persistent fever, elevated inflammatory markers, evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (or history of close contact with infected individuals) and multisystem organ involvement (at least two systems) with no alternative plausible diagnosis, requiring hospital admission. Management largely focuses on supportive care, including fluid resuscitation, inotropic and respiratory support as needed and immunomodulation, which includes steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG).

### Manifestations of toxic shock syndrome in children, Columbus, Ohio, USA, 2010–2017 [^3aac4698]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Data from published literature illustrate the importance of prompt recognition of TSS and early treatment (,–). Complementary treatment with clindamycin improves the survival of patients with STSS by reducing toxin release (,–). Although IVIg is suggested as a possible adjunctive agent, published patient outcomes have varied. IVIg functions by inhibiting T-cell activation that would result in decreased cytokine release, down-regulation of adhesion molecules, chemokine and chemokine-receptor expression, and neutralization of superantigens. In some studies, IVIg did not show significant benefit in treatment of patients with STSS. One report that pooled 5 studies of clindamycin and IVIg treatment for STSS showed the death rates decreased from 33.7% to 15.7%. We did not identify significant differences in hospitalization rates and duration of mechanical ventilation among patients treated with or without IVIg. Fewer than half the patients in our study received clindamycin and IVIg. Similarly, only 50%–67% of patients with severe GAS infection have received clindamycin. Our results suggest that the lack of appropriate treatment may be associated with absence of rash at the time of presentation. In our study, in STSS patients without rash, sepsis alone was often diagnosed, and the patients were not treated with clindamycin or IVIg. These patients also experienced delays in diagnosis and had longer hospital stays than those with a rash.

### Menstrual toxic shock syndrome: a French nationwide multicenter retrospective study [^28ba3b12]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Studies describing the clinical features and short-term prognosis of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for menstrual toxic shock syndrome (m-TSS) are lacking.

Methods

This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients with a clinical diagnosis of m-TSS admitted between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2020 in 43 French pediatric (n = 7) or adult (n = 36) ICUs. The aim of the study was to describe the clinical features and short-term prognosis, as well as to assess the 2011 Centers for Disease and Control (CDC) diagnostic criteria, in critically ill patients with m-TSS.

Results

In total, 102 patients with m-TSS (median age, 18 years; interquartile range, 16–24 years) were admitted to 1 of the participating ICUs. All blood cultures (n = 102) were sterile. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus grew from 92 of 96 vaginal samples. Screening for superantigenic toxin gene sequences was performed for 76 of the 92 vaginal samples positive for S. aureus (83%), and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 was isolated from 66 strains (87%). At ICU admission, no patient met the 2011 CDC criteria for confirmed m-TSS, and only 53 (52%) fulfilled the criteria for probable m-TSS. Eighty-one patients (79%) were treated with antitoxin antibiotic therapy, and 8 (8%) received intravenous immunoglobulins. Eighty-six (84%) patients required vasopressors, and 21 (21%) tracheal intubation. No patient required limb amputation or died in the ICU.

Conclusions

In this large multicenter series of patients included in ICUs for m-TSS, none died or required limb amputation. The CDC criteria should not be used for the clinical diagnosis of m-TSS at ICU admission.

### Toxic shock syndrome post open reduction and kirschner wire fixation of a humeral lateral condyle fracture [^ec006429]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Use of Kirschner wires (K-wires) is the most common method of fracture stabilisation in lateral condyle fracture fixation in children. We report a case of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) following an open reduction and internal fixation using K-wires for a humeral lateral condyle fracture in a 5-year-old girl. TSS is a toxin-mediated multisystem illness. It typically presents with shock and it is most often attributed to toxin-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. It can lead to multiorgan failure and, ultimately, death. It is important to be aware of TSS, as it can present within any setting. Patients often have non-specific symptoms and their condition can worsen rapidly. TSS postorthopaedic surgery is rare; however, due to the serious nature of this disease, it is important to promptly recognise and diagnose TSS, and to ensure appropriate treatment is started without delay.

### Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome [^92d7d1d7]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Perhaps more noteworthy than the emergence of Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (StrepTSS) is its persistence for a period of more than 15 years in most geographical areas and an actual increase in incidence in some regions. Early diagnosis remains a problem, and aggressive surgery often cannot be avoided. The continuing rates of mortality and morbidity indicate the need for novel approaches to diagnosis and treatment.

### Evaluation of surveillance methods for staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome [^9f6a6b0d]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

We found it useful to add regular ICD-9 code searches for TSS-specific codes as an active surveillance adjunct to our passive surveillance system. This addition increases sensitivity of TSS surveillance with a minimal increase in resources. Use of this more sensitive system increases the ability to detect trends in TSS, which may develop because of changes in bacterial virulence characteristics, host characteristics such as the use of new devices or products, changes in human behavior, or changes in host susceptibility. Evaluation of this approach in other areas to assess sensitivity of TSS surveillance would be useful because coding practices may differ.

### Early and definitive diagnosis of toxic shock syndrome by detection of marked expansion of T-cell-receptor VBeta2-positive T cells [^50e56118]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a severe illness caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, usually during menstruation but also in the postpartum period. S. aureus produces several superantigenic exotoxins, including TSS toxin-1 (TSST-1), which activate a vast number of T cells in a T-cell-receptor Vβ-selective manner. Cytokines produced by T cells and activated by TSST-1 are thought to cause the abnormal changes of TSS. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of peripheral blood T cells from adults with TSS has shown a protracted expansion of TSST-1–reactive Vβ2-positive T cells persisting for 4–5 weeks. TSS in neonates, referred to as neonatal TSS-like exanthematous disease, has been shown by flow cytometric analysis to involve an expansion of T-cell–receptor Vβ2-positive T cells.

Because many cases do not satisfy the strict diagnostic criteria for TSS proposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, revised clinical diagnostic criteria for TSS, including probable cases, have been proposed (Table). In Japan, several clinicians have described a TSS-like clinical entity that could not be diagnosed as TSS even according to the revised criteria.

Table
Laboratory data on admission of case-patients

We report two cases of TSS with puerperal infection that could be diagnosed at the early stage of the clinical course by detecting a marked expansion of T-cell–receptor Vβ2-positive T cells, as measured by flow cytometric analysis. The symptoms of one patient were too complex to permit diagnosis according to the clinical criteria without evaluation of the TSST-1-reactive T cells. We discuss the role of T-cell analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the diagnosis of TSS.

### Clinical and molecular epidemiology of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome in the United Kingdom [^78b57801]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS) was originally described in menstruating women and linked to TSS toxin 1 (TSST-1)-producing Staphylococcus aureus. Using UK national surveillance data, we ascertained clinical, molecular and superantigenic characteristics of TSS cases. Average annual TSS incidence was 0.07/100,000 population. Patients with nonmenstrual TSS were younger than those with menstrual TSS but had the same mortality rate. Children < 16 years of age accounted for 39% of TSS cases, most caused by burns and skin and soft tissue infections. Nonmenstrual TSS is now more common than menstrual TSS in the UK, although both types are strongly associated with the tst+ clonal complex (CC) 30 methicillin-sensitive S. aureus lineage, which accounted for 49.4% of all TSS and produced more TSST-1 and superantigen bioactivity than did tst+ CC30 methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains. Better understanding of this MSSA lineage and infections in children could focus interventions to prevent TSS in the future.

### Evaluation of surveillance methods for staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome [^96e898e3]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a severe illness associated with toxin-producing Staphylococcus aureus. First named in 1978, TSS has been associated with tampon use, intravaginal contraceptive devices, and skin infections, particularly after surgical procedures. In January 1980, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) initiated surveillance for TSS with active and passive components. The national incidence of TSS decreased during 1980–1996 after removal of high-absorbency tampons from the market and public awareness campaigns. In subsequent years, surveillance methods in Minnesota were changed to a solely passive surveillance system that relied on clinicians to report cases. MDH uses the 1997 case definition of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Atlanta, GA, USA) to determine case criteria for any probable TSS case (> 4 clinical criteria and laboratory criteria) considered reportable (Table 1). Given the complexity of the case definition, we suspected that TSS underreporting was likely.

Table 1
Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome case definitions*

*From the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
†Involving > 3 organ systems.

Recently, several factors, including increasing prevalence of community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus that carries superantigens and the trend toward earlier menarche, suggested that the incidence of TSS might be increasing. Additionally, the number of requests for superantigen testing in the Minneapolis–St. Paul (MSP) area made to a reference microbiology laboratory that tests staphylococcal isolates from TSS cases increased during 2000–2003. To determine the incidence of TSS, active surveillance was initiated at all MSP area hospitals using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9), codes assigned at hospital discharge. We compared passive surveillance reports with ICD-9 codes to determine an effective and efficient surveillance method for TSS.

### Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal [^d65e5fdf]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.2 Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)

Cases of TSS have been reported by Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring users. TSS has been associated with tampons and certain barrier contraceptives, and, in some cases the Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring users were also using tampons. A causal relationship between the use of Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring and TSS has not been established. If a patient exhibits signs or symptoms of TSS, consider the possibility of this diagnosis and initiate appropriate medical evaluation and treatment.

5.3 Liver Disease

Impaired Liver Function

Do not use Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring in women with liver disease such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of the liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of CHC use until markers of liver function return to normal and CHC causation has been excluded [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Discontinue Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring use if jaundice develops.

Liver Tumors

Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with CHC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases per 100,000 CHC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long term (> 8 years) CHC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in CHC users is less than one case per million users.

### Clinical and molecular epidemiology of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome in the United Kingdom [^ea33f644]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

We provide a substantive national clinical and microbiological overview of staphylococcal TSS cases in the United Kingdom. TSS incidence was 0.07/100,000 population, nmTSS cases now outnumber mTSS cases, and nmTSS affects younger persons. The tst -positive CC30 S. aureus lineage was linked strongly with TSS and almost all mTSS cases. CC30 MSSA is a prevalent lineage in the United Kingdom, so ongoing surveillance and clinical vigilance for TSS are important.

Our findings may underestimate TSS incidence because notification of TSS is voluntary in the United Kingdom and we included only microbiologically confirmed cases. These factors increase diagnostic confidence, but TSS is a syndromic condition not requiring bacteriological confirmation. Overall TSS incidence was low but similar to rates in the United States; improvements in care may account for low overall incidence of TSS, because patients may not fulfill all of the criteria required by the case definition of TSS. The overall TSS incidence in children contrasts with findings from a British Pediatric Surveillance Unit study in which a higher incidence of combined streptococcal and staphylococcal TSS cases was reported.

The number of cases of mTSS fell from 2009 to 2012, such that nmTSS cases are now more common than mTSS cases, mirroring US trends. Patients in our study were younger than in US cohorts, and nmTSS patients were younger than those with mTSS. Most nmTSS cases occurred in children, with burns and SSTIs as the cause in 51.8% (29/56) of these cases. An association between nmTSS and increased mortality rate has been reported, although a high incidence of bacteremia may have affected the findings of that study. It is possible that we did not ascertain all cases of TSS, although we found no difference in reported deaths between mTSS and nmTSS cases or associations with age; the overall death rate was 5%.

### Infectious shock and toxic shock syndrome diagnoses in hospitals, Colorado, USA [^c65f065b]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Martin et al. reported that the incidence of septic shock increased from 1979 through 2000 in the United States. Using similar methods, we showed an increase in infectious shock in Colorado from 1993 through 2006 and estimated that the diagnosis of TSS accounted for as much as 27% of all cases of infectious shock. The TSS-specific incidence attributed to S. aureus has remained relatively constant in Colorado, although TSS attributed to S. pyogenes appears to be increasing. The latter has been noted in other studies as well. The observation that TSS accounts for a substantial proportion of all infectious shock is of clinical importance because TSS may respond to therapies (e.g. clindamycin, intravenous immune globulin, steroids) not ordinarily used for septic shock caused by other organisms, with more favorable outcomes as evidenced by significantly lower case-fatality rates for TSS noted in our study. For the current study period of 1993–2006, < 20% of cases with a specific ICD-9-CM diagnosis of TSS (presumed staphylococcal) were reported to the state's passive surveillance system. Passive surveillance systems may be of limited use if reported cases are not numerous enough to track trends. Our data show that the estimated incidence for staphylococcal TSS has not decreased significantly in Colorado since 1980. Data recently published using similar methods also reported stable TSS incidence.

Our methods have important limitations. Our chart validation of coded definitions demonstrated reasonable sensitivity and positive predictive value for TSS-specific and possible TSS codes at a single institution; however, discharge coding among institutions is not necessarily consistent or precise and can result in ascertainment errors when applied to larger discharge populations. The TSS-specific code definition most likely underestimates the true incidence of less severe disease variants. Discharge databases contain little additional data that would facilitate risk factor assessment.

With these limitations, our results suggest that surveillance of TSS with a hospital discharge database provides significantly more sensitive case ascertainment than conventional passive reporting. Electronic definitions that use population-based databases could improve identification of TSS cases with a better understanding of its epidemiology. Given the clinical and management differences between shock caused by TSS, S. aureus, S. pyogenes, and other organisms, it is important to recognize TSS as a common cause of infectious shock in persons of both sexes and all ages.

### Toxic shock syndrome surveillance in UK children [^20bc49ae]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an acute toxin-mediated illness caused by toxin-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. There is no recent data regarding incidence, management and mortality of TSS in UK children.

Methods

Consultants from paediatric and burns units in the UK and Ireland, reported cases of TSS seen between November 2008 and December 2009, via the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit. Respondents were sent questionnaires requesting detailed information about TSS cases. Established criteria were used to divide cases into staphylococcal or streptococcal TSS.

Results

Forty-nine cases were identified overall; 29 cases of streptococcal TSS (18 confirmed and 11 probable) and 20 cases of staphylococcal TSS (15 confirmed and 5 probable). The incidence of TSS children in the UK & the Republic of Ireland was calculated to be 0.38 per 100000 children. Children with staphylococcal TSS were older than those with streptococcal TSS (9.5 vs 3.8years; p < 0.003). Paediatric intensive care facilities were used for 78% of cases (invasive ventilatory support 69%; inotropic support 67%; haemofiltration 12%). Agents with antitoxin effects were underused; clindamycin 67%, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 20%, fresh frozen plasma 40%. There were eight deaths, all in the streptococcal group (28% of streptococcal cases)-none were given IVIG.

Conclusions

Streptococcal TSS was as frequent as staphylococcal TSS, contrasting with previous literature. Children with streptococcal TSS had a higher mortality than those with staphylococcal TSS (28% vs 0%; p < 0.05). Recommended immunomodulatory agents (IVIG and clindamycin) were underused. This study highlights the need for a guideline to improve management of TSS in children.

### High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin versus albumin 4% in paediatric toxic shock syndrome: a randomised controlled feasibility study [^a318d9d6]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a rare disease responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IG) therapy in paediatric TSS could improve shock and organ failure, but more consistent efficacy and safety data are needed. Our objective was to determine whether a randomised clinical trial (RCT) assessing intravenous IG in TSS in children is feasible.

Methods

We performed a multicentre, feasibility, double-blind RCT assessing efficacy of high-dose intravenous IG versus albumin 4% (control group) within the first 12 hours of shock onset. Included patients were aged above 1 month and below 18 years with suspected TSS and septic shock. Feasibility was assessed by measuring inclusion rate, protocol compliance and missing data regarding death and the Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 (PELOD-2) Score. Other secondary clinical outcomes were evaluated during hospital stay, at 60 day and 1 year.

Results

28 patients, admitted in 6 paediatric intensive care units during 36 consecutive months and followed for 1 year, received the allocated treatment: 13 in intravenous IG group, 15 in control group. The median age was 10.6 years and the sex ratio was 1. Inclusion rate was above 50%, protocol deviations were below 30% and missing data regarding death and PELOD-2 Score below 10%. No difference concerning secondary clinical outcomes between groups was observed, and more adverse events were reported in the control group.

Conclusion

It seems to be feasible to conduct an RCT assessing intravenous IG efficacy and safety in paediatric TSS but must be realised internationally, with choice of a clinically relevant endpoint and a specific design in order to be realistic.

### Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring [^3c702a58]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.2 Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)

Cases of TSS have been reported by etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring users. TSS has been associated with tampons and certain barrier contraceptives, and, in some cases the etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring users were also using tampons. A causal relationship between the use of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring and TSS has not been established. If a patient exhibits signs or symptoms of TSS, consider the possibility of this diagnosis and initiate appropriate medical evaluation and treatment.

5.3 Liver Disease

Impaired Liver Function

Do not use etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring in women with liver disease such as acute viral hepatitis or severe (decompensated) cirrhosis of the liver [see Contraindications (4)]. Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of CHC use until markers of liver function return to normal and CHC causation has been excluded [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. Discontinue etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring use if jaundice develops.

Liver Tumors

Etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [see Contraindications (4)]. Hepatic adenomas are associated with CHC use. An estimate of the attributable risk is 3.3 cases per 100,000 CHC users. Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long term (> 8 years) CHC users. However, the attributable risk of liver cancers in CHC users is less than one case per million users.

### Probable enterotoxin-associated toxic shock syndrome caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis [^91c80f18]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

We describe a case of a toxic shock-like syndrome in a child, which was associated with Staphylococcus epidermidis instead of Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, the usual causes of toxic shock syndrome.

Case Presentation

The patient was an 8-year-old boy who developed a toxic shock syndrome-like illness, including fever, hypotension, and rash. The Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate was cultured from urine, but this organism was unavailable for toxin testing. Multiple blood cultures were negative. Instead, a highly novel assay was used on acute plasma from the patient which demonstrated the presence of the genes for superantigens, staphylococcal enterotoxins A, C, D, and E. Superantigens are the known causes of toxic shock syndrome.

Conclusions

Our study suggests strongly that Staphylococcus epidermidis was causing the TSS symptoms through the known Staphylococcus aureus superantigens. It is unknown how many other such patients exist; this should be explored. Of great importance is that PCR performed directly on blood plasma in the absence of microbial isolation could be used to demonstrate superantigen genes.

### Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and toxic shock syndrome after Tooth extraction [^68cf3233]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus may cause cutaneous and systemic infections such as staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) and toxic shock syndrome (TSS). Although exfoliative toxins A and B, which cause SSSS, and TSS toxin-1 may be produced by different strains of S aureus, the two syndromes rarely occur simultaneously. We describe a patient admitted to the intensive care department with an exfoliative generalized erythroderma, signs of shock, and biopsy specimen findings consistent with SSSS. This patient presented after a tooth extraction. Symptoms recurred after dismissal, and he was readmitted. Subsequent test results were positive for exfoliative toxin B and TSS toxin-1, suggesting concurrent SSSS and TSS. For patients with acute, exfoliative, generalized erythroderma, TSS and SSSS should be considered. Although rare, it is possible to see both syndromes present concurrently.

### Association of characteristics of tampon use with menstrual toxic shock syndrome in France [^7febc7a2]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an acute onset illness caused by Staphylococcus aureus strains that can produce superantigenic exotoxins, such as toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1). TSS is characterized by non-specific symptoms, such as fever, cutaneous signs (rash followed by desquamation), digestive disorders, myalgia, and hypotension. While TSS is often initially self-limited, it is a potentially serious disease that can rapidly lead to multiple-organ failure and death. TSS treatment requires early ICU involvement for fluid resuscitation and possible vasopressors, and intravenous antibiotics with anti-staphylococcal agents and with anti-toxinic antibiotic such as clindamycin.

TSS is subdivided into two major categories: non-menstrual TSS that occurs during the course of suppurative staphylococcal infections, and menstrual toxic shock syndrome (MTSS) that occurs in young women with vaginal colonization of TSST-1-producing S. aureus and who use tampons or other intra-vaginal devices.

MTSS received attention in the early 1980s, upon the description of cases and deaths among healthy women using tampons made of high-absorbency carboxymethylcellulose fibers. Following the removal of these specific tampons from the market and their replacement with tampons made of cellulose or cotton fibers, the implementation of mandatory labelling, and improved patient education, the annual MTSS incidence in the United States (US) decreased from 10 cases to approximately 1–3 cases per 100,000 menstruating women. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended the inclusion of instructions that limit wear-time per tampon to no more than 8 h and advise against the overnight use of tampons. There has been no active worldwide surveillance of this disease since 1986, making assessment of its incidence challenging. A study conducted in the US suggested that TSS incidence increased by 18% from 2002 to 2003. The same trend has been reported in France since 2003 by the Centre National de Reference des Staphylocoques (CNRS). However, no studies have investigated this apparent rise of MTSS, its potential reasons, or determinants.

### Infectious shock and toxic shock syndrome diagnoses in hospitals, Colorado, USA [^ece9661e]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Figure 1
Yearly rates of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification–coded infectious shock, Colorado, 1993–2006. Insert: cumulative proportion of cases. TSS, toxic shock syndrome; strep, streptococci; staph, staphylococci.

The ages and sexes of patients assigned codes for TSS-specific and possible TSS (staph) is shown in Figure 2. Most cases occurred in female patients 10–49 years of age (peak 10 −19 years). For both sexes, the proportion of cases was comparable for the < 10-year and > 49-year age groups.

Figure 2
Total TSS-specific and possible TSS codes associated with Staphylococcus aureus, Colorado, 1993–2006. TSS, toxic shock syndrome.

The crude population-based incidence for TSS-specific (staph) cases in patients 1–65 years of age averaged 0.64 per 100,000 (95% CI 0.59–0.70). For female patients 10–39 years of age, the incidence averaged 1.18 per 100,000 (95% CI 0.94–1.41). We compared the annual incidence for TSS-specific (staph) cases in Colorado during 1993–2006 (this study) with estimated incidences from 2 previously reported periods in Colorado using medical record review for 1970–1982 and 1987–1997. We found no significant difference in the annual incidence in female patients 10–39 years of age among the 3 periods (p = 0.134, analysis of variance).

Fifty-three case records (1.8% of total sample) of patients hospitalized during 1998–2006 at Children's Hospital Colorado were identified with TSS-specific, possible TSS, or infectious shock not TSS codes and available for independent, blinded review using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's staphylococcal and streptococcal TSS case definitions. Within this subset, our ICD-9-CM–based code definition for TSS-specific or possible TSS had a sensitivity of 86.5%, specificity of 75.0%, and positive predictive value of 88.9%.

### Infectious shock and toxic shock syndrome diagnoses in hospitals, Colorado, USA [^e69d107c]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Annual population-based incidences during 1993–2006 were calculated as cases per 100,000 persons by using extrapolated estimates of population by age interval and sex based on the US 1990 and 2000 censuses. Annual numbers of TSS cases reported to the State of Colorado were obtained from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and classified as either TSS associated with S. pyogenes (reporting began in 2000) or TSS (assumed otherwise to be associated with S. aureus infection).

Infectious shock incidence increased significantly from 1993 through 2006 (R² = 0.708, p < 0.001 by linear regression). Of the 2,861 hospitalized persons with infectious shock, those assigned TSS-specific codes accounted for 411 (14.4%), and possible TSS codes constituted 371 (13.0%) (Figure 1). Of the 782 TSS-specific and possible TSS cases, 121 (15.5%) had a diagnostic code related to S. pyogenes; the remaining 661 (84.5%) cases were assumed by default to be associated with S. aureus. Case-fatality rates were significantly lower (p < 0.001) for TSS-specific cases (5.6%) than for infectious shock, not TSS (29.3%). The incidence of TSS-specific (staph) cases did not change significantly from 1993 through 2006, whereas incidences for all other categories significantly increased. Beginning in 2000, an annual average of 54% (range 22%–100%) of TSS-specific (strep) and 16% (range 8%–26%) of TSS-specific (staph) cases were annually passively reported to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.

### A unilateral whiteout lung in child with multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19 due to SARS-CoV-2: one case report of a boy [^41b1087b]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

MIS-C patients, Kawasaki disease (KD), and Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) share a number of overlapping clinical characteristics but numerous clinical and investigative results are different and aid in differentiating these conditions. The median age of KD patients is often lower, mucocutaneous lesions and coronary artery anomalies are more common, and cardiac dysfunction and myocarditis are less common than MIS-C. Toxic shock syndrome was more abrupt and advanced more quickly than in MIS-C. It was identified by multisystem involvement involving three organ systems, typically renal involvement. Often, toxic shock syndrome does not involve myocardial failure like MIS-C. The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG has been a good indicator to identify MIS-C.

The typical chest radiographic findings in MIS-C are perihilar-peribronchial thickening, pleural effusions, bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities and consolidative airspace opacities. Lung opacities were usually bilateral. Our patient's chest radiograph and CT scan presented with asymmetrical rapidly progressive ground-glass and consolidative airspace opacities, mainly in the right lung, which is rare and unusual in the typical MIS-C. With a prior report from Winant AJ, et al. a radiograph of an 8-year-old girl who came with MIS-C, hypoxic respiratory failure, myocarditis, and acute kidney injury revealed an acute respiratory distress syndrome pattern with an asymmetric, right greater than left pattern. Other differential diagnosis should be concerned especially bacterial pneumonia or complication of MIS-C such as pulmonary embolism pulmonary edema which can present with unilateral lung consolidation. In this case, his CXR returned to normal in 3 days after treatment with anti-inflammatory medication along with no evidence of infection. Hyperinflammatory process could be the cause of his unilateral lung consolidation. Furthermore, rapid recovery of left ventricular systolic dysfunction in this patient suggests that his dysfunction might be from transient myocardial stunning secondary to systemic inflammation. A series of imaging helped us to assess the patient's condition and guided the diagnosis.

### Early and definitive diagnosis of toxic shock syndrome by detection of marked expansion of T-cell-receptor VBeta2-positive T cells [^6ed5d416]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

On day 3 after admission to the intensive care unit, an abscess was observed around the surgical wound. Bacteriologic tests showed that the vaginal discharge was positive for MRSA, and a preliminary diagnosis of TSS was made. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stained with antibodies to CD3, CD4, CD8, and T-cell-receptor–Vβ2 elements and examined for the percentage of Vβ2-positive T cells by a flow cytometer as described. Five hours after staining, a marked expansion of Vβ2-positive–T cells, unrelated to the CD4:CD8 ratio, was confirmed (Figure), indicating the definitive diagnosis of TSS in the early clinical course. Rash and desquamation, important clinical symptoms of TSS, did not develop. On day 7 after admission, the patient was discharged from the intensive care unit and entered the general ward. On day 17, intrapelvic abscess was incised and drained. Subsequently, her general condition improved. The percentage of Vβ2-positive–T cells decreased gradually over the course of 5 weeks (Figure). She has no long-term sequelae. MRSA isolated from this patient was later confirmed to be positive for TSST-1.

### Estradiol (estring) [^cbaf6a5c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Cases of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) have been reported in women using vaginal rings. Toxic shock syndrome is a rare but serious illness caused by a bacterial infection. Symptoms of TSS include fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, dizziness, faintness, or a sunburn-like rash on face and body.
Cases of the vaginal ring becoming attached to the vaginal wall, making ring removal difficult, have occurred. Some women have needed surgery to remove vaginal rings.
Cases of erosion (wearing away) and ulceration (holes) of the vaginal lining have also occurred. Symptoms of vaginal erosion and ulceration can include vaginal pain or soreness, vaginal bleeding, and redness, swelling, or scrapes in the vagina.
Cases of bowel obstruction have been reported.
Severe allergic reactions have been reported including skin rash, giant hives, swelling of the eyelids, face, lips, tongue or throat.

The most frequently reported side effect with ESTRING use is increased vaginal secretions. Many of these vaginal secretions are like those that occur normally prior to menopause and indicate that ESTRING is working. Vaginal secretions that are associated with a bad odor, vaginal itching, or other signs of vaginal infection are NOT normal and may indicate a risk or a cause for concern. Other side effects may include vaginal discomfort, abdominal pain, or genital itching.

### Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome erythroderma is associated with superantigenicity and hypersensitivity [^ab3769b1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS) has rarely been reported without rash and desquamation. This study describes a patient who met all criteria for TSS except erythroderma and desquamation. The associated staphylococcal superantigen was enterotoxin B. We demonstrate that erythroderma depends on preexisting T cell hypersensitivity amplified by superantigenicity.

### Structural and functional properties of antibodies to the superantigen TSST-1 and their relationship to menstrual toxic shock syndrome [^cb3e548f]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

Menstrual toxic shock syndrome (mTSS) is an acute febrile disease accompanied by hypotension and multiple organ involvement. Infection with Staphylococcus aureus producing the superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) vaginally is necessary; however, only a small fraction of those infected with TSST-1 producing bacteria actually develop mTSS, suggesting that host factors modulate disease susceptibility. Serum antibodies to the toxin protect against development of the syndrome, but not all antibodies can neutralize the toxin. We set out to determine whether risk of developing the syndrome is related to the absence of neutralizing antibody and if antibody isotypes influence the neutralization capacity. In healthy subjects, TSST-1-binding serum antibodies were exclusively of the IgG and IgM classes; however, toxin-neutralizing capacity was correlated to the TSST-1-specific IgG1 and IgG4 antibodies (r² = 0.88, p < 0.0001 and 0.33, p < 0.0086, respectively) but not with IgM antibodies. Specific IgA was not detectable. Compared to healthy matched controls who were colonized vaginally with S. aureus, IgG1 anti-TSST-1 antibodies and toxin neutralizing activity was lacking in all of the acute phases and in the majority of convalescent sera, suggesting that these patients may be incapable of generating TSST-1 neutralizing antibodies. These new findings support the hypothesis that host factors are important in the development of mTSS and that the anti-toxin isotype impacts antibody functionality.

### Probable enterotoxin-associated toxic shock syndrome caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis [^68f06ade]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a serious infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, with occasional cases associated with Groups B, C and G streptococci. Superantigens, which include toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), staphylococcal enterotoxin serotypes B and C, and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin serotypes A and C, are the major causes of TSS.

All menstrual TSS is caused by TSST-1, most likely because of its ability to easily penetrate mucosal surfaces. Staphylococcal enterotoxins B and C and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins A and C, as well as TSST-1, are associated with non-menstrual TSS.

Many coagulase-negative staphylococci have been examined for production of TSST-1. However, none so far has been found to be positive for either the protein or the tstH gene that encodes the toxin. However, occasionally coagulase-negative staphylococci produce enterotoxins. The FRI909 organism, used by many researchers studying staphylococcal enterotoxins, to produce large quantities of staphylococcal enterotoxin C, is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus. The production of staphylococcal enterotoxins by coagulase-negative staphylococci raises the possibility that non-menstrual TSS cases may be associated with such organisms. This study presents a case in a male patient consistent with coagulase-negative staphylococcal TSS.

### Evaluation of surveillance methods for staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome [^e4655ce9]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Of 7,414 hospitalizations with > 1 study code, 116 (1.6%) were assigned the TSS-specific code and were reviewed (Figure). Of the remaining 7,298 hospitalizations assigned > 1 nonspecific TSS code, 1,575 (21.6%) randomly selected hospitalizations were reviewed. Of these 1,691 hospitalizations, 55 had 5 or 6 criteria for TSS, of which 12 (22%) met the CDC case definition for streptococcal TSS, and 7 were non-MSP residents. The remaining 36 cases were probable or confirmed TSS. No cases from UNEX or death certificate searches met the TSS case definition. Of the 36 TSS cases, 17 (47%) were reported to MDH by passive surveillance. Thirty-one (86%) cases were found by using TSS-specific ICD-9 codes. Five cases were found by using non-TSS–specific ICD-9 codes. After adjusting for 20% random sampling for cases identified by non-TSS–specific codes, we identified the estimated number of cases by using non-TSS–specific codes to be 25. This analysis resulted in 56 estimated TSS cases identified in the surveillance area during 2000–2003 by using ICD-9 codes.

### Evaluation of surveillance methods for staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome [^2387e3d3]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The TSS-specific ICD-9 code search identified 31 of the 56 estimated TSS cases (sensitivity 55%, specificity 99%). Seventeen cases were reported to MDH by passive surveillance (sensitivity 30%, specificity 99.9%); all were coded with the TSS-specific code. The TSS-specific ICD-9 code search was more sensitive than passive surveillance (p = 0.0005, McNemar χ² = 12.25). Of those cases reported to MDH, more were likely to be associated with menstruation (14/17 vs. 5/19; p < 0.001) and to have had a positive test result for S. aureus (16/17 vs. 11/19; p = 0.01). Twenty-seven of 36 TSS cases detected had a bacterial culture positive for S. aureus. The 3 TSS cases with methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates were not reported to MDH. The positive predictive value of being a case among those coded with the TSS-specific code was 27% (31/116). In 68 of 116 cases that received the TSS-specific code, there was clinical suspicion of TSS, but these cases did not meet the clinical case definition (< 5 criteria): 10 were streptococcal TSS and 7 were in non-MSP residents. All 17 cases reported to MDH were detected through the ICD-9 code search.

The steps leading to key pathogenetic aspect of ANCA-associated vasculitis, such as lung nodules in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), onset of glomerulonephritis (GN) in experimental myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA models and the implications of carrying staphylococcal superantigens, such as toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (tsst-1), in GPA remain to be elucidated. The session 'Cellular and molecular mechanisms of disease (II)' was devoted to close some of these knowledge gaps and underlined that research in ANCA-associated vasculitis leads to more granular understanding of these complex diseases.

### Evaluation of surveillance methods for staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome [^3a9a46be]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The Study

The MSP area is composed of 7 counties with a population of 2,642,056 (2000 US Census) and 24 acute-care hospitals. Requests were sent to medical record departments of these hospitals for data on inpatients discharged from hospitals from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2003, whose medical records indicated > 1 of the select ICD-9 study codes. Medical records from all hospitalizations receiving the TSS-specific code (040.82 or 040.89) were reviewed (Figure), and a 20% random sample of medical records from hospitalizations that received > 1 nonspecific TSS study code (Table 2) from within each hospital was reviewed. Each medical record was reviewed for TSS case criteria and pertinent epidemiologic and clinical information. Additionally, death certificates assigned the ICD-10 code for TSS (A48.3) and cases from the Minnesota Unexplained Critical Illness and Death of Possible Infectious Etiology project (UNEX) during 2000–2003 were reviewed. TSS cases identified through ICD-9 code searches were compared with cases reported to MDH during 2000–2003. Data were analyzed with Stata version 9 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Statistical analyses included Pearson and McNemar χ² tests.

### On the use of prophylactic antibiotics in prevention of toxic shock syndrome [^8e58adfb]. Burns (2005). Low credibility.

No consensus exists among burn surgeons on the role of prophylactic antibiotics in prevention of toxic shock syndrome (TSS). We recently reported a series of 71 children admitted with burns to our burn unit. By Centres for Disease Control (CDC) criteria, six of these were 'definite' and four 'probable' cases of TSS. Prior to this report, none of our patients were given prophylactic antibiotics. Thereafter, prophylactic therapy was included in the management of children admitted to the burns unit. The aim of this study was to assess whether prophylaxis with a one off single dose of systemic antibiotics prevented the occurrence of TSS. Data were collected prospectively between 1 January and 31 December 2001, on all children admitted to the burns unit. Out of 50 children admitted to the burns unit, 39 received prophylactic antibiotics in the referring accident and emergency. Two of these became unwell but none fulfilled the CDC criteria. The remaining 11 patients were given antibiotics on admission out of which one child required direct admission to the intensive care unit with a working diagnosis of TSS. Retrospectively, his features did not conform to the CDC criteria. In conclusion, this study suggests that prophylaxis may prevent TSS in children.

Computed tomography (CT) scan identified the source of infection in one patient. At laparotomy, pelvic peritonitis and massive edema of the pelvic retroperitoneal tissue was found. The other patient had myonecrosis of the forearm necessitating amputation. Intra-operative cultures of tissue in each case yielded Streptococcus pyogenes, Group A. These patients were treated early with clindamycin and intensive supportive care as well as surgery, and both made a full recovery. Because of the necessity of early recognition of the varied presentation of these infections, the clinical features as well as essential interventions are emphasized. We review the pathophysiology of invasive Group A streptococcal infection to increase awareness of these uncommon but fulminant and often lethal infections.

### TSST-1 promotes colonization ofwithin the vaginal tract by activation of CD8T cells [^e442cf57]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Approximately one-third of the human population is thought to be chronically colonized by Staphylococcus aureus either on the skin or other mucosal surfaces including the nasal and vaginal tracts. However, colonization by S. aureus can become harmful when natural host defenses are weakened leading to numerous diseases ranging from superficial skin infections to life-threatening invasive conditions including bacteremia, endocarditis, and pneumonia.

Apart from a broad range of infections, S. aureus can also cause specific toxin-mediated diseases, including toxic shock syndrome (TSS), which is triggered by the bacterial superantigens (SAgs). SAgs are secreted exotoxins that short circuit the interaction between major histocompatibility class II (MHC-II) molecules and T-cell receptors (TCRs), which may lead to uncontrolled T-cell activation, excessive cytokine production, and systemic inflammation known as TSS. Staphylococcal TSS can be distinguished into two subgroups where the non-menstrual form can occur from essentially any S. aureus infection and can be caused by different SAgs; however, the menstrual form of TSS (mTSS) is usually related to the use of menstrual hygiene products, such as tampons, and occurs in women who are vaginally colonized by S. aureus that specifically produce the toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1). Nevertheless, little is known about how TSST-1 functions within the S. aureus life cycle.

*CHC = combination hormonal contraception

Pregnancy data based on actual duration of pregnancy in the reference studies. Based on a model assumption that pregnancy duration is nine months, the rate is 7 to 27 per 10,000 WY.

Several epidemiology studies indicate that third generation oral contraceptives, including those containing desogestrel (etonogestrel, the progestin in etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring, is the biologically active metabolite of desogestrel), may be associated with a higher risk of VTE than oral contraceptives containing other progestins. Some of these studies indicate an approximate two-fold increased risk. However, data from other studies have not shown this two-fold increase in risk.

Use of CHCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions, especially in women with other risk factors for these events. CHCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes). In general, the risk is greatest among older (> 35 years of age), hypertensive women who also smoke.

Use etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors.

5.2 Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)

Cases of TSS have been reported by etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring users. TSS has been associated with tampons and certain barrier contraceptives, and, in some cases the etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring users were also using tampons. A causal relationship between the use of etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring and TSS has not been established. If a patient exhibits signs or symptoms of TSS, consider the possibility of this diagnosis and initiate appropriate medical evaluation and treatment.

### Clinical and molecular epidemiology of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome in the United Kingdom [^e5707e59]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Among MSSA isolates, resistance rates to key antimicrobial drugs were similar to reported UK MSSA bacteremia isolates. Notably, teicoplanin resistance was detected, although rarely. This finding circumvents any need to change current recommendations for antimicrobial drugs for TSS that include a bactericidal cell wall inhibitor (e.g. β-lactamase–resistant antistaphylococcal) and protein-synthesis inhibitor (e.g. clindamycin) along with intravenous immunoglobulin for severe cases unresponsive to first-line therapy and source control. No vaccines are available to prevent TSS, although a recombinant TSST-1 variant vaccine has shown promise in a recent human clinical trial and was found to be safe and immunogenic.

The MRSA-TSS rate in this study was lower than rates in the United States, perhaps reflecting the low UK community-associated MRSA prevalence. All MRSA cases were nonmenstrual and mostly associated with recognized healthcare-associated MRSA clones, although we did not record the mode of acquisition. Only 1 CC30 MRSA (EMRSA-16) isolate caused TSS, even though CC30 is the main TSS-associated lineage; this finding mirrors the national decline in UK EMRSA-16 over time.

Isolates of tst -positive CC30 MSSA were more likely to produce TSST-1 in vitro and secreted almost 3 times more TSST-1 than did tst -positive CC30 MRSA isolates, which translated into a functional difference in superantigenic activity. We do not know whether such a difference would extend to the in vivo setting. Our study of TSST-1 production was limited by availability of clinical tst + CC30 strains; clinical TSS CC30 MSSA strains were therefore compared with clinical non-TSS CC30 MRSA strains and not to clinical TSS MRSA strains. Thus, more MSSA than MRSA strains were from the genital tract or from burns, potentially confounding phenotypic differences observed. Defining the precise comparator group for TSS CC30 MSSA isolates is challenging because of lack of TSS CC30 MRSA isolates and suitable non-TSS strains referred to PHE.

### Low level of TSST-1 antibody in burn patients with toxic shock syndrome caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^3807d4d8]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2014). Low credibility.

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nosocomial infection is a growing concern in both adult and pediatric patients. The reason why TSS appears in only some patients with MRSA infection remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed serial TSS toxin-1 (TSST-1) antibody in patients with burn injury to investigate the mechanisms of TSS caused by MRSA nosocomial infection. This study comprised of patients with burn injury in our burn care unit from September, 2010 to August, 2011. Serum samples were collected serially on admission, at 48 to 72 hours after injury, on the day MRSA infection appeared, and on the day MRSA infection resolved. TSST-1 antibody was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). TSS was diagnosed according to the criteria of the Centers for Disease Control. Serial serum samples were collected from 24 patients and nosocomial MRSA infection was detected in 12 patients. In these 12 patients, TSS occurred in five patients (TSS+ group) but did not occur in the other seven patients (TSS- group). TSST-1 antibody level was significantly lower in the TSS+ group than TSS- group on admission and on the day MRSA infection appeared. All patients in the TSS+ group received intravenous immune globulin when TSS was diagnosed, and no patients died of TSS. Patients suffering from TSS had a lower level of TSST-1 antibody than patients not suffering from TSS. Testing for TSST-1 antibody in the clinical setting might help to predict and prevent the appearance of TSS caused by nosocomial MRSA infection.

### Toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) antibody levels in Japanese children [^9b5cb9b2]. Burns (2010). Low credibility.

Children with burns have a greater risk of developing toxic shock syndrome (TSS) than adults. This risk is thought to be associated with colonisation by toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1)-producing Staphylococcus aureus in children with insufficient antibody titers. The diagnosis of TSS is difficult because, in the early stages, its signs and symptoms resemble those of other common childhood illnesses such as scarlet fever. If the condition is not treated promptly, the mortality rate is high. This study was designed to determine the titers of TSST-1 serum antibody in Japanese children, in order to prevent TSS and facilitate its early diagnosis. Between May 2006 and May 2007, we studied 119 patients who were treated in the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery of Kanazawa Medical University Hospital. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to test the level of the IgG antibody to TSST-1 in the patients' serum samples. The percentage of cases testing for TSST-1 antibody in the patients under 6 months old was 78.6%, and it was lowest (21.3%) in the age group from 6 to 12 months old. The group of patients older than 41 years showed the highest rate of positivity (100.0%) for TSST-1 antibody. Higher titers of TSST-1 antibody were found within the first 6 months after birth, and lower titers were found between 6 months and 2 years old. The titers began to increase again after age three. The high morbidity of TSS in children around 2 years of age was proven to be related to changes in the titers of TSST-1 antibody. Infants under 6 months old are protected from TSS because of the high level of TSST-1 antibody they receive from their mother. Children are at risk of developing staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome when their immune system is immature and they have no protective circulating anti-TSS antibodies.

### Toxic shock-like syndrome and COVID-19: multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) [^8e2a32bd]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Early reports of COVID-19 in pediatric populations emphasized a mild course of disease with severe cases disproportionately affecting infant and comorbid pediatric patients. After the peak of the epidemic in New York City, in late April to early May, cases of severe illness associated with COVID-19 were reported among mostly previously healthy children ages 5–19. Many of these cases feature a toxic shock-like syndrome or Kawasaki-like syndrome in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 positive diagnostic testing and the CDC has termed this presentation Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C). It is essential to disseminate information among the medical community regarding severe and atypical presentations of COVID-19 as prior knowledge can help communities with increasing caseloads prepare to quickly identify and treat these patients as they present in the emergency department. We describe a case of MIS-C in a child who presented to our Emergency Department (ED) twice and on the second visit was found to have signs of distributive shock, multi-organ injury and systemic inflammation associated with COVID-19. The case describes two ED visits by an 11- year-old SARS-CoV-2-positive female who initially presented with fever, rash and pharyngitis and returned within 48 hours with evidence of cardiac and renal dysfunction and fluid-refractory hypotension requiring vasopressors and PICU admission.

Many of these cases occurred after several weeks of quarantine, and it is possible that these subjects suffered from a mild form of COVID-19 after intrafamilial transmission and severe complications appeared weeks later, likely related to a dysregulated immune response. The temporal relationship between infection curves and reported cases would also be consistent with this hypothesis.

The presence of shock has led to analogies with KD shock syndrome. Toxic shock is a rare presentation of KD (1–2%), often inaugural and without the typical mucocutaneous symptoms, but toxic shock has also been associated for years with bacterial toxins, especially from streptococcus and staphylococcus, playing a role of superantigen with subsequent immunologic reaction similar to anaphylaxis. At present, little is known on the link between viral infection and shock syndrome. Of interest, a retrospective cohort of 1099 SARS-COV-2 confirmed patients in China reported 12 (1.1%) with shock syndrome, the direct role of the virus may, however, be only speculative, as these patients may have had coinfections suffered from treatment-related anaphylactic reactions.

### Refractory septic shock: our pragmatic approach [^a7c1810f]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Despite timely intervention, there exists a small subgroup of patients with septic shock who develop progressive multi-organ failure. Seemingly refractory to conventional therapy, they exhibit a very high mortality. Such patients are often poorly represented in large clinical trials. Consequently, good evidence for effective treatment strategies is lacking. In this article, we describe a pragmatic, multi-faceted approach to managing patients with refractory septic shock based on our experience of toxin-mediated sepsis in a specialist referral centre. Many components of this strategy are inexpensive and widely accessible, and so may offer an opportunity to improve outcomes in these critically ill patients.

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) may be mediated by superantigen-activated T cells, a theory we tested in rabbits, which are more susceptible to the lethal effects of superantigens, such as TSS toxin-1 (TSST-1), than are mice. Rabbits exposed to 10 cGy of total body irradiation exhibited T cell deficiency, with profound depletion of splenic lymphocytes and circulating CD4(+) lymphocytes, as well as an inability to manifest delayed-type hypersensitivity. Nevertheless, these rabbits remained completely susceptible to TSST-1, indicating that TSS can occur in the setting of marked immunosuppression.

Supportive treatment for the critically ill patients

NSTIs can present with a fulminant course and may be associated with great morbidity and high case-fatality rates, especially when they occur in conjunction with toxic shock syndrome.

Aggressive treatment of the underlying organ dysfunction is an essential component of improving patient outcome. Physiologic support including close invasive monitoring in an intensive care unit setting and aggressive resuscitation are often necessary in necrotizing infections.

Soft tissue infections in immunocompromised patients

SSTIs in immunocompromised patients can be challenging as they can be caused by unusual microorganisms. SSTIs in immunocompromised patients may progress rapidly, then becoming life threatening and are more difficult to eradicate with antibiotics alone, in the absence of an intact immune system. Additionally, fungal SSTI infections are more common in immunocompromised populations.

There are few studies on immunocompromised patients with soft-tissue infections.

A single-institution retrospective cohort study evaluating immunocompromised patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections was recently published.

In this study immunodeficiency was defined by corticosteroid use, active malignancy, receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy, diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus or AIDS, or prior solid organ or bone marrow transplantation with receipt of chronic immunosuppression.

Immunocompromised patients with NSTIs were associated with delays in diagnosis and surgical treatment and with higher in-hospital mortality. At presentation, immunocompromised patients failed to exhibit typical clinical and laboratory signs of NSTIs. The authors concluded that physicians caring for such patient populations should maintain a higher level of suspicion for necrotizing soft tissue infections and consider early surgical evaluation and treatment.

### TSST-1 promotes colonization ofwithin the vaginal tract by activation of CD8T cells [^80e7330d]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

Toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) is a superantigen produced by Staphylococcus aureus and is the determinant of menstrual toxic shock syndrome (mTSS); however, the impact of TSST-1 on the vaginal environment beyond mTSS is not understood. Herein, we assessed how TSST-1 affects vaginal colonization by S. aureus, host inflammatory responses, and changes in microbial communities within the murine vagina. We demonstrated that TSST-1 induced a CD8 + T-cell-dependent inflammatory response in 24 h that correlated with S. aureus persistence within the vaginal tract. This increase was due to superantigen-dependent T-cell activation that triggered a change in microbial composition within the vaginal tract. Altogether, this study demonstrates that within the vaginal tract, TSST-1 modulates the vaginal microbiota to favor the survival of S. aureus in the absence of mTSS. IMPORTANCEToxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) is a superantigen toxin produced from Staphylococcus aureus that causes the menstrual form of toxic shock syndrome. This research demonstrates that TSST-1 also has a wider function within the vaginal tract than previously expected. We show that TSST-1, by activating CD8 + T cells, induces an inflammatory environment that modifies the vaginal microbiota to favor colonization by S. aureus. These are important findings as S. aureus can colonize the human vaginal tract efficiently and subsequently trigger dysbiosis within the microbial communities leading to several adverse outcomes such as decreased fertility, increased risks for sexually transmitted diseases, and issues related to pregnancy and birth.

### Phenotypic classification of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children using latent class analysis [^fa43f385]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

MIS-C case finding potentially captures a range of conditions because presentation shares clinical features with other conditions, including acute COVID-19, Kawasaki disease, and toxic shock syndrome, which may complicate timely diagnosis and treatment. Clinical severity (including the occurrence of shock, intensive care unit [ICU] admission, and death) can also vary substantially, and understanding of risk factors for severe disease remains incomplete.

This heterogeneity in presentation and clinical severity suggests the existence of phenotypic classes of MIS-C, as has been documented for other conditions, including acute respiratory distress syndrome. Characterizing these classes could improve understanding of MIS-C pathophysiology, guide subgroup analyses in clinical trials of therapeutic options, and support refinement of case definitions and epidemiologic surveillance. Previous studies have used latent class analysis (LCA) and other algorithms to characterize the spectrum of MIS-C presentation. These analyses have informed MIS-C case definition updates and highlighted how statistical models can help interpret MIS-C heterogeneity, but have been limited in sample size and geographic representativeness. Additionally, some prior studies, have aggregated input clinical data into broad organ system categories, which loses information on both severity and number of symptoms affecting organ systems.

The landscape of MIS-C incidence, surveillance, and treatment has changed considerably since SARS-CoV-2 first emerged, highlighting the need for an updated categorization of MIS-C phenotypic clusters. Overall incidence of MIS-C has decreased as new SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged, but increases in MIS-C cases can still occur after surges in COVID-19 transmission. In this study, we apply statistical clustering methods to the largest cohort of US MIS-C cases to date to systematically characterize MIS-C phenotypic clusters and investigate their association with clinical severity.

### Early intravenous immunoglobulin therapy for group A β-haemolytic streptococcal meningitis with toxic shock syndrome [^57f22163]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A woman in her forties was transferred to a Sydney (Australia)-based tertiary hospital, following presentation to a regional hospital with group A Streptococcus (GAS) otomastoiditis; complicated by meningitis, venous sinus thrombosis, haemorrhagic cerebral infarction and subdural empyema. She rapidly deteriorated with profound cardiovascular collapse. Despite initiation of high dose vasoactive therapy, she remained shocked and developed multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. Early intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (140g in two doses) was initiated as an adjunct to antimicrobial, surgical and supportive care for refractory streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Over the course of a twelve-day intensive care unit stay she made good progress with de-escalation of her vasoactive supportive care and reversal of her organ injuries. She was subsequently discharged to ward-based care. At her three-month follow-up appointment she had significantly reduced neurological deficit. Five months following her presentation to hospital she had returned to full-time work.

### Polyclonal V β ₂ 1.3 expansion in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children despite SARS-CoV-2 vaccination [^971e633d]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Finally, the clinical presentation of MIS-C partially overlaps with other hyperinflammatory syndromes such as toxic shock syndrome. The latter is caused by an exacerbated cytotoxic adaptive immune response triggered on the binding of bacterial superantigens in a non-specific manner to T cell receptors and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Such immune triggering in an MHC-unrestricted manner causes massive polyclonal T cell activation and cytokine release. Previous computational models have suggested structure and sequence homology of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein with the bacterial superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B that holds a high-affinity motif for binding T cell receptors as an explanation for the cytokine storm that leads to multiorgan dysfunction in MIS-C.

In addition to the expanded Vβ21.3+ T cells, some of the breakthrough MIS-C patients had expansions of other Vβ subsets as well. This was most notably seen in P5, who showed Vβ17 expansion as well. While a toxin-related immune reaction — such as that induced by staphylococcal enterotoxin B, which typically drives Vβ17 expansion — cannot be definitively excluded, similar expansions of different Vβ subsets have been reported by othersand are not consistently observed in all (breakthrough) MIS-C patients. Therefore, they are likely non-specific, in contrast to the Vβ21.3+ signature typical for MIS-C, or Vβ2+ expansion typically seen in toxic shock syndrome, which we did not observe in any of our breakthrough MIS-C patients (figure 2).

The clinical cases presented in the current study indicate that potentially life-threatening breakthrough MIS-C in SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated patients seems unlikely to be related to in vivo superantigenic properties of the spike protein. We did not find any association with classical HLA alleles, consistent with our previous study. Although an incomplete seroconversion following prior vaccination may be related to the MIS-C presentation as the consequence of a mild breakthrough infection, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels during presentation are not suggestive of these lines of thinking. Other as yet elusive components and virus-related mechanisms to trigger the selective Vβ T cell expansion in MIS-C should be considered.

### Review of cardiac involvement in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children [^6d0a92fa]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with substantial cardiovascular implications. Although infection with SARS-CoV-2 is usually mild in children, some children later develop a severe inflammatory disease that can have manifestations similar to toxic shock syndrome or Kawasaki disease. This syndrome has been defined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Although the prevalence is unknown, > 600 cases have been reported in the literature. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children appears to be more common in Black and Hispanic children in the United States. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children typically occurs a few weeks after acute infection and the putative etiology is a dysregulated inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Persistent fever and gastrointestinal symptoms are the most common symptoms. Cardiac manifestations are common, including ventricular dysfunction, coronary artery dilation and aneurysms, arrhythmia, and conduction abnormalities. Severe cases can present as vasodilatory or cardiogenic shock requiring fluid resuscitation, inotropic support, and in the most severe cases, mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Empirical treatments have aimed at reversing the inflammatory response using immunomodulatory medications. Intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, and other immunomodulatory agents have been used frequently. Most patients recover within days to a couple of weeks and mortality is rare, although the medium- and long-term sequelae, particularly cardiovascular complications, are not yet known. This review describes the published data on multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, focusing on cardiac complications, and provides clinical considerations for cardiac evaluation and follow-up.

### Therapeutic plasma exchange as rescue therapy in severe sepsis and septic shock: retrospective observational single-centre study of 23 patients [^6a73ea54]. BMC Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

A comparison of survivors and non-survivors of septic shock might help in the decision when to consider rescue TPE therapy in septic shock. Survivors were felt to be younger, to display higher procalcitonin values, to present at an earlier stage of MOF, to have more plasma volume exchanged, and to receive TPE earlier, although this was not significant due to small patient numbers. The latter observation would be supported by earlier data suggesting that earlier TPE might improve outcome, whereas PE performed > 40 h after presentation is unlikely to be useful in severe septic vasoplegia. Additionally, the high prevalence of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome among survivors might indicate that this entity is particularly amenable to TPE therapy.

We are aware of several important limitations of our study: i) The small patient number and the retrospective observational design are due to the fact that there is only a small window of therapeutic opportunity in fulminant septic shock. Even at a university hospital the minority of such patients are admitted in the very acute phase of overwhelming sepsis where TPE might exert beneficial effects. ii) We presented single-centre data because TPE is far from being established as rescue therapy for septic shock even between tertiary care hospitals, and TPE algorithms and technologies used differ. iii) By analyzing consecutive TPEs instituted for septic shock, we tried to minimize patient selection bias. Still, TPE effects might have been underestimated by including patients with irreversible multiple organ failure. iv) Rescue TPE was instituted on the basis of individual team decisions instead of pre-defined start and stop criteria. Although not significant, those who died received fewer TPEs. It is therefore possible that under-dosing might have lead to underestimation of the efficacy of rescue TPE. v) When analysing the hemodynamic effects of TPE, we focused on the first TPE session, because 10 of our patients (44%) received only one TPE procedure, and we felt that there were too many confounders in this extremely ill patients during the following TPE sessions. This might have underestimated the observed treatment effect.

### Hypotension in severe dimethoate self-poisoning [^dd34a911]. Clinical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute self-poisoning with the organophosphorus (OP) pesticide dimethoate has a human case fatality three-fold higher than poisoning with chlorpyrifos despite similar animal toxicity. The typical clinical presentation of severe dimethoate poisoning is quite distinct from that of chlorpyrifos and other OP pesticides: many patients present with hypotension that progresses to shock and death within 12–48 h post-ingestion. The pathophysiology of this syndrome is not clear.

Case reports

We present here three patients with proven severe dimethoate poisoning. Clinically, all had inappropriate peripheral vasodilatation and profound hypotension on presentation, which progressed despite treatment with atropine, i.v. fluids, pralidoxime chloride, and inotropes. All died 2.5–32 h post-admission. Continuous cardiac monitoring and quantification of troponin T provided little evidence for a primary cardiotoxic effect of dimethoate.

Conclusion

Severe dimethoate self-poisoning causes a syndrome characterized by marked hypotension with progression to distributive shock and death despite standard treatments. A lack of cardiotoxicity until just before death suggests that the mechanism is of OP-induced low systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Further invasive studies of cardiac function and SVR, and post-mortem histology, are required to better describe this syndrome and to establish the role of vasopressors and high-dose atropine in therapy.

Spinal shock duration and clinical markers of resolution — course and reflex findings — note that spinal shock can persist from days to weeks and may be prolonged by toxic or septic syndromes; there is a lack of consensus to define its end, and clinicians may interpret resolution by the appearance of the bulbocavernosus reflex occurring within several days of injury, the return of deep tendon reflexes which can take several weeks, or the return of reflexive bladder function, while for most patients the end is seen with early return of the deep plantar reflex and progressive recovery of the bulbocavernosus, cremasteric, ankle jerk, Babinski sign, and knee jerk; spared distal sacral reflexes such as the bulbocavernosus and anal wink can occur yet should not be confused with sacral sparing, as patients with a complete SCI lack sacral sensation.

### Comparison of laboratory and hemodynamic time series data across original, alpha, and delta variants in patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children [^dde8ba05]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiological presentation of severe cases of MIS-C has been that of distributive shock with multiple organ failure. Children in our cohort experienced cardiac involvement, including elevated troponin, depressed cardiac function, and occasionally dilated coronary arteries. Children in our cohort demonstrated improvement in cardiac function following anti-inflammatory therapies, suggesting immunologic/inflammatory insult resulting in cardiac involvement, similar to that reported in previously published case series. This trend to resolution over 3–5 days from presentation, which is similar between different epochs, could help clinicians anticipate a timeline for recovery, allowing them to identify patients with a tendency for prolonged critical illness based on a lack of rapid recovery of hemodynamic and laboratory parameters. Future studies are needed to determine the correlation between the rate of change of laboratory and hemodynamic markers of cardiac injury and time to myocardial recovery.

Although the exact pathophysiology is still unknown, MIS-C is likely to be a consequence of postinfectious immune dysregulation. Our study found significantly higher initial levels of ferritin, CRP, and procalcitonin associated with patients requiring ICU admission on presentation. The ensuing systemic hyperinflammatory state, along with the clinical manifestation of associated hemodynamic instability, has some similarities to KD shock syndrome. Yet, it also resembles the more innate immunity-driven process that approximates toxic shock syndrome. All clinical parameters improved with medical support and immunomodulatory therapies, though a few patients required mechanical circulatory support despite immunomodulator therapies. It is imperative to note that patients with slow resolution of inflammatory markers represent the most critically ill subgroup, with high likelihood of requiring hemodynamic support in the form of vasoactive and/or mechanical circulatory support.

### Typical and reverse Takotsubo syndromes as initial manifestations of consecutive addisonian crises in a 38-year-old patient: the heart has its reasons! [^ab2fc543]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We report an interesting case of a 38-year-old woman presenting with reverse Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) secondary to an Addisonian crisis, her second such episode. A few years prior, she had presented with typical TTS in the setting of Addisonian crisis; diagnostic work-up revealing Auto-Immune Polyglandular Syndrome Type II (APS II). We believe this to be the first case report of typical and variant phenotypes of TTS in a patient with APS II. The pathogenic link between these two conditions is explored. In patients presenting with Addisonian crises and refractory shock, the possibility of concurrent TTS should be considered. TTS muddies the diagnostic waters and poses therapeutic challenges as outlined.

### Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and outcomes of Streptococcus suis infection in humans [^b724d782]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

S. suis is mostly sensitive to penicillin; resistance was reported in only 2 patients. After cessation of antimicrobial drug treatment, infection relapsed in a small proportion of patients, including those for whom the organism tested highly sensitive to penicillin. The pooled relapse rate was 4.4% (Table 3).

### Clinical deterioration among patients with fever and erythroderma [^40fc357c]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Some children who present with fever and erythroderma have rapid clinical deterioration or progress to toxic shock syndrome. Our primary objective was to determine whether specific clinical features of those who present with fever and erythroderma can predict who will develop hypotension or progress to toxic shock syndrome. Our secondary objective was to describe the clinical presentation, course, and outcome of children with fever and erythroderma.

Methods

We conducted a medical chart review of children ≤ 19 years of age with fever and erythroderma who presented to an urban pediatric emergency department over 60 months. Historical, clinical, and laboratory data were abstracted from the medical chart.

Results

Fifty-six patients with fever and erythroderma were studied. Eighteen percent of patients presented with hypotension. Thirty-three percent of the remaining patients who were normotensive on arrival developed shock. Fifty-two percent of patients with hypotension required vasopressor support. The most important predictors of developing hypotension after presentation were: age ≥ 3 years, ill appearance, vomiting, glucose ≥ 110 mg/dL, calcium ≤ 8.6 mg/dL, platelets ≤ 300,000/microL, elevated creatinine, polymorphonuclear leukocytes ≥ 80%, and presence of a focal infection. Among all patients studied, 4 variables were determined to be the most important predictors of developing toxic shock syndrome: age ≥ 3 years, ill appearance, elevated creatinine, and hypotension on arrival.

Conclusions

Overall, 45% of patients with fever and erythroderma developed shock, including 33% of those who were normotensive on presentation. Older age, presence of vomiting, identification of a focal bacterial source, as well as specific laboratory parameters can be used to help predict which patients are likely to have hemodynamic deterioration. Given the high rate of clinical decompensation, all of the patients with fever and erythroderma should be hospitalized, closely monitored, and managed aggressively.

### Gemcitabine-induced chronic systemic capillary leak syndrome [^5acaef01]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Differential diagnosis

SCLS is under-recognised due to its rarity and non-specific presenting symptoms. Many patients presenting with hypotension are presumed to have septic shock and are treated with antibiotics and intravenous fluids. Unlike the hypotension associated with anaphylaxis, which usually resolves with administration of subcutaneous epinephrine, the hypotension in SCLS can be resistant to medications including vasopressors.

Congestive heart failure and nephrotic syndrome can present with anasarca but have associated findings of poor EF on echocardiogram and proteinuria on urinalysis, respectively. Our patient had a normal echocardiogram and urinalysis.

Adrenal insufficiency can also mimic SCLS with hypotension, diarrhoea and hypoalbuminaemia. Cortisol levels are typically low in these patients. Cortisol levels in our patient were normal on two separate occasions.

Pancreatic insufficiency secondary to pancreas surgery can lead to malabsorption and subsequent hypoalbuminaemia with resultant oedema. This is typically associated with diarrhoea and steatorrhoea, which our patient did not have. Further, our patient was on postoperative supplemental pancreatic enzymes.

Hereditary angioedema typically presents in adults with recurrent attacks of cutaneous and gastrointestinal oedema. It is due to deficiency or dysfunction of C1 inhibitor. Unlike the generalised oedema of SCLS, the cutaneous swelling of hereditary angioedema is usually localised.

Toxic shock syndrome presents with high fever, hypotension and rash. The presence of skin findings along with infection source and/or blood cultures will help distinguish toxic shock syndrome from SCLS.

Gleich syndrome is characterised by recurrent episodes of angioedema, urticaria, pruritus, fever, weight gain, oliguria and eosinophilia. Symptoms occur in cycles of 3–4 weeks and resolve spontaneously. Our patient did not exhibit features of this disease.
