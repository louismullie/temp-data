## Question

Is group b strep treated like strep throat

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether group B streptococcus (GBS) is treated the same as strep throat, which is caused by group A streptococcus (GAS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the organisms and their clinical significance. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approaches and when testing is indicated. Next, I will compare treatment indications, first-line agents, and durations. After that, I need to check special populations and public health implications. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer and highlight exceptions where management might overlap or be confused.

> Let me first confirm the organisms and their usual disease patterns. Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) is the classic cause of streptococcal pharyngitis ("strep throat") and is managed with antibiotics to shorten symptoms, reduce transmission, and prevent complications like acute rheumatic fever, with penicillin or amoxicillin as first-line therapy for about 10 days in nonallergic patients [^115H7z7h] [^112ACtFT] [^116JcF45]. Group B Streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae) is a different species that colonizes the vagina and rectum and is primarily a concern in pregnancy for neonatal disease prevention; it is not a recognized cause of streptococcal pharyngitis and is not treated for throat infections in nonpregnant individuals [^117BYWXd] [^115hesRQ].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach for suspected strep throat. For GAS pharyngitis, guidelines recommend using a validated clinical decision rule (e.g. Centor/McIsaac) and, if intermediate or high risk, obtaining rapid antigen testing, with confirmatory throat culture in children and adolescents when the RADT is negative; antibiotics are indicated only with a positive test or culture, and routine testing is not recommended when viral features predominate [^115dgucv] [^117FtXKa] [^113evtML]. Hold on, I should verify the role of PCR: NAAT/PCR is increasingly available and can replace culture in some algorithms, but it still detects carriage and should be interpreted in clinical context to avoid overtreatment [^1115y1k4] [^113t3sEg].

> I need to check whether GBS is ever a throat pathogen. Non–group A streptococci, including groups C and G, can occasionally cause pharyngitis and may present similarly to GAS, but GBS is not established as a cause of acute pharyngitis in immunocompetent hosts; thus, routine throat testing or treatment for GBS in nonpregnant patients with sore throat is not indicated [^114zJA4c] [^116FzKUh]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if GBS could colonize the oropharynx and mimic strep throat, but I should correct that: oropharyngeal colonization with GBS is uncommon and not associated with streptococcal pharyngitis, so testing the throat for GBS in a nonpregnant patient with sore throat would be inappropriate and misleading [^notfound].

> Next, I should review treatment indications and choices for GAS. Antibiotics are indicated for confirmed GAS pharyngitis to reduce symptom duration, transmission, and complications; penicillin or amoxicillin is first-line for 10 days in nonallergic patients, with alternatives such as a first-generation cephalosporin, clindamycin, or macrolides reserved for penicillin allergy, noting local macrolide resistance patterns and the inferior evidence base for macrolides in GAS [^115H7z7h] [^112ACtFT] [^117AKQRB]. I should double-check duration: although some studies explore shorter penicillin V courses, current guidelines still endorse 10 days as standard to maximize bacterial eradication from the pharynx [^115H7z7h] [^113CsrQF].

> Now, I will examine GBS management in its relevant clinical contexts. For pregnant patients, GBS screening at 35–37 weeks guides intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis with penicillin G or ampicillin to prevent early-onset neonatal GBS disease; this is a prevention strategy, not treatment of a maternal infection, and it is unrelated to strep throat management [^117BYWXd] [^115hesRQ]. For neonates and young infants, management is risk-based with empiric antibiotics when indicated, again distinct from strep throat care in older children and adults [^1116j2o2]. For nonpregnant adults, GBS is typically treated only when it causes invasive disease or significant infections such as bacteremia, endocarditis, or skin and soft tissue infection, using beta-lactams guided by susceptibilities, which is a different clinical problem than pharyngitis and does not involve throat-directed therapy [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm public health and stewardship implications. Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of viral pharyngitis drive unnecessary antibiotic use; rapid testing and adherence to clinical rules reduce inappropriate prescriptions without increasing complications, reinforcing that GAS testing and treatment should be targeted and that GBS has no role in routine sore throat evaluation [^113bY21x] [^116tu4mk] [^113t3sEg]. I need to ensure I emphasize that treating a nonpathogenic GBS throat isolate would expose patients to antibiotics without benefit and contribute to resistance, which is precisely why guidelines do not recommend testing for GBS in this setting [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize and answer the question directly. No, group B strep is not treated like strep throat. Strep throat is caused by group A streptococcus and warrants antibiotics when confirmed, whereas GBS is not a cause of streptococcal pharyngitis in nonpregnant hosts and should not be tested or treated for sore throat; GBS management pertains to maternal-neonatal prophylaxis and invasive disease, not to routine pharyngitis care [^115H7z7h] [^117BYWXd] [^116FzKUh]. I should confirm the bottom line: the organisms differ, the diseases differ, the diagnostic pathways differ, and the treatment indications differ, so conflating GBS with strep throat leads to misdirected testing and inappropriate antibiotic use [^115H7z7h] [^117BYWXd].

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is **not treated like strep throat** because it is a different bacterium with distinct clinical implications. Strep throat is caused by group A Streptococcus (GAS) and is treated with penicillin or amoxicillin to prevent complications and reduce transmission [^115H7z7h] [^112ACtFT]. GBS is a normal vaginal/rectal colonizer and is managed only in **pregnancy** with intrapartum antibiotics to prevent neonatal disease [^117BYWXd]; it is not a cause of pharyngitis and does not require treatment for throat infections. Antibiotics for GBS are reserved for confirmed invasive disease or colonization in pregnancy, not for routine throat infections [^115hesRQ].

## Clinical differences between GBS and strep throat

| **Feature** | **Group B Streptococcus (GBS)** | **Strep throat (GAS)** |
|-|-|-|
| Organism | Streptococcus agalactiae | Streptococcus pyogenes |
| Primary colonization site | Vagina and rectum | Oropharynx |
| Clinical significance | - Normal colonizer <br/> - Causes invasive disease in neonates, elderly, and immunocompromised | - Causes pharyngitis <br/> - Can lead to rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis |
| Transmission | - Vertical (mother to infant) <br/> - Rarely person-to-person | Person-to-person via respiratory droplets |
| Treatment indication | Intrapartum prophylaxis in pregnancy; invasive disease | Confirmed pharyngitis with antibiotics |

---

## Treatment of strep throat (GAS)

- **First-line antibiotics**: Penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days [^115H7z7h] [^112ACtFT].
- **Alternatives**: Cephalosporins, macrolides, or clindamycin for penicillin allergy [^115d74AE].
- **Rationale**: Reduces symptoms, transmission, and complications (e.g. rheumatic fever) [^1156fVtp].

---

## Treatment of GBS

- **Pregnancy**: Intrapartum penicillin G or ampicillin to prevent neonatal GBS disease [^115hesRQ].
- **Nonpregnant adults**: Antibiotics only for confirmed invasive GBS disease (e.g. bacteremia, endocarditis).
- **Not indicated**: Routine treatment for colonization or throat infections.

---

## Conclusion

GBS is **not treated like strep throat** because it is a different organism with different clinical roles. GBS is managed in pregnancy to prevent neonatal disease, whereas strep throat is treated with antibiotics to prevent complications and transmission. GBS does not cause pharyngitis and is not treated for routine throat infections.

### Diagnosis of strep throat in adults: are clinical criteria really good enough? [^113aYefM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The clinical manifestations of group A streptococcal and nonstreptococcal pharyngitis overlap quite broadly. For this reason, the updated Infectious Diseases Society of America practice guideline for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, published in this issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases, recommends laboratory confirmation of the clinical diagnosis by means of either throat culture or a rapid antigen detection test. However, a recently published guideline, developed by a subcommittee of the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine (ACP-ASIM) in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, advocates use of a clinical algorithm alone, in lieu of microbiologic testing, for confirmation of the diagnosis in adults for whom the suspicion of streptococcal infection is high. In this discussion, we examine the assumptions of the ACP-ASIM guideline, question whether its recommendations will achieve the stated objective of dramatically decreasing excess antibiotic use, and suggest that its recommendations be confirmed by clinical trials before clinicians abandon long-held teachings regarding diagnosis and management of group A streptococcal pharyngitis.

### Signs and symptoms of group A versus non-group A strep throat: a meta-analysis [^112rCCij]. Family Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Both non-Group A streptococcal (non-GAS) pharyngitis and Group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis are commonly found in patients with sore throat. It is not known whether or not they present with similar signs and symptoms compared to patients with non-streptococcal pharyngitis.

Methods

MEDLINE was searched for prospective studies that reported throat culture for both GAS and non-GAS as a reference standard, and reported at least one sign, symptom, or the Centor score. Summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-), and diagnostic odds ratios (DOR) were calculated using a bivariate random effects model. Summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were created for key signs and symptoms.

Results

Eight studies met our inclusion criteria. Tonsillar exudate had the highest LR+ for both GAS and non-GAS pharyngitis (1.53 versus 1.71). The confidence intervals of sensitivity, LR+, LR-, and DOR for all signs, symptoms, and the Centor score between two groups overlapped, with the relative difference between sensitivities within 15% for arthralgia or myalgia, fever, injected throat, tonsillar enlargement, and tonsillar exudate. Larger differences in sensitivities were observed for sore throat, cervical adenopathy, and lack of a cough, although the difference for lack of a cough largely due to a single outlier.

Discussion

Signs and symptoms of patients with GAS and non-GAS pharyngitis are generally similar. No signs or symptoms clearly distinguish GAS from non-GAS infection. Further work is needed to determine whether Group C streptococcus is a pathogen that should be treated.

### Pharyngitis management: defining the controversy [^1149pYrX]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Despite numerous controlled trials, clinical practice guidelines and cost-effective analyses, controversy persists regarding the appropriate management strategy for adult pharyngitis. In this perspective, we explore this controversy by comparing two competing clinical guidelines. Although the guidelines appear to make widely diverging recommendations, we show that the controversy centers on only a small proportion of patients: those presenting with severe pharyngitis. We examine recently published data to illustrate that this seemingly simple problem of strep throat remains a philosophical issue: should we give primacy to relieving acute time-limited symptoms, or should we emphasize the potential societal risk of antibiotic resistance? We accept potentially over treating a minority of adult pharyngitis patients with the most severe presentations to reduce suffering in an approximately equal number of patients who will have false negative test results if the test-and-treat strategy were used.

Background

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although their effectiveness increases in people with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated. This is an update of a review first published in 2010, and updated in 2013, 2016, and 2020.

Objectives

To assess the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing clinical relapse (i.e. recurrence of symptoms after initial resolution); and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 3 September 2020: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946), Embase Elsevier (from 1974), and Web of Science Thomson Reuters (from 2010). We also searched clinical trial registers on 3 September 2020.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics, and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications and/or adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and used the GRADE approach to assess the overall certainty of the evidence for the outcomes. We have reported the intention-to-treat analysis, and also performed an analysis of evaluable participants to explore the robustness of the intention-to-treat results.

Main Results

We included 19 trials reported in 18 publications (5839 randomised participants): six trials compared penicillin with cephalosporins; six compared penicillin with macrolides; three compared penicillin with carbacephem; one compared penicillin with sulphonamides; one compared clindamycin with ampicillin; and one compared azithromycin with amoxicillin in children. All participants had confirmed acute GABHS tonsillopharyngitis, and ages ranged from one month to 80 years. Nine trials included only, or predominantly, children. Most trials were conducted in an outpatient setting. Reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was poor in all trials. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence mainly due to lack of (or poor reporting of) randomisation or blinding, or both; heterogeneity; and wide confidence intervals. Cephalosporins versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference in symptom resolution (at 2 to 15 days) for cephalosporins versus penicillin (odds ratio (OR) for absence of symptom resolution 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.12; 5 trials; 2018 participants; low-certainty evidence). Results of the sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants differed (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; 5 trials; 1660 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be lower for cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 50; 4 trials; 1386 participants; low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence showed no difference in reported adverse events. Macrolides versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference between macrolides and penicillin for resolution of symptoms (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.35; 6 trials; 1728 participants; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants resulted in an OR of 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.09; 6 trials; 1159 participants). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be different (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.03; 6 trials; 802 participants; low-certainty evidence). Azithromycin versus amoxicillin Based on one unpublished trial in children, we are uncertain if resolution of symptoms is better with azithromycin in a single dose versus amoxicillin for 10 days (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; 1 trial; 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis for per-protocol analysis resulted in an OR of 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; 1 trial; 482 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are also uncertain if there was a difference in relapse between groups (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.82; 1 trial; 422 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events were more common with azithromycin compared to amoxicillin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.99; 1 trial; 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Carbacephem versus penicillin There is low-certainty evidence that compared with penicillin, carbacephem may provide better symptom resolution post-treatment in adults and children (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14.3; 3 trials; 795 participants). Studies did not report on long-term complications, so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better in preventing serious but rare complications. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are uncertain if there are clinically relevant differences in symptom resolution when comparing cephalosporins and macrolides with penicillin in the treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Low-certainty evidence in children suggests that carbacephem may be more effective than penicillin for symptom resolution. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the other comparisons in this review. Data on complications were too scarce to draw conclusions. These results do not demonstrate that other antibiotics are more effective than penicillin in the treatment of GABHS pharyngitis. All studies were conducted in high-income countries with a low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is a need for trials in low-income countries and Aboriginal communities, where the risk of complications remains high.

### The rational clinical examination. does this patient have strep throat? [^116L3a4d]. JAMA (2000). Excellent credibility.

Context

Sore throat is a common complaint, and identifying patients with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat) is an important task for clinicians. Previous reviews have not systematically reviewed and synthesized the evidence.

Objective

To review the precision and accuracy of the clinical examination in diagnosing strep throat.

Data Source

MEDLINE search for articles about diagnosis of strep throat using history-taking and physical examination.

Study Selection

Large blinded, prospective studies (having ≥ 300 patients with sore throat) reporting history and physical examination data and using throat culture as the reference standard were included. Of 917 articles identified by the search, 9 met all inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Pairs of authors independently reviewed each article and used consensus to resolve discrepancies.

Data Synthesis

The most useful findings for evaluating the likelihood of strep throat are presence of tonsillar exudate, pharyngeal exudate, or exposure to strep throat infection in the previous 2 weeks (positive likelihood ratios, 3.4, 2.1, and 1.9, respectively) and the absence of tender anterior cervical nodes, tonsillar enlargement, or exudate (negative likelihood ratios, 0.60, 0.63, and 0.74, respectively). No individual element of history-taking or physical examination is accurate enough by itself to rule in or rule out strep throat. Three validated clinical prediction rules are described for adult and pediatric populations.

Conclusions

While no single element of history-taking or physical examination is sufficiently accurate to exclude or diagnose strep throat, a well-validated clinical prediction rule can be useful and can help physicians make more informed use of rapid antigen tests and throat cultures.

Regarding medical management for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend to initiate an appropriate antibiotic (penicillin or amoxicillin as the drug of choice if not allergic to these agents) at an appropriate dose for a duration likely to eradicate the organism from the pharynx (usually 10 days).

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^117K3jjR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although effectiveness increases in participants with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated.

Objectives

To assess the evidence on the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing relapse; and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to March week 3, 2016), Embase Elsevier (1974 to March 2016), and Web of Science Thomson Reuters (2010 to March 2016). We also searched clinical trials registers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications or adverse events, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion, and extracted data using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed risk of bias of included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and used the GRADE tool to assess the overall quality of evidence for the outcomes.

Main Results

We included 19 trials (5839 randomised participants); seven compared penicillin with cephalosporins, six compared penicillin with macrolides, three compared penicillin with carbacephem, one trial compared penicillin with sulphonamides, one trial compared clindamycin with ampicillin, and one trial compared azithromycin with amoxicillin in children. All included trials reported clinical outcomes. Reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was poor in all trials. The overall quality of the evidence assessed using the GRADE tool was low for the outcome 'resolution of symptoms' in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and very low for the outcomes 'resolution of symptoms' of evaluable participants and for adverse events. We downgraded the quality of evidence mainly due to lack of (or poor reporting of) randomisation or blinding, or both, heterogeneity, and wide confidence intervals (CIs). There was a difference in symptom resolution in favour of cephalosporins compared with penicillin (evaluable patients analysis odds ratio (OR) for absence of resolution of symptoms 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 20, N = 5, n = 1660; very low quality evidence). However, this was not statistically significant in the ITT analysis (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.12; N = 5, n = 2018; low quality evidence). Clinical relapse was lower for cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; NNTB 50, N = 4, n = 1386; low quality evidence), but this was found only in adults (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.88; NNTB 33, N = 2, n = 770). There were no differences between macrolides and penicillin for any of the outcomes. One unpublished trial in children found a better cure rate for azithromycin in a single dose compared to amoxicillin for 10 days (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; NNTB 18, N = 1, n = 482), but there was no difference between the groups in ITT analysis (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; N = 1, n = 673) or at long-term follow-up (evaluable patients analysis OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.82; N = 1, n = 422). Children experienced more adverse events with azithromycin compared to amoxicillin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.99; N = 1, n = 673). Compared with penicillin carbacephem showed better symptom resolution post-treatment in adults and children combined (ITT analysis OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14, N = 3, n = 795), and in the subgroup analysis of children (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.99; NNTB 8, N = 1, n = 233), but not in the subgroup analysis of adults (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.22, N = 2, n = 562). Children experienced more adverse events with macrolides compared with penicillin (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.15; N = 1, n = 489). Studies did not report on long-term complications so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better in preventing serious but rare complications.

Authors' Conclusions

There were no clinically relevant differences in symptom resolution when comparing cephalosporins and macrolides with penicillin in the treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Limited evidence in adults suggests cephalosporins are more effective than penicillin for relapse, but the NNTB is high. Limited evidence in children suggests carbacephem is more effective than penicillin for symptom resolution. Data on complications are too scarce to draw conclusions. Based on these results and considering the low cost and absence of resistance, penicillin can still be regarded as a first choice treatment for both adults and children. All studies were in high-income countries with low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is need for trials in low-income countries and Aboriginal communities where risk of complications remains high.

### Modalities of group A streptococcal prevention and treatment and their economic justification [^112ZsJgL]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This review synthesises two decades of studies incorporating economic evaluation of Strep A prevention and treatment modalities. The cohort of these studies are notable for their scope. Though, the vast majority evaluated clinical diagnostic or therapeutic strategies to manage acute disease and focused on near-term outcomes. For example, the largest number of included publications addressed primary prevention (n = 19), particularly diagnostic strategy for acute pharyngitis (n = 5). These studies largely found that performing RADTs in all patients presenting with pharyngitis was cost-effective in reducing antibiotic consumption compared to other diagnostic and management strategies. Use of RADT was also a favourable strategy for diagnosing and managing pharyngitis when considering the reduction in risk of ARF and other sequelae in studies that did, and did not, include reductions in duration of infection as a benefit. However, few, if any, studies considered the implications of diagnostic tests detecting upper respiratory tract carriage of Strep A among cases of viral infection, which might lead to unnecessary antibiotic treatment.

The number of studies focusing on diagnostic strategies may suggest to decision-makers that this is the key clinical or public health question in addressing Strep A burden; i.e. the area with the most evaluation is the impost important or impactful. However, studies which identify cost-effective strategies for pharyngitis management do not necessarily translate into studies for cost-effective strategies to reduce the population-level burden of post-infection sequalae, including ARF and RHD. Only seven studies evaluated strategies to reduce the incidence of ARF and/or RHD among the general population. and four studies evaluated strategies to prevent worsening of established disease –. While these studies indicate that improving the coverage of existing or introducing new prevention strategies are economically justifiable, the body of existing literature does not clearly meet the needs of decision makers targeting the population-wide reduction in post-infection sequelae.

### Locally delivered flurbiprofen 8.75 mg for treatment and prevention of sore throat: a narrative review of clinical studies [^115cWLyM]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pharyngitis is one of the most common reasons patients seek advice from a healthcare provider (HCP) in primary care. Although not life-threatening, pharyngitis, particularly symptoms such as sore throat, can have a substantial negative impact on an individual's daily life. Relief from the severe symptoms of pharyngitis are a key driver of patients' consultations with HCPs, and of antibiotic-seeking behavior, with complaints of sore throat constituting between 1% and 4% of all primary care presentations internationally. Pharyngitis is generally of infectious etiology, with the vast majority of cases caused by self-limiting viral infections. Only around 5–30% of cases are attributed to bacterial etiologies – with approximately 10% to group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus pyogenes (strep A)–– although other bacteria, including S treptococcus dysgalactiae (strep C), have been implicated. Pharyngitis symptoms typically last 3–7 days, but are often worst during the first few days. The natural course of pharyngitis is similar in most patients, regardless of whether they are strep positive or not.

### Efficacy and safety of rapid tests to guide antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat [^113bY21x]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a common condition caused by viruses or bacteria, and is a leading cause of antibiotic prescription in primary care. The most common bacterial species is group A streptococcus ('strep throat'). Between 50% to 70% of pharyngitis cases are treated with antibiotics, despite the majority of cases being viral in origin. One strategy to reduce antibiotics is to use rapid tests for group A streptococcus to guide antibiotic prescriptions. Rapid tests can be used alone or in combination with a clinical scoring system.

To assess the efficacy and safety of strategies based on rapid tests to guide antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat in primary care settings.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and LILACS, as well as the trial registries ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP on 5 June 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rapid tests with management based on clinical grounds to guide the prescription of antibiotics for people with a sore throat in ambulatory care settings. We included trials that randomised individuals, as well as cluster-RCTs in which individual practitioners (or practices) or emergency departments were randomised.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data on the primary outcomes (number of participants provided with an antibiotic prescription; number of participants with an antibiotic dispensed) and secondary outcomes (duration of sore throat symptoms; duration of other symptoms; quality of life measures; number of participants with a complication attributed to the index infection; number of participants in need of re-consultation by the end of follow-up; number of participants in need of hospital admission by the end of follow-up; number of satisfied participants; number of participants with an adverse event attributed to the rapid test). We assessed the risk of bias of all included trials and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We performed meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses when feasible.

Main Results

We included five trials (2891 children and adult participants in total; 2545 participants after adjusting for clustering). Management in the intervention group was as follows: in three trials rapid tests were used in combination with a clinical scoring system; in one trial, some physicians were asked to use rapid tests alone, while others were asked to use rapid tests in combination with a clinical scoring system; in one trial, rapid tests were used alone. Based on data from five trials (2545 participants), a large reduction in prescribed antibiotics was found in the rapid test group (481/1197) versus management based on clinical grounds (865/1348), for a summary risk difference (RD) of -25%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -31% to -18%; I² = 62%; moderate-certainty evidence. Estimates of effect on antibiotic prescription rates were stable in various sensitivity analyses. Based on data from two trials (900 people) originating from the same overarching study, the evidence suggests that rapid tests may not reduce dispensed antibiotic treatments: rapid test group (156/445) versus management based on clinical grounds (197/455); summary RD -7%, 95% CI -17% to 2%; I² = 53%; low-certainty evidence. Four trials (2075 participants) reported data on the number of participants with a complication attributed to the index infection; the summary odds ratio (OR) was 0.85, 95% CI 0.03 to 26.65; P = 0.93; I² = 62%; very low-certainty evidence, which means that people in the rapid testing group were less likely to develop complications of the index infection, but the evidence is very uncertain. Two trials (1161 participants) reported on the number of participants in need of re-consultation by the end of follow-up; the summary OR was 1.12, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.21; P = 0.74; I² = 59%; low-certainty evidence, which means that participants in the rapid testing group were more likely to be in need of re-consultation by the end of the study follow-up, but the evidence is uncertain. Lack of data impeded assessment of other secondary outcomes (including safety outcomes) and of sources of heterogeneity. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Rapid testing to guide antibiotic treatment for sore throat in primary care probably reduces antibiotic prescription rates by 25% (absolute risk difference), but may have little or no impact on antibiotic dispensing. More studies are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of rapid test-guided antibiotic prescribing, notably to evaluate patient-centred outcomes and variability across subgroups (e.g. adults versus children).

### Strep A: challenges, opportunities, vaccine-based solutions, and economics [^112PXHi9]. NPJ Vaccines (2024). Medium credibility.

Streptococcus pyogenes (also referred to herein as Strep A or S. pyogenes) is estimated to be the fifth-leading cause of infectious disease deaths globally, behind the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Plasmodium falciparum, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (although the advent of SARS-CoV-2 has likely pushed it to sixth place). Infections from Strep A occur across the entire age spectrum and result in perhaps the most diverse range of acute and chronic clinical manifestations of any known pathogen –. These include pharyngitis, impetigo, cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, sepsis, maternal sepsis, scarlet fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, acute rheumatic fever (ARF), and rheumatic heart disease (RHD).

While Strep A infections are common globally, the burden of Strep A diseases varies widely according to country income level, socioeconomic and demographic composition of the local population, health system quality, and other factors. In high-income settings, for example, Strep A infection commonly manifests as pharyngitis (sore throat), which is typically treated with antibiotics quite effectively. Successful treatment of pharyngitis at this early stage can prevent rheumatic fever and may reduce the risk of invasive disease transmission to household contacts, although evidence that it can prevent other serious Strep A diseases is lacking. Recent major upsurges in invasive Strep A infections have shown that penicillin alone will not control major outbreaks, and real-life experience in New Zealand shows that intensive antibiotic treatment of Strep A sore throat can reduce, at best, only about one-quarter of ARF episodes, at a cost that is unaffordable in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In addition, the proliferation of antibiotics used to treat pharyngitis presumed to be caused by Strep A introduces the real risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) both in the target Strep A organism but also in bystander pathogens where AMR is an even greater concern. Worse still, severe Strep A manifestations, such as RHD, disproportionately affect populations in low-resource settings and, consequently, perpetuate social inequities. During 2015–2017 in Australia, for example, the incidence rate of new first diagnosis of RHD among Indigenous people younger than 45 years of age was roughly 50 times higher than that of non-Indigenous people (45.5 vs. 0.9 cases per 100,000 person-years, respectively). Overall, the incidence of invasive Strep A infection has increased in several regions of the world during the past two decades –, and the health burden of Strep A is similar to, or higher than, that of other pathogens for which vaccines have recently been developed and successfully implemented (e.g. meningococcus).

### Safety of Streptococcus pyogenes vaccines: anticipating and overcoming challenges for clinical trials and post-marketing monitoring [^115VWbf8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (Strep A), a human pathogen, afflict more than 800 million people each year and result in an estimated 639 000 deaths, most attributable to rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and invasive infections. Clinical manifestations vary from mucosal diseases (pharyngitis, tonsillitis, superficial skin infections) to locally invasive and systemic diseases (bacteremia, meningitis, puerperal sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome) and immune-related sequelae including acute rheumatic fever (ARF), acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, and RHD. While most manifestations of S. pyogenes infection can be treated with penicillin, the lack of prevention strategies, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), leads infection to progress to severe disease and death. Hence, the 71st World Health Assembly asked the World Health Organization (WHO) in May 2018 to prioritize the development of a safe and effective S. pyogenes vaccine.

### The global burden of sore throat and group apharyngitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115oK6AP]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Additionally, Strep A sore throat was defined in all but one study as sore throat, or pharyngitis, with the presence of Strep A in the pharynx based on positive culture or RADT. As neither diagnostic method distinguishes between throat carriage and active infection, it is unlikely that all reported episodes were caused by Strep A. Danchin et al. demonstrated this, finding evidence of active Strep A infection (defined as a significant serological response) in only two-thirds of culture-positive episodes from children.

We excluded studies based on healthcare presentations for sore throat from this review. In the USA, the rate of ambulatory care presentations in children aged 0–19 years for pharyngitis (2010–2011) was 16.2 presentations per 100 person-years, whereas community surveillance among children in the USA for Strep A pharyngitis alone was almost three times higher at 47 episodes per 100 child-years. In a survey of 15,788 individuals aged 14 years and over, Hannaford et al. found that only 38% of those who reported severe sore throat or tonsillitis presented to health services at the time of acute infection. These studies highlight the value of community surveillance to estimate the disease burden of sore throat and Strep A sore throat. Use of outpatient data is limited to the small proportion of people who present to health services for what is often considered a self-limiting diseaseand is further limited by diagnostic testing practices, and coding of electronic medical records. As such, outpatient data provide an incomplete estimate that is biased toward more severe cases.

Primary prevention: treat acute disease to reduce duration of illness and prevent ARF or other complications of infection

Six studies evaluated diagnostic strategies for patients presenting for treatment of sore throat. All included the benefits of reducing duration of acute illness and preventing ARF and/or quinsy (Supplementary Table 4). In addition, some studies included further down-stream benefits, namely preventing RHD due to preventing ARF.

The earliest of those studies, a study by Neuner et al. published in 2003, was a model-based, cost-utility analysis for pharyngitis treatment among adult patients from a societal perspective. The authors estimated the costs and quality-adjusted life-days (QLADs) lost due to pharyngitis and related complications for five diagnosis and treatment strategies: observation without testing or treatment, empirical treatment with penicillin, throat culture all patients and treat Strep A positive cases, RADT for all patients followed by culture to confirm negative test, and RADT without follow-up culture for all patients. They concluded that performing a throat culture on all patients and treating Strep A positive cases was the least costly and the most effective (least QALDs lost to pharyngitis and complications) strategy. From sensitivity analyses, the authors conclude that observation without testing or treatment would be more effective if the probability of ARF was lower (baseline was 5 in 10,000 adults with Strep A pharyngitis), the probability of anaphylaxis was higher, or the quality of life with pharyngitis was better compared to baseline values. These results are important as there was uncertainty in all parameter estimates, which were derived from few and aging studies from the literature or from unsubstantiated assumptions.

Sore throat is one of the most common reasons for visits to family physicians. While most patients with sore throat have an infectious cause (pharyngitis), fewer than 20 percent have a clear indication for antibiotic therapy (i.e., group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection). Useful, well-validated clinical decision rules are available to help family physicians care for patients who present with pharyngitis. Because of recent improvements in rapid streptococcal antigen tests, throat culture can be reserved for patients whose symptoms do not improve over time or who do not respond to antibiotics.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

To inform investment cases regarding the full value of Strep A vaccination, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the global burden of Strep A sore throat. We prospectively submitted the systematic review protocol for registration with PROSPERO (CRD42020181103) and reported according to PRISMA guidelines. The study protocol is available online.

We used Clarivate Analytics' Web of Science search platform, which includes multiple databases such as WoS core collection, PubMed, Medline, data citation index, KCI-Korean Journal Database, Russian Science Citation Index, and the SciELO Citation Index to perform a literature search of papers published between 2000 and 2019 inclusive on April 13, 2020, and we conducted an updated search on February 15, 2021, to include all papers published since the original end date. The search included the following terms: tonsillopharyngitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, sore throat, or throat infection and epidemiology, incidence, frequency, rate, surveillance, prevalence, or burden. To supplement database searches, we used Google Scholar; using the same search terms to capture any additional studies within the gray literature, including conference proceedings. Appendix 1 provides a list of search strings. We also reviewed reference lists of each eligible paper to identify additional articles for inclusion.

Studies were eligible for inclusion if (1) incidence rates or cumulative incidence could be calculated for sore throat or Strep A sore throat (both outcomes including pharyngitis, tonsillitis, or tonsillopharyngitis) and (2) participants were recruited from settings that captured a representative sample of the general population. Studies were excluded for the following reasons: the population denominator could not be established; incidence rates were modelled, rather than observed; episodes of sore throat were limited to those caused solely by a pathogen other than Strep A (e.g. studies of only episodes of group C or G Streptococcus pharyngitis); or episodes of sore throat that were the result of endotracheal intubation. We also excluded studies based on healthcare presentations for sore throat as they are biased toward people accessing care and, therefore, are not representative of all people who experience a sore throat in a population. No restrictions were placed on age or language. Google translate was used to translate non-English publications.

### Strep A: challenges, opportunities, vaccine-based solutions, and economics [^116EjT2b]. NPJ Vaccines (2024). Medium credibility.

Insofar as current approaches to prevention have proven insufficiently effective at the population level, combating Strep A infection and the diseases it causes requires a new approach. The Cannon and Wyber piece in this issue, "Modalities of group A streptococcal prevention and treatment and their economic justification", explores various preventive interventions for Strep A infections and sequelae. The authors report that primordial prevention — behaviors like improved hygiene, physical distancing, and preventive vaccination — are particularly understudied, especially as averting infection prevents acute diseases like pharyngitis, impetigo, cellulitis, and necrotizing fasciitis and attendant downstream outcomes like RHD (and, therefore, also obviates the need for related downstream prevention and treatment strategies). Typically viewed as occurring passively with economic development, primordial prevention has long been neglected; indeed, of the 44 studies the authors reviewed that undertook economic analysis of Strep A prevention approaches, only one evaluated primordial prevention. One of the main conclusions of the Cannon and Wyber article is that a vaccine and related vaccination program could translate to a major advance in primary prevention — and potentially even primordial prevention — if it interrupts carriage and reduces the overall circulation of Strep A strains. As added gains, further interventions that address social determinants of health are likely to result in health and economic benefits for other infectious diseases, including educational and productivity gains.

Data synthesis and analysis

We compared and contrasted studies evaluating strategies aimed at similar points in the aetiological pathway between Strep A exposure and death. To do that, we broadened the traditional framework used to categorise prevention strategies for ARF and RHD to cover strategies for all diseases and sequalae caused by Strep A (Fig. 2). In our framework, categories closely but not strictly follow level of care and studies that evaluated strategies from multiple categories were summarised in the most up-stream category (e.g. studies evaluating both primary and secondary prevention strategies were summarised in the primary prevention category). Our categories were defined as follows
Primordial prevention: strategies aimed at preventing infection (e.g. hygiene measures, social distancing, and vaccination). Preventing infection prevents acute disease and down-stream outcomes and the need for related down-stream prevention and treatment strategies.
Primary prevention: strategies aiming to reduce duration or severity of illness from superficial Strep A infections and/or prevent sequalae, generally by appropriate treatment. Duration of illness can be reduced through antibiotic treatment and relieved through analgesics. Prevention of ARF and other sequelae, such as quinsy and plausibly APSGN, can be achieved by prompt antibiotic treatment of Strep A infection. Preliminary review of the literature indicated three subcategories among economic evaluations of primary prevention strategies. They were evaluations of strategies that Reduce duration or severity of illness only Reduce duration of illness and prevent sequalae (e.g. ARF, APSGN, quinsy) Prevent development of autoimmune sequalae only Like primordial prevention, primary prevention may prevent down-stream complications and the need for associated prevention and treatment strategies.
Secondary prevention: strategies to prevent infection and illness or worsening of an established condition. These strategies typically involve antibiotic prophylaxis and were summarised as those that targeted ARF and direct sequelae Other Strep A diseases
Secondary prevention for other Strep A diseases included antibiotic prophylaxis in patients at risk of recurrent cellulitis and among close contacts of people with invasive infection –. It also included tonsillectomy among people suffering frequently recurrent episodes of tonsillitis. Tertiary prevention: strategies aimed at preventing mortality among those with severe disease, such as cardiovascular complications from RHD or sepsis from invasive infection.

Introduction

Upper respiratory infection by group A Streptococcus (Strep A) and other pathogens can result in a sore throat and clinical diagnosis of pharyngitis or tonsillitis. Strep A sore throat (and tonsillitis) can progress to more severe infection, such as peritonsillar abscess or invasive infections; Strep A sore throat can also result in post-infection sequelae including acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, acute rheumatic fever (ARF), and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). There is limited contemporary data for the global burden of all Strep A related diseases. Based on 2010 estimates that each year RHD caused more than 345,000 deathsadded to previous estimates that Strep A invasive infection caused more than 163,000 deaths, Strep A was postulated to be the fifth most lethal pathogen in the world. Strep A vaccines could significantly reduce this disease burden. Moreover, the World Health Organization highlights the potential role of Strep A vaccines in reducing antibiotic treatment of presumed Strep A sore throat, which could plausibly lead to reduced levels of antibiotic resistance and associated harms.

Despite the high global burden of Strep A diseases and the existence of several promising candidate vaccines in early development, investment in late-stage development of these candidates has not been forthcoming. Therefore, formal assessment of the value of prospective Strep A vaccines from both a commercial and societal perspective is warranted. The incidence and burden of sore throat and Strep A sore throat are important inputs for assessing the value of Strep A vaccines.

A review of the burden of Strep A diseases published in 2005 estimated that more than 616 million cases of Strep A sore throat occur globally each year. Since then, a single systematic review and meta-analysis of the incidence of sore throat and Strep A sore throat has been published, which reported a pooled Strep A sore throat incidence of 10.8 episodes per 100 child-years from six studies. Collectively, these published reviews had significant limitations. The first review was based on only four studies, the most recent of which was published nearly two decades ago, and the second review only examined studies among populations considered at risk of ARF (children from low- and middle-income countries [LMICs] or Indigenous children living in high-income countries [HICs]). Consequently, there are no contemporary estimates of the global incidence or burden of sore throat and Strep A sore throat.

### Guideline for the management of acute sore throat [^1174zw4c]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Low credibility.

The European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases established the Sore Throat Guideline Group to write an updated guideline to diagnose and treat patients with acute sore throat. In diagnosis, Centor clinical scoring system or rapid antigen test can be helpful in targeting antibiotic use. The Centor scoring system can help to identify those patients who have higher likelihood of group A streptococcal infection. In patients with high likelihood of streptococcal infections (e.g. 3–4 Centor criteria) physicians can consider the use of rapid antigen test (RAT). If RAT is performed, throat culture is not necessary after a negative RAT for the diagnosis of group A streptococci. To treat sore throat, either ibuprofen or paracetamol are recommended for relief of acute sore throat symptoms. Zinc gluconate is not recommended to be used in sore throat. There is inconsistent evidence of herbal treatments and acupuncture as treatments for sore throat. Antibiotics should not be used in patients with less severe presentation of sore throat, e.g. 0–2 Centor criteria to relieve symptoms. Modest benefits of antibiotics, which have been observed in patients with 3–4 Centor criteria, have to be weighed against side effects, the effect of antibiotics on microbiota, increased antibacterial resistance, medicalisation and costs. The prevention of suppurative complications is not a specific indication for antibiotic therapy in sore throat. If antibiotics are indicated, penicillin V, twice or three times daily for 10 days is recommended. At the present, there is no evidence enough that indicates shorter treatment length.

APPLICATIONS TO STREP A VACCINE DEVELOPMENT

The clinical spectrum of Strep A is broad (Figure 1). The lack of a single, focused disease entity likely contributes to the lack of consensus on its public health priority and affects advocacy efforts for disease prevention through development of a Strep A vaccine. Additionally, while some clinical endpoints are specific to Strep A, others (eg, cellulitis, pharyngitis) have multiple etiologies.

Figure 1.
Key group A Streptococcus disease syndromes. Colonization of upper respiratory infection and skin is not included. Note this is a simplified figure of the diseases associated with group A Streptococcus. Locally invasive disease and invasive disease can also include bacteremia, meningitis, puerperal sepsis, and necrotizing fasciitis. Toxin-mediated diseases can also include streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Direct sequelae can also include chronic kidney disease. Figure adapted with permission by Cannon et al.

To address this challenge and highlight the need for a Strep A vaccine, we used our framework to provide a roadmap and identify priority data requirements specific to key Strep A clinical endpoints, grouped into acute diseases (Table 2) and immune-mediated sequelae (Table 3). Some data purposes differ between high-income countries (HICs) and LMICs. However, the HIC/LMIC dichotomy does not account for the large heterogeneity within some HICs. For example, Australia has the highest reported rates of impetigo and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) in the world among First Nations people; hence, burden of disease data requirements in these populations in Australia may reflect more of an LMIC prioritization than an HIC. Furthermore, the simple dichotomy does not account for the transition from low-income to middle-income country status, which is particularly important for Gavi funding considerations and future vaccine implementation.

### Diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of group a streptococcal pharyngitis in children in a primary care setting: impact of point-of-care polymerase chain reaction [^117N2iVj]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Infection with Streptococcus pyogenes (group A beta-hemolytic streptococci; GAS) is the most common bacterial cause of acute pharyngitis and is responsible for an estimated 20–30% of sore throat cases in children. In the United States, the societal cost of GAS pharyngitis is estimated to range from $224 to $539 million per year, with children missing an average of 1.9 days of school/daycare and 42% of parents missing a mean of 1.8 days of work. The timely initiation of antibiotics can effectively treat GAS pharyngitis, prevent the spread of infection to close contacts, reduce the duration of symptoms, and limit rare long-term complications. Acute pharyngitis can be a result of either bacterial or viral pathogens and, as such, current clinical guidelines encourage the use of antibiotics only for confirmed cases of GAS. Despite these recommendations, and the overall rates of documented GAS infections (5–30% of sore throat visits), antibiotics are often prescribed in as many as 60% of patient visits for sore throat. Greater awareness of the development of bacterial resistance resulting from the overprescribing of antibiotics is increasing the urgency to move away from empiric antibiotic treatment for common respiratory infections.

Defining and documenting throat infection for tonsillectomy candidacy emphasizes accurate episode tracking and required sore throat symptoms. Clinicians are told it is "incumbent… to accurately describe individual episodes of throat infection and to document the frequency of these events", with "Supportive documentation… [including] absences from school, spread of infection within the family, and a family history of rheumatic heart disease or poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis". "The presence of sore throat was a necessary entrance criterion in all randomized controlled trials", and "no claim can be made that tonsillectomy is effective" if sore throat is absent "even when GABHS is identified". For children repeatedly positive for GABHS, it "is desirable to rule out streptococcal carriage", and "streptococcal carriage is strongly suggested by positive strep cultures or other strep tests when the child lacks signs or symptoms of acute pharyngitis".

### Role of non-group a streptococci in acute pharyngitis [^114zJA4c]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The role of non-group A streptococci (non-GAS) as pathogens of acute pharyngitis is controversial. Data are limited and conflicting on whether these bacteria are true pathogens of pharyngitis and whether treatment is indicated in all cases or just select cases. However, non-GAS are well-documented as being pathogens of other diseases, including neonatal sepsis, pneumonia, endocarditis, and urinary tract infections. If non-GAS are pathogens of acute pharyngitis, treatment may speed recovery as well as prevent complications. The objective of this study was to determine whether, in cases of pharyngitis in which non-GAS is identified on culture, the clinical signs and symptoms resemble those of group A streptococcal pharyngitis thus implicating them as true pathogens or if they resemble culture-negative pharyngitis, suggesting these cases are viral in etiology.

Method

This was a 3-group retrospective case-control study (N = 915; mean age, 26 years). Cases included all patients with non-GAS identified on culture (n = 180). The control group 1 consisted of all patients with GAS infection identified by a rapid strep test or culture (n = 145); control group 2 included all patients with a negative rapid strep test and culture (presumed viral pharyngitis; n = 584). Multivariate analysis was used to compare the prevalence of 5 clinical features among the groups.

Results

The presence of headache and fever was significantly associated with streptococcal infection, with no difference between GAS and non-GAS infection. Exudates and lymphadenopathy were also significantly associated with both GAS and non-GAS infection compared with viral infection. When 2 criteria were present, the risk of any streptococcal infection rose to 55% (27% for non-GAS or GAS); when 3 or more criteria were present, the rate of any streptococcal infection rose to 81% (non-GAS infection, 34%; GAS infection, 47%).

Conclusion

In this predominantly young, adult population with acute pharyngitis, non-GAS infection was as common as GAS infection and was associated with the same clinical features typically associated with GAS. Although the benefits of treating non-GAS pharyngitis in terms of either symptomatic relief or prevention of sequelae are unproven, clinicians may want to consider treating patients with proven or presumptive non-GAS pharyngitis who fail to respond to symptomatic therapy or who are at increased risk for sequelae of group B or group C streptococcal infections, such as those patients who are or have close contact with pregnant women, neonates, and elderly or immunocompromised persons. Further study is needed to determine whether patients with non-GAS pharyngitis benefit from targeted antibiotic treatment.

### Efficacy of flurbiprofen 8.75 mg delivered as a spray or lozenge in patients with sore throat due to upper respiratory tract infection: a randomized, non-inferiority trial in the Russian Federation [^115v9w1w]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pharyngitis, more commonly known as sore throat, is associated with pharyngeal inflammation and is usually caused by an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) such as the common cold.–Although painful, acute sore throat is self-limiting and most cases resolve within 3–7 days, even in the absence of treatment. However, the discomfort caused by sore throat can significantly impact quality of life and daily activities, and sore throat remains one of the most common reasons for primary care consultations.–

Only a small proportion (~10%) of sore throat cases are caused by bacterial infection, such as group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (Strep A). Although less common, group C beta-hemolytic streptococcus (Strep C) can also cause sore throat. The vast majority of sore throats are caused by viral infection, but many patients seek – and are inappropriately prescribed – antibiotics.–Antibiotics can be useful in certain circumstances, but their effectiveness is limited in most cases of acute sore throat and they do not always lead to faster symptom resolution even when bacterial infection is involved. Inappropriate use of antibiotics also contributes to the growing problem of antibacterial resistance. Furthermore, it has been suggested that patients who hope for antibiotic treatment may actually be seeking a treatment to relieve pain. Together, these factors show that a need remains for treatments that can provide rapid and effective pain relief for acute sore throat, even in those cases where antibiotics are warranted.

### Antibiotics for sore throat [^1156fVtp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a common reason for people to present for medical care. Although it remits spontaneously, primary care doctors commonly prescribe antibiotics for it.

Objectives

To assess the benefits of antibiotics for sore throat for patients in primary care settings.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 6, MEDLINE (January 1966 to July week 1, 2013) and EMBASE (January 1990 to July 2013).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of antibiotics versus control assessing typical sore throat symptoms or complications.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion and extracted data. We resolved differences in opinion by discussion. We contacted trial authors from three studies for additional information.

Main Results

We included 27 trials with 12,835 cases of sore throat. We did not identify any new trials in this 2013 update. 1. Symptoms Throat soreness and fever were reduced by about half by using antibiotics. The greatest difference was seen at day three. The number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) to prevent one sore throat at day three was less than six; at week one it was 21. 2. Non-suppurative complications The trend was antibiotics protecting against acute glomerulonephritis but there were too few cases to be sure. Several studies found antibiotics reduced acute rheumatic fever by more than two-thirds within one month (risk ratio (RR) 0.27; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 0.60). 3. Suppurative complications Antibiotics reduced the incidence of acute otitis media within 14 days (RR 0.30; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.58); acute sinusitis within 14 days (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.08 to 2.76); and quinsy within two months (RR 0.15; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.47) compared to those taking placebo. 4. Subgroup analyses of symptom reduction Antibiotics were more effective against symptoms at day three (RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.71) if throat swabs were positive for Streptococcus, compared to RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.97 if negative. Similarly at week one the RR was 0.29 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.70) for positive and 0.73 (95% CI 0.50 to 1.07) for negative Streptococcus swabs.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics confer relative benefits in the treatment of sore throat. However, the absolute benefits are modest. Protecting sore throat sufferers against suppurative and non-suppurative complications in high-income countries requires treating many with antibiotics for one to benefit. This NNTB may be lower in low-income countries. Antibiotics shorten the duration of symptoms by about 16 hours overall.

### Diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of group a streptococcal pharyngitis in children in a primary care setting: impact of point-of-care polymerase chain reaction [^1115y1k4]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis based on clinical symptoms alone is not recommended. The use of point-of-care (POC) rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) to test throat-swab specimens obtained in the clinic can help diagnose GAS pharyngitis with the convenience of rapid turnaround times (e.g. < 10 min); however, the overall sensitivity of these tests (70–90%) is low. Thus, current treatment guidelines for the diagnosis of acute pharyngitis in children recommend the use of RADTs of throat-swab specimens plus confirmatory bacterial culture in the case of negative results. Although highly accurate (90–95% sensitivity) when performed correctly, bacterial cultures are labor intensive and require additional infrastructure for sample transport to a separate laboratory and experienced staff to grow and test the bacteria – these factors can delay result reporting to the clinic by 48–72 h. In addition, data have shown that the sensitivity of diagnostic culture conducted as part of routine clinical care is widely variable and lower than that observed with reference culture implemented in clinical trials. Despite clear recommendations for diagnostic testing to confirm GAS, a recent analysis of US claims data found that ≈ 25% of patients with pharyngitis receive no diagnostic testing and have high rates of empiric treatment (57.1%).

In recent years, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for diagnosing GAS pharyngitis, including several polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. The sensitivity and specificity of PCR assays are similar to those of bacterial reference culture, but PCR has better turnaround times – minutes to hours compared with days. PCR has been implemented into pharyngitis treatment algorithms, as both a confirmatory method to replace culture and as a single test to eliminate the 2-step algorithm. In 2015, the FDA approved the first Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments–waived PCR test for GAS for in-office POC use (cobas Strep A nucleic acid test for use on the cobas Liat System; Roche Molecular Systems, Pleasanton, CA); this system targets a segment of the S. pyogenes genome to produce test results within 15 min in a clinic setting, offers sensitivity and specificity equivalent to and potentially improved over current diagnostic testing procedures, and eliminates the need for confirmatory culture.

Introduction

Sore throat is a common reason for prescribing antibiotics and accounts for about 11% of all antibiotic prescriptions in primary healthcare in Sweden, which is a low prescribing country. Among approximately 29 consultations per 1000 inhabitants for sore throat in 2013, about two thirds were labelled as tonsillitis, of which 80% received an antibiotic prescription. Group A streptococcus is the most common pathogen in acute tonsillitis and is present in about 33% of patients with acute sore throat, but other bacteria and viruses are also potential pathogens. The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) Sore Throat Guideline Group and Swedish guidelines for the management of sore throat focus on patients who are more likely to benefit from antimicrobial treatment. These patients have a higher symptom burden and an infection caused by group A streptococcus. The recommendation is that antibiotic treatment should be offered to patients with three or four Centor criteria (fever, tender cervical lymph nodes, coatings of the tonsils, and lack of cough) and a positive rapid antigen detection test for group A streptococcus. In Sweden the recommended treatment regimen for adults is 1000 mg penicillin V three times daily for 10 days. This duration of treatment is similar to other countries, but the dosage and total exposure (30 g) are relatively high. The historical reason for antimicrobial treatment is mainly to avoid serious complications such as acute rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis. These conditions are currently extremely rare in high income countries. Today the main reason for treatment in high income countries is to speed up clinical resolution of symptoms, but treatment also prevents rare complications such as peritonsillitis, impetigo, cellulitis, otitis media, and sinusitis.

### Antibiotic regimens | Group A strep… [^112SrWMm]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Multiple antibiotic regimens have been used to eradicate carriage of group A Streptococcus in previous outbreaks.
- Regimen should be chosen on a case-by-case basis.
- Some regimens require antibiotic susceptibility test results prior to their use.
- Follow recommended guidance on preventing and treating GAS infections. Overview Multiple antibiotic regimens have been recommended for GAS carriage eradication in either
- 2002 U. S. guidelines for postpartum and post-surgical outbreaks
- Canada's guidelines for prevention and control of invasive GAS disease Several regimens have been used in previous outbreaks for GAS carriage eradication. Regimen choice Which antibiotic regimen to use for GAS carriage eradication during an outbreak depends on multiple considerations. Long-term care facility and public health staff should carefully consider the pros and cons of each regimen on a case-by-case basis.

Key decision makers from the LTCF include the medical director and infection prevention and control personnel. In addition to a first-line regimen, it's likely necessary to choose alternative regimens for those
- With allergies to antibiotics
- At risk for drug-drug interactions with antibiotic regimens. First-line regimens GAS is universally susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, including penicillin and cephalosporins. LTCFs and public health don't need to consider antibiotic susceptibility when selecting one of these treatment regimens. Universally susceptible antibiotic regimens, with dosages. Benzathine penicillin G plus rifampin BPG: 600, 000 units for patients < 27 kilograms or 1, 200, 000 units for patients ≥ 27 kg intramuscular in a single dose Rifampin: 20 mg/kg/day oral in 2 divided doses for 4 days.

Alternative regimens LTCFs and public health should only consider clindamycin or macrolides if the outbreak strain is documented as susceptible to these antibiotics. Clindamycin and macrolide resistance have been commonly reported. Among invasive disease isolates in 2023, 27% of GAS isolates were macrolide resistant and 26% of isolates were clindamycin resistant.

### Polymeric epitope-based vaccine induces protective immunity against group A Streptococcus [^114NzggH]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Group A Streptococcus (Strep A, S. pyogenes) is an important global human pathogen that leads to a wide range of infections from such as mild pharyngitis and impetigo to invasive diseases such as toxic shock syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis and cellulitis –. Strep A pharyngitis has a considerable global health and economic burden. Robust surveillance mechanisms must be put in place to accurately measure and analyze disease burden between populations, and evaluate the potential impact of future Strep A vaccines. This bacterium is heavily equipped with multiple virulence factors and genetic regulators enabling its diverse infection profile. Recurrence of streptococcal infection may result in post-infection sequelae of acute rheumatic fever, rheumatic heart disease, and acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Strep A infections are a major problem in many low- and middle-income countries and indigenous populations of developed countries where inadequate access to health care and socioeconomic issues occur. The main killers of Strep A infection are rheumatic heart disease mostly in resource-poor settings and invasive infection in high-income countries. Excess mortality due to Strep A is indirectly caused by the development of antimicrobial resistance resulting from the massive consumption of antibiotics. Globally, Strep A causes approximately 700 million human infection each year and there are more than 500,000 deaths due to Strep A diseases. Treatments of streptococcal infection are also very expensive. Currently, there is no licensed vaccine available to prevent this infection. Hence, a globally available safe and effective vaccine against Strep A is urgently needed to prevent streptococcal infection to reduce associated morbidity and mortality.

### High diagnostic accuracy of automated rapid strep A test reduces antibiotic prescriptions for children in the United Arab Emirates [^116H9M2L]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Timely and targeted antibiotic treatment of GAS infections constitutes the backbone of prevention of complications. This has resulted in a reduction in the burden of RHD in high-income countries; however, high rates of disease persist in low-income countries compounded by lack of healthcare access and unavailability of adequate diagnostic testing.

Clinical features and history do not reliably discriminate between GAS and viral pharyngitis, especially in children. International guidelines recommend throat swabs for rapid antigen testing and GAS culture for patients with acute pharyngitis to rapidly detect and target antibiotic treatment for those with GAS infection. The main rationale for antibiotic therapy for GAS pharyngitis is to prevent the development of ARF, the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children. RHD constitutes a substantial burden of chronic disability and death among adolescents and young adults.

Throat cultures are considered the gold standard for diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis. A recent systematic review demonstrated an 85% diagnostic sensitivity of SAT among children. However, this sensitivity is suboptimal for rapid assays to be considered stand-alone diagnostic tests, and concurrent back-up throat cultures are required for definitive diagnosis of GAS in children with a negative SAT.

We have previously reported a high diagnostic accuracy of QuickVue® Dipstick Strep A rapid test in a paediatric outpatient clinic setting where high-quality swabs were taken by the attending paediatrician. A similar study in the UAE demonstrated a similarly high diagnostic accuracy of Diaquick Strep A Test. Other studies have also demonstrated a high test sensitivity when throat swabs for SAT are collected by a paediatrician. However, these studies' findings are not generalizable to a "real-world" setting where samples are often taken by nurses or non-paediatric physicians, necessitating the need for back-up throat cultures in routine practice to minimize false-negative diagnoses of GAS pharyngitis that would increase the risk of post-infectious sequelae.

In our current study, we evaluated the use of a newer automated rapid streptococcal antigen test system (A-SAT) in children presenting with pharyngitis. Standard F strep A antigen test (SD Biosensor, Republic of Korea) is a fluorescence immunoassay with a manufacturer-reported test sensitivity of 93.3% and specificity of 95% compared to throat culture. We designed a study to determine its diagnostic accuracy in a "real world" scenario in an emergency room where samples are taken by non-paediatric nurses, and to determine its impact on antibiotic prescribing practices in children presenting with pharyngitis.

### Severe acute pharyngitis caused by group C Streptococcus [^111CEMN1]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Adult group C beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis has a prevalence of approximately 5%. It can present with a broad spectrum of severity.

Case Report

We report a 30-year-old woman who presented with severe Group C streptococcal pharyngitis.

Discussion

She presented with a 9-day history of progressive symptoms, including fever, sore throat, neck swelling, and recent onset of hoarseness. In the 9 days before the emergency room (ER) presentation, the patient had visited the ER twice complaining of a sore throat. At both visits, the physicians performed rapid antigen strep testing. Each time her test was negative and the physicians recommended symptomatic therapy. Her symptoms continued to worsen leading to her repeat presentation. At this time she had severe pharyngitis with markedly enlarged tonsils. Neck CT excluded peritonsillar abscess. Rapid strep testing was again negative, but her throat culture grew group C beta-hemolytic streptococcus.

Conclusion

This presentation illustrates the importance of a systematic approach to evaluating patients with negative rapid strep tests and worsening pharyngitis.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^1118KEJr]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Infections of the skin and soft tissues are caused most frequently by Staphylococcus aureus (also referred to as "Staph") or Streptococcus pyogenes (also referred to as "Strep" or Group A strep; refer to the Streptococcal infections section), and other less common bacteria. Staph infections may be caused by staph strains that are very susceptible to antibiotics or by MRSA (see MRSA section above). Sometimes the specific bacteria can indicate the type of skin infection (e.g. impetigo, cellulitis, and abscess), the events leading to the infection (e.g. unknown, trauma, and animal bite), and the individual's underlying risk factors (e.g. previous history of skin infections and immune compromise).

Many skin infections are easily treated with oral antibiotics. Some skin infections, especially those caused by Staph, may require a minor surgical procedure to drain pus from an abscess (also called a boil), if present. If the infection is severe, it may require hospital admission for intravenous (IV) antibiotics.

The ways these bacteria spread depends on the type of skin infection and the specific bacteria. Staph, including MRSA, transmit easily through direct contact with infected fluids, such as pus and through respiratory secretions from a person with pneumonia (see MRSA section). People can minimize the risk of transmission by avoiding direct contact with infected fluids, careful hand hygiene and using dressings to cover skin infections with draining fluid and changing dressings frequently.

Individuals also can be colonized with these bacteria, meaning the bacteria live in their nose, throat, or on their skin, but they do not have symptoms of illness.

Recommendations

If group A streptococcus (Strep) is the cause of the individual's skin infection, refer to Streptococcal infections section.
Restrict individuals from entering the family-centered residential facility with skin and soft tissue infections if they have active drainage from the infection site. After an individual has surgical drainage of an infected abscess (boil), the facility may allow entry if the affected skin can be kept completely covered at all times with a clean and dry dressing.
Allow individuals who have been exposed to someone with a skin infection who do not have symptoms of illness to enter the facility.
Refer individuals who develop a skin infection while staying at the facility for medical evaluation. Until evaluated, restrict the individual to their private room.
Educate guests and family members about the importance of frequent hand hygiene and careful handling of contaminated items (e.g. used bandages, clothing, and linens) with appropriate, prompt cleaning or disposal.

Streptococcal infections (including strep throat)

Background

The most common infection caused by group A streptococcus (GAS) is pharyngitis, commonly called strep throat. Symptoms include fever, sore throat, and enlarged lymph nodes in the neck. Scarlet fever can occur along with strep throat, and it is characterized by a red, sandpaper-like rash.GAS can cause other infections including skin and soft tissue infections, pneumonia, musculoskeletal infections, bloodstream infection, and sepsis. Sepsis is the body's overactive and toxic response to infection. Sepsis can be life threatening.

GAS can spread through contact with the respiratory secretions of a person who is infected. A person is considered contagious until they have been treated with appropriate antibiotics for 24 hours. The is no vaccine available to prevent GAS infections.

Recommendations

Restrict individuals who have active, untreated GAS infections from entry to the family-centered residential facility.
Allow entry once they have completed at least 24 hours of antibiotic treatment and have been fever-free for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medication.
Allow individuals who were exposed to someone with a documented case of GAS infection to enter the facility if they do not have symptoms of illness.
Refer for medical evaluation individuals who were exposed to GAS and develop symptoms for testing and treatment if the test is positive. Apply the previous steps to their reentry to the facility.

### Are invasive group A streptococcal infections preventable by antibiotic therapy? a collaborative retrospective study [^112ubg5T]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The great majority of patients did not have a missed opportunity for antibiotic treatment preceding their iGAS disease. Therefore, based on our study and considering all limitations, withholding antibiotic treatment for suspected local GAS infections does not seem to be a risk factor for consecutive invasive GAS disease. The invasive GAS disease appears to be an independent event rather than following the preceding local GAS disease. Therefore, wisely chosen outpatient antibiotic treatment of suspected or proven noninvasive GAS disease in children remains justified and should be reinforced by current recommendations even in time periods of surging iGAS infections.

### High diagnostic accuracy of automated rapid strep A test reduces antibiotic prescriptions for children in the United Arab Emirates [^1161kGGg]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a rapidly-growing global health threat. Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens increase the burden of both healthcare-associated and community-acquired infections, leading to increased healthcare utilization and high mortality. Inappropriate antibiotic use in community and healthcare settings is a major driver of antibiotic resistance worldwide.

Recent estimates suggest that over 700,000 people die annually from antibiotic-resistant infections globally. International agencies have warned that in the absence of a coordinated global response to this epidemic, the death toll from drug-resistant infections could climb to 10 million annually, forcing 24 million people globally into extreme poverty (World Health Organization. New report calls for urgent action to avert antimicrobial resistance crisis. 2019).

Children are often prescribed antibiotics for potential streptococcal pharyngitis when in fact their signs and symptoms are suggestive of viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). It has been demonstrated that antibiotic prescribing practices vary by country and by provider specialty. Inappropriate antibiotic use results in increased rates of AMR and increased healthcare utilization due to adverse drug reactions.

Acute pharyngitis due to Streptococcus pyogenes or group A β-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS) is diagnosed in up to 37% of children with pharyngitis and requires antibiotic treatment. This has been traditionally thought of as an infection of school-age children; however, a recent meta-analysis estimated the prevalence of GAS pharyngitis in children under 5 years at 25%, supporting diagnostic testing in this age group when clinically indicated.

GAS is a leading global pathogen of infectious diseases. The spectrum of GAS disease extends from superficial infections (pharyngitis, impetigo) to invasive disease (abscesses, cellulitis, sepsis), toxin-mediated manifestations (scarlet fever, toxic shock syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis) and autoimmune sequelae (acute rheumatic fever [ARF], poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and rheumatic heart disease [RHD]). The most frequent manifestation of GAS infection is pharyngitis, with over 600 million new cases diagnosed per year and complications from invasive GAS disease resulting in 500,000 deaths globally.

### Clinical mimics: an emergency medicine-focused review of streptococcal pharyngitis mimics [^113HhDKt]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pharyngitis is a common disease in the emergency department (ED). Despite a relatively low incidence of complications, there are many dangerous conditions that can mimic this disease and are essential for the emergency physician to consider.

Objective

This article provides a review of the evaluation and management of group A β-hemolytic Streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis, as well as important medical conditions that can mimic this disease.

Discussion

GABHS pharyngitis often presents with fever, sore throat, tonsillar exudates, and anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. History and physical examination are insufficient for the diagnosis. The Centor criteria or McIsaac score can help risk stratify patients for subsequent testing or treatment. Antibiotics may reduce symptom duration and suppurative complications, but the effect is small. Rheumatic fever is uncommon in developed countries, and shared decision making is recommended if antibiotics are used for this indication. Oral analgesics and topical anesthetics are important for symptom management. Physicians should consider alternate diagnoses that may mimic GABHS pharyngitis, which can include epiglottitis, infectious mononucleosis, Kawasaki disease, acute retroviral syndrome, Lemierre's syndrome, Ludwig's angina, peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, and viral pharyngitis. A focused history and physical examination can help differentiate these conditions.

Conclusions

GABHS may present similarly to other benign and potentially deadly diseases. Diagnosis and treatment of pharyngitis should be based on clinical evaluation. Consideration of pharyngitis mimics is important in the evaluation and management of ED patients.

### The global burden of sore throat and group apharyngitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114HQwnU]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 2
Characteristics of studies with data on the incidence rate of Strep A sore throat.

Nine of the 13 studies that included children were conducted prospectively over a period of nine months or more. From those studies, the pooled IR of Strep A sore throat for children, most commonly aged 5–14 years, in those studies was 22.1 (95% CI 14.7–33.1) episodes per 100 child-years (Figure 4). Significant heterogeneity was present among those studies (I² = 98%, p < 0.001), which could not be explained by country, country income level, study duration, follow-up frequency, or microbiological testing frequency. From the sub-group analysis, no statistical evidence indicated a difference in pooled IRs of Strep A sore throat between LMICs and HICs (p = 0.190), with respective pooled IRs of 18.6 episodes (95% CI 11.6–29.9) and 30.9 episodes (95% CI 17.1–55.6) per 100 child-years. Given 1.3 billion children aged 5–14 years of age in 2020, the estimated global burden of Strep A sore throat among children is 288.6 million episodes and 0.1 million DALYs.

Figure 4
Pooled incidence rate of Strep A sore throat for children.

Four studies of children were not included in the pooled analysis. Data from the Italian study by Di Pierro et al. among 3-year-old children suggest an incidence rate of 121.1 episodes per 100 person-years based on a six-month follow-up period. The Ugandan study by DeWyer et al. among children aged 5–16 years reported an extrapolated IR of 540.0 episodes per 100 person-years from one month of surveillance. The Croatian study by Kostic et al. of children aged 6–7 years during autumn months had an extrapolated IR of 31.1 episodes per 100 person-years based on three months of follow up. Lastly, in the cumulative incidence study by Dierksen et al. among New Zealand children aged 5–13 years, 15.7% experienced one or more episodes of Strep A sore throat in a 10-month period.

### Locally delivered flurbiprofen 8.75 mg for treatment and prevention of sore throat: a narrative review of clinical studies [^1144bzLK]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Streptococcal versus Non-Streptococcal Pharyngitis

The effectiveness of flurbiprofen in patients with or without strep A/C sore throat has been assessed in several of the reviewed papers. In a paper by Shephard et al, subgroup data from two clinical trials were combined to evaluate the efficacy of flurbiprofen lozenges in patients with and without microbiologically proven strep A/C. Strep A/C was confirmed in 24% (96/401) of patients who had a throat culture test. Significant pain reduction (on the STPIS) with single-dose flurbiprofen compared with placebo was observed for up to 4 h (p < 0.01) for the overall population and for patients without strep A/C, and for up to 3 h for patients with strep A/C (both p < 0.05). There were no differences in treatment effects in the strep A/C group compared with the non-strep A/C group (p > 0.2 for all time points assessed up to 6 h). Likewise, there were no significant differences in flurbiprofen single-dose treatment effects in the strep A/C group compared with the non-strep A/C group for either difficulty swallowing or swollen throat (p > 0.05 for all time points assessed up to 6 h). With multiple-dose flurbiprofen, reductions in pain intensity, and improvements in difficulty swallowing and swollen throat, were also similar regardless of strep A/C status, although the improvements observed in the strep A/C group were not statistically different from placebo, possibly due to the small patient numbers or the natural improvement of throat symptoms over time.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children (update) [^1161NMiE]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Paradise criteria for tonsillectomy — recurrent throat infection in children requires specified episode frequency plus qualifying clinical features, treatment, and documentation. Minimum frequency is Seven or more episodes in the preceding year, OR Five or more episodes in each of the preceding 2 y, OR Three or more episodes in each of the preceding 3 y. Clinical features that qualify an episode are Temperature > 38.3°C (> 101°F), Cervical lymphadenopathy (tender lymph nodes or > 2 cm), Tonsillar exudate, or Positive culture for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and sore throat plus the presence of ≥ 1 qualifies as a counting episode. Treatment requires that antibiotics had been administered in conventional dosage for proved or suspected streptococcal episodes. Documentation requires contemporaneous clinical record for each episode OR, if not fully documented, subsequent observance by the clinician of 2 episodes with consistent patterns; children who meet all other criteria may nonetheless qualify if the same pattern is observed and documented by the clinician in 2 subsequent episodes, and a 12-month period of observation is usually recommended prior to consideration of tonsillectomy as an intervention.

### The impact of antibiotic therapy in psoriasis patients with active streptococcal infection: a prospective study [^114HM4Us]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Our study highlighted a significantly higher prevalence of confirmed streptococcal throat colonization in psoriasis patients (25.5%) compared to the control group (12.7%). Similarly, Gudjonsson et al. isolated β‐hemolytic streptococci from about 10% of psoriasis patients complaining of sore throat, while the same bacteria were found in < 1% of the controls. However, our study did not reveal any difference in prevalence of throat colonization between psoriatic males and females.

The diagnostic method used to assess the presence of active streptococcal infection was the MALDI‐TOF technique performed on cultured throat swabs, because the ASO titer cannot discriminate between active and past infection, and is, therefore, no longer considered a relevant diagnostic test alone.

To date, no antistreptococcal interventions are recommended in therapeutic guidelines for psoriasis, due to the lack of firm evidence of efficacy. Nevertheless, antibiotic therapy or tonsillectomy have already been adopted in the clinical practice to reduce psoriasis flares. Several authors in the literature reported efficacy of those interventions, although often through uncontrolled trials with wide heterogeneity in antimicrobial treatments and variable assessment methods of streptococcal infection. Therefore, the prescription of antibiotics or tonsillectomy for psoriasis remains controversial. In our study, analysis of the impact of tonsillectomy in a dedicated patient groups was not regarded as ethically possible as it would have represented an invasive treatment with the possibility of complications. However, our results do not support the effectiveness of adjunctive, anti‐streptococcal treatment after 18 months of follow‐up. In fact, patients with streptococcal throat colonization treated with a course of antibiotic therapy experienced a greater mean PASI reduction compared to patients without streptococcal pharyngitis, but the difference was not significant.

### The global burden of sore throat and group apharyngitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116H2VAm]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Three studies included data to determine IRs among adults or all ages; all were from Australia. Based on data from two studies reported by McDonald et al. the IRs of sore throat among Indigenous people in remote Northern and Central Australian communities were 0.5 episodes per 100 person-years and 13.4 episodes per 100 person-years, respectively. The Central Australian study also indicated an IR of 14.4 episodes per 100 person-years among adults (≥ 15 years old), which was comparable to the IR (13.5 episodes per 100 person-years) among the parents of children included in the Melbourne study by Danchin et al.

Five studies reported one or more episodes of sore throat in school-aged children (ranging from 5 to 29 years old) within a study period of 9–12 months. From these studies, a pooled cumulative incidence of 31.9 per 100 children (i.e. 31.9% of children) had one or more episodes of sore throat during the study periods (Appendix 4, Figure A1). Appendices 4 and 5 report further results.

Incidence of Strep A sore throat

15 studies reported the incidence of Strep A sore throat: 14 reported incidence rates, (Table 2), and one reported cumulative incidence. Of the 15 studies, 12 were conducted among children, one among children and their parents, and two among participants of all ages. Episodes of Strep A sore throat were ascertained via culture from throat swabs in all but one study; the study by DeWyer et al. used RADTs for Strep A, with throat culture performed on portions of RADT positive and negative cases. A single study provided an IR for serologically confirmed Strep A sore throat. The IR of Strep A sore throat ranged from 0.12 episodes per 100 child-yearsto 540.0 episodes per 100 child-years.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnant individuals [^112PewQo]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) treatment in pregnant individuals — clinicians should prescribe a 5–7-day course of targeted antibiotics for colony counts of 100,000 CFU/mL or higher, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against repeat screening after appropriate treatment; ASB is clinically significant at 100,000 CFU/mL (10⁵ CFU/mL) or higher, treatment should start once bacteriuria is confirmed and be adjusted per sensitivities, and normal vulvovaginal flora should not be treated. Group B strep should be treated if present in counts greater than 100,000 CFU/mL, whereas lower colony counts do not require treatment but should be noted for group B streptococcus prophylaxis at delivery; several randomized studies show that a 5–7-day duration is superior to single-dose treatment, with no difference in ASB recurrence, pyelonephritis, or preterm birth. Fosfomycin is an exception with single-dose efficacy making it a reasonable choice for 1-day treatment of ASB, and there are no studies assessing a 3-day treatment duration for ASB; there are also no studies to recommend for or against whether a test of cure or repeat screening is indicated after treatment.

GROUP A STREPTOCOCCAL PHARYNGEAL INFECTIONS

Bacteria are the second most common etiology of acute pharyngitis. Infection with β-hemolytic GAS, accounts for 5%–15% and 20%–30% of infections in adults and children, respectively. While acute pharyngitis caused by GAS can also be self-limited and resolve without antibiotic treatment, the clinical course of GAS pharyngitis can be associated with significant postinfectious sequelae and other complications. Inadequately or untreated GAS pharyngitis can lead to both nonsuppurative and/or suppurative complications, especially in children 3–15 years of age. Treatment consists of penicillin or amoxicillin, or for β-lactam allergic individuals, a first-generation cephalosporin, clindamycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin. Nonsuppurative complications are immune mediated and include poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, acute rheumatic fever, and rheumatic heart disease. Suppurative complications include abscess (brain, peritonsillar region, soft tissues of head and neck), cervical lymphadenitis, mastoiditis, meningitis, otitis media, sinusitis, and rarely septicemia. Based on 2010 estimates of deaths by rheumatic heart disease and other previous deaths by invasive GAS infections, GAS was postulated to be the fifth most lethal pathogen worldwide.

### Clinical score and rapid antigen detection test to guide antibiotic use for sore throats: randomised controlled trial of PRISM (primary care streptococcal management) [^116tu4mk]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine the effect of clinical scores that predict streptococcal infection or rapid streptococcal antigen detection tests compared with delayed antibiotic prescribing.

Design Open adaptive pragmatic parallel group randomised controlled trial.

Setting Primary care in United Kingdom.

Patients Patients aged ≥ 3 with acute sore throat.

Intervention An internet programme randomised patients to targeted antibiotic use according to: delayed antibiotics (the comparator group for analyses), clinical score, or antigen test used according to clinical score. During the trial a preliminary streptococcal score (score 1, n = 1129) was replaced by a more consistent score (score 2, n = 631; features: fever during previous 24 hours; purulence; attends rapidly (within three days after onset of symptoms); inflamed tonsils; no cough/coryza (acronym FeverPAIN).

Outcomes Symptom severity reported by patients on a 7 point Likert scale (mean severity of sore throat/difficulty swallowing for days two to four after the consultation (primary outcome)), duration of symptoms, use of antibiotics.

Results For score 1 there were no significant differences between groups. For score 2, symptom severity was documented in 80% (168/207 (81%) in delayed antibiotics group; 168/211 (80%) in clinical score group; 166/213 (78%) in antigen test group). Reported severity of symptoms was lower in the clinical score group (−0.33, 95% confidence interval −0.64 to −0.02; P = 0.04), equivalent to one in three rating sore throat a slight versus moderate problem, with a similar reduction for the antigen test group (−0.30, −0.61 to −0.00; P = 0.05). Symptoms rated moderately bad or worse resolved significantly faster in the clinical score group (hazard ratio 1.30, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.63) but not the antigen test group (1.11, 0.88 to 1.40). In the delayed antibiotics group, 75/164 (46%) used antibiotics. Use of antibiotics in the clinical score group (60/161) was 29% lower (adjusted risk ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 0.95; P = 0.02) and in the antigen test group (58/164) was 27% lower (0.73, 0.52 to 0.98; P = 0.03). There were no significant differences in complications or reconsultations.

Conclusion Targeted use of antibiotics for acute sore throat with a clinical score improves reported symptoms and reduces antibiotic use. Antigen tests used according to a clinical score provide similar benefits but with no clear advantages over a clinical score alone.

### Diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of group a streptococcal pharyngitis in children in a primary care setting: impact of point-of-care polymerase chain reaction [^115RyYmj]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the use of the POC PCR cobas Liat Strep A test in a large pediatric clinic increased the rates of accurately diagnosing GAS pharyngitis, provided results at the time of the clinic visit, and reduced inappropriate antibiotic prescribing compared with the recommended current treatment paradigm of RADT plus reflex culture. The American Society for Microbiology has recommended that clinics redesign their office workflow to incorporate POC testing. Additionally, PCR-based GAS pharyngitis testing, while not currently recommended in treatment guidelines, may produce results on par with gold standard laboratory testing; incorporation of PCR-based methods into practice guidelines could inform providers of the benefits of these methods and encourage their use. Thus, the use of POC PCR to diagnose GAS pharyngitis should be considered to improve patient care and office/provider efficiency.

### The potential global cost-effectiveness of prospective strep A vaccines and associated implementation efforts [^116PNHej]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Group A Streptococcus causes a wide range of diseases from relatively mild infections including pharyngitis to more severe illnesses such as invasive diseases and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). Our aim is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical Strep A vaccine on multiple disease manifestations at the global-level. Cost-effectiveness analyses were carried out by building on the potential epidemiological impact of vaccines that align with the WHO's Preferred Product Characteristics for Strep A vaccines. Maximum vaccination costs for a cost-effective vaccination strategy were estimated at the thresholds of 1XGDP per capita and health opportunity costs. The maximum cost per fully vaccinated person for Strep A vaccination to be cost-effective was $385–$489 in high-income countries, $213–$312 in upper-income-income countries, $74–$132 in lower-middle-income countries, and $37–$69 in low-income countries for routine vaccination at birth and 5 years of age respectively. While the threshold costs are sensitive to vaccine characteristics such as efficacy, and waning immunity, a cost-effective Strep A vaccine will lower morbidity and mortality burden in all income settings.

QUESTION 3. WHAT INPUT DATA AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS ARE THEREFORE REQUIRED?

The most important principle is to maximize the available data, applying explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. The lack of systematic surveillance data, especially for the highest-burden countries, means that modeling is inevitable for worldwide estimates. Given the complexity of methods and variable reporting approaches, there has been an erosion of public trust in estimates. Hence, to promote transparency, WHO with the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, Seattle, and some independent experts including some authors on this series, have published the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER), as a standard for reviewing data inputs, biases, and reporting methods. The articles in this supplement follow the GATHER checklist through the process from data assessment to final publication, including open access data and code (Table 3).

Table 3.
Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER)

To maximize data inputs, we review all published literature on GBS worldwide, applying prespecified criteria and case definitions (Figure 3). Databases searched include Medline, Embase, the WHO library database (WHOLIS), Scopus, and Literature in the Health Sciences in Latin America and the Caribbean (LILACS). For each paper, the particular search for GBS disease outcome is given according to international guidelines. In all papers we used Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms related to GBS: Streptococcus OR Streptococcal OR Streptococci AND (Group AND B) or agalactiae; Streptococcus agalactiae. When needed, secondary analyses were requested from authors. In addition, searches of trial and study registries were undertaken and investigators were approached. Data were abstracted by at least 2 people and assessed for biases as described in each of the relevant papers. Biases that apply to GBS data generally are discussed below and, where specific to a given parameter, are covered in the relevant paper. Meta-analyses were undertaken using random-effects modeling to estimate pooled measures of effect using the DerSimonian and Laird method.

Selection and attrition bias, practice effects

There was no evidence of clinical selection bias when we compared the patients in the two parts of the trial (appendix 3). Although the trial patients presented with slightly fewer streptococcal features compared with observational cohorts, when we selected practices recruiting patients with higher streptococcal scores the estimates of effect were larger, which suggests the trial results are possibly conservative.

Adjustment for practice as a covariate (that is, for potential confounding) provided similar estimates and inferences, whereas adjustment for clustering by practice resulted in slightly different inferences (table 3).

### Locally delivered flurbiprofen 8.75 mg for treatment and prevention of sore throat: a narrative review of clinical studies [^116jan57]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

In a study by Schachtel et al, strep A/C was detected in 34% (42/122) of patients, and efficacy of flurbiprofen lozenges in reducing sore throat symptoms (on the QuaSTI) was similar regardless of strep A/C status. In a further analysis of the data, among flurbiprofen-treated patients with strep A/C, 82% reported "meaningful" pain relief (on the STPIS) within 3 h compared with 78% in the non-strep group. Moreover, there was no significant difference in median time to "meaningful" relief for flurbiprofen-treated patients with or without strep A/C (41 min vs 43 min, respectively; p = 0.39). All patients with strep A/C reported "first perceived pain relief" with flurbiprofen within the 3-h study period. Likewise, in a study from Radkova et al, although only 5.4% (22/411) of patients tested positive for strep A/C sore throat, subgroup analyses showed similar efficacy (change in pain intensity on the STPIS at 2 h) with flurbiprofen spray and lozenges regardless of strep A/C status.

Concomitant Antibiotic Use

In a study from Blagden et al,59% (135/230) of flurbiprofen lozenge-treated patients also took concomitant antibiotics, as did 58% (133/229) of placebo-treated patients. Antibiotic usage did not affect sore throat relief (reported as TOTPAR) over days 1–4 within the flurbiprofen treatment group.

### Clinical score and rapid antigen detection test to guide antibiotic use for sore throats: randomised controlled trial of PRISM (primary care streptococcal management) [^116sPdqb]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the effect of clinical scores that predict streptococcal infection or rapid streptococcal antigen detection tests compared with delayed antibiotic prescribing.

Design

Open adaptive pragmatic parallel group randomised controlled trial.

Setting

Primary care in United Kingdom.

Patients

Patients aged ≥ 3 with acute sore throat.

Intervention

An internet programme randomised patients to targeted antibiotic use according to: delayed antibiotics (the comparator group for analyses), clinical score, or antigen test used according to clinical score. During the trial a preliminary streptococcal score (score 1, n = 1129) was replaced by a more consistent score (score 2, n = 631; features: fever during previous 24 hours; purulence; attends rapidly (within three days after onset of symptoms); inflamed tonsils; no cough/coryza (acronym FeverPAIN).

Outcomes

Symptom severity reported by patients on a 7 point Likert scale (mean severity of sore throat/difficulty swallowing for days two to four after the consultation (primary outcome)), duration of symptoms, use of antibiotics.

Results

For score 1 there were no significant differences between groups. For score 2, symptom severity was documented in 80% (168/207 (81%) in delayed antibiotics group; 168/211 (80%) in clinical score group; 166/213 (78%) in antigen test group). Reported severity of symptoms was lower in the clinical score group (-0.33, 95% confidence interval -0.64 to -0.02; P = 0.04), equivalent to one in three rating sore throat a slight versus moderate problem, with a similar reduction for the antigen test group (-0.30, -0.61 to -0.00; P = 0.05). Symptoms rated moderately bad or worse resolved significantly faster in the clinical score group (hazard ratio 1.30, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.63) but not the antigen test group (1.11, 0.88 to 1.40). In the delayed antibiotics group, 75/164 (46%) used antibiotics. Use of antibiotics in the clinical score group (60/161) was 29% lower (adjusted risk ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 0.95; P = 0.02) and in the antigen test group (58/164) was 27% lower (0.73, 0.52 to 0.98; P = 0.03). There were no significant differences in complications or reconsultations.

Conclusion

Targeted use of antibiotics for acute sore throat with a clinical score improves reported symptoms and reduces antibiotic use. Antigen tests used according to a clinical score provide similar benefits but with no clear advantages over a clinical score alone.
