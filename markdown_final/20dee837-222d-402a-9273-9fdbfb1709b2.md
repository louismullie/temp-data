## Question

Is magnesium an appropriate treatment for restless leg during pregnancy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether magnesium is an appropriate treatment for restless legs syndrome (RLS) in pregnancy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying RLS versus common mimics in pregnancy. Then, I should review direct evidence for magnesium in RLS. Next, I will check guideline recommendations (AAN, AASM, IRLSSG) specific to pregnancy. After that, I need to evaluate magnesium safety in pregnancy by route and duration. Then, I should consider mechanistic plausibility (iron–dopamine biology) versus magnesium. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation, including what to do instead and any exceptions if magnesium deficiency is documented [^113zLwBM] [^116CXWFV].

> Let me first confirm the clinical target so we do not conflate entities. RLS is defined by an urge to move the legs, worse at rest, relieved by movement, and with evening–night predominance; mimics like nocturnal leg cramps are common in pregnancy but are pathophysiologically distinct and require different evidence bases, so I should not mix those literatures when judging magnesium for RLS specifically [^1128dGqf] [^113zLwBM] [^111YQedb].

> Now, I will examine direct efficacy data for magnesium in RLS. The most focused analysis is a 2019 systematic review that screened 855 records and found only eight small, heterogeneous studies; the single RCT did not show a significant benefit, leading to an inconclusive conclusion about magnesium's effectiveness for RLS or PLMD, which makes me cautious about recommending it as therapy for RLS during or outside pregnancy [^1134Vhop]. Wait, let me verify if any newer controlled data change this; I see an open-label 2024 pilot suggesting improvement with magnesium citrate in 12 adults, but without a control arm and not in pregnancy — useful hypothesis-generating data, not practice-changing evidence [^115215f2]. There is also a pregnancy case report where RLS improved with IV magnesium sulfate given for preterm labor, but that single case cannot establish efficacy for RLS treatment in pregnant patients broadly [^111QQwCY].

> Next, I should review what high-credibility guidelines say. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — do any pregnancy-specific RLS guidelines endorse magnesium? The IRLSSG pregnancy/lactation guideline emphasizes nonpharmacologic measures and iron replacement when indicated; it does not recommend magnesium for RLS, and neither do AAN 2016 nor AASM 2025 RLS guidelines, which instead prioritize iron repletion strategies, alpha-2-delta ligands, and carefully selected dopaminergic or opioid therapies when necessary, with pregnancy-specific risk–benefit considerations noted by AASM 2025 [^113zLwBM] [^114NcAuB] [^114bhdcp] [^116CXWFV].

> I need to check safety profiles because pregnancy changes the calculus. For magnesium sulfate, the FDA warns about continuous maternal administration beyond 5–7 days due to fetal risks, and systematic reviews show increased maternal side effects with parenteral regimens; rare but serious events (e.g., respiratory depression) occur with dosing errors or susceptible comorbidities, so prolonged IV use is not appropriate for RLS, which is a chronic/intermittent condition in pregnancy [^115KU2ML] [^1112VHYW] [^112bFkab]. Let me verify the flip side — short courses of IV magnesium are standard for eclampsia prevention and neuroprotection, supporting that brief use can be safe for those indications, but that does not translate into justification for RLS treatment indications or chronic exposure [^114FSupH]. For oral magnesium, typical supplemental doses are generally well tolerated in pregnancy, yet efficacy for RLS is unproven, and no pregnancy-specific RLS data establish benefit, so safety alone is not enough to endorse it as RLS therapy [^111J6hMe].

> Mechanistically, I should confirm whether magnesium aligns with known RLS biology. RLS pathophysiology centers on brain iron deficiency and dopaminergic dysfunction with strong genetic signals (e.g. MEIS1), whereas a magnesium-based mechanism is not well supported; in contrast, iron is biologically integral to dopamine synthesis and has supportive therapeutic evidence, which coheres with the guideline emphasis on iron assessment and repletion [^117834Zx] [^114mcTWe] [^114bhdcp] [^113hLU7z]. Hmm, wait a minute — if magnesium deficiency is common in pregnancy, could that indirectly justify magnesium for RLS? Even if prevalence of hypomagnesemia is nontrivial in some cohorts, the link to RLS improvement is unproven, so I should avoid extrapolating deficiency prevalence to RLS treatment efficacy without controlled data [^113wtisU].

> Let me synthesize the evidence. The best available data do not show convincing efficacy for magnesium in RLS, guidelines do not recommend it, and safety concerns emerge with prolonged IV exposure in pregnancy, while oral magnesium lacks RLS-specific efficacy data; therefore, magnesium should not be considered an evidence-based treatment for RLS in pregnancy at this time [^1134Vhop] [^113zLwBM] [^115KU2ML].

> I should double-check the standard-of-care pathway for pregnant patients with RLS so the recommendation is complete. The approach is: confirm the diagnosis and exclude mimics; implement nonpharmacologic measures (sleep hygiene, moderate exercise, avoidance of caffeine/antihistamines); obtain morning iron studies off supplements; replete iron if ferritin is ≤ 75 ng/mL (oral ferrous sulfate plus vitamin C or IV iron depending on ferritin/transferrin saturation thresholds and tolerability); and reserve pharmacotherapy for severe, refractory symptoms with pregnancy-specific risk–benefit review and shared decision-making, recognizing that evidence for many agents in pregnancy is limited [^113zLwBM] [^114NcAuB] [^113hLU7z] [^116CXWFV].

> But wait, what if the presenting complaint is actually leg cramps rather than RLS? Magnesium has been studied for pregnancy leg cramps with mixed and limited evidence, and even there conclusions are uncertain; this does not justify using magnesium for RLS, which remains a distinct entity with different diagnostic criteria and treatment evidence [^111YQedb] [^117LJtZw].

> Exception and clarification: if laboratory-confirmed hypomagnesemia is present, I would correct it because repleting a deficiency is standard care in pregnancy; however, that treats the electrolyte disorder, not RLS per se, and it should not be framed as RLS-specific therapy in the absence of evidence for symptom benefit in RLS [^115KU2ML] [^113wtisU]. Hold on, I should verify dosing and monitoring — parenteral regimens are reserved for acute indications with time-limited courses and careful monitoring, whereas oral magnesium can be used to correct deficiency but should not be expected to relieve RLS symptoms based on current data [^115KU2ML].

> Bottom line: No, magnesium is not an appropriate treatment for RLS in pregnancy given insufficient efficacy evidence, absence from authoritative guidelines, and safety concerns with prolonged IV exposure; instead, follow pregnancy-focused RLS best practices with diagnostic confirmation, nonpharmacologic strategies, iron testing and repletion when indicated, and judicious use of pharmacotherapy only when benefits clearly outweigh risks in shared decision-making [^1134Vhop] [^113zLwBM] [^114NcAuB] [^114bhdcp] [^116CXWFV].

Magnesium supplementation is **not supported by strong evidence** for treating restless legs syndrome (RLS) in pregnancy [^1134Vhop], and current guidelines do not recommend it as first-line therapy [^116CXWFV] [^113zLwBM]. Magnesium is generally safe at standard doses, but high or prolonged use [^115KU2ML] can cause maternal and fetal adverse effects [^1112VHYW] [^116StjDb]. Clinicians should **prioritize iron supplementation when ferritin is low** [^114bhdcp], use non-pharmacologic measures [^113zLwBM], and reserve magnesium for documented deficiency or refractory cases, with close monitoring [^115KU2ML].

## Prevalence and clinical significance of RLS in pregnancy

RLS **affects about 21% of pregnant women** [^1123zW54], increasing with gestation and peaking in the third trimester. It is associated with poor sleep, daytime dysfunction, and reduced quality of life [^117Xz9nv]. Symptoms often improve postpartum [^114ztF2N]; however, pregnancy-related RLS increases the risk of chronic RLS later [^114mCStq].

---

## Magnesium supplementation: evidence for efficacy in RLS during pregnancy

- **Evidence base**: Data on magnesium for RLS in pregnancy are limited and inconclusive [^1134Vhop].
- **Systematic review**: A 2019 review [^1134Vhop] found insufficient evidence for magnesium in RLS/PLMD; the only RCT showed no significant benefit and may have been underpowered.
- **Pregnancy-specific data**: No robust RCTs support magnesium for RLS in pregnancy; a single case report described symptom resolution with IV magnesium sulfate [^111QQwCY], but this is anecdotal.

---

## Safety considerations of magnesium supplementation during pregnancy

- **General safety**: Magnesium is usually safe at standard doses, but high or prolonged use can cause adverse effects [^115KU2ML].
- **Maternal risks**: Increased risk of hypotension, tachycardia [^1112VHYW], and injection-site problems with magnesium sulfate.
- **Fetal risks**: Prolonged high-dose IV magnesium has been linked to fetal bone demineralization and fractures [^116StjDb] [^115KU2ML].
- **Oral magnesium**: Generally safe at recommended doses, but high doses can cause GI upset and, rarely, hypermagnesemia [^111J6hMe].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

No major guidelines **recommend magnesium as first-line therapy** for RLS in pregnancy. The IRLSSG emphasizes non-pharmacologic measures and iron supplementation when ferritin is low and **does not endorse magnesium** [^113zLwBM]. The AASM recommends considering pregnancy-specific safety profiles but **does not endorse magnesium** [^116CXWFV].

---

## Alternative treatments and management strategies

Recommended **non-pharmacologic measures** include sleep hygiene, regular moderate exercise, and avoidance of exacerbating factors [^113zLwBM]. Iron supplementation is **strongly recommended when ferritin is low**, as iron deficiency is a key contributor to RLS [^114NcAuB] [^113zLwBM]. Pharmacologic options such as dopamine agonists and gabapentinoids are effective for RLS in general [^117ADTfp] [^114mcTWe] but are used cautiously in pregnancy due to limited safety data [^112e32qd].

---

## Clinical recommendations and practical considerations

- **Assessment**: Evaluate iron status and correct deficiencies before considering magnesium [^113hLU7z].
- **Magnesium use**: Consider only for documented deficiency or refractory cases, with close monitoring [^116CXWFV].
- **Monitoring**: Watch for maternal hypotension, tachycardia [^1112VHYW], and GI upset; monitor fetal growth and bone health if prolonged high-dose use is necessary [^116StjDb].
- **Patient education**: Discuss limited evidence, potential risks, and alternative strategies [^1134Vhop].

The US FDA raised concern about prolonged Mg++ use in pregnancy. This was prompted by 18 reported cases of fetal and neonatal bone demineralization and fractures following long-term in utero exposure to intravenous magnesium over a mean of 9.6 weeks, at a mean total cumulative maternal dose of 3700 g. This adverse outcome was not seen in prior RCTs of 24–48 hour intravenous Mg++ sulfate for fetal neuroprotection (n = 6145 infants) or for the prevention of eclampsia in mothers with preeclampsia (n = 11,444 women, including 3283 children followed to 18 months of age). The latter level I evidence does not negate the risk of prolonged intravenous Mg++ to fetal bone development, but the level IV data about potential harm are sparse and reflect very high doses of intravenous Mg++ sulfate.

### Magnesium supplementation for the treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder: A systematic review [^1134Vhop]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Magnesium supplementation is often suggested for restless legs syndrome (RLS) or periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) based on anecdotal evidence that it relieves symptoms, and because it is also commonly recommended for leg cramps. We aimed to review all articles reporting the effects of magnesium supplementation on changes in RLS and/or PLMD. We conducted a systematic search looking for all relevant articles, and then two reviewers read all article titles and abstracts to identify relevant studies. Eligible studies were scored for their quality as interventional trials. We found 855 abstracts, and 16 of these could not be definitively excluded for not addressing all aspects of our research question. Seven full-text articles were unlocatable and one was ineligible, which left eight studies with relevant data. One was a randomized placebo-controlled trial, three were case series, and four were case studies. The RCT did not find a significant treatment effect of magnesium but may have been underpowered. After quality appraisal and synthesis of the evidence, we were unable to make a conclusion as to the effectiveness of magnesium for RLS/PLMD. It is not clear whether magnesium helps relieve RLS or PLMD, or in which patient groups any benefit might be seen.

### Consensus clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease during pregnancy and lactation [^113zLwBM]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS)/Willis-Ekbom disease (WED) is common during pregnancy, affecting approximately one in five pregnant women in Western countries. Many report moderate or severe symptoms and a negative impact on sleep. There is very little information in the medical literature for practitioners on the management of this condition during pregnancy. Accordingly, a task force was chosen by the International RLS Study Group (IRLSSG) to develop guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of RLS/WED during pregnancy and lactation.

A committee of nine experts in RLS/WED and/or obstetrics developed a set of 12 consensus questions, conducted a literature search, and extensively discussed potential guidelines. Recommendations were approved by the IRLSSG executive committee, reviewed by IRLSSG membership, and approved by the WED Foundation Medical Advisory Board. These guidelines address diagnosis, differential diagnosis, clinical course, and severity assessment of RLS/WED during pregnancy and lactation.

- **Nonpharmacologic approaches**: These include reassurance, exercise, and avoidance of exacerbating factors.
- **Iron supplementation**: A rationale for iron supplementation is presented.
- **Medications for RLS/WED**: Medications are risk/benefit rated for use during pregnancy and lactation, with a few rated as "may be considered" when RLS/WED is refractory to more conservative approaches.

An algorithm summarizes the recommendations. These guidelines are intended to improve clinical practice and promote further research.

### Maternal adverse effects of different antenatal magnesium sulphate regimens for improving maternal and infant outcomes: a systematic review [^1112VHYW]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Women receiving magnesium sulphate were almost five times more likely to experience 'any side effects' in the four included trials (RR 4.62; 95% CI 2.42 to 8.83; 13,322 women; Analysis 1.7). Compared with women receiving no treatment or a placebo, women receiving magnesium sulphate experienced an approximately 50% increased risk of hypotension (RR 1.52; 95% CI 1.10 to 2.11; 3 trials, 1,782 women; Analysis 1.11) and tachycardia (RR 1.53; 95% CI 1.03 to 2.29; 1 trial, 1,062 women; Analysis 1.12). Furthermore, these women experienced an approximately 50% increased risk of problems at the IM injection site (RR 1.49; 95% CI 1.25 to 1.79; 1 trial, 4,553 women; Analysis 1.25) and more than six times the risk of problems or discomfort at the IV site (RR 6.34; 95% CI 3.10 to 12.98; 3 trials, 8,704 women; Analysis 1.24).

### Restless legs syndrome [^1128dGqf]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome is a common neurologic movement disorder that affects approximately 10 percent of adults. Of those affected with this condition, approximately one third have symptoms severe enough to require medical therapy. Restless legs syndrome may be a primary condition, or it may be secondary to iron deficiency, renal failure, pregnancy, or the use of certain medications. The diagnosis is clinical, requiring an urge to move the legs usually accompanied by an uncomfortable sensation, occurrence at rest, improvement with activity, and worsening of symptoms in the evening or at night.

Restless legs syndrome causes sleep disturbances, is associated with anxiety and depression, and has a negative effect on quality of life. Treatment of secondary causes of restless legs syndrome may result in improvement or resolution of symptoms. Currently, there is little information regarding the effects of lifestyle changes on the symptoms of restless legs syndrome. If medications are needed, dopamine agonists are the primary medications for moderate to severe restless legs syndrome. Other medications that may be effective include gabapentin, carbidopa/levodopa, opioids, and benzodiazepines.

### Interventions for leg cramps in pregnancy [^111YQedb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Leg cramps are a common problem in pregnancy, and various interventions have been used to treat them. These include drug, electrolyte, vitamin therapies, and non-drug therapies. This Cochrane Review is an update of a review first published in 2015.

- **Objective**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of different interventions for treating leg cramps in pregnancy.

- **Search methods**: We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) as of 25 September 2019, along with reference lists of retrieved studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of any intervention for the treatment of leg cramps in pregnancy were compared with placebo, no treatment, or other treatments. Quinine was excluded due to its known adverse effects. Cluster-RCTs were eligible for inclusion, while quasi-RCTs and cross-over studies were excluded.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and checked them for accuracy. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

- **Main results**: We included eight small studies (576 women). Our primary outcome was the frequency of leg cramps; secondary outcomes included the intensity and duration of leg cramps, adverse outcomes for mother and baby, and health-related quality of life. Overall, the studies were at a low or unclear risk of bias. Outcomes were reported in different ways, precluding the use of meta-analysis, thus data were limited to single trials.

### Magnesium for skeletal muscle cramps [^117LJtZw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Skeletal muscle cramps are common and often occur in association with pregnancy, advanced age, exercise, or motor neuron disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Typically, these cramps have no obvious underlying pathology and are thus termed idiopathic. Magnesium supplements are marketed for the prophylaxis of cramps; however, the efficacy of magnesium for this purpose remains unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2012 to identify and incorporate more recent studies.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of magnesium supplementation compared to no treatment, placebo control, or other cramp therapies in people with skeletal muscle cramps.

- **Search methods**: On 9 September 2019, the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL Plus, AMED, and SPORTDiscus were searched. Furthermore, WHO-ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for registered trials that might be ongoing or unpublished, as well as ISI Web of Science for studies citing those included in this review.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of magnesium supplementation (in any form) to prevent skeletal muscle cramps in any patient group (i.e. all clinical presentations of cramp) were considered. We compared magnesium to no treatment, placebo control, or other therapies.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. Two review authors also assessed the risk of bias. We attempted to contact all study authors when questions arose and obtained participant-level data.

### Treating restless legs syndrome was associated with low risk of cardiovascular disease: A cohort study with 3.4 years of follow-up [^1136n9ar]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The exact reason why an improvement in restless legs syndrome (RLS) would lead to a decrease in RLS-related cardiovascular risk is unknown. An intermediary mechanism may be an improvement in sleep, as it is well known that RLS causes severe insomnia and insomnia alone can increase cardiovascular risk. However, our study was based on claims data, so we did not have access to detailed sleep schedule histories. It is likely that if there is an impact of medication on sleep, it results from an improvement in RLS symptoms rather than a direct impact on sleep since none of the medications studied, except the benzodiazepines, are used as hypnosedatives.

One could also consider that dopaminergic agents might lower cardiovascular risk through their hypotensive effect. However, this antihypertensive effect is not characteristic of the other therapeutic agents in this study, suggesting that the improvement in cardiovascular disease (CVD) could result from the direct impact of the various therapeutic modalities on RLS symptoms.

The agents in this study have been shown to ameliorate RLS symptoms in both short-term and long-term studies. In some cases, however, long-term treatment with dopaminergic therapy may lead to a paradoxical worsening of symptoms, known as augmentation. As this study was based on claims data, we did not have any long-term measure of augmentation. Despite the lack of this measure, the study demonstrates that long-term treatment with these agents effectively reduces cardiovascular disease risks in patients with RLS.

### Current guidelines and standards of practice for restless legs syndrome [^116UHLvp]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Algorithms for the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) include both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapy. Patients with RLS are divided into three groups: (1) those with intermittent RLS symptoms, (2) those with daily RLS symptoms, and (3) those whose symptoms are refractory to standard treatments. Many patients do not require medication, and symptoms often can be relieved with good sleep hygiene and avoidance of medications and factors that provoke symptoms.

Recent large-scale clinical trials have proved the efficacy of therapy for RLS when it is required. Several classes of medications are helpful, but dopaminergic therapy appears to be most effective and relieves symptoms rapidly. The first step in managing RLS is to ensure that there is an adequate diagnosis; this involves discriminating RLS from other conditions that may share a number of features. Finally, it is important to tailor treatment to the needs of each individual patient.

### The BRAzil MAGnesium (BRAMAG) trial: A randomized clinical trial of oral magnesium supplementation in pregnancy for the prevention of preterm birth and perinatal and maternal morbidity [^111TRD6S]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

At high intravenous doses of Mg++ sulphate, maternal side effects such as nausea, cutaneous flushing, lassitude, and muscle weakness are common, essentially bordering between a therapeutic versus a toxic effect. Mg++ intoxication causes a reduction in serum calcium concentration, leading to a rapid decline in maternal serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration; hypocalcaemia may be partly due to the suppressive effects of acute hypermagnesaemia on PTH secretion. Intravenous Mg++ sulphate crosses the placental barrier, which may have a neuroprotective effect on the very preterm fetus, including a reduction in the risk of cerebral palsy, without increasing the risk of perinatal death.

While 300 mg of Mg++ citrate contains 12.4 mmol of Mg++, a fair amount is not absorbed, whereas intravenous MgS04 has nearly 100% bioavailability. With oral Mg++ therapy, the normal serum Mg++ level is 0.75 to 0.95 mmol/L. In one RCT of 4 weeks of supplemental oral Mg++ oxalate (400 mg twice daily) in middle-aged non-pregnant adults, serum Mg++ levels only changed from 0.84 to 0.89 mmol/L. In a second RCT of 16 weeks of Mg++ chloride (2500 mg per day) among non-pregnant adults with diabetes mellitus, serum Mg++ levels changed from 0.64 to 0.74 mmol/L. In contrast, among pregnant women who receive intravenous Mg++ sulphate — whether as a tocolytic agent in preterm labor, for preeclampsia, or for fetal neuroprotection — serum Mg++ levels rapidly rise to sustained concentrations of 2.0 mmol/L or more. Certainly, acute neonatal depression is positively correlated with maternal serum Mg++ concentrations.

Regarding medical management for restless legs syndrome, specifically with respect to agents with no evidence for benefit, the AAN 2016 guidelines provide recommendations. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against the use of gabapentin, iron sucrose, oxycodone, clonazepam, bupropion, clonidine, selenium, rifaximin, botulinum neurotoxin, valproic acid, carbamazepine, or valerian in the treatment of RLS.

Regarding medical management for restless legs syndrome, particularly in terms of iron supplementation, the AAN 2016 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of ferrous sulfate with vitamin C. This treatment aims to alleviate symptoms in patients with RLS who have a serum ferritin level of ≤ 75 ng/mL.

### Restless legs syndrome and sleep-wake disturbances in pregnancy [^117Xz9nv]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to estimate the association of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and its frequency with sleep-wake disturbances in pregnancy. A cohort of 1,563 women in their third trimester of pregnancy was recruited from prenatal clinics between March 2007 and December 2010. Demographic, pregnancy, and delivery data were extracted from medical records, and sleep information was collected using questionnaires. To diagnose RLS, we used standardized criteria for RLS symptoms and frequency developed by the International Restless Legs Study Group. Logistic regression models were constructed to investigate the association of RLS and its frequency with sleep-wake disturbances, including poor sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, poor daytime function, and delivery outcomes.

Overall, 36% of the pregnant women had RLS, with half experiencing moderate to severe symptoms. Compared to women without RLS, those with RLS were more likely to have poor sleep quality (odds ratio [OR] 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7–2.9), poor daytime function (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4–2.4), and excessive daytime sleepiness (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.3–2.0). A dose-response relationship was evident between RLS frequency and each of the sleep-wake disturbances. There was no evidence of any association between RLS and delivery outcomes.

Restless legs syndrome is a significant contributor to poor sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and poor daytime function — conditions that are common and often debilitating during pregnancy. Obstetric health care providers should be aware of these associations and screen women for RLS.

### The restless legs syndrome [^11771Mkt]. The Lancet Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

The restless legs syndrome is a common disorder characterized by an idiopathic form of genetic or unknown origin, as well as symptomatic forms associated with various causes. Symptomatic forms can occur during pregnancy and coincide with conditions such as uraemia, iron depletion, polyneuropathy, spinal disorders, and rheumatoid arthritis.

Hereditary forms have identified at least three gene loci located on chromosomes 12, 14, and 9. Prevalence in the general population ranges between 3% and 9%, increases with age, and is observed to be higher in women than in men. Treatment is necessary only for moderate to severe forms of the disorder, primarily affecting elderly individuals.

Pathophysiology and treatment might be closely linked to the dopaminergic system and iron metabolism. Dopaminergic treatment with levodopa and dopamine agonists is preferred for idiopathic restless legs syndrome; however, monitoring for augmentation and rebound is essential in long-term treatment. Alternative treatment options include various other drugs, such as opioids, gabapentin, and benzodiazepines.

### Practice guideline summary: Treatment of restless legs syndrome in adults: Report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^112z3r2z]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

To make evidence-based recommendations regarding restless legs syndrome (RLS) management in adults, articles were classified according to the 2004 American Academy of Neurology evidence rating scheme, and recommendations were linked to the strength of evidence.

- **Results and recommendations**: In moderate to severe primary RLS, clinicians should consider prescribing medication to reduce RLS symptoms. There is strong evidence supporting the use of pramipexole, rotigotine, cabergoline, and gabapentin enacarbil (Level A). Moderate evidence supports the use of ropinirole, pregabalin, and IV ferric carboxymaltose (Level B). Clinicians may consider prescribing levodopa (Level C). There are few head-to-head comparisons to suggest agents preferentially, and cabergoline is rarely used due to cardiac valvulopathy risks. Augmentation risks with dopaminergic agents should be considered.

- **Treatment of periodic limb movements of sleep**: Clinicians should consider prescribing ropinirole (Level A) or pramipexole, rotigotine, cabergoline, or pregabalin (Level B).

- **Subjective sleep measures**: Clinicians should consider prescribing cabergoline or gabapentin enacarbil (Level A), or ropinirole, pramipexole, rotigotine, or pregabalin (Level B).

- **For patients failing other treatments for RLS symptoms**: Clinicians may consider prescribing prolonged-release oxycodone/naloxone where available (Level C). In patients with RLS and ferritin levels ≤ 75 μg/L, clinicians should consider prescribing ferrous sulfate with vitamin C (Level B).

### Characteristics and determinants of restless legs syndrome in pregnancy: a prospective study [^114ztF2N]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

The aim of this cohort study was to prospectively assess the frequency, characteristics, and determinants of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in pregnancy and its impact on sleep.

- **Methods**: Pregnant women were prospectively studied in each trimester and 8 weeks postpartum. Assessments included interviews about RLS symptoms and sleep disturbances, standardized sleep-wake questionnaires including the International Restless Legs Syndrome Scale (IRLSS) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire (PSQI), actigraphic recording of periodic limb movements (PLM), and blood tests including levels of hemoglobin, ferritin, and estrogen.

- **Results**: RLS was diagnosed in 58 of 501 women (12%). A positive family history was found in 37% of women with RLS, while 59% reported onset of RLS symptoms before the 20th week. Additionally, 45% had an IRLSS > 20 and 100% had a PSQI > 5. Hemoglobin levels < 11 g/dL were found in 20% of both affected and unaffected women in the third trimester. Women with and without RLS had similar hemoglobin, ferritin, and estrogen levels. Notably, IRLSS and PLM in sleep dropped by more than 50% postpartum in women with RLS.

- **Conclusion**: We found a lower prevalence and earlier onset of symptoms compared to previous studies and confirmed significant improvement after delivery. RLS is clinically relevant due to its severe impact on sleep quality. Genetic factors and smoking, but not ferritin, anemia, or estrogen levels, seem to play a role in the pathophysiology of RLS in pregnancy.

### Risk factors and comorbidities associated with magnesium deficiency in pregnant women and women with hormone-related conditions: Analysis of a large real-world dataset [^116rZWYf]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

Magnesium is one of the essential minerals involved in numerous metabolic functions. Magnesium deficiency is linked to various diseases and conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, and neurological and cardiovascular events. It is estimated that 48–60% of adults do not meet the average recommended dietary intake of magnesium, and 15–42% of apparently healthy individuals are shown to have magnesium deficiency. Magnesium deficiency occurs more frequently in women than in men; this may be partially influenced by the fact that estrogen stimulates magnesium utilization by tissues, and hormonal rhythms in women may affect and modulate magnesium status.

Assessing magnesium levels presents a challenge due to its predominant retention in soft tissues and bones. Magnesium in the blood accounts for only about 0.8% of all magnesium in the body, with 0.3% contained in serum and 0.5% in red blood cells. Since magnesium level is most frequently assessed by measuring blood serum concentration, magnesium deficiency may be masked by apparently normal serum levels, and its prevalence may be underestimated. Furthermore, there is no uniform lower reference limit for serum magnesium level, with cut-offs ranging between 0.66 mmol/L and 0.85 mmol/L in different studies.

Although the majority of adults will not experience serious consequences, subclinical magnesium deficiency may have a more profound effect on individuals in high-risk groups, such as pregnant women and women undergoing menopause, who are at risk of osteoporosis. Pregnancy is associated with a need for increased magnesium intake.

### Maternal adverse effects of different antenatal magnesium sulphate regimens for improving maternal and infant outcomes: A systematic review [^112upg2v]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

The results of the search strategy, including the sources of the studies, culling, and final inclusion of studies, are shown in Figure 1. The initial database search identified 5,062 articles. Reviewing abstracts/titles and excluding irrelevant/duplicate articles yielded 1,034 articles. Of these, 896 were excluded for documented reasons. We, therefore, included 138 studies, along with an additional five studies identified through other searches, resulting in a total of 143 studies (see Additional File 3 for references to all included reports). In the case of multiple publications from the same study, we included the report with the most relevant data relating to adverse effects.

- **Flow diagram of included studies**: Figure 1 contains a flow diagram of the included studies. *Numbers indicate the level of evidence according to the Australian Government National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Evidence Hierarchy.*

- **Evidence from randomised controlled trials**: Twenty-one randomised trials (16,812 women) were included, the characteristics of which are detailed in Additional File 4, and the risk of bias assessment is presented in Figures 2, 3, and 4. The trials assessed a variety of different treatment regimens with varying comparators and are, therefore, assessed under six different comparisons.

### Review of the role of the endogenous opioid and melanocortin systems in the restless legs syndrome [^1165yrkk]. Brain (2024). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) has five obligatory criteria for diagnosis: (i) an urge to move the legs often accompanied by uncomfortable leg sensations; (ii) symptoms are worse at rest, i.e. lying or sitting; (iii) there is at least partial and temporary relief of symptoms by activity, e.g. walking, stretching, or bending the legs; (iv) symptoms are worse later in the day or at night; and (v) mimics of RLS such as leg cramps and positional discomfort should be excluded by history and physical examination.

Opioids have been found effective in double-blind studies and also in the long term in RLS. Although addiction and tolerance have been found to be low in studies of opioids for RLS, most standards and practice guidelines suggest that they be reserved as a third-line agent for refractory RLS because of these concerns. They, however, have been endorsed for use in RLS in standards and practice documents from the American Academy of Neurology, the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and the Scientific and Medical Advisory Board of the Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation. They are also federally approved for use in refractory RLS in most countries in Western Europe. Because of the marked response of RLS to opioid therapy, several studies have been undertaken to determine a potential role for the endogenous opioid system in the pathogenesis of RLS. These studies are summarized below.

### Prevalence of restless legs syndrome during pregnancy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1123zW54]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Pregnant women are more likely to be affected by restless legs syndrome (RLS) than the general population. Restless legs syndrome during pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Currently unknown is the worldwide and regional prevalence of RLS in pregnant women. We performed a meta-analysis to provide a full profile of the prevalence of RLS during pregnancy.

A systematic search of the PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases was conducted to identify studies published up to April 2017, followed by random-effects meta-analyses. A total of 196 articles were identified, among which 27 longitudinal and cross-sectional observational studies with 51,717 pregnant subjects were included in the analysis. The pooled overall prevalence of RLS across all three trimesters was 21%.

According to the regional classification of the World Health Organization, the prevalence of RLS during pregnancy in the European Region, Western Pacific Region, Eastern Mediterranean Region, and Region of the Americas was 22%, 14%, 30%, and 20%, respectively. The regional prevalence in the African Region and South-East Asia Region was not assessed due to insufficient data.

We also analyzed the prevalence of RLS in the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy, and the rates of RLS were 8%, 16%, and 22%, respectively. Notably, the high prevalence of RLS decreased to 4% after delivery. No publication bias was found in these analyses. The findings emphasize the high occurrence of RLS during pregnancy. Future studies should examine the effects of RLS in greater detail to understand its impacts fully.

### Interventions for chronic kidney disease-associated restless legs syndrome [^114TpCEH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is defined as the spontaneous movement of the limbs (mainly legs) associated with an unpleasant, sometimes painful sensation that is relieved by moving the affected limb. The prevalence of RLS among people on dialysis has been estimated to be between 6.6% and 80%. RLS symptoms contribute to impaired quality of life, and people with RLS are shown to have increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Various pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have been used to treat primary RLS; however, the evidence for the use of these interventions in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not well established. The agents used in the treatment of primary RLS may be limited by side effects in people with CKD due to increased comorbidity and altered drug pharmacokinetics.

- **Objectives**: The aim of this review was to critically assess the benefits, efficacy, and safety of various treatment options used in the treatment of RLS in people with CKD and those undergoing renal replacement therapy (RRT). We aimed to define different group characteristics based on CKD stage to assess the applicability of a particular intervention to an individual patient.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 12 January 2016 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that assessed the efficacy of an intervention for RLS in adults with CKD were eligible for inclusion.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study with dipyridamole for restless legs syndrome [^116W5DDM]. Movement Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

The study was conducted at the Sleep Research Institute in Madrid, Spain, and was approved by the local institutional review board. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. This research was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial, involving 28 previously untreated patients diagnosed with idiopathic restless legs syndrome (RLS). These patients were treated over two consecutive two-week periods with either dipyridamole or a placebo.

Patients included in the study met the 2014 International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group diagnostic criteria for idiopathic RLS and had an International Restless Legs Rating Scale (IRLS) score of greater than 20 at baseline. They experienced symptoms at least three times per week and did not show significant RLS symptoms before 7:00. Furthermore, they were not suffering from augmentation and none had been previously treated with dipyridamole.

Before commencing the study treatment, patients underwent a two-week washout period for any other psychoactive substances. During the trial, the drug (either placebo or dipyridamole) was administered at a dose of 100 mg/day for the first three days, which was then increased to 200 mg/day. If deemed clinically necessary, the dose was further increased to 300 mg/day during the second week. After a one-week washout period, patients started a new two-week treatment period with the alternative treatment regimen.

A computerized randomization list ensured patients were allocated to each treatment order on a 1:1 basis. The staff responsible for the randomization list had no contact with the patients and did not influence the order of treatment, which was conveyed via a sealed envelope. Masking of the medication was implemented using appropriate methods.

### Exposure to medication for neurological disease in pregnancy - time to consider the long-term implications [^112e32qd]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Exposure to medication for neurological disease during pregnancy poses significant concerns regarding the long-term implications on both maternal and fetal health. Recent studies have highlighted the need for thorough research in evaluating the safety and efficacy of these medications. The review aims to raise awareness and prompt consideration of potential risks, encouraging healthcare providers to monitor and manage medication exposure carefully in pregnant patients dealing with neurological conditions.

### Intravenous magnesium sulfate may relieve restless legs syndrome in pregnancy [^111QQwCY]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

We report a case of restless legs syndrome (RLS) that improved after intravenous magnesium sulfate administration. A 34-year-old gravida 1 para 0 woman, with a 13-year history of RLS, was prescribed bed rest due to pre-term labor at 26 weeks. While at rest, the subject experienced severe RLS. She was later admitted to the hospital for pre-term labor. Treatment for pre-term labor included intravenous magnesium sulfate. RLS symptoms completely resolved during treatment, beginning the first day of administration. Studies involving intravenous magnesium treatment for RLS have not included pregnant women. The authors propose that intravenous magnesium sulfate may alleviate RLS in some pregnant women.

### Clinical trials in restless legs syndrome — recommendations of the European RLS Study Group (EURLSSG) [^114CTw36]. Movement Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

The European Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) Study Group (EURLSSG) is an association of European RLS experts who are actively involved in RLS research. A major aim of the study group is the development and continuous improvement of standards for the diagnosis and treatment of RLS. Several members developed study designs and evaluation methods in investigator-initiated trials early in the 1990s, and all members have since contributed to many pivotal and non-pivotal drug trials for the treatment of RLS.

The recommendations on clinical investigations of pharmacological treatment of RLS patients summarize the group's expertise and knowledge acquired through clinical trials. The recommendations primarily address how to plan and conduct confirmatory, randomized clinical studies in patients with idiopathic RLS. Advice is presented for the diagnosis of RLS and clinical and polysomnographic inclusion and exclusion criteria. Primary and secondary endpoints for the evaluation of efficacy are based on a critical description of validated methods for both short- and long-term trials, also in special populations (children, pregnant women, elderly patients). The recommendations include the assessment of augmentation.

Finally, general issues including the evaluation of safety and tolerability, as well as specific neurological and cardiovascular risks and sleep attacks/daytime somnolence, are discussed. The aim of these recommendations is to support research groups or pharmaceutical companies in the design of optimized study protocols.

### Rls patients: who are they [^112Y4ndS]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Four essential diagnostic criteria for restless legs syndrome (RLS) have been identified. Patients experience an urge to move the legs, which typically begins or worsens during periods of rest. The symptoms are at least partially relieved by movement and are typically worse in the evening and night than in the day. All four criteria are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of RLS. In addition, a family history of RLS, the presence of periodic leg movements in sleep, and a positive response to dopaminergic therapy are useful supportive clinical features to confirm the diagnosis.

While many cases of RLS are idiopathic, secondary RLS is often observed in pregnant women, patients who have severe renal dysfunction, or those with iron deficiency. Several other conditions have symptoms similar to those of RLS, but a detailed patient history is usually sufficient to identify these differential diagnoses. The accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of RLS should result in considerable improvements in patients' quality of life.

### Sleep during pregnancy [^115sLk2a]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2022). Low credibility.

This article provides a brief review of the most recent findings on sleep, insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and restless leg syndrome (RLS) during pregnancy.

- **Recent findings**: Recent meta-analyses indicate that 38.2% of pregnant women experience insomnia, 15% experience obstructive sleep apnea, and 20% experience restless leg syndrome. Poor sleep during pregnancy is associated with increased odds of preterm birth, cesarean section, hypertension, gestational diabetes, and longer deliveries. OSA is also linked to poor outcomes such as maternal hypertension, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and low infant Apgar scores. The incidence of new-onset RLS increases with parity, gestational age, maternal age, and increased maternal adiposity.

Typical treatments have proven effective for managing sleep disorders in pregnant women. Ensuring sufficient sleep quality and quantity, alongside assessing and treating sleep disorders, should be a priority for pregnant women and their healthcare providers.

### Magnesium supplementation in pregnancy [^111J6hMe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Magnesium is an essential mineral required for the regulation of body temperature, nucleic acid and protein synthesis, and maintaining nerve and muscle cell electrical potentials. Many women, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, have low intakes of magnesium. Magnesium supplementation during pregnancy may reduce fetal growth restriction and pre-eclampsia and increase birthweight.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of magnesium supplementation during pregnancy on maternal, neonatal/infant, and paediatric outcomes.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 March 2013).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials assessing the effects of dietary magnesium supplementation during pregnancy were included. The primary outcomes were perinatal mortality (including stillbirth and neonatal death prior to hospital discharge), small-for-gestational age, maternal mortality, and pre-eclampsia.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies.

- **Main results**: Ten trials involving 9090 women and their babies were included; one trial had a cluster design (with randomisation by study centre). All 10 trials randomly allocated women to either an oral magnesium supplement or a control group; in eight trials, a placebo was used, and in two trials, no treatment was given to the control group. In the 10 included trials, the compositions of the magnesium supplements, gestational ages at commencement.

### Pharmacologic therapy for primary restless legs syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117ADTfp]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder characterized by unpleasant sensations in the legs and a distressing, irresistible urge to move them. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and comparative effectiveness of pharmacologic treatments for primary RLS.

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), published in English, reporting efficacy outcomes and harms of pharmacologic treatments for primary RLS of at least four weeks' duration. MEDLINE and other databases were searched through June 2012. Reviewers extracted outcomes and adverse events and rated the strength of evidence.

We identified 29 eligible RCTs. High-strength evidence indicated that the proportion of patients who had a clinically important response (International Restless Legs Syndrome [IRLS] responders), defined as a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in mean IRLS symptom scale scores, was greater with dopamine agonist therapy compared with placebo (61% vs. 41%) (risk ratio, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.38–1.86]; 7 trials). Dopamine agonists also improved patient-reported sleep scale scores and quality-of-life measures. Furthermore, high-strength evidence demonstrated that calcium channel alpha-2-delta ligands increased the proportion of IRLS responders compared with placebo (61% vs. 37%) (risk ratio, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.33–2.09]; 3 trials). Adverse events associated with dopamine agonists included nausea, vomiting, and somnolence, while alpha-2-delta ligands were associated with somnolence and unsteadiness or dizziness.

### Evidence of involvement of the calcitonin gene-related peptide in restless legs syndrome [^117MJK6D]. Movement Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sensory‐motor disorder characterized by an urge to move the legs, often accompanied by unpleasant sensations, particularly during rest. Treatments typically include iron supplementation, dopamine agonists, and opioids, but there is a need for new therapeutic approaches. Dysfunction of the A11 nucleus, which modulates dopaminergic transmission to the spinal cord, is thought to play a role in the pathophysiology of RLS. Calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP), involved in pain modulation, may interact with A11 pathways and suggest its potential role in RLS.

This study aimed to assess the involvement of CGRP in RLS by determining whether CGRP‐related proteins are overexpressed in RLS patients. A cross‐sectional study was conducted with 17 drug‐free RLS patients (mean age 55.8 years) and 17 age‐ and gender‐matched controls. Serum samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography‐parallel reaction monitoring‐tandem mass spectrometry (LC‐PRM‐MS/MS) to identify and quantify CGRP‐related proteins. Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to differentiate between the groups.

PCA showed clear differentiation between RLS and control groups. Among 13 identified CGRP‐related proteins, 10 were dysregulated in RLS patients: 8 were upregulated, and 2 were downregulated, including notable proteins such as S100A12, ADM, SRSF6, and ADM2.

This study indicates the significant involvement of CGRP and related proteins in RLS, suggesting that these proteins may play roles in various aspects of the disorder. Further research is necessary to explore these findings.

### Treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^113hLU7z]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for restless legs syndrome, particularly in relation to serum iron tests, the AASM 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining serum iron studies, including ferritin and transferrin saturation (calculated from iron and total iron-binding capacity). These tests should ideally be conducted in the morning, with patients avoiding all iron-containing supplements and foods for at least 24 hours before the blood draw, in all patients with clinically significant RLS.

### Risk factors and comorbidities associated with magnesium deficiency in pregnant women and women with hormone-related conditions: Analysis of a large real-world dataset [^113wtisU]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). High credibility.

Although the importance of magnesium in pregnancy and various hormone-related conditions is widely recognized, further studies are needed to establish the prevalence of magnesium deficiency and to what extent low magnesium levels can be linked to patient outcomes and comorbidities. To this end, four large observational studies were conducted between 2012 and 2016 across the Russian Federation. These studies assessed the prevalence and clinical management of magnesium deficiency in pregnant women (MAGIC, MAGIC2) and in women with hormone-related conditions (MAGYN, MAGYN2) using a magnesium deficiency questionnaire (MDQ) and a blood test assessing serum magnesium levels.

These studies showed an unexpectedly high prevalence of magnesium deficiency, assessed using both MDQ and blood magnesium test. Here, we present the results of a secondary analysis of the prevalence of magnesium deficiency in women with hormone-related conditions and pregnant women with symptoms of magnesium deficiency in the pooled population and evaluate its association with risk factors and comorbidities related to magnesium deficiency in these cohorts.

### Identification of novel risk loci for restless legs syndrome in genome-wide association studies in individuals of European ancestry: a meta-analysis [^117834Zx]. The Lancet Neurology (2017). High credibility.

Restless legs syndrome is a prevalent chronic neurological disorder with potentially severe mental and physical health consequences. A clearer understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is needed to improve treatment options. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to identify potential molecular targets.

- **Methods**: In the discovery stage, we combined three GWAS datasets (EU-RLS GENE, INTERVAL, and 23andMe) with diagnosis data collected from 2003 to 2017, through face-to-face interviews or via questionnaires, involving 15,126 cases and 95,725 controls of European ancestry. We identified common variants by fixed-effect inverse-variance meta-analysis. Significant genome-wide signals (p ≤ 5×10⁻⁸) were tested for replication in an independent GWAS of 30,770 cases and 286,913 controls, followed by a joint analysis of the discovery and replication stages. We performed gene annotation, pathway, and gene-set-enrichment analyses and studied the genetic correlations between restless legs syndrome and traits of interest.

- **Findings**: We identified and replicated 13 new risk loci for restless legs syndrome and confirmed the previously identified six risk loci. MEIS1 was confirmed as the strongest genetic risk factor for restless legs syndrome (odds ratio 1.92, 95% CI 1.85–1.99). Gene prioritization, enrichment, and genetic correlation analyses showed that identified pathways were related to neurodevelopment and highlighted genes linked to axon guidance (associated with SEMA6D), synapse formation (NTNG1), and neuronal specification (HOXB cluster family and MYT).

### Treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^112LQezZ]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of restless legs syndrome, specifically concerning iron supplementation, the AASM 2025 guidelines recommend initiating iron supplementation with oral or IV formulations, such as ferrous sulfate, in pediatric patients with RLS and serum ferritin levels below 50 ng/mL (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence).

### Practice guideline summary: Treatment of restless legs syndrome in adults: Report of the Guideline Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^116k7xDk]. Neurology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for restless legs syndrome, particularly concerning the use of opioids, the 2016 AAN guidelines recommend considering the use of prolonged-release oxycodone/naloxone (where available) for patients with RLS who have not responded to other treatments. It is essential to balance the potential benefits of this approach against the known risks associated with opioid use.

### Gitelman syndrome patient managed with amiloride during pregnancy and lactation [^113qdaxx]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

We are aware of only four previous reports of amiloride use during pregnancy in GS patients. In all cases, amiloride was used due to persistent hypokalemia unresponsive to potassium and magnesium supplementation alone. All pregnancies resulted in healthy newborns; however, one pregnancy required labor induction at 38 weeks of gestation due to oligohydramnios. The use of amiloride in our case was necessary to maintain adequate potassium and magnesium serum levels in our patient, thus preventing further serious complications. Although amiloride is classified by the FDA as category B in terms of teratogenicity, no randomized clinical trials have been conducted to investigate its actual safety profile in humans during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

In conclusion, we report a safe and effective use of amiloride during pregnancy in a GS patient, which facilitated control of her persistent hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia despite oral supplementation therapy. However, due to the uncertainty regarding its safety during breastfeeding and the limited available literature, we cannot make a definitive recommendation for amiloride use during this period. Accordingly, we suggest that more clinical studies are needed to evaluate the safety profile of amiloride therapy during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

### Comorbidities, treatment, and pathophysiology in restless legs syndrome [^114mcTWe]. The Lancet Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome, also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a common neurological condition influenced by complex environmental and genetic interactions. This syndrome can occur independently, often at a young age, or alongside comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and arterial hypertension, complicating proper diagnosis. The concept of restless legs syndrome being either primary or secondary to another condition has been challenged, with genetic data providing further insight into its pathophysiology.

Although dopaminergic treatment was previously the first-line therapy, its prolonged use can lead to a serious symptom worsening known as augmentation. Clinical studies on pregabalin, gabapentin enacarbil, oxycodone-naloxone, and iron preparations have introduced new treatment options. However, most patients still report inadequate long-term symptom management. Studies of hypoxic pathway activation and iron deficiency have offered valuable insights into the pathophysiology of restless legs syndrome, which should now be translated into more effective treatments.

### Iron for the treatment of restless legs syndrome [^116dDccQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurologic disorder associated with peripheral iron deficiency in a subgroup of patients. It is unclear whether iron therapy is an effective treatment for RLS.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral or parenteral iron for the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) when compared with placebo or other therapies.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL for the period January 1995 to September 2017. We also searched reference lists for additional published studies and ClinicalTrials.gov along with other clinical trial registries (September 2017) for ongoing or unpublished studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Controlled trials comparing any formulation of iron with placebo, other medications, or no treatment, in adults diagnosed with RLS according to expert clinical interview or explicit diagnostic criteria.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality, discussing to reach consensus in the case of any disagreement. The primary outcome considered in this review was restlessness or unpleasant sensations, as subjectively experienced by the patient. We combined treatment/control differences in outcomes across studies using random-effects meta-analyses. We analyzed continuous data using mean differences (MDs) where possible and performed standardized mean difference (SMD) analyses when different measurements were used across studies.

### Maternal adverse effects of different antenatal magnesium sulphate regimens for improving maternal and infant outcomes: A systematic review [^114CLfwY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

- **Inclusion criteria**: We included intervention studies (randomised, cluster-randomised, quasi-randomised, and non-randomised comparative studies) and observational studies (cohort, case-control, cross-sectional, case series, and case reports). Studies available as abstracts only, along with full-text publications, were included. Personal blogs and discussion forum threads from pregnancy-related internet sites, together with incident reports from patient safety organisations, were also considered.

- **Participants, interventions, and comparisons**: We included women given antenatal magnesium sulphate for various reasons: for pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (including when continued or initiated in the immediate postpartum period), for tocolysis in women in preterm labour or those who had experienced at least one episode of threatened preterm labour, and for neuroprotection of the fetus in women at risk of preterm birth (less than 37 weeks' gestation) or at term. This was regardless of the regimen for administration, including cases of iatrogenic overdoses. We excluded studies where women were given oral magnesium sulphate, where it was used as an adjuvant during anaesthesia, or where it was combined with another agent for tocolysis. Comparisons included instances where magnesium sulphate was compared to no placebo, a placebo, a different magnesium sulphate regimen, or where the study's exposure was magnesium sulphate. Studies comparing magnesium sulphate to an alternative therapy were excluded.

### Magnesium sulfate [^115KU2ML]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The dosage of magnesium sulfate must be carefully adjusted according to individual requirements and response, and administration of the drug should be discontinued as soon as the desired effect is obtained.

Both intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) administration are appropriate. IM administration of the undiluted 50% solution results in therapeutic plasma levels within 60 minutes, whereas IV doses will provide a therapeutic level almost immediately. The rate of IV injection should generally not exceed 150 mg per minute (1.5 mL of a 10% concentration or its equivalent), except in severe eclampsia with seizures. Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities.

Solutions for IV infusion must be diluted to a concentration of 20% or less prior to administration. The diluents commonly used are 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. Deep IM injection of the undiluted (50%) solution is appropriate for adults; however, the solution should be diluted to a 20% or less concentration prior to such injection in children.

In the treatment of mild magnesium deficiency, the usual adult dose is 1 g, equivalent to 8.12 mEq of magnesium (2 mL of the 50% solution) injected IM every six hours for four doses, equivalent to a total of 32.5 mEq of magnesium per 24 hours. For severe hypomagnesemia, as much as 250 mg (approximately 2 mEq) per kg of body weight (0.5 mL of the 50% solution) may be given IM within a period of four hours if necessary.

### Pre-pregnancy restless legs syndrome (Willis-Ekbom disease) is associated with perinatal depression [^113YmZUv]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Both restless legs syndrome (RLS, also known as Willis-Ekbom Disease or WED) and depression are common during pregnancy. However, no prior studies have assessed if pregnant women with RLS have an elevated risk of depression during and/or after pregnancy.

- **Methods**: 1,428 women who were pregnant in gestational weeks 16–17 were asked to participate in a longitudinal survey. They were followed by web-based questionnaires in gestational weeks 17 and 32, and 6 weeks after delivery. Data were also retrieved from prenatal and birth records. Two different sets of criteria were used to examine the prevalence of RLS in the cohort: the International Restless Legs Syndrome Society Group standard criteria and the later developed CH-RLSQ11 questionnaire. The latter questionnaire attempts to exclude those with common "mimics" of RLS.

- **Results**: Adjusted odds ratio for depression in gestational weeks 17, 32, and postpartum week 6 in relation to pre-pregnancy RLS onset and moderate to severe symptom severity were 4.74 (2.30–9.76), 3.67 (1.85–7.28), and 2.58 (1.28–5.21), respectively. No significant associations were seen in pregnant women with de novo RLS during pregnancy. When using the standard diagnostic RLS criteria and frequency of symptoms more than 2–3 days per week, the prevalence of RLS was 12.3%. With the CH-RLSQ11 questionnaire and the same threshold for frequency of symptoms, the prevalence was 6.5%.

- **Conclusion**: Women with RLS onset before pregnancy with moderate or severe symptoms had an increased risk of both antenatal and postnatal depression.

### Treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^114bhdcp]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for restless legs syndrome, the AASM 2025 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of iron supplementation with specific oral or IV iron preparations in adult patients with RLS who have serum ferritin levels ≤ 75 ng/mL or transferrin saturation < 20%. In cases where serum ferritin levels are between 75–100 ng/mL, only IV iron should be considered:

- **IV ferric carboxymaltose**: Useful for patients with low serum ferritin levels.
- **IV low molecular weight ferric derisomaltose**: Appropriate for targeted supplementation.
- **IV ferumoxytol**: An alternative for iron replenishment needs.
- **Ferrous sulfate**: An oral alternative for patients with lower iron requirements.

These recommendations aim to improve patient outcomes by addressing iron deficiency, a key factor in the management of restless legs syndrome.

### What treatment works best for restless legs syndrome? Meta-analyses of dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic medications [^115pCPYc]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, only dopamine agonists are licensed for the treatment of restless legs syndrome (RLS) in various countries, but randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been performed with other treatments. We performed comprehensive meta-analyses and indirect comparisons of RCTs for all currently recommended treatments of RLS.

- **Methods**: We searched the Central, Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases. Outcome measures were the International RLS Study Group Severity Scale (IRLS), Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I), Periodic Limb Movement Index (PLMI), and psychosocial parameters such as quality of life (QoL). We also conducted indirect comparisons by testing for heterogeneity between the substance groups.

- **Results**: Placebo (58 trials) and actively (4 trials) controlled RCTs with dopamine agonists (38 trials), levodopa (4 trials), anticonvulsants (13 trials) — most of them with α₂δ ligands (11 trials) — opioids (1 trial), and iron treatments (6 trials) were included (9596 patients). Although treatment effects showed large variations, changes in the IRLS in the substance groups were comparable (P = 0.78), with a mean reduction in the IRLS of -5.47 points for dopamine agonists, -5.12 points for anticonvulsants (α₂δ ligands and levetiracetam), and -4.59 points for iron treatments. The CGI-I indicated slightly different treatment effects between the substance groups, while PLMI changes during treatment differed (P = 0.002), showing a marked decrease with dopamine agonists (-22.50/h), levodopa (-26.01/h), and oxycodone (-34.46/h) compared with other treatments.

### Predisposing factors of restless legs syndrome in pregnancy [^115pu3bu]. Movement Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

The occurrence of restless legs syndrome in pregnancy is well known, yet the mechanism of this association remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify the factors that predispose women to restless legs syndrome during pregnancy. A total of 146 pregnant women were included in the study. Patients were asked questions regarding demographic characteristics, complications of pregnancy, medical therapy (vitamin and iron intake), sleep disorders, muscle cramps, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Electroneurography, routine blood biochemistry tests, complete blood count, and thyroid function tests were performed. Vitamin B12, folic acid, serum iron, iron-binding capacity, ferritin, iron saturation, prolactin, estradiol, and progesterone levels were measured.

Of the participants, 38 were diagnosed as having restless legs syndrome. In women with restless legs syndrome, additional medical problems, night cramps, and excessive daytime sleepiness were more frequent. Conversely, in women without restless legs syndrome, serum hemoglobin levels were significantly higher, and the use of supplemental iron or vitamins was greater. Among the women with restless legs syndrome, progesterone levels were slightly higher; however, this difference was not statistically significant. In summary, this study found that lower hemoglobin levels and supplementation deficits of iron and vitamins were risk factors for restless legs syndrome in pregnancy.

### Magnesium citrate monotherapy improves restless legs syndrome symptoms and multiple suggested immobilization test scores in an open-label pilot study [^115215f2]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

An estimated 3% of the population has clinically significant restless legs syndrome. Given the limited pharmacological options available, there is a need for a therapeutic agent with an improved side effect profile.

- **Methods**: Twelve treatment-naive adults (10 women and 2 men with a median age of 41.5 [32–48.5] years) with primary restless legs syndrome were recruited for this open-label pilot study. Magnesium citrate 200 mg was administered daily for 8 weeks. The following were measured before and after supplementation: serum magnesium levels, International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group Rating Scale, Kohnen quality of life scale, and multiple suggested immobilization tests (three 1-hour tests). Paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used for data analysis. Pearson and Spearman's analyses assessed the association between magnesium levels and restless legs syndrome variables.

- **Results**: Participants had a significant reduction in International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group Rating Scale scores (6.67 [2.33–11], P = 0.006) and improved Kohnen quality of life scores (8.5 [2.09–14], P = 0.014) without notable differences in serum magnesium levels (P = 0.3). The median periodic limb movements during wakefulness index (30.40 [5.20, 122.40] to 8.63 [0.32, 17.47], P = 0.043) and self-reported discomfort score (19 [14, 30.5] to 6 [0, 8], P = 0.0010) across all 3 multiple suggested immobilization test trials also demonstrated improvement. Serum magnesium levels negatively correlated with multiple suggested immobilization test self-reported scores and the periodic limb movement index.

### Treating restless legs syndrome was associated with low risk of cardiovascular disease: A cohort study with 3.4 years of follow-up [^112zcgTm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

We identified patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS), aged ≥ 20 years, using the RLS International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD‐9), code (333.94) recorded between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2008. To enhance statistical power, a 1:6 matching ratio was employed, pairing each participant with RLS to six control participants without RLS, matched by birth year and sex.

All participants adhered to the following criteria:

1. They were free of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary heart disease, stroke, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure, as well as malignancy (with ICD‐9 codes: 140–172, 174–199.1, and 200–208), and end‐stage renal disease (ICD‐9 code 585.6) before January 1, 2009.
2. They were not pregnant for at least a year before the RLS diagnosis date (the first RLS ICD‐9 code).
3. They had continuous enrollment in a medical and pharmacy benefits program from 2006 to 2008.
4. They possessed complete data on exposure, outcome, and covariates.

The analysis included 24,199 participants with RLS and 145,194 age- and sex-matched participants without RLS (average age, 49 years; 31% men). Within the timeframe of 2006 to 2008, we identified 16,694 patients with RLS who received any RLS-related medications, including non-ergot-dopaminergic agents, ergot-dopaminergic agents, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, and opiates. Additionally, 7,505 patients with RLS were identified as not receiving treatment. The initial date of RLS treatment receipt was used as the index date for patients with RLS who were treated.

### Postpartum depressive symptoms and its association to daytime sleepiness and restless legs during pregnancy [^116k5dQs]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Screening for RLS involved using the four questions set by the International RLS Study Group for diagnosing restless legs syndrome in epidemiological studies. These questions addressed whether the women experienced unpleasant sensations in their legs combined with a need for movement, if these sensations were chiefly present at rest and decreased by movement, if the sensations were worse in the evenings or during the nights compared to the mornings, and how often the sensations occurred. Women who answered positively to the first three questions and experienced the symptoms at least once per month were considered sufferers from restless legs.

At the postpartum check-up, depressive symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), which is specifically designed for detecting postpartum depression. The original English version of the EPDS and the Swedish translation used in this study are both validated instruments. The scale comprises ten self-reported items measuring common symptoms of depression, each scored on a four-point scale (0–3) to rate the intensity of depressive symptoms during the previous seven days. The maximum score is 30. To identify all actual major depression cases, Cox et al. proposed a cut-off level of ≥ 10 to reduce detection failure in the postpartum period. Using this threshold increased the sensitivity for detecting major depression to almost 100% and specificity to 82%. In this study, a cut-off level of ≥ 10 was employed.

### Iron for restless legs syndrome [^113A5zT4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurologic syndrome associated with iron deficiency in many patients. It remains unclear whether iron therapy is an effective treatment for RLS. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of iron supplementation, either oral or intravenous, for patients with RLS.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (January 1995 to April 2011), EMBASE (January 1995 to April 2011), PsycINFO (January 1995 to April 2011), and CINAHL (January 1995 to April 2011). Corresponding authors of included trials and additional members of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group were contacted to locate additional published or unpublished trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We included controlled trials comparing any formulation of iron with placebo, other medications, or no treatment in adults diagnosed with RLS according to expert clinical interviews or explicit diagnostic criteria.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors extracted data and at least two authors assessed trial quality. We contacted trial authors for missing data.

- **Main results**: Six studies, comprising a total of 192 subjects, were identified and included in this analysis. The quality of the trials was variable. Our primary outcome was restlessness or uncomfortable leg sensations, quantified using the International Restless Legs Scale (IRLS) severity scale in four trials and another RLS symptom scale in a fifth trial. Combining data from the four trials using the IRLS severity scale revealed no clear benefit from iron therapy for reducing IRLS severity score.

### Maternal adverse effects of different antenatal magnesium sulphate regimens for improving maternal and infant outcomes: a systematic review [^112bFkab]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Seventy-five studies describing a total of 137 case reports of maternal adverse effects were included [see Table 7; the more detailed characteristics of cases are presented in Additional file 7].

- **Adverse effects from case reports**: Iatrogenic overdoses (16 reports) and rapid administration of magnesium sulphate (one report) were associated with a range of serious adverse events, such as respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, cardiopulmonary arrest, and death. A detailed account noted 52 errors associated with magnesium sulphate administration, including seven cases resulting in death or women remaining in a persistent vegetative state. Additional errors related to the epidural or intrathecal administration of magnesium sulphate were associated with pain, inadequate pain relief, or temporary paralysis (four reports).

Women at an increased risk of adverse effects were described in 11 reports, including women with renal failure (three reports) and women with neuromuscular junction disorders, myopathies, and neuropathologies (eight reports). In neurological cases, magnesium sulphate administration, according to recommended regimens, was associated with muscle pain, weakness, or temporary paralysis, and associated respiratory problems. The interaction of magnesium sulphate with agents used in general anesthesia (10 reports) and with antihypertensive agents, including nifedipine (six reports), was associated with varying adverse effects, most commonly muscular weakness or paralysis, and altered clinical states.

### Identification of novel risk loci for restless legs syndrome in genome-wide association studies in individuals of European ancestry: a meta-analysis [^112twrKS]. The Lancet Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Restless legs syndrome is a prevalent chronic neurological disorder with potentially severe mental and physical health consequences. A clearer understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is needed to improve treatment options. We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify potential molecular targets.

In the discovery stage, we combined three GWAS datasets (EU-RLS GENE, INTERVAL, and 23andMe) with diagnosis data collected from 2003 to 2017, gathered in face-to-face interviews or via questionnaires. This involved 15,126 cases and 95,725 controls of European ancestry. Common variants were identified by fixed-effect inverse-variance meta-analysis. Significant genome-wide signals (p ≤ 5 × 10⁻⁸) were tested for replication in an independent GWAS of 30,770 cases and 286,913 controls, followed by a joint analysis of the discovery and replication stages. We performed gene annotation, pathway, and gene-set-enrichment analyses and studied the genetic correlations between restless legs syndrome and traits of interest.

We identified and replicated 13 new risk loci for restless legs syndrome and confirmed the previously identified six risk loci. MEIS1 was confirmed as the strongest genetic risk factor for restless legs syndrome (odds ratio 1.92, 95% CI 1.85–1.99). Gene prioritization, enrichment, and genetic correlation analyses showed that identified pathways were related to neurodevelopment. The analyses highlighted genes linked to axon guidance (associated with SEMA6D), synapse formation (NTNG1), and neuronal specification (HOXB cluster).

### Magnesium for skeletal muscle cramps [^111aYeRn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Skeletal muscle cramps are common and frequently presented to physicians, often associated with pregnancy, advanced age, exercise, or disorders of the motor neuron, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Magnesium supplements are marketed for the prophylaxis of cramps; however, the efficacy of magnesium for this indication has not been evaluated by systematic review.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of magnesium supplementation compared to no treatment, placebo control, or other cramp therapies in people with skeletal muscle cramps.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (11 October 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2011, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to September 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to September 2011), LILACS (January 1982 to September 2011), CINAHL Plus (January 1937 to September 2011), AMED (January 1985 to October 2011), and SPORTDiscus (January 1975 to September 2011).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of magnesium supplementation (in any form) to prevent skeletal muscle cramps in any patient group, encompassing all clinical presentations of cramp. Comparisons included magnesium versus no treatment, placebo control, or other therapies.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. They also assessed the risk of bias. Attempts were made to contact all study authors, and patient-level data were obtained for three of the included trials, one of which was unpublished. All data on adverse effects were collected.

### Risk factors and comorbidities associated with magnesium deficiency in pregnant women and women with hormone-related conditions: Analysis of a large real-world dataset [^1146uLSc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

This manuscript summarizes a part of the secondary analysis of pooled data collected in four observational studies of magnesium deficiency in pregnant women and women with hormone-related conditions: MAGIC (DIREGL06157), MAGIC2 (DIREGL06468), MAGYN (MAGNEL06863), and MAGYN2 (MAGNEL07741).

- **Study design and patients**: MAGIC and MAGIC2 enrolled pregnant women (N = 1130 and N = 2117, respectively) during routine visits to maternity welfare centers. Women were included in the studies if they were > 18 years of age, were pregnant, and had suspected magnesium deficiency (fatigue, muscle cramps, etc). The study excluded women who reported other known or obvious reasons for magnesium deficiency beside pregnancy. MAGYN and MAGYN2 studies enrolled women with hormone-related conditions (N = 9168 and N = 11,424, respectively) attending outpatient clinics. Women were included if they were 18–60 years of age and used hormonal contraception or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or had one of the following conditions: premenstrual syndrome (PMS), climacteric syndrome without HRT, osteoporosis, or other hormonal conditions (including endometriosis, polycystic ovarian disease, uterine leiomyoma, dysmenorrhea, endometrial hyperplasia). Women were excluded if they had severe conditions potentially hindering participation in the study or were receiving magnesium supplementation at baseline.

The present analysis included all patients who fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria in the studies. Patients with missing data, contradictory/inconsistent data, or outlier data were excluded.

### Transient RLS during pregnancy is a risk factor for the chronic idiopathic form [^114mCStq]. Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to determine whether restless legs syndrome (RLS) during pregnancy is a risk factor for the later development of chronic idiopathic RLS. Pregnancy is known to be a risk factor for transient RLS, which typically resolves in the postdelivery period.

A long-term follow-up study was conducted as an extension of a previous survey on RLS during pregnancy. After a mean interval of 6.5 years, 207 parous women were contacted to compare the incidence of RLS between subjects who never experienced symptoms and those who reported RLS during the previously investigated pregnancy.

Seventy-four women who experienced RLS during a previous pregnancy, and 133 who did not, participated in the study. The incidence of RLS was 56% person/year among women who experienced the transient pregnancy form of RLS, compared to 12.6% person/year in those who did not. There was a significant four-fold increased risk of developing chronic RLS in women who had experienced RLS in a previous pregnancy. Furthermore, during the follow-up period, RLS symptoms reappeared in 58% of women who had further pregnancies, while they emerged for the first time in only 3% of women who had never experienced RLS.

The study concludes that transient pregnancy RLS is a significant risk factor for the development of chronic idiopathic RLS.
