## Question

What is the recommended time window for taking doxycycline for tick prophylaxis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended time window for taking doxycycline as prophylaxis after a tick bite, including what the window is measured from, who qualifies, how to dose, and what to do if the window is missed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative guidelines. Then, I should verify the exact timing language and whether it is from tick removal or attachment. Next, I will define the eligibility criteria for a "high‑risk" bite. After that, I need to check dosing, including pediatric nuances. Then, I should clarify what to do if criteria are not met or the 72‑hour window has passed. Finally, I will review the evidence base and safety considerations to ensure the recommendation is both accurate and practical.

> Let me first confirm the guideline consensus. Hold on, I should verify that all major societies align on a single window. The IDSA/AAN/ACR guideline recommends a single dose of oral doxycycline within 72 hours of tick removal for high‑risk Ixodes bites, and this is echoed by companion publications and summaries of the same guideline package, the AAFP primary care synopsis, and the Wilderness Medical Society guidance, all of which converge on the same 72‑hour timing for high‑risk exposures [^114HVdky] [^113LR2HP] [^112aur6p] [^112qfHA8] [^111kpMgk] [^116xhDbS].

> Wait, let me verify exactly what the 72 hours refers to. I need to ensure it is measured from the time of tick removal rather than from the estimated time of attachment. The pivotal NEJM randomized trial only enrolled patients who had removed an attached Ixodes scapularis within the previous 72 hours, and guidelines phrase the recommendation as "within 72 hours of tick removal", so the clock starts at removal, not attachment, with the practical corollary that sooner is better within that window [^1135DHM2] [^114HVdky].

> Next, I should review the eligibility criteria because not every bite warrants prophylaxis. High‑risk generally means a bite from an Ixodes species in an endemic area and with likely attachment for at least 36 hours based on engorgement, with no current signs of Lyme disease and no contraindication to doxycycline; if species identification is uncertain or duration is unknown, guidelines favor observation rather than prophylaxis, and some clinicians use engorgement-based tools such as the scutal index to avoid overuse [^112qfHA8] [^114HVdky] [^114HVdky] [^113tvgUa] [^117BdmWD].

> I will now examine dosing, including pediatric considerations. The adult regimen is a single 200 mg oral dose, and the NEJM trial used this exact approach; for children, dosing is 4 mg/kg up to a maximum of 200 mg as a single dose, but wait, I initially thought doxycycline could not be used under age 8, which would exclude younger children entirely; let me reconsider and reconcile this. The IDSA/AAN/ACR guideline explicitly recommends prophylaxis for high‑risk bites in all age groups, whereas the AAFP synopsis suggests use in children aged 8 years or older, so practice varies, but IDSA supports single‑dose prophylaxis across ages when criteria are met, with shared decision‑making around risks and benefits [^1135DHM2] [^113LR2HP] [^112aur6p] [^112qfHA8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about giving antibiotics if criteria are not met or the window is missed. I need to check what guidelines advise in those scenarios. If more than 72 hours have elapsed since tick removal or the exposure is not clearly high‑risk, guidelines recommend against prophylactic antibiotics and favor watchful waiting, with clear instructions to return if symptoms develop; prophylaxis is not advised for non‑Lyme tick‑borne infections; removed ticks should not be tested for Borrelia; asymptomatic patients should not undergo serologic testing; and if erythema migrans or other Lyme manifestations appear, treat promptly with standard therapy such as doxycycline for 10 days rather than attempting PEP [^113d5DNN] [^1179dyZC] [^1122EWB8] [^112d4pj8] [^1118mHvH] [^114HVdky].

> I should double‑check the evidence that underpins the 72‑hour limit. The NEJM randomized controlled trial in a hyperendemic region showed that a single 200 mg dose within 72 hours reduced erythema migrans at the bite site from 3.2% to 0.4% (about 87% relative efficacy), but importantly the trial did not evaluate administration beyond 72 hours, which is why benefits after that time remain unproven and are not recommended by guidelines [^1135DHM2] [^114XKnAR].

> Let me consider safety and contraindications. The single‑dose regimen was associated mainly with transient gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting in the RCT, and doxycycline should be avoided in those with known tetracycline hypersensitivity per FDA labeling; I need to ensure shared decision‑making includes these potential adverse effects and allergy screening before prescribing [^114XKnAR] [^114jUT6C] [^111pWixk].

> But wait, what if the patient already has a rash or systemic symptoms at presentation. I should confirm that prophylaxis is no longer appropriate in symptomatic patients and that treatment should proceed without delay. Guidelines advise making a clinical diagnosis of erythema migrans when present and starting a therapeutic course rather than offering PEP, with typical first‑line therapy being oral doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil for erythema migrans according to recommended durations [^113GPmR2] [^112d4pj8] [^1118mHvH].

> Bottom line, I need to ensure the recommendation is crisp and actionable. Administer a single oral dose of doxycycline 200 mg (children 4 mg/kg up to 200 mg) as soon as possible and within 72 hours of tick removal for clearly high‑risk Ixodes bites in endemic areas with likely attachment of at least 36 hours, provided there is no doxycycline allergy; measure the window from removal, not attachment; if the window is missed or criteria are not met, do not give prophylaxis, instead observe with clear return precautions and treat promptly if symptoms such as erythema migrans develop [^114HVdky] [^113LR2HP] [^112qfHA8].

The recommended window for doxycycline prophylaxis following a high-risk Ixodes tick bite is **within 72 hours of tick removal** [^114HVdky] [^111kpMgk]. A **single 200 mg oral dose** is recommended for adults and children when the tick is identified as Ixodes [^112aur6p], has been attached for ≥ 36 hours [^117BdmWD], and prophylaxis can begin within this window [^113LR2HP]. Prophylaxis is **not recommended** [^114HVdky] if more than 72 hours have passed [^112qfHA8], the tick is not Ixodes, or the attachment duration is unknown or < 36 hours [^112bSW2N].

---

## Recommended time frame for doxycycline prophylaxis

Administer a single 200 mg oral dose of doxycycline **within 72 hours** of tick removal [^113LR2HP] [^116xhDbS]. This timing aligns with Borrelia burgdorferi transmission dynamics and clinical trial data [^1135DHM2] [^111kpMgk].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the 72-hour window

An RCT found that a single 200 mg dose given within 72 hours reduced erythema migrans at the bite site by approximately 87% (0.4% vs 3.2%) [^1135DHM2]. IDSA/AAN/ACR [^112d4pj8] and WMS guidelines [^112fVabc] recommend prophylaxis only **within 72 hours** of removal of an identified high-risk Ixodes tick [^114HVdky].

---

## Criteria for doxycycline prophylaxis

Prophylaxis is **indicated** when all of the following are met:

| **Criterion** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Tick species | Ixodes scapularis or Ixodes pacificus [^114HVdky] [^112fVabc] |
| Attachment duration | ≥ 36 hours (engorged or scutal index) [^113LR2HP] [^117BdmWD] |
| Time since removal | ≤ 72 hours [^1135DHM2] [^112aur6p] |
| Patient factors | No contraindications to doxycycline [^111pWixk] |

---

## Situations where prophylaxis is not recommended

Prophylaxis should **not be given** if:

- **Tick species**: Not Ixodes scapularis or Ixodes pacificus [^112fVabc] [^114HVdky].

- **Attachment duration**: < 36 hours or unknown [^112bSW2N] [^117BdmWD].

- **Time since removal**: > 72 hours [^112qfHA8] [^112aur6p].

- **Patient factors**: Contraindications to doxycycline [^114jUT6C] [^111pWixk].

---

## Clinical implications of delayed prophylaxis

Prophylaxis after 72 hours is **less effective and therefore not recommended** [^114HVdky]. If prophylaxis is not given, use watchful waiting and monitor for erythema migrans or other Lyme disease symptoms [^113tvgUa] [^112bSW2N].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Time frame**: Within 72 hours of tick removal [^114HVdky].

- **Dose**: Single 200 mg oral dose [^1135DHM2].

- **Indications**: Ixodes tick, ≥ 36-hour attachment, no contraindications [^113LR2HP] [^117BdmWD].

- **Not recommended**: Non-Ixodes ticks, < 36-hour attachment, > 72 hours since removal, or contraindications [^112fVabc] [^114jUT6C].

---

The recommended window for doxycycline prophylaxis following a high-risk Ixodes tick bite is **within 72 hours of tick removal** [^114HVdky]. This approach is supported by clinical trial data and expert guidelines [^1135DHM2] [^112d4pj8]. Prophylaxis should not be given if the window is missed or criteria are not met [^113tvgUa].

The study procedures are explained in the published protocol. Patients had outpatient follow-up at 10 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after inclusion, with additional blood samples collected 2 and 4 weeks after starting treatment. The patients were assessed using a Composite Clinical Score (CCS) at each visit. The CSS evaluates 10 subjective symptoms and 22 objective neurological findings. Each of the 32 items is scored as 0 for none, 1 for mild (without influence on daily life), or 2 for severe (with influence on daily life), resulting in a sum score range from 0 to 64. Clinicians at each site scored patients and discussed with study coordinators when necessary.

The primary endpoint was clinical improvement 6 months after treatment start, measured by the difference in CCS sum score from baseline to 6 months.

- **Secondary endpoints**: CCS at 10 weeks and 12 months; CSF findings at 6 and 12 months; safety and tolerability measured by blood tests (haematological values, kidney and liver function) at 2 and 4 weeks after treatment start; patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs); and weekly reported side effects in a patient diary for 10 weeks.

	- The PROMs included:
		- Fatigue scored with the Fatigue Severity Scale
		- Subjective somatic symptoms scores with the Patient Health Questionnaire-15
		- Health-related quality of life (RAND 36)

	- The patient diary consisted of five questions regarding side effects: nausea, diarrhoea, skin changes, genital ailments, and decreased appetite. Each question was answered with 0 for no symptoms, 1 for mild symptoms, or 2 for severe symptoms, with a sum score calculated each week.

### Doxycycline for malaria chemoprophylaxis and treatment: Report from the CDC expert meeting on malaria chemoprophylaxis [^114LJ5zj]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2011). Low credibility.

Other studies have also shown doxycycline to have inadequate causal activity, or activity against the liver stage of the malaria parasite, which has implications for doxycycline's post-exposure course. One randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial examined the efficacy of doxycycline prophylaxis for P. falciparum malaria when taken by individuals exposed to mosquitoes infected with P. falciparum. Doxycycline was taken daily 3 days before exposure and for 6 days post-exposure. Four of 12 persons taking that preventive regimen developed falciparum malaria 15–24 days after completing medications; the protective efficacy was 67% (95% CI = 35–90%). Another study found that of 60 soldiers who received 100 mg of doxycycline a day before deployment, 6 weeks during their deployment, and for 3 days after their return, none had falciparum malaria, whereas two developed vivax malaria. These studies suggest that doxycycline has some tissue schizontocidal activity for P. falciparum, but is insufficient for causal prophylaxis. Doxycycline would therefore have to be continued for a sufficient amount of time post-exposure for successful suppression of parasites that emerge from the liver. Studies have observed that malaria developed within 3–4 weeks post-exposure. It is therefore recommended that doxycycline prophylaxis be continued for 4 weeks post-exposure.

Doxycycline's limited activity in the liver stages of Plasmodium also means that it does not kill P. vivax hypnozoites. Although very effective for preventing primary P. vivax infections, doxycycline is not effective at preventing relapses of P. vivax malaria.

Regarding preventative measures for Chlamydia trachomatis infection, specifically with respect to post-exposure prophylaxis, CDC 2024 guidelines recommend counseling MSM and transgender women who have had a bacterial STI (specifically syphilis, chlamydia, or gonorrhea) in the past 12 months. Doxycycline can be used as post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent these infections. Offer persons in this group a prescription for doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (200 mg, not to exceed 200 mg every 24 hours) after shared decision-making, to be self-administered within 72 hours after having oral, vaginal, or anal sex.

### Treatment of erythema migrans with doxycycline for 7 days versus 14 days in Slovenia: A randomised open-label non-inferiority trial [^115tVWUF]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Lyme borreliosis is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in Europe and the United States. Doxycycline for 10 days is the primary treatment recommendation for erythema migrans. To reduce potentially harmful antibiotic overuse by identifying shorter effective treatments, we aimed to assess whether oral doxycycline for 7 days is non-inferior to 14 days in adults with solitary erythema migrans.

- **Methods**: In this randomised open-label non-inferiority trial, we enrolled patients with a solitary erythema at the University Medical Centre in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Patients were excluded if they were pregnant or lactating, immunosuppressed, allergic to doxycycline, had received antibiotics with anti-borrelial activity within 10 days preceding enrolment, or had additional manifestations of Lyme borreliosis. Adults were randomly allocated 1:1 to receive oral doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 7 days or 14 days.

	- The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference in the proportion of patients with treatment failure, defined as persistent erythema, new objective signs of Lyme borreliosis, or borrelial isolation on skin re-biopsy at 2 months, in a per-protocol analysis. This population completed the assigned doxycycline regimen according to the study protocol and did not receive any other antibiotics with anti-borrelial activity until the 2-month visit. The non-inferiority margin was set at 6 percentage points. Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who followed the study protocol and were evaluable at the 14-day visit.

### Assessment of duration of tick feeding by the scutal index reduces need for antibiotic prophylaxis after Ixodes scapularis tick bites [^117BdmWD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Doxycycline is recommended for persons with Ixodes scapularis tick bites in certain geographic areas if the tick had fed for at least 36 hours. Based on the scutal index, over 40% of I. scapularis tick bites from patients seen at the Lyme Disease Diagnostic Center did not warrant antibiotic prophylaxis.

### Lyme disease: What the wilderness provider needs to know [^114XF1B1]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Lyme disease is a multisystem tickborne illness caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and is the most common vectorborne disease in the United States. Prognosis after initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy is typically good if treated early. Wilderness providers caring for patients who live in or travel to high-incidence Lyme disease areas should be aware of the basic biology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of Lyme disease.

### Prophylaxis with single-dose doxycycline for the prevention of Lyme disease after an Ixodes scapularis tick bite [^114XKnAR]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). High credibility.

It is unclear whether antimicrobial treatment after an Ixodes scapularis tick bite will prevent Lyme disease.

- **Methods**: In an area of New York where Lyme disease is hyperendemic, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of treatment with a single 200-mg dose of doxycycline in 482 subjects who had removed attached I. scapularis ticks from their bodies within the previous 72 hours. At baseline, three weeks, and six weeks, subjects were interviewed and examined, and serum antibody tests were performed, along with blood cultures for Borrelia burgdorferi. Entomologists confirmed the species of the ticks and classified them according to sex, stage, and degree of engorgement.

- **Results**: Erythema migrans developed at the site of the tick bite in a significantly smaller proportion of the subjects in the doxycycline group than in those in the placebo group (1 of 235 subjects [0.4 percent] vs. 8 of 247 subjects [3.2 percent], P < 0.04). The efficacy of treatment was 87 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 25 to 98 percent). Objective extracutaneous signs of Lyme disease did not develop in any subject, and there were no asymptomatic seroconversions.

Treatment with doxycycline was associated with more frequent adverse effects (in 30.1 percent of subjects, as compared with 11.1 percent of those assigned to placebo; P < 0.001), primarily nausea (15.4 percent vs. 2.6 percent) and vomiting (5.8 percent vs. 1.3 percent). Erythema migrans developed more frequently after untreated bites from nymphal ticks than after bites from adult female ticks.

### Doxycycline for prevention of spirochetal infections: Status report [^115xR7Gk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Important human infections caused by spirochetal microorganisms include Lyme disease, syphilis, leptospirosis, and tick-borne relapsing fever. Doxycycline prophylactic regimens have been shown to significantly reduce the risk of developing all these infections in potentially exposed individuals, which is highly clinically relevant as no vaccines to prevent these infections in humans are currently available. Additional data, however, are needed to define more precisely the level of efficacy of the doxycycline prophylactic regimens, especially for Lyme disease and syphilis, infections that can be potentially prevented by a single 200-mg dose of doxycycline given within 72 hours post-exposure.

### Doxy 100 [^115MTz9i]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of doxycycline for injection, USP, and other antibacterial drugs, doxycycline for injection, USP, should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Doxycycline for injection, USP, is indicated in infections caused by the following microorganisms:

- **Rickettsiae**: Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsial pox, and tick fevers.
- **Mycoplasma pneumoniae**: PPLO, Eaton Agent.
- **Agents of psittacosis and ornithosis**.
- **Agents of lymphogranuloma venereum and granuloma inguinale**.
- **The spirochetal agent of relapsing fever**: Borrelia recurrentis.

The following gram-negative microorganisms:

- **Haemophilus ducreyi**: Chancroid.
- **Yersinia pestis**: Formerly Pasteurella pestis, and Francisella tularensis, formerly Pasteurella tularensis.
- **Bartonella bacilliformis**.
- **Bacteroides species**.
- **Vibrio cholerae**: Formerly Vibrio comma, and Campylobacter fetus, formerly Vibrio fetus.
- **Brucella species**: In conjunction with streptomycin.

### Six versus 2 weeks treatment with doxycycline in European Lyme neuroborreliosis: A multicentre, non-inferiority, double-blinded, randomised and placebo-controlled trial [^112ccaHH]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

At 6 months, the proportions of patients with any complaint, including symptoms without influence on daily life, were 73% and 71% in the 2 and 6 weeks treatment groups, respectively. The proportions with at least one complaint influencing daily life (CCS ≥ 2) were 23% (n = 12) and 22% (n = 11). One patient treated for 6 weeks had an elevated CSF cell count at 6 months (baseline 82 M/L, 6 months 28 M/L) but had no other signs of treatment failure or disease progression, and the CSF cell count normalized at 12 months (3 M/L).

We did not register any serious adverse events, and no patients were excluded or had to stop treatment because of adverse events. Weekly patient-reported side effects for 10 weeks are summarized in figure 3. There was a trend towards more patients with high sum scores in weeks 3–7 in the 6 weeks treatment group, but the difference was statistically significant only in week 5 (p = 0.03). There were no differences in median sum scores between the treatment groups at any time point. The only single question that differed between the treatment groups was the report of nausea at week 5, where nine patients reported mild and two serious nausea in the 6 weeks treatment group compared with three patients with mild nausea in the 2 weeks treatment group (p = 0.03).

### Doxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis: Awareness, beliefs, and interest among patients with and at risk for HIV [^115W4KTe]. AIDS and Behavior (2025). High credibility.

Rates of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STI) in the United States (US) have increased 2% from 2018 to 2022. Overall, half of STI cases were diagnosed among young people between the ages of 15 to 24, and STIs disproportionately affect gay and bisexual men who have sex with men (MSM) as well as non-White sub-groups. Associated costs related to the diagnosis and treatment of bacterial STIs account for $1.4 billion in healthcare expenditures annually, underscoring the importance of effective treatment and prevention modalities.

Doxycycline is an antibiotic in the tetracycline class that is currently indicated as first-line therapy for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and as alternative therapy for syphilis. Recently, use of doxycycline, given as a single (200 mg), post-exposure dose within 72 hours of sexual activity was studied in several randomized clinical trials with promising results.

Initially, a small (N = 232) sub-study within the IPERGAY trial in France showed that use of doxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis (doxy-PEP) among MSM and transgender women (TGW) on HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) significantly lowered the incidence of CT (-70%) and syphilis (-73%) but not gonorrhea (GC, -17%) when compared to placebo. Two larger randomized clinical trials, the DoxyPEP (N = 501, MSM/TGW with HIV or on PrEP) and DOXYVAC (N = 502, MSM on PrEP) studies, confirmed these results and also reported significant reductions of GC STIs (risk reduction ranges: CT, 74–89%; GC, 51–57%; syphilis, 77–87%).

The dPEP trial in Kenya evaluated the use of doxy-PEP among cisgender individuals.

### Acticlatecap [^113rcEik]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). High credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Instructions for Use) for ACTICLATE and ACTICLATE CAP for malaria prophylaxis. Emphasize that no present-day antimalarial agent, including doxycycline, guarantees complete protection against malaria. Advise patients to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes by using personal protective measures, especially from dusk to dawn. These measures include staying in well-screened areas, using mosquito nets, covering the body with clothing, and using an effective insect repellent.

Direct patients to begin doxycycline prophylaxis 1 to 2 days before traveling to a malarious area and to continue daily while in the malarious area. After leaving, they should carry on for 4 additional weeks to prevent malaria development, ensuring that doxycycline use does not exceed 4 months.

Advise all patients taking ACTICLATE and ACTICLATE CAP:

- **Tablet dosage adjustments**: ACTICLATE Tablets (150 mg) can be broken at the scored lines into two-thirds or one-third to provide 100 mg or 50 mg doses, respectively.
- **Capsule administration**: Patients must swallow ACTICLATE CAP whole and must not break, open, crush, dissolve, or chew the capsule [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Patients should avoid excessive sunlight or artificial ultraviolet light while on doxycycline and discontinue therapy if phototoxicity occurs, such as skin eruptions. The use of sunscreen or sunblock is recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Additionally, patients are advised to drink fluids liberally while taking ACTICLATE and ACTICLATE CAP.

### Diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease [^112qfHA8]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2008). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for tick bites, specifically in the context of post-exposure prophylaxis, the AAFP 2012 guidelines recommend administering antimicrobial prophylaxis with a single 200 mg dose of doxycycline to adult patients exposed to Ixodes scapularis. This is advisable if prophylaxis can be given within 72 hours of tick removal and there is at least a 20% rate of tick infection with Borrelia burgdorferi in the area. Consider administering antimicrobial prophylaxis with a single 4 mg/kg dose of doxycycline (maximum dose of 200 mg) in pediatric patients aged 8 years or older.

### Post-exposure prophylaxis with doxycycline to prevent sexually transmitted infections in men who have sex with men: an open-label randomised substudy of the ANRS IPERGAY trial [^1133D2TB]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2018). High credibility.

Increased rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) have been reported among men who have sex with men. We aimed to assess whether post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with doxycycline could reduce the incidence of STIs.

- **Methods**: All participants attending their scheduled visit in the open-label extension of the ANRS IPERGAY trial in France (men aged 18 years or older having condomless sex with men and using pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine) were eligible for inclusion in this open-label randomised study. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) at a central site to take a single oral dose of 200 mg doxycycline PEP within 24 hours after sex or no prophylaxis. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of a first STI (gonorrhoea, chlamydia, or syphilis) during the 10-month follow-up. The cumulative probability of occurrence of the primary endpoint was estimated in each group with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. The primary efficacy analysis was done on the intention-to-treat population, comprising all randomised participants. All participants received risk-reduction counselling and condoms, and were tested regularly for HIV. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01473472.

- **Findings**: Between July 20, 2015, and January 21, 2016, we randomly assigned 232 participants (n = 116 in the doxycycline PEP group and n = 116 in the no-PEP group) who were followed up for a median of 8.7 months (IQR 7.8–9.7). Participants in the PEP group used a median of 680 mg doxycycline per month.

### Doxycycline for malaria chemoprophylaxis and treatment: Report from the CDC expert meeting on malaria chemoprophylaxis [^116iwdYv]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2011). High credibility.

There is very limited information on the best regimen for changing from doxycycline to other antimalarials, and recommendations for doing so are based on considering several issues such as drug-drug interactions, half-life differences, and differences in mechanism of action. If changing between atovaquone/proguanil and doxycycline, note that the atovaquone-proguanil label lists a pharmacokinetic interaction of "concomitant treatment (of P. falciparum malaria) with tetracycline (with atovaquone) has been associated with approximately a 40% reduction in plasma concentrations of atovaquone", however, there are no accessible published studies that support this. On the contrary, early in vitro studies of atovaquone plus doxycycline and atovaquone plus tetracycline showed potentiation between the two drugs, which was later confirmed in clinical studies by improved cure rates when compared with atovaquone alone. Therefore, if changing from doxycycline to atovaquone/proguanil for malaria treatment or prophylaxis, doxycycline can be stopped and atovaquone/proguanil started at the same time. However, the recommended length of the post-trip course of prophylactic medications may change because the drugs target different stages of the Plasmodium life cycle. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently recommends that the atovaquone/proguanil is continued for up to 4 weeks after leaving the endemic area depending on when the change was made.

### Six versus 2 weeks treatment with doxycycline in European Lyme neuroborreliosis: a multicentre, non-inferiority, double-blinded, randomised and placebo-controlled trial [^111Psckm]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

The primary objective of the study was to determine if a treatment duration of 2 weeks with doxycycline is as effective as a prolonged regimen of 6 weeks. Accordingly, the null hypothesis was that the 2-week treatment duration is inferior to the 6-week treatment duration.

For the sample size calculation, the authors drafting the protocol considered a non-inferiority margin of 0.5 points in mean improvement on the CCS as clinically relevant. In other words, a mean difference in the clinical score from baseline to 6 months after inclusion of up to 0.5 points represented the maximum reduction in effectiveness we would accept, while still considering the short regimen treatment to be non-inferior. We used data from our previous trial with an adult population with European LNB and the same clinical score to calculate sample size and determine the non-inferiority margin. With a significance level of 0.05 and statistical power at 80%, this corresponded to a sample size of 50 patients in each group. To compensate for 20% drop-outs, we planned to include 120 patients, with 60 in each group.

For analyses of the primary endpoint, we applied a general linear model adjusting for gender, age, pretreatment duration of symptoms, and CCS at baseline.

The primary endpoint was analyzed in an intention-to-treat (ITT) principle population, excluding participants who withdrew consent, discontinued treatment, and/or were lost to follow-up, and in a per-protocol population. In the latter, we also excluded one patient who fulfilled treatment according to protocol but was shown to have an incomplete outcome assessment.

Regarding preventative measures for syphilis, more specifically with respect to post-exposure prophylaxis, the BASHH 2025 guidelines recommend not offering epidemiological treatment to asymptomatic doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis users who are contacts of chlamydia and took doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis within 72 hours of exposure. Consider administering a dose of doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis rather than offering standard epidemiological treatment if the patient attends within 72 hours of exposure but has not yet taken doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis. Consider offering a test for chlamydia if the patient is in the clinical service.

### Doxycycline [^111yP45t]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of doxycycline capsules, USP, and other antibacterial drugs, doxycycline capsules, USP, should be used only to treat or prevent infections proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empirical selection of therapy.

Doxycycline is indicated for the treatment of the following infections:

- **Rickettsial diseases**: Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox, and tick fevers caused by Rickettsiae.

- **Respiratory infections**: Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

- **Chlamydial infections**:
	- Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.
	- Psittacosis (ornithosis) caused by Chlamydophila psittaci.
	- Trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, although the infectious agent is not always eliminated as judged by immunofluorescence.
	- Inclusion conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.
	- Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.
	- Nongonococcal urethritis caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum.

- **Borrelial infections**: Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis.

Doxycycline is also indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms.

Regarding preventative measures for syphilis, specifically with respect to post-exposure prophylaxis, the CDC 2024 guidelines recommend counseling MSM and transgender women who have had a bacterial STI (specifically syphilis, chlamydia, or gonorrhea) in the past 12 months that doxycycline can be used as post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent these infections. Offer individuals in this group a prescription for doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (200 mg, not to exceed 200 mg every 24 hours) after shared decision-making, to be self-administered within 72 hours after having oral, vaginal, or anal sex.

### Six versus 2 weeks treatment with doxycycline in European Lyme neuroborreliosis: a multicentre, non-inferiority, double-blinded, randomised and placebo-controlled trial [^115fYaJ3]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

There is limited evidence regarding the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment in neuroborreliosis. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of oral doxycycline for 2 and 6 weeks in European Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB).

- **Methods**: The trial had a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority design. Patients with LNB were recruited from eight Norwegian hospitals and randomised to doxycycline 200 mg once daily for 2 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of placebo, or doxycycline 200 mg once daily for 6 weeks. The primary endpoint was clinical improvement as measured by the difference in a Composite Clinical Score (0–64 points) from baseline to 6 months. The non-inferiority margin was predetermined to 0.5 points.

- **Results**: One hundred and twenty-one patients were included. Fifty-two treated for 2 weeks and 53 for 6 weeks were included in the intention-to-treat analyses, and 52 and 51 in per-protocol analysis. The mean difference in clinical improvement between the groups was 0.06, 95% CI −1.2 to 1.2, p = 0.99 in the intention-to-treat population, and −0.4, 95% CI −1.4 to 0.7, p = 0.51 in the per-protocol population, and non-inferiority could not be established. There were no treatment failures and no serious adverse events. The groups did not differ in secondary outcomes, including clinical scores at 10 weeks and 12 months, cerebrospinal fluid data, and patient-reported outcome measures. Patients receiving 6 weeks of doxycycline reported slightly more side effects in week 5.

- **Conclusion**: Our results strongly indicate that there are no benefits of doxycycline treatment beyond 2 weeks.

### Diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease [^115jWgz5]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2008). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for tick bite, particularly concerning tick avoidance, the AAFP 2012 guidelines recommend the following measures for the prevention of Lyme disease:

- **Avoiding high-risk areas**: Areas with high tick burdens should be avoided.

- **Wearing protective clothing**: Ensure that clothing covers as much skin as possible.

- **Using tick repellents**: Application of repellents, such as diethyltoluamide, is recommended.

- **Performing frequent body checks**: Regularly check the body for ticks after outdoor activities.

- **Bathing after outdoor exposure**: A bath taken after being outdoors can help remove ticks.

- **Environmental landscape modifications**: Implement modifications such as grass mowing, deer exclusion fencing, and removing leaf litter and woodpiles to reduce the tick burden.

### Treatment of erythema migrans with doxycycline for 10 days versus 15 days [^117GdokU]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The efficacy of a 10-day doxycycline treatment in patients with erythema migrans has been assessed in the United States, but not in Europe. Experts disagree on the significance of post-Lyme borreliosis symptoms.

- **Methods**: In a noninferiority trial, the efficacies of 10 days and 15 days of oral doxycycline therapy were evaluated in adult European patients with erythema migrans. The prevalence of nonspecific symptoms was compared between patients with erythema migrans and 81 control subjects without a history of Lyme borreliosis. The efficacy of treatment, determined on the basis of clinical observations and microbiologic tests, was assessed at 14 days and at 2, 6, and 12 months. Nonspecific symptoms in patients and controls were compared at 6 months after enrollment.

- **Results**: A total of 117 patients (52%) were treated with doxycycline for 15 days, and 108 (48%) received doxycycline for 10 days. Twelve months after enrollment, 85 of 91 patients (93.4%) in the 15-day group and 79 of 86 (91.9%) in the 10-day group had a complete response (difference, 1.6 percentage points; upper limit of the 95% confidence interval, 9.1 percentage points). At 6 months, the frequency of nonspecific symptoms in the patients was similar to that among controls.

- **Conclusions**: The 10-day regimen of oral doxycycline was not inferior to the 15-day regimen among adult European patients with solitary erythema migrans. Six months after treatment, the frequency of nonspecific symptoms among erythema migrans patients was similar to that among control subjects.

### Doxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis: Awareness, beliefs, and interest among patients with and at risk for HIV [^1134kt39]. AIDS and Behavior (2025). Low credibility.

At the time of survey completion, only 41 respondents (24.7%) were aware of doxy-PEP, and 3 respondents (1.8%) reported prior use of doxy-PEP. Overall, 37.3% of respondents expressed high levels of interest in doxy-PEP. About half of the respondents (44.6%) believed they would be extremely likely to take doxy-PEP if it were offered to them. Reasons for doxy-PEP interest included reduced risk of STI acquisition and transmission.

- **Doxy-PEP awareness, interest, and usage patterns**: Respondents' beliefs regarding their interest in doxy-PEP use if offered, and reasons for doxy-PEP interest (check all that apply). *STI complications noted: infertility, vision loss, hearing loss.*

Anticipated frequency of doxy-PEP usage was more evenly distributed among respondents. However, 41.6% of respondents believed they would use doxy-PEP at least monthly (i.e. more than 12 doses per year). Nearly half of respondents (43.4%) preferred a short-term doxy-PEP prescription (i.e. 5–10 doses per prescription). Respondents generally believed that they would not share doxy-PEP with partners. Yet, roughly a quarter of respondents (28.9%) rated the likelihood of sharing doxy-PEP with partners as "very likely" to "extremely likely". We observed differences in the likelihood of doxy-PEP use between PWH and PrEP respondents.

- **Doxy-PEP concerns**: Respondents' beliefs regarding their anticipated frequency of doxy-PEP use, likelihood to share doxy-PEP with partners, and prescription preference.

Overall, most respondents…

### Prophylaxis after exposure to Coxiella burnetii [^112iF46C]. Emerging infectious diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Several issues will be important when considering post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) recommendations. First, when selecting a representative threshold value for each risk group, social and political concerns must be acknowledged and considered. If a threshold value is 2.5%, it may be more realistic for decision-makers to instruct all persons with any probability of exposure to take PEP, rather than using valuable time and resources to determine a person's numerical probability of exposure. Additionally, before providing a specific numeric threshold value in the guidelines, it is crucial to know how to measure that probability of exposure. For example, if 7% is provided as a threshold, there must be a mechanism for differentiating between 6% and 8% or 5% and 15%. These threshold points and PEP recommendations must be both useful and realistic. Some research has been conducted to evaluate how to determine likely concentrations of a bioterrorism agent and a person's level of exposure by using computer modeling and simulation. Further studies on the assessment of exposure would be beneficial; modeling Q fever exposure would be especially critical, given C. burnetii's low infectious dose and high environmental stability.

This study does not directly address children under 8 years of age. In general, this population is not at a higher risk for illness or death from Q fever infection than the general population. However, risk-benefit analyses for children should be conducted to provide guidance on PEP recommendations for this age group. Lastly, this analysis was conducted based on the most frequently suggested practices.

Another possible limitation is the use of an unvalidated clinical score (CCS) that carries both inter- and intra-observer variability. The randomisation procedure is assumed to equalise this variability, but still, the score is encumbered with imprecise absolute scores that may cause wide 95% CIs. We chose the score since we were familiar with it from a previous trial; it reflects assessments done of these patients in clinical practice, and it has also been used in a modified form by other researchers.

Our study included 18 patients with possible Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB), including six with negative antibodies in both serum and CSF. A relatively short pretreatment symptom duration, ranging from two to seven days, could explain persistent antibody negativity in these six patients, but it is possible that some of them did not have LNB. Two had facial palsy as their only symptom and were retrospectively thought to have suffered from Bell's palsy. The inclusion of some patients with an unclear diagnosis is unavoidable in a treatment trial of LNB due to the low sensitivity of intrathecal antibody production in the early phase of the disease, and the need to start antibiotic treatment before antibody results are available. This study included relatively few such patients, however.

Overall, we consider the trial to be well-designed with few sources of bias and high internal validity. We also think the trial results reflect everyday clinical practice by including patients with both definite and possible LNB from different centres and thereby possess high external validity.

### Doxycycline for malaria chemoprophylaxis and treatment: Report from the CDC expert meeting on malaria chemoprophylaxis [^114x6bzN]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2011). Low credibility.

Photosensitivity in individuals taking doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis has been reported, with an erythematous rash occurring in sun-exposed areas in 7.3–21.2% of cases. Although one study found no significantly higher percentage of all skin events (unspecified photosensitivity) with doxycycline compared to other antimalarials, the rash typically resolves upon discontinuation of the drug. Another study involving 106 acne patients on daily doxycycline reported a high incidence (35.8%) of light-sensitive rash. The study suggested this phenomenon is dose-related, as 20% of patients taking 150 mg/day developed a rash, while 42% of those on 200 mg/day were affected. Patients with lighter skin complexions (Fitzpatrick skin types 1 and 2) may be more prone to doxycycline-induced photosensitivity than those with darker skin. Both ultraviolet A (UV-A) and B (UV-B) radiation have been implicated.

Although the precise mechanism of the phototoxic reaction is not fully understood, it is believed to involve excited-state singlet oxygen and free radicals, which after UV-A radiation exposure, cause selective mitochondrial injury where doxycycline and other tetracyclines are localized. Patients developing photosensitivity should be advised to discontinue doxycycline use. Reducing photosensitivity risk can involve avoiding sun exposure, wearing protective clothing, and using broad-spectrum sunscreen (protecting against both UV-A and UV-B radiation).

### The role of the infectious disease consultation in Lyme disease [^115AWBWw]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Low credibility.

A consultation regarding Lyme disease can be challenging for the infectious disease physician when the referral question centers on the use of prolonged or empirical antibiotic treatment of Lyme disease and associated tick-borne infections. Patients who have been infected with Borrelia burgdorferi, and many who have been misdiagnosed, are confronted with a seemingly endless array of misinformation that is not in keeping with the understanding of the clinical spectrum of Lyme disease and its response to evidence-based treatment. Preparing for these conversations with a good grasp of the public beliefs regarding Lyme disease and its treatment can be beneficial.

### The efficacy of doxycycline treatment on infection: An open-label, randomized trial in Ghana [^111T7SAr]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Low credibility.

- **Adherence to treatment and dropout rate**: Ninety-one of the 101 participants who were randomized into the early treatment group received immediate treatment, whereas 84 of the 101 participants randomized to the delayed treatment group received the treatment 6 months after the early group. Participants who did not receive the study medication had relocated to new communities, traveled at the time of treatment, became pregnant, were breastfeeding, or refused the treatment (delayed group). Three patients randomized to the early group received their treatment together with the delayed group. These three patients were excluded from the PP but were included in the ITT analysis. Adherence to treatment was very high with only one patient opting out during the delayed treatment. At the 12-month follow-up, a dropout rate of 23% was recorded in the early treatment group and 21% in the delayed treatment group.

- **Adverse events experienced by participants during treatment**: All adverse events (AEs) occurred within the first week of treatment and included general body pains, dizziness, diarrhea, headache, nausea, abdominal pains, and vomiting. A total of 16 (9.2%) of 174 participants who started the treatment reported one or more AEs. One participant reported having two AEs (nausea and abdominal pains, lasting for 2 days) on the third day of treatment. Other participants only reported one of the AEs. Twelve of the AEs occurred in the early treatment group and five in the delayed treatment group. The AEs with the longest reported duration, diarrhea and dizziness, were reported by two participants.

### Effectiveness of personal protective measures to prevent Lyme disease [^1149f7kX]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). High credibility.

Lyme disease (LD) is the most commonly reported tick-borne illness in the United States. A vaccine against the disease was licensed in 1998 for use in individuals aged 15–70. However, due to poor sales, it was withdrawn from the market in 2002. Current recommendations for preventing LD emphasize personal protective measures and interventions aimed at reducing the abundance of vector ticks.

- **Personal protective strategies**: These include avoiding tick-infested areas, wearing protective clothing such as long-sleeved shirts and long pants to minimize exposed skin, routinely checking the body for ticks, and applying tick repellents to the skin or clothing.

- **Environmental and host-targeted strategies**: While some strategies focus on the environment and vertebrate hosts of deer ticks, their practical application is challenging, and their impact on LD incidence remains uncertain.

- **Antimicrobial prophylaxis**: For selected individuals who have been bitten by a deer tick, this measure might be effective.

Despite frequent recommendations from medical providers, public health officials, and the media in LD-endemic areas, there is limited data on the effectiveness of personal protective measures. In 1992, Herrington et al. observed a correlation between self-perceived risk of acquiring LD, knowledge about the disease, and the use of personal protective measures. However, adherence to these measures varies significantly, even in highly endemic areas like Connecticut; for instance, while 79% of respondents routinely used tick repellents, 93% reported inspecting themselves and removing ticks after exposure.

### Wilderness medical society clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of tick-borne illness in the United States [^112fVabc]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

The Wilderness Medical Society convened an expert panel to develop evidence-based guidelines for the prevention and management of tick-borne illness (TBI). Recommendations are graded based on the quality of supporting evidence according to criteria put forth by the American College of Chest Physicians. The guidelines include a brief review of the clinical presentation, epidemiology, prevention, and management of TBI in the United States, with a primary focus on interventions that are appropriate for resource-limited settings.

- **Prevention strategies**: Strong recommendations are provided for the use of DEET, picaridin, and permethrin; tick checks; washing and drying clothing at high temperatures; and mechanical tick removal within 36 hours of attachment. Additionally, single-dose doxycycline for high-risk Lyme disease exposures is recommended versus "watchful waiting". Evacuation from backcountry settings for symptomatic tick exposures and TBI education programs are strongly advised.

- **Weak recommendations**: The use of light-colored clothing, insect repellents other than DEET, picaridin, and permethrin, as well as showering after exposure to tick habitat, receive weak recommendations. Weak recommendations are also provided against passive methods of tick removal, including the use of systemic and local treatments.

There was insufficient evidence to support the use of long-sleeved clothing and the avoidance of tick habitat such as long grasses and leaf litter. Although there was sound evidence supporting Lyme disease vaccination, a grade was not offered as the vaccine is not currently available for use in the United States.

### Six versus 2 weeks treatment with doxycycline in European Lyme neuroborreliosis: A multicentre, non-inferiority, double-blinded, randomised and placebo-controlled trial [^1174GJeZ]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

The primary endpoints in the two treatment groups are shown in the referenced data, not provided here. The lower limit of the 95% confidence intervals for the difference between groups exceeded the predefined non-inferiority margin of 0.5 points, yet the treatment groups were similar concerning superiority in both the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol populations. The two treatment groups were also similar with respect to clinical improvement in the subgroups of definite and possible Lyme Neuroborreliosis (LNB). For definite LNB, the scores were 6.3 versus 6.5, with a p-value of 0.76 (mean difference = 0.2, 95% CI −1.1 to 1.5). For possible LNB, the scores were 5.8 versus 5.9, p = 0.95 (mean difference = 0.08, 95% CI −2.9 to 2.7), and similar results were observed for all secondary endpoints not presented here.

### Doxycycline prophylaxis for bacterial sexually transmitted infections [^113U39tv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Doxycycline is a moderate-spectrum, second-generation tetracycline that is generally well tolerated. It is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration. First introduced commercially in the 1960s, doxycycline has been used by millions to manage acne and as primary prophylaxis for scrub typhus, leptospirosis, malaria, and Lyme disease. There are anecdotal reports of doxycycline used for syphilis prophylaxis among US and Australian military personnel during the Vietnam War. Doxycycline is a first-line agent for the treatment of chlamydia and an alternative regimen for syphilis.

Several studies examined doxycycline prophylaxis for STI prevention. In a small, open-label pilot study, 30 MSM living with HIV with prior syphilis were randomized 1:1 to daily doxycycline 100 mg as pre-exposure prophylaxis (Doxy PrEP) for 48 weeks versus a financial incentive–based behavioral intervention. There was a 73% reduction (P = 0.02) in syphilis, NG, or CT in the Doxy PrEP group compared with the control group. Most intervention-arm participants maintained blood doxycycline levels of greater than 1 μg/mL. Reported sexual behaviors were similar in both groups.

### Reservoir targeted vaccine against Borrelia burgdorferi: A new strategy to prevent Lyme disease transmission [^114GDWnP]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

A high prevalence of infection with Borrelia burgdorferi in ixodid ticks is correlated with a high incidence of Lyme disease. The transmission of B. burgdorferi to humans can be disrupted by targeting two key elements in its enzootic cycle: the reservoir host and the tick vector. In a prospective five-year field trial, we show that oral vaccination of wild white-footed mice resulted in outer surface protein A-specific seropositivity, which led to reductions of 23% and 76% in the nymphal infection prevalence in a cumulative, time-dependent manner (two and five years, respectively), whereas the proportion of infected ticks recovered from control plots varied randomly over time. Significant decreases in tick infection prevalence were observed within three years of vaccine deployment. Implementation of such a long-term public health measure could substantially reduce the risk of human exposure to Lyme disease.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

This evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Lyme disease was developed by a multidisciplinary panel representing the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). The scope of this guideline includes prevention of Lyme disease and the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease presenting as erythema migrans, as well as Lyme disease complicated by neurologic, cardiac, and rheumatologic manifestations. It also covers Eurasian manifestations of Lyme disease and Lyme disease complicated by coinfection with other tick-borne pathogens.

This guideline does not include comprehensive recommendations for babesiosis and tick-borne rickettsial infections, which are published in separate guidelines. The target audience for this guideline includes primary care physicians and specialists caring for this condition such as infectious diseases specialists, emergency physicians, internists, pediatricians, family physicians, neurologists, rheumatologists, cardiologists, and dermatologists in North America.

### Management of tick bites and early Lyme disease: a survey of Connecticut physicians [^116TRmuF]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Practice guidelines have been published for the treatment of Lyme disease (LD); however, these guidelines have been challenged as inadequate. Two common LD management problems are the antibiotic prophylaxis of deer tick bites, as deer ticks may carry Borrelia burgdorferi (the spirochete that causes LD), and the antibiotic treatment of erythema migrans, the pathognomonic rash of LD. A one-page questionnaire was sent to a 13% (573 out of 4300) sample of Connecticut physicians to define how they treat deer tick bites and erythema migrans. Of these, 320 (56%) physicians returned the questionnaire, and responses from the 267 physicians who saw patients with LD were analyzed.

- **Antibiotic prophylaxis**: Seventy (26%) of the 267 surveyed physicians prescribed antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with tick bites.

- **Serology orders**: B. burgdorferi serology was ordered by 31% of physicians for patients with tick bites.

- **Treatment of erythema migrans**: Most surveyed physicians treated erythema migrans with doxycycline or amoxicillin for a mean of 21 days. Serology was ordered by 49% of physicians for patients with erythema migrans.

Most physicians did not use prophylaxis for patients with deer tick bites. Moreover, most of the physicians surveyed followed established guidelines for treating patients with erythema migrans. However, many of the physicians surveyed conducted serologic testing for patients with tick bites and/or erythema migrans, even though serologic testing for these patients is usually not necessary.

### Six versus 2 weeks treatment with doxycycline in European Lyme neuroborreliosis: A multicentre, non-inferiority, double-blinded, randomised and placebo-controlled trial [^116quwG5]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

Irrespective of recommendations, there are clues to substantial variations in clinical practice. In a Norwegian study of adherence to guidelines, 61% of patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) were treated for more than 2 weeks, 36% for more than 3 weeks, and 12% for more than 6 weeks.

Several factors are likely to influence the choice of treatment duration, such as limited evidence in guidelines, local treatment cultures, beliefs and attitudes, and pressure and expectations from patients due to advocacy in media for long durations of antibiotic treatment in LNB. High-quality research has been called for to pave the way for more evidence-based treatment decisions in clinical practice.

In light of all this, we aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of treatment with oral doxycycline for 2 and 6 weeks in European LNB in a randomised controlled trial. We chose a non-inferiority approach for assessment of efficacy, as the short antibiotic regimen was not expected to be superior to the long regimen, but it still offers clear advantages in terms of antibiotic resistance issues, lower costs, and less strain on the patients.

### Posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome-what it might be and what it is not [^1179BsDB]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Lyme disease is a multisystem disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi infection. It accounts for well-defined manifestations appearing either at an early or late stage. Appropriate antibiotic therapy generally leads to a favorable outcome. Still, several patients report unspecific persisting symptoms, such as fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, or cognitive dysfunction, months to years after adequate treatment. The underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of these symptoms is unclear.

However, there is no evidence for microbiological persistence in these cases, and attempts to resolve symptoms through repeated or prolonged antibiotic treatment have not been convincingly successful; rather, they may be harmful. To narrow down the controversially handled entity of posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) and avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment, case definitions have been proposed. These definitions acknowledge PTLDS as a complex of nonspecific, subjective symptoms that are neither caused by ongoing infection nor by any other identifiable disease. PTLDS is mainly a diagnosis of exclusion and requires careful evaluation of differential diagnosis, followed by counseling about optimal management in light of the absence of specific therapeutic options.

The 2024 CDC guidelines address preventative measures for gonococcal urethritis, particularly post-exposure prophylaxis. They recommend counseling men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women who have had a bacterial STI — specifically syphilis, chlamydia, or gonorrhea — in the past 12 months. Doxycycline can be used as post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent these infections.

- **Prescription details**: Offer persons in this group a prescription for doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (200 mg, not to exceed 200 mg every 24 hours). After shared decision-making, it should be self-administered within 72 hours after having oral, vaginal, or anal sex.

### Doxycycline prophylaxis for skin and soft tissue infections in naval special warfare trainees, United States [^112sAQ4G]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

A review by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2011 of doxycycline as long-term malaria prophylaxis found mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea and abdominal pain, to be the most common adverse effects, occurring in 4%–33% of patients. An investigation of US Marines in Okinawa, Japan, in 2014, who were taking 200 mg of doxycycline weekly, reported side effects, primarily nausea, in 18% of 291 study participants. Peace Corps volunteers receiving long-term malarial prophylaxis reported gastrointestinal side effects in 40% of survey respondents taking doxycycline, but few reported severe symptoms, and discontinuation of medication due to symptoms was infrequent.

More severe gastrointestinal manifestations, such as pill-induced esophagitis, occur in less than 1% of doxycycline recipients, although that number might be an underestimate. Phototoxicity has been reported in 7%–21% of individuals taking doxycycline for long-term malaria prophylaxis, depending on the degree of sun exposure. Most of these side effects might be mitigated through simple precautions, such as remaining upright after taking medications, taking them with adequate water to prevent pill esophagitis, and using sunscreen while avoiding direct skin exposure to the sun to prevent phototoxicity. In our investigation, a previously healthy population was exposed to doses of 100 mg of doxycycline daily for 8 days. Although specific side effects were not actively solicited at the time, we noted no overt increase in attributable symptoms.

Doxycycline, when diluted with Ringer's Injection, USP, or invert sugar, 10% in water, to a concentration between 1 mg/mL and 0.1 mg/mL, must be completely infused within 12 hours after reconstitution to ensure adequate stability. During infusion, the solution must be protected from direct sunlight. Reconstituted solutions (1 to 0.1 mg/mL) may be stored up to 72 hours before starting the infusion if refrigerated and protected from sunlight and artificial light. Infusion must then be completed within 12 hours. Solutions must be used within these time periods or discarded.

Diluted solutions (0.1 to 1 mg/mL) prepared using Normosol-M® in D5-W; Normosol-R® in D5-W; Plasma-Lyte® 56 in 5% dextrose; or Plasma-Lyte® 148 in 5% dextrose may also be stored up to 12 hours prior to starting the infusion, if refrigerated and protected from sunlight and artificial light. The infusion must be completed within 12 hours. Solutions must be used within these time periods or discarded.

When diluted with lactated Ringer's Injection, USP, or dextrose 5% in lactated Ringer's, infusion of the solution (approximately 1 mg/mL) or lower concentrations (not less than 0.1 mg/mL) must be completed within six hours after reconstitution to ensure adequate stability. During infusion, the solution must be protected from direct sunlight. Solutions must be used within this time period or discarded.

Solutions of doxycycline for injection, at a concentration of 10 mg/mL in sterile water for injection, when frozen immediately after reconstitution, are stable for eight weeks when stored at –20°C. If the product is warmed, care should be taken to ensure it remains stable.

### The efficacy of doxycycline treatment on infection: An open-label, randomized trial in Ghana [^114dhnoX]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). High credibility.

Within the group followed for 24 months as a secondary endpoint, one participant from the early group had 2,091 MF/mL at baseline and zero at the 12-month follow-up but had 5 MF/mL at the 24-month follow-up. This might have been due to new infection or the limitations of MF assessment/applied methods, especially in individuals with low MF counts.

Reinfection is likely to occur in this area of ongoing transmission, given that it is estimated that the adult worms are long-lived, with MF detectable 10 years after leaving an endemic area. New infections coincide with a rise in Wolbachia levels following doxycycline treatment. This has been documented for onchocerciasis, where old, doxycycline-treated, and thus Wolbachia-depleted, female worms were located in onchocercomata next to young, nulliparous worms that were full of Wolbachia. However, due to the unavailability of adult worms for histological analysis in M. perstans infection, we could not prove these findings for mansonellosis in a similar manner. There is a need for continued study to determine how long it takes for reinfection to occur in M. perstans infections. A slight increase in MF levels (not significant) at month 24 in the early group, which has the longest time difference between treatment and follow-up, may support the occurrence of new infection in our study groups.

### Diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease [^1156tiX7]. Mayo Clinic Proceedings (2008). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for tick bites, particularly in evaluating Lyme disease, the AAFP 2012 guidelines recommend a two-tier serologic testing protocol. Initially, an ELISA should be obtained, followed by the more specific Western blot for confirmation when the assay samples are positive or equivocal for the diagnosis of Lyme disease.
