## Question

Renal abscess

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about renal abscess management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and epidemiology to frame pretest probability. Then, I should verify the typical presentation and key differentials. Next, I will review the diagnostic imaging pathway and how to distinguish abscess from mimics. After that, I need to check the microbiology and resistance patterns that drive empiric therapy. Then, I will examine management by size and clinical severity, including when to drain and when antibiotics suffice. I should also consider special populations and complications. Finally, I will outline follow-up, prognostic factors, and a practical algorithm, making sure each step aligns with the best available evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and epidemiology so I don't jump to conclusions. Renal abscess is uncommon in children but represents the severe end of upper urinary tract infection spectrum, with most cases arising from ascending E. coli UTIs rather than hematogenous spread, and a female predominance in pediatric series, which helps calibrate pretest probability in a child with fever and flank pain and high inflammatory markers [^1164uXyD] [^113LQfx5] [^11692zt5].

> I need to check the typical presentation and key differentials before ordering tests. Fever, flank pain, and nausea or vomiting are common, but symptoms are often nonspecific in younger children, leading to delays; leukocytosis and elevated CRP are typical, and pyuria is present in roughly half to two-thirds, so a normal urinalysis does not exclude disease, and I should keep acute lobar nephronia, emphysematous pyelonephritis, xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, and tumor on the list to avoid anchoring bias [^113kJzr1] [^113N8drx] [^115mEUxm] [^114mM6SD] [^117N2LP6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging; I should verify the optimal sequence. Ultrasound is a good first-line screen in children because it avoids radiation and can detect complex collections, but contrast-enhanced CT provides superior sensitivity and specificity and is the gold standard when abscess is suspected or ultrasound is nondiagnostic; MRI can substitute when radiation avoidance is paramount, and ACR supports selective CT with IV contrast for suspected complications such as abscess, which I should align with clinical severity and local expertise [^116rn54s] [^113PFvcX] [^117JX8Lv].

> Wait, let me verify how to distinguish abscess from mimics on imaging so I don't misclassify. A mature abscess typically shows a well-defined complex cystic lesion with rim enhancement and central hypoattenuation on CT, lacks internal vascularity on Doppler, and may demonstrate restricted diffusion centrally on MRI; these features help differentiate from necrotic tumor and from acute lobar nephronia, which is a wedge-shaped area of hypoenhancement without liquefaction and may require prolonged antibiotics to prevent progression to abscess [^112aKG7p] [^115mEUxm].

> I should double-check the microbiology and resistance risks before choosing empiric therapy. E. coli predominates in pediatric renal abscesses, but Staphylococcus aureus, including community-acquired MRSA, occurs, particularly with hematogenous sources; ESBL-producing Enterobacterales are increasingly reported in previously healthy children, so I need to consider local antibiograms, prior antibiotic exposures, and sepsis severity when selecting initial agents and be ready to escalate to carbapenems if ESBL bacteremia is suspected or confirmed [^1164uXyD] [^113LQfx5] [^1163DiVe] [^112CWgxU].

> Let me think about size-based management because this is where errors happen. For lesions 3 cm or smaller, conservative management with IV antibiotics alone is highly effective, with pediatric series showing 100% success in small abscesses and high overall cure rates; for lesions larger than 3 cm or in patients who are persistently febrile despite appropriate antibiotics, immunocompromised, or critically ill, percutaneous drainage should be considered, ideally under image guidance, and this size threshold is echoed in pediatric infectious disease guidance and supported by interventional radiology appropriateness criteria [^1164uXyD] [^113LQfx5] [^116dRZfG] [^111KFP6Z].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the 3 cm cutoff was a hard rule; let me reconsider and ensure clinical context is integrated. While the 3 cm threshold is a pragmatic guide, persistent clinical instability, failure to improve after 48–72 hours of appropriate therapy, or host factors such as immunocompromise can justify earlier drainage even for smaller collections, so I should individualize decisions rather than rely solely on size [^116dRZfG] [^1164uXyD].

> I need to ensure the antibiotic strategy is aligned with severity and culture data. Empiric broad-spectrum therapy should cover gram-negative uropathogens and consider MRSA risk; once cultures return, I should narrow promptly, and if ESBL is identified, a carbapenem is appropriate, with some pediatric reports supporting early carbapenem use in bacteremic ESBL infections while acknowledging the evidence base is limited and carbapenem-sparing options may be considered in select stable patients after susceptibilities are known; total duration commonly ranges from 2 to 4 weeks depending on size, drainage, and clinical response, with longer courses for larger or undrained collections [^112CWgxU] [^1163DiVe] [^113X2Yty].

> But wait, what if the patient is an infant, immunocompromised, or has a transplanted kidney; I should verify special considerations. In infants and young children, ultrasound-first strategies remain appropriate, and evaluation for underlying urologic anomalies such as high-grade VUR is important; in immunocompromised hosts, atypical pathogens including fungi and resistant bacteria are more likely, so broader empiric coverage and early source control are prudent; in transplant recipients, interventional radiology standards emphasize detailed reporting of access, microbiology, and outcomes to guide management and prevent recurrence [^111gzdvH] [^112CWgxU] [^117DXPWU].

> I will now examine complications and red flags that change urgency. Emphysematous pyelonephritis, obstructed pyonephrosis, and perinephric extension increase morbidity and may necessitate urgent drainage and supportive care; xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis often requires nephrectomy for diffuse disease, though focal cases may be managed conservatively or with partial nephrectomy; I should also remember that malignancy can rarely masquerade as abscess, so lack of response or atypical features warrants reconsideration of the diagnosis and possible tissue diagnosis [^114mM6SD] [^112nhu9R] [^115Mft5q].

> Next, I should review follow-up and prognostic markers to close the loop. Repeat imaging at about 1–2 weeks helps confirm resolution trajectory, DMSA scintigraphy 3–6 months after the acute episode can document scarring and relative function, and persistent or new scars correlate with risk of hypertension and CKD; early recognition and appropriate therapy reduce the risk of permanent renal damage, but delays are common, especially in younger children with nonspecific symptoms, so I need to ensure timely imaging and reassessment at 48 hours if the clinical course is atypical [^111gzdvH] [^113X2Yty] [^11454pkL].

> Hold on, I should verify that my practical algorithm is coherent and evidence-based. Suspect renal abscess in a child with fever, flank or abdominal pain, leukocytosis, and elevated CRP, especially with a UTI history; obtain renal ultrasound promptly and proceed to contrast-enhanced CT if ultrasound is nondiagnostic or if the child is severely ill; start empiric broad-spectrum IV antibiotics covering gram-negatives and MRSA as indicated; if the abscess is 3 cm or smaller and the child is clinically stable, continue antibiotics with close monitoring; if the abscess is larger than 3 cm or the child fails to improve within 48–72 hours, arrange image-guided percutaneous drainage; tailor antibiotics to culture results and treat for 2–4 weeks total, arranging follow-up imaging and DMSA as indicated to assess for scarring and underlying anomalies [^116rn54s] [^116dRZfG] [^1164uXyD] [^111gzdvH].

Renal abscess is a **pus collection within the kidney** [^112aKG7p] most often due to ascending E. coli infection [^1164uXyD], with risk factors including diabetes, obstruction, and immunosuppression [^113uywKX]. Patients present with fever, flank pain, and leukocytosis [^113N8drx]; CT with contrast is the **diagnostic gold standard** [^113PFvcX], showing a rim-enhancing fluid collection [^112aKG7p]. Management is **antibiotics plus drainage** for collections > 3 cm or refractory cases [^116dRZfG], with percutaneous drainage preferred [^112joAfK]; small abscesses may resolve with antibiotics alone [^1164uXyD]. Complications include sepsis, renal scarring, and loss of renal function [^113uywKX] [^111gzdvH] [^113X2Yty]; early recognition and intervention are critical to prevent morbidity and mortality [^113uywKX].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

Renal abscesses arise from **ascending urinary tract infections (UTIs)** [^1164uXyD], with hematogenous spread less common [^113PFvcX]. Risk factors include:

- **Diabetes mellitus**: increases risk and severity [^notfound].
- **Urinary tract obstruction**: stones, strictures, or congenital anomalies [^11454pkL].
- **Immunosuppression**: HIV, chemotherapy, or immunosuppressive drugs [^113uywKX].
- **Instrumentation**: recent urologic procedures or catheterization [^113uywKX].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical features include:

- **Fever**: persistent, often > 38°C [^113N8drx].
- **Flank pain**: unilateral, severe, radiating to the groin [^113N8drx].
- **Leukocytosis**: elevated WBC count [^115dNVdH].
- **Dysuria**: frequency, urgency, hematuria [^115NKH4J].
- **Nausea/vomiting**: common systemic symptoms [^113kJzr1].

---

## Diagnostic imaging

Imaging is **essential** for diagnosis and management [^113PFvcX]:

| **Imaging modality** | **Findings** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Ultrasound (US) | - Hypoechoic lesion <br/> - Posterior enhancement <br/> - No internal vascularity [^112aKG7p] | Operator-dependent <br/> Limited sensitivity for small abscesses [^112fWSbA] |
| Computed tomography (CT) | - Rim-enhancing fluid collection <br/> - Perinephric fat stranding <br/> - Gas in emphysematous cases [^113y5AJK] | Radiation exposure <br/> Contrast allergy [^notfound] |
| Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) | - Hypointense T1 <br/> - Hyperintense T2 <br/> - Restricted diffusion [^112aKG7p] | Limited availability <br/> Longer scan time [^notfound] |

---

CT with contrast is the **gold standard** [^113PFvcX], providing detailed anatomical information and guiding intervention [^114eZ6mF].

---

## Microbiology

Common pathogens include:

- **Escherichia coli**: most common [^112CWgxU].
- **Klebsiella pneumoniae**: frequent [^113PFvcX].
- **Proteus mirabilis**: associated with stones [^notfound].
- **Staphylococcus aureus**: hematogenous spread [^1164uXyD].
- **Fungi**: Candida spp. in immunocompromised patients [^112CWgxU].

---

## Management

Management depends on abscess size, patient stability, and response to therapy [^1164uXyD]:

- **Antibiotics**: empiric broad-spectrum IV therapy, then narrow to culture results [^112CWgxU].
- **Percutaneous drainage**: for abscesses > 3 cm or refractory to antibiotics [^116dRZfG] [^1164uXyD].
- **Surgical intervention**: open drainage or nephrectomy for complex or refractory cases [^114WZTH6].

---

## Complications

Potential complications include:

- **Sepsis**: life-threatening [^11692zt5].
- **Renal scarring**: permanent renal damage [^notfound].
- **Loss of renal function**: chronic kidney disease [^113X2Yty].
- **Perinephric abscess**: extension into perinephric space [^113y5AJK].
- **Fistula formation**: rare, severe complication [^112J4ugk].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis is **generally favorable** with early diagnosis and appropriate management [^11692zt5]. Delayed treatment increases the risk of chronic renal impairment, hypertension, and recurrent infections [^113X2Yty].

---

Renal abscess is a serious infection requiring **prompt recognition, accurate imaging, and targeted therapy** [^113uywKX]. Early intervention with antibiotics and drainage when indicated prevents significant morbidity and mortality [^11348jpS].

### Pediatric renal abscesses: a contemporary series [^1164uXyD]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric renal abscesses are an uncommon diagnosis, with a paucity of data comparing treatment modalities. Patient presentation ranges from persistent dull flank/abdominal pain with or without fevers, to those who are overtly ill, presenting with hemodynamic instability and bacteremia. Management for pediatric renal abscesses is typically based on results extrapolated from small series in adult cohorts, with conservative measures recommended when the lesion is < 3 cm.

Objective

This study evaluated the presentation, management and outcomes of a contemporary cohort of pediatric patients with renal abscesses.

Study Design

A total of 16 consecutive pediatric patients with radiologically diagnosed intra-renal or peri-nephric abscesses from 1990 to 2012 were identified. Patients were identified by querying institutional records via ICD-9 and CPT codes referencing renal abscess. Charts were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate multiple clinical variables, including: presenting symptoms, size of abscess, management strategy and clinical outcomes. Clinical resolution was confirmed via repeat ultrasound or computed tomography.

Results

The median age at presentation was 13 years (range 1 month-18 years) and 13/16 patients (81%) were female. Abscess formation was secondary to: urinary tract infection in 13 (81%); hematogenous seeding from a skin infection in one (6%); and an unknown etiology in two (12%) patients. The most common organism identified on urine culture was Escherichia coli (10, 77%). Hematogenous seeding was confirmed in only one case, with Staphylococcus aureus growing on culture from both a cutaneous lesion and percutaneous drainage of the renal lesion. Overall, abscesses were a median of 2.2 cm (IQR 2, 3.7), with 13 (81%) successfully managed with conservative therapy, including intravenous antibiotics, with resolution on repeat imaging at a median of 21 days (range 6–55). For patients presenting with abscesses ≤ 3 cm, conservative measures were employed in 10/11 cases, with 100% success rate. Three patients had larger abscesses (3.8, 4, and 10 cm), which resolved after treatment with percutaneous drainage. A voiding cystourethrogram was performed in 10 patients, with two (20%) detecting an abnormality (low-grade vesicoureteral reflux, which required no further intervention).

Conclusions

Pediatric renal abscesses were most commonly small and secondary to an E. coli UTI. Most small (≤ 3 cm) renal abscesses resolved with conservative management. Percutaneous drainage should be considered for lesions > 3 cm and in patients who remain persistently febrile, despite culture-specific antibiotics, are immunocompromised or critically ill.

### Fatal renal abscess caused by Porphyromonas gingivalis and subcapsular hemorrhage, Japan [^113uywKX]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Renal abscesses are typically associated with underlying conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, urinary tract obstructions, or immunosuppression. However, our patient had no notable immunodeficiency or recent urologic interventions that could predispose him to such an infection. The atypical clinical manifestations, without classic signs of sepsis-like fever or leukocytosis, likely delayed the diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

Early recognition and aggressive treatment are critical in managing renal abscesses. Appropriate imaging studies, prompt abscess drainage, and targeted antimicrobial therapy are key to successful renal abscess outcomes. Identification of P. gingivalis in this case highlights the importance of comprehensive diagnostic workups, including advanced molecular techniques, to detect uncommon pathogens.

In summary, we identified a rare case of fatal renal abscess and sepsis caused by P. gingivalis. Early diagnosis and aggressive management are crucial to improving patient outcomes in such complex infections. This case underscores the need for clinicians to maintain a high index of suspicion for atypical pathogens in patients with renal masses and systemic symptoms, even when classic risk factors are absent.

### Clinical assessment of children with renal abscesses presenting to the pediatric emergency department [^113kJzr1]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Renal abscesses are relatively uncommon in children but may lead to prolonged admission and severe complications. Primary physicians should keep the diagnosis of renal abscess in mind when children present with triad symptoms (fever, nausea/vomiting, and flank pain), pyuria, and significantly elevated serum WBC count (> 15,000/μL) and CRP level (> 50 mg/L). Children with renal abscesses usually have good outcomes with early diagnosis and institution of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Finally, percutaneous drainage should not be routinely required in children with renal abscesses.

### Conservative management of paediatric renal abscess [^1157yXk9]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Renal abscesses in the paediatric patient population are a rare entity. Patients are usually treated with percutaneous surgical drainage of the renal abscess as conservative treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is not considered as effective. We describe the conservative management of renal abscesses without percutaneous drainage in 6 children.

Materials and Methods

Six patients with a median age of 31 months, admitted over a 6 year period at two medical centers, were retrospectively studied. All patients were treated conservatively.

Results

In all patients, the abscesses were solitary, unilateral and located in the right kidney. The median abscess diameter was 38 mm. The diagnosis was made by ultrasonography. All 6 children were treated conservatively with a urinary catheter or suprapubic catheter and broad-spectrum antibiotics. None of the renal abscesses were surgically or percutaneously drained.

Conclusions

A series of 6 paediatric renal abscesses, all successfully treated without surgical intervention, is presented. We believe that, in carefully selected cases, renal abscesses can be managed without percutaneous drainage. Furthermore, all children had complete resolution of the abscess.

Renal abscess is a rare disease in childhood and early diagnosis is essential to minimize the renal damages. Experiences gained from this 10-year study on patients with CT-proved diagnosis include the varied clinical presentations and use of sonographic-marked nephromegaly and focal mass as indications for further CT diagnosis.

Imaging findings and management

All patients were diagnosed with renal abscesses by imaging (CT or US). In 12 (70.6%) patients, the abscesses were confined to the right kidney (Table 4). The average abscess size was 27.8 ± 9.3 mm and more than half of the children had a single abscess on imaging studies.

Table 4
Imaging results of 17 children with renal abscesses

Multiple, > 1 abscess or multilobulated

All patients were treated with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics for a mean duration of 16.6 ± 8.8 days. Four (23.5%) of the 17 patients had a combination of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics therapy and percutaneous abscess drainage by US-guide needle aspiration. The mean duration of hospitalization in patients who received percutaneous abscess drainage was 24.3 ± 12.5 days vs. 15.5 ± 7.3 days for patients receiving antibiotics alone. All of the 17 patients recovered completely and none required an open drainage or nephrectomy. During the follow-up examinations, we did not find any abscess recurrence in these patients.

### Clinical assessment of children with renal abscesses presenting to the pediatric emergency department [^11348jpS]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

To prevent life-threatening complications caused by renal abscesses, early recognition and appropriate treatment is important. Abscess formation is more likely under conditions of impaired immunity. According to previous studies, appropriate antibiotic coverage combined with percutaneous or open surgical drainage could dramatically decrease morbidity and mortality from this infection. However, in an adult study, all abscesses < 3 cm in diameter resolved with 4–6 weeks of antibiotic therapy alone, and percutaneous drainage was as effective as open surgery for large and medium-sized abscesses. In a recently published larger pediatric study, only 3 of 45 patients required CT-guided percutaneous drainage in addition to antibiotic management, and none had to undergo open drainage or nephrectomy. In our report, 13 of 17 children were treated successfully with antibiotics alone; 4 children required US-guided percutaneous drainage in addition to antibiotic management, and none needed open drainage or nephrectomy. This supports initial management of pediatric renal abscess with a prolonged antibiotic course and US monitoring, reserving percutaneous drainage for larger renal abscesses or cases refractory to antibiotic therapy. However, definite treatment guidelines for percutaneous drainage in managing children with renal abscesses requires further, larger prospective studies.

The present study has a number of limitations. First, in a retrospective single-center review of medical records, some details of history and physical examinations may not be rigorously documented. Second, the relatively small sample size may fail to address definite factors of early diagnosis and the best treatment modality of renal abscess in children. Finally, the voiding cystourethrogram was not routinely performed in all patients, and the definite role of VUR in renal abscess was therefore difficult to address. These limitations may have led to bias in analyzing the clinical spectrum of renal abscesses in children who presented to the ED.

### Clinical assessment of children with renal abscesses presenting to the pediatric emergency department [^116au3sq]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Renal abscesses are relatively uncommon in children but may result in a prolonged antibiotic course, increased length of hospital stay, high treatment cost, or life-threatening complications. The clinical presentation of renal abscess may be nonspecific, and can include fever, nausea/vomiting, flank pain, abdominal pain, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, leukocytosis, and positive blood/urine cultures. Early diagnosis is imperative to minimize the potential for prolonged admission, high treatment costs, and life-threatening complications. However, it may be challenging for emergency physicians to make an early diagnosis of patients with renal abscesses based on the clinical presentation at the time of their emergency department (ED) visits.

With the progressive improvement of ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT), a definitive diagnosis of renal abscess may be made more readily than was previously possible. However, renal abscesses may be difficult to distinguish from certain renal lesions on US or some renal diseases based on clinical assessment, such as acute pyelonephritis, acute lobar nephronia, and renal mass. CT shows specific findings in cases of renal abscess and it remains the best choice for diagnosis. In addition, CT has the advantage of providing a distinction between renal and perirenal abscesses. In this study, we analyzed the clinical spectrum of renal abscesses in patients who presented to the pediatric ED with the goal of finding initial clinical characteristics that can help emergency physicians diagnose renal abscess earlier and to improve the prognosis for patients with this disease.

### Renal abscess with bacteremia caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli: a case report [^1163DiVe]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Renal abscess is a rare but serious disease among children, and it represents the most severe form of infectious kidney disease. Delayed diagnosis of renal abscesses commonly leads to poor therapeutic outcomes. Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) is a bacterial enzyme that causes resistance to various type of antibiotics, including third-generation cephalosporins and monobactams. Increasing rates of ESBL-producing pathogens is an emerging worldwide problem because the community-acquired infections they cause are difficult to manage. Here, we report the case of a previously healthy child who developed a renal abscess from bacteremia caused by community-acquired ESBL-producing Escherichia coli. We discuss the diagnostic difficulty and management of this condition.

### Thinking of draining a renal abscess? Wait!-could Be acute lobar nephronia [^115mEUxm]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute Lobar Nephronia (ALN) is a rare infective condition of the kidney currently described only in case reports and small case series. The diagnosis of ALN is made by characteristic clinico-radiological findings. Differentiation from acute pyelonephritis, renal abscess and renal tumor is crucial for proper management and to avoid unnecessary diagnostic interventions. Herein, we report a 58-year-old woman with an uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, who was diagnosed clinically as acute pyelonephritis and treated with standard duration of antibiotics but had recurrence of symptoms. On evaluation, she was found to have ALN which was treated successfully with prolonged antibiotic course.

### Pediatric renal abscess: a 10-year single-center retrospective analysis [^113LQfx5]. Hospital Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this retrospective series is to describe the demographics and treatment of patients with renal abscesses and to determine if abscess size influences management.

Methods

We reviewed all pediatric cases of renal abscesses treated over a 10-year period in our medical center. Clinical, laboratory, imaging data, and treatment modalities were analyzed.

Results

Thirty-six patients were evaluated, with renal abscesses found in all age groups. The median age was 9.3 years, and 64% of patients affected were female. Fever and abdominal pain were the most common clinical symptoms. A premorbid genitourinary condition was present in 310/a of patients. Previous urinary tract infection was documented in 31% of the cases. Initial elevation of C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate, when obtained, was observed in > 80% of cases. Abnormal urinalysis was recognized in two-thirds of encounters. Escherichia coli, the most common microorganism isolated, was found in half the cases. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 11%. Ultrasound and computed tomography were the most used diagnostic imaging modalities. Eighty-nine percent of the patients who received intravenous antibiotics alone as an initial treatment regimen did not require percutaneous drainage or surgery.

Conclusions

Ten of the 14 patients with an abscess size ≥ 3 cm had an invasive intervention, but only 1 of these 10 had an initial 48-hour trial of antibiotics alone. In contrast, only 2 of the 22 patients who had an abscess size < 3 cm received an invasive intervention (Fisher P = 0.0002). We conclude that conservative treatment with intravenous antibiotics may be a reasonable initial approach.

### The clinical and imaging presentation of acute "non complicated" pyelonephritis: a new profile for an ancient disease [^114RNVhw]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The diagnosis of APN is still a challenge. At least in settings such as ours in which patients are referred to the Emergency Room after a few days of empirical treatment, the prevalence of incomplete oligosymptomatic presentations is high.

In a context of high prevalence of abscessed lesions (39.5%), severe kidney involvement coexisted with incomplete presentations. None of the clinical or biochemical markers at presentation allowed discrimination between small simple lesions and multifocal or abscessed ones. Hence imaging techniques were needed to assess the severity of kidney involvement and to plan the antibiotic therapy. The relatively high prevalence of kidney scars at presentation (15.1%), mostly with a silent clinical history, draws attention to the difficulty in diagnosing and preventing long-term sequelae of APN.

Therefore, we believe that two recommendations for clinical practice can be drawn from our experience. First, the differential diagnosis of APN should be considered in all patients presenting at least one suggestive clinical feature (fever, flank pain, lower UTI symptoms) accompanied by high inflammatory markers. Second, second-line imaging tests (MRI or CT scans) should be systematically used to define the prevalence and type of parenchymal lesions in order to tailor interventions to the specific clinical contexts.

### Perihepatic, pulmonary, and renal abscesses due to Spilled gallstones [^113mJE5D]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Spilled gallstones are common during laparoscopic cholecystectomy; however, they rarely lead to postoperative complications. Perihepatic abscesses develop in < 0.1% of patients with spilled gallstones and are typically contained within the peritoneal cavity.

Case Report

We present a 57-year-old man with history of cholecystectomy 2 years prior who presented with cough and flank pain and was discovered to have a perihepatic abscess invading his lung and kidney secondary to a spilled gallstone. WHY SHOULD EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS BE AWARE OF THIS? Although most perihepatic abscesses can be treated with percutaneous drainage and antibiotics, abscesses secondary to spilled gallstones usually require open or laparoscopic surgery to drain the abscess and retrieve the gallstone. Prompt identification of spilled gallstones in patients with intra-abdominal and intrathoracic abscesses can thereby guide disposition and decrease morbidity and mortality.

### Renal and perirenal abscesses in patients with otherwise anatomically normal urinary tracts [^113FC4eY]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

We characterized evaluation, management and outcomes in a group of patients diagnosed with renal and perirenal abscesses who had otherwise anatomically normal urinary tracts.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed our experience with renal/perirenal abscesses at University of Texas Medical Branch from 1991 to 2002. Treatment was determined by physician preference in each individual.

Results

Of 70 patients with renal/perirenal abscesses 26 had otherwise anatomically normal urinary tracts, 24 (92%) had at least 1 possible contributory factor, such as diabetes mellitus, and only 38% had the correct diagnosis at initial presentation. The abscess was intranephric in 39% of cases, intranephric and perinephric in 19%, and perinephric only in 42%. Of the 26 patients 18 were treated with percutaneous drainage or aspiration of the abscess and 12 (66.7%) had positive cultures. Eight of the 12 patients (67%) with positive abscess cultures had the same organism in urine and/or blood. All 26 patients were treated with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. In most patients abscess size influenced additional treatments, such as percutaneous needle aspiration or catheter drainage. None of the patients required open surgical drainage, nephrectomy or nephrostomy tube placement. At a mean followup of 10 months all patients had complete radiographic resolution of the abscess without further complications except 1 who had pyelonephritis and another who was found to have a poorly perfused kidney.

Conclusions

With accurate diagnosis and minimally invasive therapy patients with renal and/or perirenal abscesses and otherwise anatomically normal urinary tracts have excellent functional and anatomical outcomes.

### Acute lobar nephronia: a case report and literature review [^115H7XfR]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain commonly present to the emergency department, often generating a broad differential diagnosis. We describe the first reported case in the emergency medicine literature of acute lobar nephronia (ALN).

Objectives

To describe the presentation, evaluation, and management of acute lobar nephronia.

Case Report

A healthy 27-year-old woman presented after 18 h of fever to 39.94°C (103.9°F), nausea, vomiting, and severe right-sided abdominal pain. Despite a normal urinalysis, a contrasted computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated right perinephric stranding, which was initially interpreted as pyelonephritis. A staff over-read the following day by a radiology body specialist confirmed "likely developing abscess", consistent with the diagnosis of acute lobar nephronia.

Conclusion

A normal urinalysis may move clinicians to dismiss a nephrogenic or urologic process. ALN is considered a midpoint in the spectrum of upper urinary tract infections between acute pyelonephritis and intrarenal abscess. Diagnosis may be difficult, and inpatient management, sometimes prolonged, is the norm.

### Clinical assessment of children with renal abscesses presenting to the pediatric emergency department [^113N8drx]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Renal abscesses are relatively uncommon in children but may result in prolonged hospital stays and life-threatening events. We undertook this study to analyze the clinical spectrum of renal abscesses in children admitted to the pediatric emergency department (ED) and to find helpful clinical characteristics that can potentially aid emergency physicians for detecting renal abscesses in children earlier.

Methods

From 2004 to 2011, we retrospectively analyzed 17 patients, aged 18 years or younger, with a definite diagnosis of renal abscess admitted to the ED. The following clinical information was studied: demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory testing, microbiology, imaging studies, treatment modalities, complications, and long-term outcomes. We analyzed these variables among other potential predisposing factors.

Results

During the 8-year study period, 17 patients (7 males and 10 females; mean age, 6.1 ± 4.5 years) were diagnosed with renal abscesses on the basis of ultrasonography and computed tomography findings. The 2 most common presenting symptoms were fever and flank pain (100% and 70.6%, respectively). All of the patients presented with leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Organisms cultured from urine or from the abscess were identified in 11 (64.7%) patients, and Escherichia coli was the most common organism cultured. All patients were treated with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics with the exception of 4 children who also required additional percutaneous drainage of the abscess.

Conclusions

Renal abscesses are relatively rare in children. We suggest that primary care physicians should keep this disease in mind especially when children present with triad symptoms (fever, nausea/vomiting, and flank pain), pyuria, significant leukocytosis, and elevated CRP levels. However, aggressive percutaneous drainage may not need to be routinely performed in children with renal abscesses.

### Renal abscess with bacteremia caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli: a case report [^116xSgPZ]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Renal abscess in children is a rare and severe form of infectious kidney disease that is responsible for several serious complications. In this report, we describe a previously healthy 5-year-old girl with a renal abscess caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (E. coli), which led to bacteremia and renal scarring.

Case presentation

The patient presented to our department with high fever, headache, vomiting for 2 days and high inflammatory response. We diagnosed her with a urinary tract infection and initiated treatment with ampicillin and cefotaxime. Gram-negative bacilli bacteremia was noted on day 3. On day 4, her fever persisted, and a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a renal abscess in the left kidney. After identifying the bacteria as ESBL-producing E. coli from the blood culture, we switched to the antibiotic meropenem and continued treatment for 3 weeks. The renal abscess was not drained. Although the renal abscess was successfully treated and it disappeared, a low-density area remained in same lesion on subsequent CT scans and a dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan performed 4 months after onset revealed renal scarring.

Conclusion

Given the increasing prevalence of ESBL-producing microorganisms, clinicians should be aware of the possibility of renal abscesses caused by community-acquired ESBL-producing organisms even in previously healthy children. Once a renal abscess is suspected, early diagnosis and management are important for reducing the risk of life-threating complications and renal scarring.

### State of the art: imaging of renal infections [^114ZS5FQ]. Emergency Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Infections of the urinary tract are common and account for a large number of patient encounters in the ambulatory and emergency department setting. Their severity and presentation varies, and although uncomplicated infections can often be diagnosed and treated based on clinical and laboratory findings alone, diagnostic imaging may be necessary in some cases to guide appropriate medical or surgical therapy. We will briefly describe the indications for imaging known or suspected upper urinary tract infections, and the relative benefits and limitations of the different imaging modalities for a given clinical presentation. This will be followed by a discussion of various types of renal infections with a pictorial review of their imaging appearances and differential diagnoses.

Additional blood tests, and imaging can be useful depending on the subgroup of cUTI, both for initial diagnosis and subsequently (Table 2), with the rationale for their use often different at different stages in the infection. For example, USS of the kidneys and urinary tract during the acute phase can neither rule in nor rule out an upper UTI (pyelonephritis) or vesicoureteric reflux (VUR). Therefore, the role of acute USS in children with urosepsis, septic shock, poor urine flow, abdominal or bladder mass and increased creatinine is to determine whether there is acute obstruction that needs urgent surgical intervention.USS may be performed for different reasons, including failure to respond with suitable antibiotics within 48 hours to investigate for renal abscess, or for recurrent UTI to assess for other urological abnormalities needing intervention.

All children should be reassessed 48 hours after diagnosis for (1) clinical response to treatment, (2) confirmation of the diagnosis and (3) potential targeting of antibiotics according to susceptibility (aim to the narrow antimicrobial spectrum).

Treatment should be stopped if the UTI diagnosis is not confirmed, that is, most cases with a negative urine culture with no prior antibiotics to explain this. If the response to treatment is atypical and does not follow the expected trajectory after 48 hours, reassessment for the cause is imperative, rather than simply switching to IV or broader-spectrum antibiotics (although either of these could be needed). Depending on the clinical situation, repeat urine culture, inflammatory markers, serum creatinine and renal USS may be needed to confirm the UTI diagnosis and assess for complications. Other investigations may be needed to seek an alternate/additional diagnosis.

How Should Children With cUTI be Treated?

Treatment of cUTI involves consideration of antibiotic route, choice and duration and supportive management. The majority of RCTs and meta-analyses of childhood UTIs exclude those with cUTIs, so recommendations largely rely on a synthesis of retrospective studies (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2,) and expert opinion to provide a practical empirical guideline to initiate treatment (Table 3). Due to the variability of complicating features even within subgroups, a further individualized approach is often needed, considering local antibiograms, past urine cultures, antibiotic exposure, hospital admissions, urine catheterization and other host factors, including allergies.

### Multifocal renal fungal abscesses [^113RQC6M]. Urology (2016). Low credibility.

We report a case of multiple fungal renal abscesses in a 36-year-old woman with a history of diabetes and intravenous substance use disorder. The patient presented with fever and hematuria, and was found to be bacteremic and fungemic. She was initially managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals. She remained febrile and imaging on treatment day 14 showed no improvement of the renal abscesses. Thus, a nephrectomy was performed, after which the patient defervesced and follow-up blood cultures were negative. There is a paucity of literature regarding management of multifocal fungal renal abscesses that fail to respond to medical management.

Supportive Management

Additional management depends on the cUTI subgroup and complicating features. This may involve antiemetics, fluid resuscitation and management and occasionally intensive care support. There is no clear role for steroids currently (GRADE D).
Surgically, temporary diversion may be needed for urinary obstruction, and percutaneous drainage is considered for renal abscesses (GRADE D).

Modes of supportive care for cUTI are dependent on subgroup and presenting features. Severely ill patients may need fluid resuscitation and intensive care support. Patients with vomiting should have antiemetics, as this may avoid use of IV antibiotics. With obstructive uropathy, temporary urinary diversion may be needed if antibiotics alone fails. For renal abscesses > 3 cm, percutaneous drainage should be considered. A recent meta-analysis concluded that steroids reduced renal scarring associate with UTI. However, the included studies either did not show this at all, or did not reach statistical significance. Given the variations between included studies in inclusion criteria, intervention and timing and the uncertain clinical impact of scar reduction, there is no clear role for steroids in UTI currently. No other medications have been identified as beneficial.

How Should We Follow Up Children With cUTI?

Follow-up of children with cUTI involves consideration of antimicrobial prophylaxis, imaging and referral to nephrology/urology.

Antimicrobial prophylaxis

The benefit of continuous antibiotic prophylaxis is controversial and reserved for particular cUTI subgroups: (1) in neonates and infants < 2 m, this includes those with high-grade VUR (3–4), antenatal hydronephrosis (HN), ureteral dilatation and HN in uncircumcised infants; and (2) in older children, this includes those with multiple recurrent UTI, high-grade VUR (3–4), spina bifida accompanied with high-grade VUR and/or intermittent catheterization, bladder/bowel dysfunction and severe obstructive uropathy until surgical correction (GRADES B–D).
In neonates, amoxicillin is the drug of choice, while older children are recommended to use trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or nitrofurantoin (GRADES C and D).
Consider use of cranberry products in older children to alleviate antibiotic pressure (GRADE B).
Duration of CAP should not exceed 3–6 months followed by critical reevaluation (GRADE D).

### Atraumatic bilateral renal subcapsular urinomas in a young, healthy female [^114PAJHG]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinomas are rare and generally result from trauma to any part of the urinary collecting system. Appropriate imaging is crucial in the timely diagnosis and management of urinomas and for ruling out other etiologies such as subcapsular renal hematomas and perinephric abscesses.

Case Report

A 31-year-old woman with no past medical history or known trauma presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with a week of right flank pain, abdominal pain, and intermittent fevers. On point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), she was found to have a complex right perinephric collection, later confirmed with computed tomography (CT) imaging. She was treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics and discharged after a 3-day hospital admission with instructions to follow up with Urology. A day later, she was readmitted with worsening bilateral flank pain and persistent fevers. Image-guided percutaneous aspirations of her bilateral perinephric fluid collections revealed both urine and blood. A right ureteral stent was then placed with ultimate resolution of her symptoms. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? Urinomas without history of trauma are rare and should be on the differential for patients presenting with flank pain and infectious symptoms. Urinomas or other expanding perinephric fluid collections can result in superimposed infection, rupture, secondary hypertension, and renal failure. Here, we present an atypical case of atraumatic bilateral renal subcapsular urinomas with hemorrhagic components in a young and healthy woman. Our case further outlines the utility of POCUS in the ED for the timely diagnosis and management of this disease process.

### Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis: a complicated febrile urinary tract infection detected by point-of-care ultrasound in the emergency department [^114mM6SD]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs) include a spectrum of pathologies from uncomplicated pyelonephritis to urosepsis, including xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP). Most febrile UTIs are treated with antibiotics alone, but studies indicate nearly 12% of cases of presumed simple pyelonephritis require emergent urologic intervention. How to identify these individuals, while limiting unnecessary advanced imaging and delays in diagnosis, challenges all emergency providers. We review the diagnosis and management of XGP, as well as the evidence regarding the role of renal ultrasound in the identification of complicated presentations of febrile UTIs.

Case Report

We present a case of XGP, a complicated febrile UTI requiring immediate urologic intervention, diagnosed by point-of-care ultrasound. A 40-year-old female presented in severe sepsis and complaining of flank pain. Prompt bedside ultrasound demonstrated hydronephrosis, expediting definitive urologic treatment via percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? With a mortality rate exceeding 40%, obstructed pyonephrosis requires prompt decompression. Given its exceptional sensitivity for identifying hydronephrosis and ability to detect abscesses and emphysematous changes, we advocate a point-of-care ultrasound-first approach to screen for cases of complicated febrile UTIs in order to expedite treatment and limit radiation in uncomplicated presentations.

### Clinical assessment of children with renal abscesses presenting to the pediatric emergency department [^11454pkL]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Renal abscess is a rare clinical condition in children, and the prevalence in children is still unknown. During our 8-year study period, of approximately 200,000 children presenting to our pediatric ED, only 17 pediatric patients were discharged with the final diagnosis of renal abscess. However, renal abscess is one of the most severe forms of renal parenchymal infection in children and may lead to renal loss and even death. The female to male ratio of pediatric renal abscess in our study was 1.4:1. This result is similar to the largest study of pediatric renal abscess in which the female to male ratio was 1.7:1. As previously reported, the most common predisposing risk factors of renal abscesses in adults are diabetes mellitus, nephrolithiasis, and ureteral obstruction. In the pediatric population, urological abnormality (VUR, ureteropelvic junction obstructions, and calyceal diverticulum) and urolithiasis seem to be the most important predisposing risk factors for renal abscesses. In our series, a 15-year-old girl had diabetes mellitus, and 3 children presented with VUR. Thus, preexisting structural abnormities of the urinary tract and systemic diseases are not necessarily prerequisites for renal abscess formation.

Clinical diagnosis of renal abscess is often difficult because the symptoms are often nonspecific, especially in younger children. In 2008, Cheng et al. observed fever in 100% of patients, nausea and vomiting in 44.4%, abdominal pain in 35.6%, and flank pain in 31.1%. Of the 17 patients in our study, fever was also observed in all of them (100%), and 41.2% presented with prolonged fever for > 7 days prior to diagnosis. The mean fever duration before admission of these 17 children was 5.18 ± 3.89 days, and children who were aged < 6 years had longer fever durations before admission (6.27 ± 4.31 days). This indicates that younger children who present with renal abscesses usually show less typical symptoms or signs, which may lead to delay diagnosis and treatment; in our study, 41.2% of the younger children presented with the triad of fever, nausea and vomiting, and flank pain.

### Clinical assessment of children with renal abscesses presenting to the pediatric emergency department [^115dNVdH]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Laboratory tests are not specific for the diagnosis of renal abscess. In our study, all 17 patients had leukocytosis with elevated CRP levels, and 64.7% of them presented with WBC counts > 15,000/μL. In addition, 58.8% of the 17 children showed pyuria, but none manifested renal function impairment. According to these results, we suggest that emergency physicians should keep the diagnosis of renal abscess in mind when children present with triad symptoms, pyuria, and significant elevated serum WBC counts and CRP levels.

We compared the clinical presentations and laboratory results between the children who presented with multiple abscesses and single abscess. We found that flank pain, anorexia or vomiting, significant leukocytosis, pyuria, and urine culture were more frequently noted in the multiple-abscess patient group. Early imaging studies and intravenous antibiotics are advocated in this group of children to minimize hospital stay.

### Renal abscess with bacteremia caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli: a case report [^117GFsZh]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

Renal abscess is a rare bacterial infection among children. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a renal abscess in a pediatric patient with bacteremia caused by community-acquired ESBL-producing E. coli. Increasing rates of fecal carriage of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in children have been reported. The occurrence of UTIs caused by these bacteria has also increased, and the selection of empirical treatments for UTI is becoming complicated. Only one case of pediatric renal abscess caused by community-acquired ESBL E. coli has previously been reported, and it had a favorable outcome without bacteremia.

Our patient developed a renal abscess caused by ESBL-producing E. coli despite previously being healthy. Several studies have reported that an underlying disease, recurrent UTI, or recent hospitalization are potential risk factors for UTI caused by ESBL-positive microorganisms. In addition, prophylactic antibiotics, especially cephalosporins for urinary tract anomalies, have been reported as risk factors for UTIs caused by community-acquired ESBL-producing microorganisms. Although patients with a renal abscess often have urinary tract abnormalities such as vesicoureteral reflux, patients without underlying diseases can also be affected by renal abscesses.

In this case, the urine culture was positive after confirmation of a positive blood culture and no signs of vesicoureteral reflux were found. Although the etiology of the renal abscess was not fully understood, ascending infection due to vesicoureteral reflux and hematogenous dissemination are thought to be potential etiologies. Renal abscess in the absence of a positive urine culture and no signs of vesicoureteral reflux may suggest an etiology of hematogenous dissemination. Physicians should be aware of false-negative cases of vesicoureteral reflux, such as a situation in which the bladder was not filled over the age-adjusted bladder capacity, although vesicoureteral reflux is usually used for evaluating voiding cystourethrogram.

Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and flank pain are typical symptoms of a renal abscess. However, in children, the absence of such a specific set of symptoms often makes it difficult to obtain an early diagnosis. Renal abscesses are usually confirmed by medical imaging, and CT scans are the preferred diagnostic modality, in part because they help diagnose the condition earlier than sonography. Although the present case revealed vomiting before presentation, 2 days passed before the renal abscess was diagnosed from a CT scan.

### Renal and perinephric abscesses: analysis of 65 consecutive cases [^114WZTH6]. World Journal of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to describe the last 10 years' experience of the diagnosis and treatment of renal, perinephric, and mixed abscesses in an academic reference center.

Patients and Methods

The medical records of 65 patients with renal, perinephric, and mixed abscesses treated at our hospital from January 1992 to December 2002 were reviewed. The data collected included predisposing factors, symptoms, physical examination, initial diagnosis, laboratory and radiologic evaluation, treatment, and clinical outcome.

Results

Perinephric abscesses were found in 33 (50.8%) patients, renal abscesses were found in 16 (24.6%), and 16 (24.6%) had mixed abscesses. Urolithiasis (28%) and diabetes mellitus (28%) were the most common predisposing conditions. The duration of symptoms before hospital admission ranged from 2 to 180 days (mean 20 days). Urine culture was positive in 43% of patients and blood culture was positive in 40% of patients. Most of the perinephric abscesses received an interventional treatment: surgical drainage (24%), percutaneous drainage (42%) or nephrectomy (24%). Most patients were cured (73.3%) on discharge from hospital. Mixed (renal and perinephric) abscess treatment was similar: percutaneous drainage (37.5%), surgical drainage (18.75%) or nephrectomy (37.5%). Most patients were cured (60%) on discharge from hospital. Renal abscesses, however, were treated medically in 69% of patients and 73% were cured on discharge from hospital.

Conclusions

Perinephric and mixed abscesses are successfully managed by interventional treatment. Renal abscesses can be managed by medical treatment only, reserving interventional treatment for large collections or patients with clinical impairment. Early diagnosis is an important factor in the outcome of renal and perinephric abscesses.

### Imaging of acute pyelonephritis in the adult [^117JX8Lv]. European Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in adults is predominantly made by a combination of typical clinical features of flank pain, high temperature and dysuria combined with urinalysis findings of bacteruria and pyuria. Imaging is generally reserved for patients who have atypical presenting features or in those who fail to respond to conventional therapy. In addition, early imaging may be useful in diabetics or immunocompromised patients. In such patients, imaging may not only aid in making the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis, but more importantly, it may help identify complications such as abscess formation. In this pictorial review, we discuss the role of modern imaging in acute pyelonephritis and its complications. We discuss the growing role of cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography (CT) and novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques that may be used to demonstrate both typical as well as unusual manifestations of acute pyelonephritis and its complications. In addition, conditions such as emphysematous and fungal pyelonephritis are discussed.

### Imaging of urologic trauma [^114eZ6mF]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Urologic trauma encompassed a wide range of injuries affecting the urologic tract, resulting from various traumatic events or iatrogenic procedures. This review explores the clinical presentation, diagnostic strategies, and management approaches of urologic trauma, emphasizing the critical role of imaging, particularly computed tomography, in accurately assessing and guiding treatment decisions. Renal, ureteral, bladder, and urethral trauma are comprehensively discussed, including mechanisms of injury, classification systems, and therapeutic interventions. In addition, we discuss potential complications such as post-traumatic urinoma, delayed bleeding, urinary fistula, perinephric abscess, pyelonephritis, and hydronephrosis.

### Current treatment and outcomes of perinephric abscesses [^114eLspk]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

We characterize the treatment and outcomes of perinephric abscesses in a contemporary cohort of patients.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed the experience with perinephric abscesses at a single community based hospital. Abdominal computerized tomography (CT) was widely available during the study period and experience with radiographic guided percutaneous drainage was extensive. Therapy and intervention for individual patients were dictated by the treating physician.

Results

Of the 25 patients identified with perinephric abscesses 3 (12%) ultimately died. Although 40% had multiple risk factors for perinephric abscesses only 35% were identified at presentation. Urine cultures were positive in 72% of patients and CT had a diagnostic sensitivity of 92%. Ten patients with a mean abscess size of 1.8 cm. were treated with antibiotics alone (mean hospitalization 10 days) while 11 with a mean abscess size of 11 cm. received antibiotics and initial percutaneous drainage (mean hospitalization 30 days). Of the 11 patients treated with percutaneous drainage 4 ultimately required surgical exploration and nephrectomy.

Conclusions

The clinical characteristics of perinephric abscesses have not changed significantly but improved imaging with CT allows earlier diagnosis and treatment, which likely contributed to the reduced mortality in our cohort compared to historical series. With accurate staging and careful followup, a variety of treatments can be successful, including antibiotics alone or in conjunction with percutaneous drainage and urinary drainage. Open surgical drainage and nephrectomy may eventually be required in some patients and should be considered if adequate drainage is not achieved.

### Renal and urological disorders associated with inflammatory bowel disease [^112fWSbA]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Penetrating Crohn's Disease Involving the Renal Tract

Transmural inflammation in CD predisposes to bowel perforation and fistula formation, which occurs in about 10% of patients during long-term follow-up. Adherence of inflamed intestine to the bladder wall may cause erosion and fistulization in the form of colo- and entero-vesical fistulae in 2% to 4% of Crohn's patients. Fistula formation may be preceded by subacute small bowel obstruction if there is coexistent intestinal stricturing. Entero-vesical fistulae are often associated with intrapelvic abscess development. Presenting clinical features may be pneumaturia, urinary tract infection, and fecaluria — or a combination thereof.

Comprehensive evaluation of suspected entero-vesical fistula typically requires the utilization of several imaging modalities to precisely define the fistulous connection, the presence of an abscess, and the exclusion of coexistent bowel stricturing. Historically, plain abdominal x-ray, barium enema, and intravenous urography were used, but these have been superseded by cross-sectional imaging. Cystoscopy helps identify a possible fistulous tract, but the findings are often nonspecific, failing to identify a fistula in up to 65% of cases. Ultrasound, which is safe and well-tolerated, is useful in the diagnosis of colo-vesical fistulae, and its yield may be improved by the administration of oral contrast before performing the study. However, it is highly operator-dependent and may not offer the anatomical detail afforded by other modalities. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which are now considered the gold standard, benefit from providing a multiplanar 3D representation of the fistula. This is invaluable in planning appropriate management and offers a preoperative road map for surgical intervention.

The radiological differential diagnosis for complex renal cysts seen at CT generally includes cystic malignancy or renal abscess. We have encountered five cases of complex-appearing renal cysts at CT where serial imaging and clinical outcome favored a diagnosis of a collapsed benign simple renal cyst. We present these cases to broaden the differential diagnosis for complex renal cysts seen at CT, highlighting the importance of careful correlation with prior imaging to assist in correct recognition of collapsed simple cysts and potentially allowing for conservative management or surveillance.

### Xantogranulomatous pyeloneprhritis in children [^112nhu9R]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Management

The management of XPN differs between focal and diffuse form.

Focal XPN

Owing to the difficult differential diagnosis of focal XPN with renal tumours (Wilms's tumour), it is often necessary to perform either image-guided biopsy or intraoperative biopsy to avoid unnecessary nephrectomy. In focal XPN, treatment modes are partial nephrectomy, drainage of XPN abscess, or broad-spectrum antibiotic. There have been case reports of successful medical management of focal XPN, but it is unusual because of uncertain prognostic.

Diffuse XPN

Clinical and imaging features are suggestive of diffuse XPN and biopsy is not required before nephrectomy, which remains as the standard of care for diffuse disease. Nevertheless, the indication for nephrectomy is not always straightforward. There is no published evidence suggesting whether differential function can be used to guide the treatment of diffuse XPN. Differential function of near 20% is used as a recommendation for nephrectomy. Up to 80.5% of the affected kidneys are non-functioning.

Surgery of diffuse XPN can be difficult as a result of inflammatory processes extending beyond the kidney (Fig. 17), and although laparoscopic procedure is the first option, sometimes it must be changed to lumbotomy or anterolateral transperitoneal approach. Cutaneous fistula, bowel fistula and delayed wound healing have been reported as complications; consequently, in order to improve the surgical results, it is recommended to drain the perirenal and/or renal abscess prior to surgery.

Fig. 17
Surgical procedure. Presence of multiples adherences and adenopathies around the kidney during the nephrectomy

The management of bilateral XPN is difficult due to the risk of permanent renal dysfunction. Partial nephrectomy is advocated but more recently conservative management with antibiotic therapy has been proposed.

The diffuse type of XPN is associated with a worse prognosis compared to the focal type, although no recurrence of XPN in the healthy contralateral kidney has been reported.

Genitourinary infections are commonly encountered and managed in inpatient, outpatient, and emergency settings. Fournier's gangrene, emphysematous pyelonephritis, and obstructive pyelonephritis represent the most serious urologic infections and have a high risk of mortality if not managed promptly. Due to the rarity of these infections, the evidence for specific treatment strategies is scattered. This review aims to provide comprehensive, evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of these life-threatening urologic infections.

Case Presentation

A 15-year-old girl presented to her local hospital with a 4-month history of fatigue, anorexia, and a 6-kg weight loss. She also reported fever, productive cough, and chest pain on the left lower chest posteriorly for 4 days before admission. Her medical history and systemic review were unremarkable for any respiratory or other organ disease. The patient was taking iron and multivitamin supplements. At her local hospital, she was febrile; chest radiography showed anemia and a left lower lobe infiltrate. She received a transfusion and was started on empiric antibiotics that were continued for 10 days without improvement. Subsequently, CT scan of the chest and upper abdomen showed a lung abscess and left renal mass that led to a referral to our center.

We report on a 76-year-old woman who was diagnosed with a primary renal abscess of the left kidney. After percutaneous drainage, no clinical improvement was observed. Surgical exploration and nephrectomy were performed. The histologic evaluation revealed an unsuspected transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis, which had been misinterpreted as a primary renal abscess. Malignancy must be considered as an underlying cause for the formation of a renal abscess, especially if no other predisposing factors such as diabetes mellitus or urinary stones are present.

### ACR appropriateness criteria on percutaneous catheter drainage of infected fluid collections [^111KFP6Z]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Abnormal fluid collections occur throughout the body and represent a wide range of pathologies, including abscesses, pseudocysts, cysts, lymphoceles, seromas, bilomas, hematomas, urinomas, and infected neoplasms. Appropriate management often depends on clinical presentation, location, type of collection, early response to treatment, and the presence of complicating factors such as fistulas, septations, and increased viscosity. Physicians should carefully review clinical and imaging findings and make evidence-based recommendations for the best treatment, which may include antibiotics, needle aspiration, percutaneous drainage, endoscopic drainage, or surgical drainage. This paper addresses percutaneous catheter drainage and alternative treatment options for the management of fluid collections and is the result of evidence-based consensus by the ACR Appropriateness Criteria Expert Panel on Interventional Radiology.

### Managing complicated urinary tract infections: the urologic view [^116buK5r]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Patients with complicated UTIs are a diverse group. These patients have upper UTIs and structural or functional abnormalities that reduce the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy. They are at increased risk for morbidity such as bacteremia and sepsis, perinephric abscess, renal deterioration, and emphysematous pyelonephritis. Appropriate urinary tract imaging, antimicrobials, medical and surgical therapies, and follow-up are required to avoid potentially devastating outcomes.

### Renal abscess with bacteremia caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli: a case report [^113X2Yty]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Preventing permanent renal scarring is one of the important goals in the management of UTIs, especially in patients with renal abscesses. As delayed antimicrobial treatment is associated with permanent renal scarring among children with febrile UTIs, early diagnosis and appropriate interventions are important for preventing severe complications. Although our patient developed renal scarring, we cannot conclude if this was caused by the infection or from a kidney malformation. It is also worth noting that renal scarring is not always related to long-term complications. Renal scars can cause long-term impaired kidney function, high blood pressure, and complications during pregnancy. Although there are heterogeneous reports about the long-term outcomes of renal scarring, mild to moderate renal scarring may correlate with few long-term complications. Thus, patients with renal abscesses should be managed carefully with consideration of the harmful effect of studies, such as radiation exposure.

The present case had some limitations for considering appropriate management of the renal abscess. We cannot decide if carbapenem-sparing empiric therapy is appropriate for larger renal abscesses because the renal abscess in the present case was small. Thus, this study does not confirm the appropriateness of the continuation of sensitive non-carbapenem antibiotics.

Based on our study, we suggest that, for children with a clinical suspicion of renal abscesses, early imaging studies, especially CT scans, should be performed to prevent complications such as renal scarring. A previous study had described the importance of kidney ultrasound and nephromegaly findings as good indicators for suspecting renal abscess and performing CT scans. In addition, earlier detection of sonographic-marked nephromegaly may lead to the diagnosis of acute focal bacterial nephritis before its progression into renal abscess. Furthermore, the choice of carbapenem-sparing empiric antibiotics for renal abscesses with bacteremia caused by ESBL-producing E. coli was deemed appropriate in this case. Owing to the lack of evidence regarding pediatric renal abscesses caused by ESBL-producing pathogens, empirically broader antibiotics, such as carbapenem, should also be considered until antimicrobial susceptibility is confirmed.

Given the increasing prevalence of ESBL-producing microorganisms, clinicians should be cognizant of the possibility of renal abscesses caused by these microorganisms, even among previously healthy children, when examining fevers of unknown origin. Once a renal abscess is suspected, early diagnosis and management are important to reduce the risk of life-threatening complications and renal scarring. Although we successfully managed the condition with carbapenem-sparing antibiotic treatment in this case initially, it required us to investigate appropriate therapies for pediatric renal abscesses with bacteremia caused by ESBL-positive microorganisms.

### Clinical assessment of children with renal abscesses presenting to the pediatric emergency department [^113vX3D6]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

This is a retrospective study of pediatric patients aged 18 years or younger who presented to the ED with a discharge diagnosis of renal abscess from January 2004 to December 2011. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Changhua Christian Hospital, and the necessity to obtain written consent was waived because of its retrospective nature.

We identified 36 potentially eligible patient visits by searching the Changhua Christian Hospital health records database using the following search term in the primary or secondary discharge diagnosis fields: renal and perinephric abscess (ICD-9 590.2). We excluded patients with (1) perinephric abscess on US or CT, (2) age > 18 years, and (3) no ED presentation prior to hospitalization. In total, 17 patients were included in this series.

The following information was obtained from the medical records of each patient: age, gender, clinical symptoms and signs (such as fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and flank pain), laboratory tests [white blood cell (WBC) counts, hemoglobin (Hb) level, platelet counts, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels], microbiology, imaging findings, treatment modalities, complications, and long-term outcomes. We also evaluated the follow-up data, including imaging findings and any documentation of renal sequelae.

Statistical analysis

Data of categorical variables were analyzed by the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test when appropriate. Continuous variables were analyzed by the Mann–Whitney U Test and the Kruskal–Wallis Test. A P value of < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Distributions of variables were reported as percentages and means ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software (version 15.0, SPSS, Inc. Chicago, IL, USA).

### Renal abscesses in childhood: report of two uncommon cases [^113HGZXx]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Renal abscesses are rare conditions in children, but they must be remembered in differential diagnosis of fever and abdominal pain. The authors report two paediatric cases with unusual presentation. Case 1: a 15-year-old girl was admitted following a period of fever, vomiting and left hypochondrium pain which became more localised to the left lower ribs. Blood tests suggested bacterial infection, but urinalysis and culture were negative. Renal CT scan presented features of bilateral pyelonephritis and left renal abscesses, while ultrasound remained normal until the ninth day of disease. Case 2: a 2-year-old girl, with diagnosis of β-thalassemia minor, had intermittent diffuse abdominal pain with 2 weeks of evolution. Renal ultrasonography and CT scan showed a heterogeneous mass compatible with Willms tumour. Intraoperative diagnosis was compatible with renal abscess with isolation of Proteus mirabilis in the fluid. Both responded well to long-term antibiotics and to surgical drainage (in the second case).

### The clinical and imaging presentation of acute "non complicated" pyelonephritis: a new profile for an ancient disease [^112Xp8kR]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

The present study was performed in a setting in which patients with a clinical suspicion of "non-complicated" APN are routinely hospitalized and undergo an extensive imaging work-up (ultrasound and either MR or CT scans).

In two recent surveys in the United States and Korea, the incidence of APN was reported as 20–35 new cases per year per 10,000 inhabitants. Thus the gross incidence was about 10 times higher than in our study (about 2.5 new cases per year per 10,000 inhabitants). However it is difficult to compare the incidence data in our study with those in the literature, for two main reasons. Firstly, the definition of APN rests on different bases. Imaging data are not included in the diagnostic work-up in the United States and Korea but are required for diagnosis in our setting. Secondly, in the absence of an imaging work-up, the incidence data in the United States and Korea include both non-complicated and complicated pyelonephritis while our study was limited to the former category. In our setting the ratio between "complicated or secondary" and "non-complicated or primary" APN is approximately 3:1 in the Emergency Room (ER), a finding that could at least partly explain the difference.

Unlike other settings, Italian ERs are usually the second referral point after the family physician; both family physicians and ERs are provided by the national health care system and are free of charge. An efficient filter by family physicians could be postulated on the basis of the 42% prevalence of antibiotic treatment in the last 3 days and of a median time of 3 days between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization.

In this context the present study was planned with the aim of describing the clinical presentation of imaging-confirmed APN. From the practical point of view we wanted to identify clinical or biochemical markers of severity of the kidney lesions (multifocal and abscessed lesions) to test the alternatives to our imaging-guided diagnostic and therapeutic approach.

The key feature of our study is the high prevalence of severe lesions: multiple lesions were present in 79.8% of the patients and abscessed lesions in 39.5%.

### Renal abscess in previously healthy girl [^116QTKeD]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

We describe the case of a previously healthy 11-year-old girl with a Staphylococcal aureus renal abscess. The diagnosis was confirmed by renal ultrasonography and abdominal computed tomography. We emphasize the need to obtain an abdominal ultrasound scan and computed tomography scan in patients with abdominal or flank pain, and laboratory evidences of infection to avoid diagnostic and therapeutic delays.

### Spontaneous renal fornix rupture in pregnancy and the post partum period: a systematic review of outcomes and management [^1112xk9Y]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Ureteric outflow obstruction may occur anywhere between the kidney and vesico-ureteric junction, resulting in increased intraluminal or renal pelvis pressure. The renal fornix is the most common site for spontaneous perforation or rupture, followed by the upper ureter. Spontaneous renal fornix rupture (SRFR) is often encountered in urological practice due to the presence of ureteral calculi, extrinsic compression from malignancy or mass, and instrumentation, but is otherwise uncommon in their absence. The consequences of urine extravasation into the surrounding perinephric tissue include formation of a urinoma, abscess, urosepsis and renal impairment.

Increased intraluminal pressure is commonly observed with physiologic hydronephrosis of pregnancy due to both mechanical and hormonal stimuli. Whilst flank pain and pyelonephritis secondary to over distension are common manifestations of this physiologic phenomenon, rupture of the renal collecting system may rarely occur, especially with excessive intraluminal pressures.

Due to the paucity of published data for this condition, clinical confidence is limited in identifying at-risk patients, further complicated by vague, non-specific findings on clinical assessment and laboratory testing along with limitations in use of appropriate diagnostic imaging. Pregnancy adds further complexity, with possible fetal and uterine causes of pain. Pre-term labour, uterine irritability, and placental abruption have all been confused for calyceal rupture, resulting in potentially detrimental interventions for both the mother and fetus. Urgent urological assessment is required when SRFR or significant obstruction is suspected, although optimal diagnostic pathways and management are currently unknown.

Whilst urologic long-term prognosis is favourable in cases of physiological obstruction, the effects of SRFR on pregnancy outcomes are not well known. Although rare, the potential for harm in these cases is amplified for both mother and fetus, making early diagnosis and appropriate management crucial. Consequently, the aim of this study was to identify risk factors and common clinical presentations, diagnostic pathways, management options and patient outcomes for SRFR in pregnancy.

### A rare and unusual presentation of urological infection on a patient on steroids [^116LZEen]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

We report the rare case of adult lobar nephronia in a 49-year-old female, on long-term steroids with no prior urological or transplant history. More frequently reported in paediatric literature, adult lobar nephronia (focal pyelonephritis) is an unusual radiological finding sometimes preceding the development of renal abscess. We advocate that treatment should be a prolonged course of antibiotics and close follow-up.

### The clinical and imaging presentation of acute "non complicated" pyelonephritis: a new profile for an ancient disease [^115J4v2T]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

It is difficult to explain the higher prevalence of positive cultures in non-abscessed lesions. Our hypothesis is that this may be due to the fact that the bacteria are "sequestered" in abscessed lesions. However further analysis on larger cohorts is needed to confirm this apparent paradox.

The difficulty in diagnosing APN is further underlined by the fact that over 15% of the patients displayed renal scars at the first imaging test, presumably as a result of previous APN episodes; APN had been previously diagnosed in only a minority of them (3/18).

In this context and within these limits, the major finding of our study is the lack of correlation between the severity of the renal lesions and the clinical and biochemical data at presentation (table 1, table 2, table 3 table 4). In fact oligosymptomatic presentation may coexist with abscessed or multifocal lesions and none of the tested parameters discriminated the severity of parenchymal involvement. This is of particular relevance for abscessed lesions which require long-term antibiotic therapy and are at high risk for the development of kidney scars.

Like all clinical studies, ours has strengths and weaknesses. The main strengths are the novelty and the systematic referral pattern with a diagnostic use of second-line imaging techniques. To our knowledge, this is the largest series of adults published in the last 10 years, combining a clinical and imaging work-up of all cases of suspected APN referred to the ER of a relatively large hospital in a short time span.

The limitations are partly shared by single-center observational studies. In the absence of a control group and of epidemiological data on the world-wide incidence of "non-complicated" APN, our data are hardly comparable with the literature. The suggestion that we may be dealing with negative selection of the cases, possibly due to the extensive filter of family physicians, needs further confirmation on a larger scale and in different settings. A potential confounder is the high prevalence of negative urinary cultures, possibly reflecting the policy of empirical antibiotic treatment before hospital referral and the lack of lower urinary symptoms but also perhaps related to late testing. This issue needs further analysis, also in view of the lack of recent epidemiological data on the prevalence of negative urinary cultures in APN.

These limitations may become suggestions for further studies on the prevalence and type of parenchymal involvement and on the clinical presentation in settings with different incidence and referral patterns.

### Is acute lobar nephronia the midpoint in the spectrum of upper urinary tract infections between acute pyelonephritis and renal abscess? [^117P6J84]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine acute lobar nephronia (ALN) in the spectrum of upper urinary tract infections between acute pyelonephritis (APN) and renal abscess.

Study Design

Medical records of 115 patients diagnosed with APN, ALN, or renal abscess with computed tomography (CT) were reviewed retrospectively. CT lesions and patterns of ALN were checked, and the volume of CT lesions was estimated in every patient. Then the correlation between clinical presentation and CT lesions was examined.

Results

The study included 21 patients with APN, 85 with ALN (63 simple ALN, 22 complicated ALN), and 9 with renal abscesses. The volume fraction of CT lesions correlated well with duration of fever before and after treatment in patients with APN or simple ALN, and only the correlation between fever duration after treatment and CT lesions was significant in patients with complicated ALN or renal abscess.

Conclusions

We suggest that simple ALN be regarded clinically as the progression of APN. By contrast, complicated ALN is a distinct, more severe disease entity, and it may relate to or progress to renal abscess. ALN is probably not the midpoint in the traditional dynamic spectrum of upper urinary tract infections between APN and renal abscess.

### The clinical and imaging presentation of acute "non complicated" pyelonephritis: a new profile for an ancient disease [^11475eQo]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

In spite of the severity of the lesions we found a high prevalence of incomplete clinical presentations, lacking the full-blown syndrome classically described as high fever, signs or history of recent lower UTI, costovertebral flank pain or tenderness and positive urinary cultures (table 2). The three symptoms were present at hospitalization in about one third of cases and lower urinary tract symptoms were present in about half of the patients (47%). These clinical hallmarks are usually included in the enrollment criteria for clinical trials for APN, together with positive urinary cultures and no recent antibiotic therapy. According to these criteria, only about 10% of our patients would have been eligible for a recent clinical trial on APN (table 2).

The frequent negativity of the urinary cultures deserves further comment. About half of the cases were treated with antibiotics but the difference between cases with positive and negative cultures was only marginally significant (p = 0.051). The relatively long interval between onset of symptoms and hospitalization and the frequent lack of lower urinary tract symptoms suggest alternative and adjunctive explanations.

Interestingly, a similar prevalence was found in a previous study, performed in a different setting (the largest University Hospital of the Region) in 2004–2006, in which the prevalence of positive urinary cultures was even lower (20.7%), albeit with a higher recall of antibiotic therapy (95%). This observation may indicate a "referral" bias (patients are usually referred to the emergency room after a few days of empirical therapy), more than a laboratory bias.

To further assess this point, we planned an analysis in the Emergency room to test the hypothesis that, in some cases, cultures may have been performed after the first dose of intravenous antibiotics (as may occur overnight or during the weekend, when urine sampling may be erroneously postponed in a crowded ER). The analysis is still ongoing; however even if the sampling may have been biased in some cases, this finding draws attention to the fact that urinary cultures can become negative after a single antibiotic dose, even in the presence of renal abscesses or multiple lesions.

### Nephron-sparing management of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis presenting as spontaneous renal hemorrhage: a case report and literature review [^116v4YDH]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Management

The traditional approach to XGP has been radical nephrectomy, though a nephron-sparing approach has been reported in the management of focal cases of XGP. Conservative management of XGP has been achieved with parenteral antibiotic therapy or a combination of oral and parenteral therapy which may be supplemented with drainage of the urinary tract and/or abscesses. Conservative management has even proven successful in renal allograft patients with XGP. However, conservative management is inappropriate for patients with stage III or diffuse XGP, as may be seen in many patients at the time of diagnosis. Nephron-sparing management has been successfully attempted in cases of multifocal XGP, a distinct entity from diffuse XGP. As XGP is often diagnosed first at pathological specimen, the decision for treatment is usually based on a presumptive diagnosis in which radical nephrectomy may be more appropriate.

Management of SRH is first pursued through conservative or minimally invasive approaches. As the underlying cause of SRH may be focally identified by renal arteriography, embolization is an important therapeutic treatment that may preclude the need for surgery. In cases of iatrogenic renal hemorrhage, the combined use of urokinase injections and external drainage has been reported as an effective strategy in patients with large hematomas who nonetheless had stable vital signs. This approach could also prove useful in SRH though we can find no explicit report of this in the literature. In the case of the unstable patient, surgical exploration is necessary if angioembolization is not available or is unsuccessful. Surgical exploration can be especially important if the source of the bleeding is found to be a renal neoplasm. Even in cases where bleeding can be managed conservatively, surgical evacuation of the clot may be required in instances of hypertension secondary to Page kidney.

All four previous reports of XGP presenting with SRH were managed by radical nephrectomy. We report the first case of nephron-sparing surgery for XGP presenting with SRH. Our management decision was facilitated by a pre-operative differential heavily weighted towards AML as the etiology of SRH. Prior to this procedure our approach to cases involving a large XGP lesion would have been unlikely to include a nephron-sparing approach, though we are happy to report that such an approach is certainly technically feasible.

### The SNMMI and EANM practice guideline for renal scintigraphy in adults [^11386TEv]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2018). Medium credibility.

Imaging of renal masses and infection-related defects indicates that space occupying lesions can be detected by functional imaging as parenchymal defects; however, ultrasound, CT and MR imaging are best suited for evaluation of renal masses and should be recommended when regional defects in the parenchyma are detected. Functional imaging may play a role before surgical interventions to predict expected residual renal function after partial or complete unilateral nephrectomy. Infectious/inflammatory diseases may result in reduced parenchymal function, and renal cortical defects may be seen in focal pyelonephritis, renal abscess, and with post pyelonephritic scarring.

### Perinephric abscesses in the neurologically impaired [^114qR5Kq]. Spinal Cord (2001). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective chart review.

Objectives

To document the occurrence and management of large perinephric abscesses in neurologically impaired patients at high risk for this infectious complication.

Setting

US Veterans Affairs hospital.

Methods

The records, radiographs, operative findings and outcomes of all patients who presented with perinephric abscesses evident on physical exam within the last 5 years were reviewed.

Results

Four patients presented with large perinephric abscesses evident on physical examination. All had severe neurologic impairment with high sensory levels; three had spinal cord injuries, one had advanced multiple sclerosis. All had neurogenic bladders and recurrent urinary tract infections. The diagnosis was made through a combination of history, physical examination and computed tomography (CT) examination. All were found to have upper tract obstruction. All were managed with immediate abscess drainage and three had elective nephrectomy once the infection had resolved. No patients died of their perinephric abscess.

Conclusions

These four cases illustrate that although advances in antibiotics, imaging and percutaneous management have improved the speed of diagnosis and reduced the mortality in patients with perinephric abscesses, the neurologically impaired population continues to remain at significant risk for the development and the delayed diagnosis of these morbid renal infections.

### Retroperitoneal abscess with subcutaneous extension: case report of a rare complication of percutaneous renal biopsy [^114Hnmx3]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Infective complications following percutaneous renal biopsy are rare, even among immunocompromised. However it is important to be vigilant about such complications, to detect them early and prevent morbidity and mortality. We report a case of retroperitoneal abscess with extension to subcutaneous plane after a renal biopsy.

Case Presentation

A 42-year-old female with long standing cutaneous lupus underwent renal biopsy for evaluation of nephrotic range proteinuria. She was on high dose prednisolone complicated with steroid induced hyperglycaemia. Eight weeks after the biopsy she presented with left flank pain, malaise and fever. There was a tender subcutaneous induration over the biopsy site. Contrast CT abdomen showed a retroperitoneal abscess with subcutaneous extension along the path of the biopsy needle. This was successfully treated with surgical drainage and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Conclusions

Infections and abscess formation are rare but serious complications of renal biopsy. Immunocompromised state is a potential risk factor. Possible mechanisms and measures for prevention and early detection of this rare complication are discussed.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^112CWgxU]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

For children with severe clinical presentation with sepsis features and no previous risk factors for resistance, E. coli is the most common pathogen, followed by Klebsiella, Enterococcus, Proteus and Pseudomonas spp. Treatment with broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics such as third-generation cephalosporins is recommended in moderately unwell children. If a child is severely unwell with sepsis potentially of urinary origin, local sepsis guidelines should be followed, considering the individual child's risk and/or history of resistance and whether it is hospital-acquired. There is occasionally a case for using empirical carbapenems in children with cUTI, for example, in a child with sepsis and a history of highly resistant organisms. This should be in consultation with an infectious diseases specialist to tailor empirical treatment and switch, when possible, with susceptibility.

For nephronia/renal abscess, E. coli is the most common pathogen, but urine culture is frequently negative. Since urine culture may not identify the organism or its susceptibility, if progress is poor, penicillin/ampicillin may be added to cover Enterococcus spp. Early consultation with infectious diseases and urology is also recommended in case abscess drainage is needed. In specific clinical circumstances, S. aureus (including MRSA), C. albicans and Mycobacterium tuberculosis may cause renal abscess.

Children with nonurologic underlying conditions have different risks of unusual organisms and resistance depending on hospitalization and antibiotic exposure. In children postrenal transplant, especially with urological abnormalities, there is a greater likelihood of Enterococcus spp. S. aureus or P. aeruginosa. In immunocompromised patients, in addition to Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa, less virulent organisms such as CoNS, Haemophilus influenzae and group B streptococcus may cause cUTI. Fungal infections and viruses, for example, adenovirus, can also infect the urinary tract. Choice of antibiotic in chronic renal impairment, immunocompromise or other chronic disease (eg, diabetes mellitus), therefore, depends on likely pathogens and risk of antibiotic resistance based on past antibiotic use and hospitalization. Mild acute or chronic renal impairment does not preclude use of aminoglycosides, which are generally well tolerated in children with renal dosing adjustment. Blood levels should be monitored closely. In moderate/severe renal failure, aminoglycosides should be used only when there is no alternative, as there is a higher risk of accumulation and an unknown risk to hearing.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^111gzdvH]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Further Imaging

In post-acute infection, urinary tract USS may help define urological abnormalities (GRADE C).
USS/CT/MRI can be useful to follow a renal abscess (GRADES C and D).
Micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG) and DMSA are now saved for specific instances where less invasive investigations do not give enough prognostic information, usually for children with severe urological abnormalities (GRADE D).

Ultrasound Scan

After the first episode of upper UTI, children under the age of 3 years should have a renal tract USS after the acute phase to detect potential structural abnormalities or parenchymal lesions. Obtaining an USS and MCUG after the first UTI in young children is, however, not strongly supported by high-grade evidence. A prospective study involving 309 children showed that the identified abnormalities, which were found in 12 percent (37/309) of the children, and obtained within 72 hours after diagnosis, did not modify management. Some guidelines recommend USS in case of atypical or recurrent UTI. Children who are older than 2–24 months who experience recurrent febrile UTIs should also be evaluated, though USS has a poor sensitivity for detecting mild-moderate VUR. Due to its rarity, there is a gap of evidence regarding recommendations of follow-up in children with suspected nephronia or abscess, but they may benefit from further imaging with MRI or CT.

Micturating Cystourethrography

Many guidelines recommend performing a MCUG after abnormal USS findings, non- E. coli causative pathogens or recurrent UTI. Combinations of unusual pathogens and pathological USS increase the probability of high-grade VUR to over 50%.

DMSA Scan

Although the specificity for detecting high-grade VUR after DMSA renal scan is low, they can detect renal scars, differences in relative renal function between the kidneys and deterioration of renal function or new scars over time.DMSA and its timing remain controversial for the evaluation of a child after cUTI, but children with high-grade VUR or recurrent UTI should undergo a DMSA scan to keep track of renal damage.DMSA should be performed 3–6 months after the acute episode so that transient inflammatory changes have resolved. In 1 study, the incidence of renal scarring was associated with the severity of renal parenchymal infection, with 22% of children with pyelonephritis having scars, 44% with nephronia and 72% with abscess.

### Clinical assessment of children with renal abscesses presenting to the pediatric emergency department [^113PFvcX]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

According to previous studies, renal abscess may result from hematogenous spread or ascending infections due to reflux or stasis of infected urine, and the most common pathogens isolated in children are E. coli and S. aureus. In adults, the most frequent microorganisms yielded on culture are E. coli and K. pneumoniae. In addition, anaerobic bacteria have also been reported to play an important role in pediatric renal abscesses. In our series, E. coli was not only the leading cultured organism of renal abscesses but also the most common pathogen isolated from urine. However, all blood cultures were negative in the current study. These results may indicate that ascending infections from the urinary tract may play a more important role than hematogenous spread in the development of renal abscesses in children.

Delays in diagnosis of renal abscesses may result in increased morbidity and potential mortality. However, the diagnosis is not easy to make without US or CT studies. US is particularly useful in the diagnosis of pediatric renal abscess. However, CT has greater sensitivity and the best diagnostic accuracy for these lesions. In addition, many experts still suggest that even when renal abscesses are identified by US, CT with contrast enhancement should be performed to distinguish between renal and perirenal abscesses. In our study, all patients had undergone US and CT, and, in 12 (70.1%) children, renal abscesses were initially diagnosed by US. We suggest that US can be used as a screen and follow-up tool, and CT can be used to confirm the diagnosis of renal abscesses in children as the initial US does not always provide a definitive diagnosis. In our series, 12 of 17 patients (70.6%) had renal abscesses of the right kidney. However, we did not find the same results in previous larger studies in children or in adults. Because of the relatively small sample size, we cannot make the conclusion about the lateralization of renal abscess in our study.

### Spontaneous ureteric rupture, a reality or a faux pas? [^1167tcsn]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Ureteric rupture is in itself an infrequently encountered entity and a spontaneous rupture is even rarer.

Rupture of the ureter is usually expected to occur following trauma, which may be blunt, penetrating or even iatrogenic. Spontaneous or non-traumatic rupture, if at all, is considered to be secondary to some downstream obstruction by a calculus, papilla, stricture or via extrinsic compression.

The symptom at presentation, mainly sudden, severe lower abdominal pain is usually not in sync with the clinical signs and may mimic an episode of acute appendicitis or diverticulitis.

Thus, the diagnosis frequently gets delayed leading to long term patient morbidity. Initially, an excretory urography was considered as the imaging modality of choice, however, in the current era, a contrast enhanced CT scan (CECT) forms the mainstay for imaging with intraoperative retrograde urography (RGU) being the gold standard.

Koga et al. (11 cases) and Stravodimos et al. (5 cases) remain the largest series till date, having reported spontaneous peripelvic collections, of which only 4 of the cases in the work by Stravodimos et al. were not found to have any cause, or could be said as "spontaneous" ruptures.

On account of these few and interspersed reports and lack of specific guidelines, management strategies vary among surgeons, from endoscopic stenting to even open surgical repair. There have been reports in literature documenting even percutaneous drainage, as well as conservative management with just antibiotics till clinical deterioration, but all of them suggest that a prompt intervention definitely reduces long term morbidity.

Prognosis remains excellent, once diagnosed early, and managed promptly, with immediate relief. On the contrary, a delay in instituting treatment may lead to serious consequences such as a perinephric or retroperitoneal collection, abscess formation and subsequently urosepsis.

Thus, our case illustrates that timely diagnosis and prompt management in the acute setting via simple DJ stenting is sufficient to allow complete healing and prevent long term complications.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^117Smpys]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) antibiotic duration — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course of antimicrobials, using either 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), rather than a longer course (10–14 days). An effective antimicrobial agent achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy. Most studies supporting this recommendation excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, abscesses in the urinary tract, chronic kidney disease, bacterial prostatitis, complete urinary obstruction, or undergoing urologic surgical procedures. Some patients in these subpopulations may be at higher risk for complications or treatment failure and may need an individualized duration of therapy. Men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement.

### Prostatic abscess: a rare complication of staghorn calculi [^117BVCL8]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A staghorn calculus is a calculus accommodating the majority of a renal calyx extending into the renal pelvis. A conservative approach to its treatment may lead to high morbidity and mortality rates. Such morbidity usually manifests with renal failure, obstructed upper urinary tractand/or life-threatening sepsis. Prostatic abscesses have never been associated with staghorn calculi in the literature. We report a case of a 70-year-old man who presented with sepsis, which was found to originate from a complex prostatic abscess. The patient had no history of urinary tract infections or risk factors. The authors believe that the incidentally identified staghorn calculi promoted the growth of Proteus mirabilis which led to the development of the prostatic abscess. The patient underwent a transurethral resection and drainage of the abscess following a failed course of antibiotic therapy. This case also highlights the paucity of guidelines available in treating prostatic abscesses.

### Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus renal abscess: a rare cause of fever of unknown origin [^115Dodfo]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Renal abscess is uncommon in pediatrics and is rarely a cause of fever of unknown origin. We recently cared for a patient who presented with a 3-week history of fever. An indium scan ultimately led to the diagnosis of a renal abscess. Aspiration yielded Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. This unusual case prompted a review of the clinical and microbiologic features of renal abscess in pediatric patients at our hospital over the past 10 years. Seven additional patients with a discharge diagnosis of renal abscess were identified. Only 2 of the patients had identifiable risk factors (diabetes mellitus and polycystic kidneys). Staphylococcus aureus or Enterobacteriaceae were responsible for most infections, consistent with hematogenous and urinary tract sources, respectively. No other cases of anaerobic abscess were identified. This case highlights the importance of considering a renal abscess in the differential diagnosis of fever of unknown origin and of processing specimens for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms.

### Infection presenting as pyelonephritis and perinephric abscess in an immunocompromised patient [^114L96Cb]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

We report a case of an immunosuppressed 67-year-old woman who presented with fever of unknown origin. Further investigation revealed multiple left renal and perinephric abscesses. These were managed with percutaneous drainage and broad-spectrum antibiotics; however, no clinical improvement resulted. No organism was identifiable on standard microscopy and culture of all drain, blood and urine samples taken. Left nephrectomy with right urinary diversion was performed for sepsis management and to protect the patient's right kidney. Eventually, Ureaplasma species' RNA was detected in the patient's drain fluid using PCR and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. The patient was treated successfully with targeted antibiotic therapy and underwent extensive rehabilitation following this. Histopathology of the nephrectomy specimen suggested xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis.

### Emphysematous pyelonephritis caused by raoultella ornithinolytica: a case report [^116gx9gH]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

However, owing to the rarity and variability of clinical symptoms, diagnosing EPN has proven to be a challenge. Its clinical manifestations are nonspecific compared with those of typical pyelonephritis, mainly fever, flank pain, pyuria, gross haematuria, acute kidney injury, and even septic shock. Costovertebral angle tenderness is considered the most common physical finding. Therefore, how can we diagnose EPN in a timely manner? CT is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of EPN, and can be used to classify the disease, assess the prognosis and help clinicians choose different treatment options. There are currently two EPN classifications according to CT findings. Wan et al. identified two types of EPN: Type I EPN is characterized by parenchymal destruction with either an absence of fluid collection or the presence of gas. Type II EPN is characterized as either renal or perirenal fluid collections with bubbly or loculated gas or gas in the collecting system. Huang et al. proposed in 2000 that EPN can be divided into 4 classes on the basis of CT. Class 1: gas is limited to the collecting system; Class 2: gas exists in the renal parenchyma and does not diffuse to the renal periphery; Class 3 A: gas or an abscess invades the perirenal space; Class 3B: gas or abscess invades the pararenal space; Class 4: presence of bilateral lesions or a solitary kidney. The latter classification is more widely used clinically. Our patient was judged to have Type 2 EPN/Class 3B EPN.

The treatment of EPN includes conservative medical therapy, with or without surgical drainage or surgical intervention. In the past, early nephrectomy or surgical drainage was the standard treatment, but it was later proven to be associated with high mortality. In 1997, Chen et al. proposed that antibiotic therapy combined with CT-guided percutaneous drainage for the treatment of EPN was a suitable alternative to surgical intervention. The mortality rate has decreased significantly because of advanced antibiotics, percutaneous or endoluminal drainage, and CT scan results. However, if intractable shock, persistent bacteraemia or ineffective minimally invasive drainage occurs, open drainage or nephrectomy should be considered. For this patient, we conducted several multidisciplinary consultations to formulate and then modify the best treatment plan, which included sensitive antibiotics, percutaneous drainage, correction of electrolyte and acid‒base disorders, strict blood glucose control, and respiratory support.

IMAGING OF THE PATIENT SUSPECTED OF APPENDICITIS

Ultrasound Versus Computed Tomography Scan

Ultrasound (US) has been used to evaluate patients suspected of acute appendicitis and has an 85% to 90% positive predictive value with an appendiceal diameter greater than 9 to 10 mm. It does not use radiation energy, is repeatable, and is safe for pregnant women. It can also demonstrate other pelvic pathology in women. Ultrasound is frequently used in pediatric patients and is favored as an initial study in small children. The utility of US is less well documented in the adult population.

Computed tomography scan with contrast has been the standard for imaging the abdomen when searching for acute pathology and is used with increasing frequency in the general diagnosis of abdominal pain, especially by nonsurgeons. It provides a high degree of sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis but has the potential to identify radiographic abnormalities of the appendix that are not clinically relevant. Computed tomography imaging should always be interpreted in the context of clinical history and physical examination. Computed tomography can also demonstrate an appendiceal fecalith, periappendiceal fluid collection, or an abscess, findings that may be of importance in clinical decision-making. The sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values of computed tomography (CT) scans based on pathology results were 87.9%, 81.8%, 94.7%, and 79.3%, respectively, in patients with low clinical suspicion.

In many circumstances, the position of the appendix within the abdomen and its relation to the cecum will be demonstrated.

Women

Childbearing Age

Pelvic pathology must be ruled out when suspecting acute appendicitis in women of childbearing age. A urine analysis may demonstrate urinary tract infection or potential kidney stones. An US or CT scan may show an adnexal tubo-ovarian abscess or ectopic pregnancy.

Pregnant Women

Ultrasound is the primary imaging modality to assess abdominal pain and make the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in pregnant patients, although magnetic resonance imaging is being used with increasing frequency if US findings are not diagnostic. A CT scan should be considered if a patient is acutely ill, and the diagnosis is still in question.– Alternatively, if CT scan does not clearly demonstrate acute appendicitis in the pregnant patient, magnetic resonance imaging has been shown to have a high sensitivity and negative predictive value of 100% in some studies.

### Imaging of renal pseudotumors in children: a comprehensive review [^112aKG7p]. Pediatric Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Renal abscess is a complication of focal pyelonephritis and may be parenchymal or perinephric. In the early stages, abscesses appear as ill-defined hypovascular areas. A mature abscess presents as a well-defined complex cystic lesion with a thick, irregular wall. On US, a typical abscess appears as a heterogeneous mass with posterior acoustic enhancement and absent internal flow on color Doppler. These features can also be seen in necrotic malignant tumors. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are crucial in differential diagnosis. If clinical findings are inconsistent with an abscess, MRI may be useful for confirming the diagnosis. Abscesses appear hypointense on T1- and hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI. They may exhibit perilesional edema and fluid–fluid levels. Pseudocapsules may enhance in the venous phase. Restricted diffusion is typically observed at the center of the abscess, with ADC values lower than focal nephritis or sterile fluid collections. On CT, they appear as round or geographic hypodense lesions with enhancing thick wall (Fig. 6). The wall of Wilms' tumor is typically more irregular and the presence of fat stranding may be particularly helpful in distinguishing between an abscess and a Wilms' tumor.

### Complications of renal interventions: a pictorial review of CT findings [^114B34P3]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The incidence of complications from renal interventions is expected to increase with the increasing incidence of renal pathologies. The radiologist's role in detecting potential complications on imaging from renal interventions is, as such, more important than ever, especially with the general shift to less invasive approaches. Prompt recognition of the CT findings is vital, particularly as some of the potential complications can be life-threatening. Therefore, an understanding of early and delayed complications from a variety of renal interventions will allow the radiologist to direct prompt and appropriate management.

The coexistence of empyema, nephropleural fistula and perinephric abscess is rare and presents diagnostic challenges, especially when patients exhibit atypical or mild symptoms. This case report details a female in her early 90s who presented with 3weeks of chest pain and was found to have a left-sided pleural effusion. Further imaging revealed additional findings of a left-sided nephropleural fistula and left perinephric collection. The patient underwent thoracentesis and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, with cultures growing Streptococcus Anginosus Subsequently, she underwent a left nephrectomy, with pathology findings consistent with chronic pyelonephritis and a fistulous tract. The patient was discharged on intravenous antibiotics. Follow-up imaging showed improvement. The patient completed the antibiotic course and reported symptom resolution 2weeks after discharge.

### Acute pyelonephritis in adults [^11692zt5]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute pyelonephritis:

- **Definition**: Acute pyelonephritis is a disease resulting from acute infection of the renal pelvis and kidney.
- **Pathophysiology**: Acute pyelonephritis is caused by uropathogenic bacteria, including E. coli (80%), K. pneumoniae (6.2%), Enterococcus (5.3%), Streptococcus agalactiae (2.8%), P. mirabilis (2%), S. saprophyticus (1.4%), K. oxytoca (0.9%) and P. aeruginosa (0.8%).
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the estimated incidence of acute pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization is 117 cases per 100,000 person-years among females, and 24 cases per 100,000 person-years among males.
- **Disease course**: In patients with acute pyelonephritis, bacterial colonization and toxin production in the renal parenchyma leads to an inflammatory response and immune cell recruitment. Host-bacteria interaction leads to local tissue alterations (coagulation, epithelial breakdown, vascular leakage, and tissue destruction). Progression of infection may be associated with renal abscess, bacteremia, septic shock, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In patients with associated sepsis, mortality approaches 10–20%.

### Acute urinary tract disorders [^1124EhWh]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Acute urinary tract disorders often manifest as flank pain and are a common complaint of patients who present to the emergency department. The pain is often a vague, poorly localized sensation that may have a variety of causes. Laboratory and clinical findings, such as hematuria, are neither sensitive nor specific for determining the cause of the flank pain. Accordingly, imaging is an important tool in determining a diagnosis and management plan. Patients with acute urinary tract disorders who present with pain include those with calculi as well as renal infection, vascular disorders, and hemorrhage.

Atypical, nontuberculous, mycobacteria (NTM) are emerging as significant pathogens in nosocomial infections. Historically, such outbreaks have been limited to developing countries, and clinicians in the United States have not been exposed to the nuances of diagnosing and treating such infections. With an increasing prevalence worldwide, all clinicians should be able to recognize and treat NTM infections. We report a case of a patient who developed a retroperitoneal cold abscess caused by NTM after percutaneous stone surgery in India. Through a comprehensive review of published reports, we offer strategies for the treatment and prevention of such outbreaks.

### Renal abscess with bacteremia caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli: a case report [^11196Q3L]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment for renal abscesses involves a combination of appropriate antibiotics and percutaneous or open surgical drainage. Only intravenous antibiotics were used in this case, because the abscess was too small to drain. In adult populations, it is recommended that renal abscesses less than 3 cm are treated without drainage, and this recommendation is also frequently applied to pediatric patients. Case studies in children have reported that renal abscesses less than 3 cm can be successfully treated without drainage.

Although the preferred antibiotic for ESBL-positive microorganisms is carbapenem, the selection of other antibiotics is under discussion due to antimicrobial resistance. Carbapenem treatment needs to be given intravenously and requires a longer duration of hospital stay. Two previous retrospective studies showed that the initial empiric antibiotic therapy for pediatric UTIs caused by ESBL did not worsen the outcome, and the authors concluded that switching to appropriate antibiotics after detection of ESBL-producing microorganisms was sufficient. The efficacy of non-carbapenem antibiotics such as amikacin, fosfomycin, cefmetazole, and flomoxef for UTIs with ESBL-producing bacteria has been reported. However, the efficacy of antibiotics other than carbapenem for blood culture-positive UTIs caused by ESBL-producing pathogens among children is unknown. Because the use of piperacillin-tazobactam as a "carbapenem-sparing" option was inferior to meropenem with bacteremia of an ESBL-producing pathogen in an adult population, selection of carbapenem-sparing antibiotics for similar cases should be carefully considered. Thus, there is an opinion that carbapenem be recommended from the beginning of treatment for renal abscesses in children to avoid worsening of the outcomes. Regardless of a longer hospital stay, we continued meropenem for 3 weeks in the present case, which was blood culture positive with a renal abscess caused by ESBL-producing E. coli. We did not suspect an ESBL-producing pathogen infection at first and therefore treated the patient with non-carbapenem antibiotics before switching to carbapenem after confirming the results of the culture. Although we successfully treated the patient, it required us to investigate appropriate empiric and definitive therapies for a pediatric renal abscess with bacteremia caused by ESBL-positive microorganisms.

### Percutaneous drainage of abdominal abcess [^112joAfK]. European Journal of Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

The mortality in undrained abdominal abscesses is high with a mortality rate ranging between 45 and 100%. The outcome in abdominal abscesses, however, has improved due to advances in image guided percutaneous interventional techniques. The main indications for the catheter drainage include treatment or palliation of sepsis associated with an infected fluid collection, and alleviation of the symptoms that may be caused by fluid collections by virtue of their size, like pancreatic pseudocele or lymphocele. The single liver abscesses may be drained with ultrasound guidance only, whereas the multiple abscesses usually require computed tomography (CT) guidance and placement of multiple catheters. The pancreatic abscesses are generally drained routinely and urgently. Non-infected pancreatic pseudocysts may be simply observed unless they are symptomatic or cause problems such as pain or obstruction of the biliary or the gastrointestinal tract. Percutaneous routes that have been described to drain pelvic abscesses include transrectal or transvaginal approach with sonographic guidance, a transgluteal, paracoccygeal-infragluteal, or perineal approach through the greater sciatic foramen with CT guidance. Both the renal and the perirenal abscesses are amenable to percutaneous drainage. Percutaneous drainage provides an effective and safe alternative to more invasive surgical drainage in most patients with psoas abscesses as well.

### Radiological diagnosis of perinephric pathology: pictorial essay 2015 [^113y5AJK]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Perinephric abscess

Abscess within the perinephric space can present a diagnostic challenge. Depending on chronicity, aetiology and complications, it may mimic a tumour radiologically if chronic or may mandate evacuation and immediate treatment if acute. Predisposing factors for perinephric abscess include diabetes, pyelonephritis, urinary tract calculi and immunosuppression. Acute perinephric abscess is accompanied by fever, flank pain and leukocytosis. CT and MRI findings are non-specific and include thickening of the adjacent fascia, obliteration of perinephric fat planes and fat stranding. Contrast-enhanced CT imaging may demonstrate rim enhancement with central hypo-attenuation and thickened septa. The presence of thickened perinephric fascia and increased adjacent fat signalling are further suggestive of an infectious process rather than a malignant cystic neoplasm (Fig. 11).

Fig. 11
Portal venous CT shows a right renal abscess that has burst into the perinephric space (arrow), best appreciated as the soft tissue density interposed between the kidney and adjacent liver

In cases of emphysematous infection, CT can visualise gas extending from the kidney into the perinephric space. Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, a rare progressively destructive process with lipid-rich macrophages replacing degenerative renal tissue, can also present with abscesses within the perinephric space as the inflammatory process spreads. Imaging findings include unilateral enlargement of the kidney, heterogeneous parenchymal enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT imaging, hydronephrosis and obstructive calculi.

Lastly, Sharma et al. reported a case of a 60 year old male who presented with left sided flank pain, intermittent fever, and weakness for 15 days. A known diabetic, the patient was anemic (Hgb 9.0) with an elevated white blood cell count (13,500 per mm³). Urine culture was positive for Klebsiella and the patient was subsequently started on IV antibiotics. MRI abdomen demonstrated a hydronephrotic left kidney with an ill-defined mass of the lower pole suggestive of perinephric hematoma. Further, the patient was suspected to have a hemorrhagic angiomyolipoma and was thus surgically explored. During exploration, the kidney was noted to be hydronephrotic with thinned out parenchyma and palpable thickening of the lower pole which warranted nephrectomy. Unlike the previous cases, lipid-laden macrophage aggregates were not seen though further histopathological examination of the mass revealed chronic granulomatous pyelonephritis with dilated vascular channels and no evidence of neoplasia.

He presented with an acute left groin swelling that was diagnosed to be a rare occurrence of spermatic cord abscess. Two months prior to this, he had had an episode of bacterial epididymo-orchitis that was treated with oral antibiotics. An urgent CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed to rule out incarcerated inguinal hernia. The spermatic cord abscess was initially managed with appropriate intravenous antibiotics and ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage. When the pus eventually accumulated in the scrotum, an open incision and drainage of the scrotum was also performed. He achieved complete resolution after 2 months.

Benign mimics

Pyelonephritis and renal abscesses

Focal pyelonephritis and abscesses may mimic renal masses and renal lymphoma. Clinical information is essential in making the diagnosis, including symptoms of dysuria, hematuria, flank pain, and a urinalysis positive for infection. On CT, a striated nephrogram or areas of patchy hypoenhancement can be seen in pyelonephritis, with a predilection for the upper pole. On ultrasound, renal abscesses appear as complex collections, with posterior through transmission, and lack internal vascularity. On contrast-enhanced imaging, abscesses may demonstrate rim enhancement. Follow-up imaging often demonstrates focal parenchymal scarring as a result of prior inflammation/infection (Fig. 10).

Fig. 10
Pyelonephritis and renal abscesses. Coronal (a) and axial (b) contrast CT images in 2014 of the abdomen demonstrate a delayed right nephrogram with cortical heterogeneity.

IGG4 related renal disease

IGG4-related disease is characterized by fibroinflammatory lesions rich in IGG4 positive plasma cells, and often but not always elevated serum IGG4 concentrations. Five patterns of disease have been described in renal involvement, with bilateral round or wedge-shaped peripheral cortical lesions being the most common pattern (Fig. 11). Patients usually improve after corticosteroid treatment. On MRI, IGG4 lesions demonstrate both T1 and T2 hypointense signal with mild enhancement on post-contrast T1 weighted images.

### Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis: case report [^114tkX4R]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In the emergency department (ED), pyelonephritis is a fairly common diagnosis, especially in patients with unilateral flank pain. Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis (XGP) is a rare type of pyelonephritis that is associated with unique features, which may lead to its diagnosis.

Case Report

A 30-year-old male patient presented to the ED for evaluation of right-sided abdominal pain that has been ongoing for the past 24 hours. He noted the pain was located predominantly in the right flank and described it as sharp in nature. The pain was nonradiating and was associated with scant hematuria. He stated that he had similar pains approximately 1 month earlier that resolved after a few days. The patient underwent a bedside ultrasound and a subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which showed an enlarged, multiloculated right kidney with dilated calyces and a large staghorn calculus, findings that represent XGP. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? This case report highlights an unusual variant of pyelonephritis, a relatively common ED diagnosis. XGP should be considered in patients with recurrent pyelonephritis, as treatment for XGP may require surgical intervention in addition to traditional antibiotic management.

### Purulent pericarditis and septic shock secondary to a hepatic-pericardial fistula in a patient with complex oncologic and cardiac history [^114ngrTQ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hepatic-pericardial fistulas are extremely rare complications typically arising from hepatic abscesses, trauma, or invasive procedures. These fistulas can lead to clinical manifestations such as pericarditis, cardiac tamponade, and septic shock. We report a case of purulent pericarditis and septic shock secondary to a hepatic-pericardial fistula in a patient with complex cardiac and oncologic history.

Case presentation

A 76-year-old man with a history of pancreatic, renal cell and prostate cancer presented with acute chest pain and dyspnea. Initial investigations revealed a moderate pericardial effusion and a suspicious hepatic lesion. The patient developed cardiac tamponade and underwent emergency pericardiocentesis, draining 750 mL of purulent fluid. A CT-guided biopsy confirmed a hepatic abscess with fistulization to the pericardium. Despite antibiotic therapy and drainage procedures, the patient's condition deteriorated, resulting in septic shock and death.

Discussion

This case highlights the challenges in managing hepatic-pericardial fistulas, particularly in patients with significant comorbidities. Bacteroides fragilis was identified as the causative pathogen, which underscores the importance of timely identification and management of these rare infections. Early surgical intervention and targeted antibiotic therapy are critical, although prognosis remains poor in patients with compromised cardiovascular and respiratory status.

Conclusion

Hepatic-pericardial fistulas, though rare, should be considered in patients with unexplained pericarditis or septic shock, particularly in the presence of hepatic abscesses. Early recognition, multidisciplinary management, and individualized treatment are essential to improve outcomes.

### Renal abscess due to community-acquired extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli in a 15-year-old girl [^116uLsvK]. Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Infections caused by community-acquired (CA) extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae are an increasing public health concern. We report a 15-year-old girl with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections who developed a right renal abscess. Percutaneous abscess drainage and subsequent microbiological culture revealed CA-ESBL Escherichia coli. To our knowledge, this is the first reported pediatric case of CA-ESBL E coli renal abscess complicating urinary tract infection. Establishing a definitive diagnosis of ESBL E coli renal abscess may necessitate obtaining a microbiological culture via surgical specimen, especially in children with apparent risk factors for the selection of ESBL-producing organisms.

### Tuberculosis revisted: classic imaging findings in childhood [^115ESoKx]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

In urogenital TB, the kidney is the most commonly involved site. Diagnosis of renal TB and progression of disease can be detected by US, CT and MRI. Ultrasound is the initial imaging modality, while CT and MRI are the options for cross-sectional imaging.

Renal involvement in TB may be parenchymal or involve the pelvicalyceal system. Parenchymal involvement can be seen on CT and MRI as hypo-enhancing granulomas, striated nephrogram (Fig. 36), TB renal abscess formation (Figs. 44 and 45), tuberculomas and eventually autonephrectomy. The healing stage may demonstrate calcification, varying in appearance from punctate foci to almost complete replacement of the renal parenchyma, characteristically described as a putty kidney (during the autonephrectomy stage).

Fig. 44
Tuberculous pyelonephritis in a 4-year-old boy. A coronal contrast-enhanced computed tomography image of the abdomen shows a striated nephrogram in the bilateral kidneys with wedge-shaped hypodense areas (arrows)

Fig. 45
Tuberculous renal abscesses in a 5-year-old girl. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography images of the abdomen in axial (a) and coronal (b) planes show multiple peripherally enhancing hypodense lesions in the periphery of the left kidney (arrows)

Peripheral lobar calcifications in the kidney represent yet another typical pattern that may be seen in end-stage kidney disease and is said to be characteristic of TB. A lobar pattern of calcification, in which a densely calcified rim is seen to outline the periphery of the distorted renal lobar anatomy, is also characteristic of renal TB. Pelvicalyceal system involvement can be seen at imaging as papillary necrosis, focal calyceal blunting/dilatation, infundibular and/or pelvic stenosis, peripheral urothelial calcification and urothelial thickening.

### Xantogranulomatous pyeloneprhritis in children [^116L5Gv6]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

The diffuse process has characteristic imaging features. The involved kidney enlarges but maintains its reniform shape; it shows nephrolithiasis, hydronephrosis, and loss and replacement of the normal corticomedullary junction by yellow masses extending to the renal pelvis and perirenal fat.

The focal form disease is confined to a renal segment or one pole of a duplex system, and the most common location is the lower pole of the kidney.

The perirenal infiltration is possible in both types and can be mistaken for common renal neoplasm (Wilms' tumour, clear cell carcinoma) or inflammatory process (renal or perirenal abscess, renal tuberculosis, focal or diffuse nephritis, sarcoidosis or Wegener granulomatosis disease).

Lesions are frequently unilateral. Bilateral XPN is extremely rare. Only ten cases of bilateral diffuse and six cases of bilateral focal XPN have been reported in the literature.

The treatment of the diffuse type usually requires a total nephrectomy with or without antibiotic therapy. The prognosis after surgery is excellent, and no recurrence of XPN in the healthy contralateral kidney has yet been reported. However, routine follow-up, including clinical examination, ultrasonography (US), blood count and urine examination is recommended to monitor the recurrence of stone disease in the contralateral unit and the development of urinary tract infection.

The less common segmental type can be cured by partial nephrectomy or by first-line antibiotic therapy, with no recurrence reported in published studies. The main problem is to confirm this diagnosis and exclude malign diseases. It is essential — in the presence of intrarenal mass — to perform biopsies for appropriate surgical management of focal XPN in order to avoid unnecessary total nephrectomy.

The radiological diagnosis of XPN cannot be carried out on the basis of a single test. Radiological features of US and computed tomography (CT) in combination with clinical suspicion must enable a diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used most frequently. A Tc-99m DTPA (diethylene-triamine-penta-acetate) renal scan demonstrates non-function of the affected kidney.

The definitive diagnosis is based on pathological assessment after nephrectomy, which shows areas of parenchymal destruction and necrosis, as well as interstitial fibrosis and chronic inflammatory infiltrate composed of plasma cells, lymphocytes and numerous lipid-laden macrophages.

We review and illustrate the clinical, radiological, surgical and pathological characteristics of XPN in children. All cases shown are surgically and histopathologically proven.

An alternative treatment modality is described in the form of embolization of the renal artery to devascularise the renal parenchyma and ablate the renal tissue, thus avoiding a major surgical procedure and the significant risks involved.

### CT imaging of mass-like renal lesions in children [^111Tnpkx]. Pediatric Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Mass-like renal lesions in children occur in a diverse spectrum of conditions including benign and malignant neoplasm, infection, infarction, lymphatic malformation, and traumatic injury. Although mass-like renal lesions can sometimes be suspected on plain radiographs and evaluated with US in children, subsequent CT is usually performed for the confirmation of diagnosis and further characterization. The purpose of this pictorial essay was to review the CT imaging findings of both common and uncommon mass-like renal lesions in pediatric patients. Understanding the characteristic CT appearance of mass-like renal lesions in children enables an accurate diagnosis and optimizes patient management.

### Laparoscopic vs. open nephrectomy for inflammatory renal conditions: a meta-analysis emphasizing safety [^112AzGQH]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Implications for clinical practice

Given the moderate-certainty evidence (GRADE) for reduced complications, LN should be considered a first-line approach for IRCs in high-volume centers with experienced laparoscopic surgeons. However, surgeon expertise remains paramount, as complex cases with extensive adhesions or perinephric abscesses may still warrant ON. Robles-Torres et al. proposed a risk-stratification algorithm for XGP, recommending ON for cases with severe adhesions or renal fistulae. Preoperative imaging and prolonged antibiotic regimens should guide decision-making.

Subgroup and meta-regression findings clarify which patients may benefit most from LN. Specifically, patients with XGP experienced significantly lower EBL with LN compared to ON (MD = -130.8 mL; 95% CI: -203.35 to -58.21). Additionally, shorter hospital stays were consistently observed with LN in XGP, non-XGP and non-TB cohorts, particularly when using the transperitoneal approach (PMD = -4 to -5 days; I² = 0%, 56%, and 33%). While LN showed trends toward reduced transfusion rates and fewer high-grade complications, the certainty of evidence remained low-to-moderate due to study design limitations. In TB-dominant IRCs, outcome variability remained high despite meta-regression (I² = 98%), suggesting cautious patient selection in such cases.

Therefore, preoperative imaging, disease etiology, and surgical approach are critical factors in optimizing outcomes. LN is best reserved for cases without anticipated complex anatomical challenges, with surgeon experience and institutional capability informing the surgical decision.

Future Directions.

### Perinephric abscess caused by group B. streptococcus… [^116Vthoi]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

to the editor: A 37-year-old black woman with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes and a history of urinary tract infections presented with a three-week history of increasing sharp right flank pain, tactile fever, chills, nausea, anorexia, and a single episode of hematuria. She denied dysuria, frequency, urgency, vomiting, or abdominal pain. Six weeks before admission, she was treated with ciprofloxacin for a UTI by her personal physician; however, urine culture ultimately grew group B streptococcus not sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Initial follow-up with her physician indicated she was improving. Physical examination revealed a slender, uncomfortable woman. Her pulse was 114 and blood pressure was 142/91 mm Hg. She exhibited pale mucosa and a soft cardiac flow murmur, a benign abdominal examination, but significant right flank tenderness. Pelvic examination and wet preparation revealed yeast and trichomonal vaginitis. A bilateral distal peripheral neuropathy was present.

Urinalysis revealed glucosuria, mild proteinuria, excretion of six to 10 red blood cells and one to five white blood cells per high-powered field, with negative leukocyte esterase and nitrate. Chemistry panel was normal except for a glucose level of 317 mg per dL. Hemoglobin A 1c was 16. 3 percent. A computed tomography scan revealed a 4- to 6-cm right perinephric abscess and non-specific enlargement of both kidneys. This patient recovered with percutaneous drainage of the abscess and intravenous antibiotics directed against GBS, which grew from the abscess drainage. 1 These illnesses are more common in blacks and elderly persons. One report 2 describes a 17-year-old black girl with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and duplication of her upper right ureter–who exhibited signs and symptoms similar to our patient.

There also have been case reports of GBS perinephric abscess in a 47-year-old woman, 3 a young adult man with diabetes, 4 a male newborn, 5 and a 61-year-old woman with diabetes who was treated for renal abscess caused by "ß-hemolytic streptococcus. " 6. GBS may cause perinephric abscess and other types of invasive infections, particularly in persons with underlying medical problems. It is important that this organism be treated with antibiotics active against GBS when found to be the etiologic agent of UTI.

### Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus renal abscess: a rare cause of fever of unknown origin… [^114AtL1K]. publications.aap.org (2001). Low credibility.

Renal abscess is uncommon in pediatrics and is rarely a cause of fever of unknown origin. We recently cared for a patient who presented with a 3-week history of fever. An indium scan ultimately led to the diagnosis of a renal abscess. Aspiration yielded. Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus. This unusual case prompted a review of the clinical and microbiologic features of renal abscess in pediatric patients at our hospital over the past 10 years. Seven additional patients with a discharge diagnosis of renal abscess were identified. Only 2 of the patients had identifiable risk factors. Staphylococcus aureus or Enterobacteriaceae were responsible for most infections, consistent with hematogenous and urinary tract sources, respectively. No other cases of anaerobic abscess were identified.

This case highlights the importance of considering a renal abscess in the differential diagnosis of fever of unknown origin and of processing specimens for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms.

### Effective duration of antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of acute lobar nephronia… [^111Xx8bM]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. Effective treatment of acute lobar nephronia can prevent its progression to renal abscess. The goal of this prospective study was to compare the treatment efficacy for pediatric patients who had ALN with a 3- vs 2-week intravenous plus oral antimicrobial-therapy regimen. METHODS. Patients who were suspected of having an upper urinary tract infection underwent a systematic scheme of ultrasonographic and computed tomographic evaluation for ALN diagnosis. Patients with positive CT findings were enrolled and randomly allocated with serial entry for either a total 2-week or a 3-week antibiotic treatment regimen. Antibiotics were changed from an intravenous form to an oral form 2 to 3 days after defervescence of fever. Follow-up clinical evaluations and urine-culture analyses were performed 3 to 7 days after cessation of antibiotic treatment. Patients with persistent infection or relapse were considered as treatment failures. RESULTs.

A total of 80 patients with ALN were enrolled. Forty-one patients were treated with a 2-week antimicrobial protocol, and the other 39 patients were treated with a 3-week course. Seven treatment failures, 1 persistent infection, and 6 infection relapses were identified, all of which were in the 2-week treatment group. Prolonged fever before admission and positive. Escherichia coli growth in urine culture were noted as risk factors for treatment failure. All treatment failures were managed successfully with an additional 10-day antibiotic course. CONCLUSION. A total of 3 weeks of intravenous and oral antibiotic therapy tailored to the pathogen noted in cultures should be the treatment of choice for pediatric patients with ALN. Comments.

### Clinical overview of melioidosis… [^115FCkBk]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Types of melioidosis infection Generally, symptoms appear 1 to 4 weeks after exposure to B. pseudomallei bacteria. Melioidosis can be localized or disseminated, and sub-clinical infections are also possible. A localized infection often presents as an ulcer, nodule, or skin abscess. Symptoms generally include fever and myalgias. Melioidosis most commonly presents as a pulmonary infection, which may include: Patients generally present with acute illness, but around 10 percent present with chronic melioidosis, an ongoing illness of at least two months. Both acute and chronic melioidosis can lead to disseminated infection and rapid-onset septicemia can occur. These conditions are more common in patients with underlying risk factors including diabetes and renal insufficiency. Abscesses may be found throughout the body, notably in the liver, spleen, or prostate. Involvement of joints, bones, viscera, lymph nodes, skin, or brain are also possible.

Patient management Long-term outcomes and survival depend on disease severity and course of treatment. Treatment consists of an initial intensive phase, followed by an eradication phase: Initial intensive therapy lasts 2 weeks to more than 8 weeks: Intravenous antibiotics
- Ceftazidime, every 6–8 hours OR
- Meropenem, every 8 hours for critically ill patients or patients with CNS or long-bone involvement
- Ceftazidime, every 6–8 hours
- Add PO Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole every 12 hours in patients with non-pulmonary focal sites of infection.

Eradication therapy lasts 3 months to more than 6 months:

- **First choice**: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, every 12 hours with folic acid to prevent or reduce antifolate toxicity OR
- Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, every 8 hours OR
- Doxycycline, once daily ORevery 12 hours If antibiotics are not taken for the length of time prescribed, early recrudescence or subsequent relapse can occur, usually within 1 to 2 years.
