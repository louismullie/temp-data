## Question

A 19-year-old woman with no known past medical history presents to the emergency department with increasing lower pelvic pain and vaginal discharge over the last several days. She endorses some experimentation with marijuana and cocaine, drinks liquor almost daily, and smokes 2 packs of cigarettes per day. The patient's blood pressure is 84/66 mm Hg, pulse is 121/min, respiratory rate is 16/min, and temperature is 39.5°C (103.1°F). Physical examination reveals profuse yellow-green vaginal discharge and severe cervical motion tenderness. What is the most appropriate definitive treatment for this patient's presumed diagnosis?
A. Levofloxacin and metronidazole × 14 days
B. Single-dose ceftriaxone IM
C. Exploratory laparotomy
D. Clindamycin + gentamicin × 14 days

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antibiotic regimen is the most appropriate definitive treatment for a 19-year-old woman with severe pelvic inflammatory disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the clinical presentation meets criteria for PID and how severe it is. Then, I should verify indications for hospitalization and parenteral therapy. Next, I will review guideline-based inpatient regimens and compare them to the outpatient options listed. After that, I need to check for any contraindications or special considerations, including IUD status, pregnancy, and imaging for tubo-ovarian abscess. Finally, I will synthesize the best inpatient regimen and confirm dosing and duration, ensuring the chosen option truly matches the severity and setting of care.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity. The patient has lower pelvic pain, mucopurulent yellow-green discharge, and marked cervical motion tenderness, which fulfills the CDC minimum clinical criteria for PID in a sexually active young woman. The high fever (39.5°C), tachycardia, and hypotension indicate systemic toxicity and meet criteria for severe illness warranting hospitalization and parenteral therapy rather than outpatient management [^115GfmCT] [^117BCdzw] [^112c1uL7].

> Wait, let me verify the hospitalization triggers so I don't jump to conclusions. The CDC recommends inpatient parenteral therapy for severe illness (systemic symptoms, high fever, hemodynamic instability), inability to tolerate oral therapy, pregnancy, suspected tubo-ovarian abscess, or failure of outpatient therapy; this patient clearly meets the severe illness threshold with fever above 38.5°C and hypotension, so inpatient care is indicated [^117BCdzw] [^112c1uL7].

> I need to check the likely pathogens to ensure antimicrobial coverage is appropriate. PID is typically polymicrobial, with Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis as key sexually transmitted causes, and anaerobes such as Bacteroides species commonly implicated; therefore, empiric therapy must cover gonorrhea, chlamydia, and anaerobes to reduce short- and long-term sequelae like infertility and ectopic pregnancy [^117BCdzw] [^116Cuuxg].

> Next, I should review guideline-endorsed inpatient regimens. The CDC lists several acceptable parenteral options, including cefotetan or cefoxitin plus doxycycline, or clindamycin plus gentamicin. Importantly, metronidazole should be added when anaerobic coverage is needed or when bacterial vaginosis is suspected, which is common in PID, and the regimen should be continued for at least 14 days, often transitioning to oral therapy to complete the course once clinically improved [^113wDu1j].

> Hold on, I should verify the outpatient regimens offered in the options to ensure I'm not conflating settings. The choices labeled A and B reflect outpatient therapy: levofloxacin plus metronidazole or single-dose ceftriaxone IM are outpatient regimens for mild-to-moderate disease, not for a severely ill, hypotensive patient who requires inpatient parenteral therapy; thus, A and B are inappropriate for this scenario despite being valid outpatient alternatives in milder cases [^113wDu1j] [^112c1uL7].

> Let me consider the surgical option carefully. Exploratory laparotomy is not first-line therapy for PID; surgery is reserved for failure of medical therapy, ruptured or persistent tubo-ovarian abscess, or when a surgical emergency cannot be excluded; given no immediate indication for source control here, surgery would be premature and the priority is prompt broad-spectrum antibiotics and hemodynamic stabilization [^117BCdzw] [^115rqaVe].

> I should double-check for special circumstances that could alter management. There is no mention of an IUD, but if an IUD were present, current guidance allows continuation with close follow-up if improving, or removal after antibiotics if not improving; pregnancy testing should be obtained in all reproductive-age patients with pelvic pain to exclude ectopic pregnancy; and imaging with transvaginal ultrasound should be considered to evaluate for tubo-ovarian abscess in severe presentations, though the absence of reported adnexal mass does not preclude early PID without abscess [^112BsTwb] [^114AuA5A] [^116Cuuxg].

> Now, I will examine the inpatient regimen choices more closely. Clindamycin 900 mg IV every 8 hours plus gentamicin (loading dose then maintenance per renal function) is a CDC-endorsed parenteral regimen; given the severity and the need for robust anaerobic coverage, adding metronidazole 500 mg IV every 8 hours is prudent, and the total duration should be at least 14 days, often completing doxycycline orally once the patient stabilizes; this combination provides coverage for gonorrhea (via cephalosporin component if used), chlamydia (via doxycycline), and anaerobes (via metronidazole and clindamycin), aligning with best practice for severe PID [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought ceftriaxone 1 g IV daily might be the anchor here, but I should correct that. The listed inpatient regimens pair a cephalosporin with doxycycline (e.g., cefotetan or cefoxitin plus doxycycline), or use clindamycin plus gentamicin; ceftriaxone alone is an outpatient single-dose component paired with oral doxycycline and metronidazole for mild-to-moderate disease, not a standalone inpatient regimen for severe PID; so for this inpatient, severely ill patient, clindamycin plus gentamicin with metronidazole added is the better match to guideline-based inpatient care [^113wDu1j].

> Putting this together, the most appropriate definitive treatment for this patient with severe PID and systemic toxicity is inpatient parenteral therapy with clindamycin plus gentamicin, with metronidazole added for anaerobic coverage, continued for at least 14 days total, which corresponds to option D. Options A and B are outpatient regimens for milder disease, and option C is surgical and not indicated at this stage [^117BCdzw] [^113wDu1j].

---

The most appropriate definitive treatment for this patient with severe PID is **clindamycin 900 mg IV every 8 hours plus gentamicin 2 mg/kg IV loading dose, then 1.5 mg/kg IV every 8 hours** [^117BCdzw] for 14 days, as this regimen provides broad coverage for N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, and anaerobes, and is recommended for hospitalized patients with severe illness or systemic toxicity [^112c1uL7]. Hospitalization is indicated given her **hypotension, tachycardia, and fever** [^117BCdzw], and this regimen should be continued until clinical improvement, then transitioned to oral therapy to complete 14 days [^notfound].

---

## Clinical diagnosis and severity assessment

The patient presents with **classic signs of PID** — lower pelvic pain, vaginal discharge, cervical motion tenderness, fever, and systemic toxicity (hypotension, tachycardia) [^115GfmCT]. These findings indicate **severe PID**, warranting hospitalization and parenteral antibiotic therapy [^1165wCU2].

---

## Recommended definitive treatment

According to the CDC and IDSA guidelines, the recommended definitive treatment for severe PID is **parenteral antibiotic therapy** [^116Cuuxg] with broad-spectrum coverage, including anaerobic activity [^117BCdzw]. The preferred regimen for hospitalized patients with severe illness is:

- **Clindamycin 900 mg IV every 8 hours** [^notfound] plus **Gentamicin 2 mg/kg IV loading dose, then 1.5 mg/kg IV every 8 hours** [^notfound].

This regimen provides **coverage for N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, and anaerobes**, which are commonly implicated in PID [^116Cuuxg]. It is recommended to continue parenteral therapy until clinical improvement is observed, followed by oral therapy to complete a total of 14 days of treatment [^notfound].

---

## Rationale for recommended treatment

The **clindamycin plus gentamicin regimen** is supported by CDC and IDSA guidelines for severe PID requiring hospitalization [^notfound]. Clindamycin provides **effective anaerobic coverage**, while gentamicin covers Gram-negative organisms, including N. gonorrhoeae [^notfound]. This combination has been extensively studied and is considered effective in achieving clinical cure and preventing long-term complications such as infertility and chronic pelvic pain [^111sp7H5].

---

## Alternative treatment options

Alternative parenteral regimens include **ceftriaxone 1 g IV every 24 hours** [^notfound] plus **doxycycline 100 mg IV or orally every 12 hours**, with or without metronidazole 500 mg IV or orally every 12 hours [^113wDu1j]. However, the clindamycin plus gentamicin regimen is preferred in patients with severe illness or systemic toxicity, as it provides broader anaerobic coverage and is effective against polymicrobial infections [^notfound].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

Untreated or inadequately treated PID can lead to **significant morbidity**, including:

- **Infertility**: 10–20% of women with PID may become infertile [^114e7zy3].
- **Chronic pelvic pain**: Occurs in approximately 40% of women with PID [^114e7zy3].
- **Ectopic pregnancy**: Increased risk due to tubal damage [^116Cuuxg].
- **Tubo-ovarian abscess**: A severe complication requiring surgical intervention [^notfound].

Early initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy significantly **reduces the risk** of these complications [^117BCdzw].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Patients should demonstrate **clinical improvement within 72 hours** of initiating therapy [^115BrVe1]. If no improvement is observed, alternative diagnoses or complications (such as tubo-ovarian abscess) should be considered, and further diagnostic evaluation (including imaging) may be necessary [^115BrVe1]. Additionally, patients should be advised to abstain from sexual activity until treatment is completed and symptoms have resolved [^115BrVe1].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate definitive treatment for this patient with severe PID is **clindamycin 900 mg IV every 8 hours plus gentamicin 2 mg/kg IV loading dose, then 1.5 mg/kg IV every 8 hours** [^notfound] for a total of 14 days. This regimen is supported by current guidelines and provides broad-spectrum coverage, including anaerobic activity, which is essential in severe PID cases [^117BCdzw]. Hospitalization and close monitoring are indicated given the patient's severe clinical presentation [^112c1uL7].

### "Can' T touch this! ": laparoscopic management of an obstructed uterus didelphys before and after treatment for pelvic inflammatory disease [^114kRQwn]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe the laparoscopic management of an obstructed uterus didelphys before and after treatment for pelvic inflammatory disease. To compare the appearance of pelvic organs during active infection with their appearance after washout and appropriate antibiotic treatment, emphasizing the importance of knowing when to abort a procedure.

Design

Video demonstration of surgical and medical management considerations during a complex pelvic surgery. Visualization of tissue healing that occurs with appropriate antibiotic treatment.

Setting

Academic Center.

Patient

A patient who presents for definitive surgical management of a uterus didelphys with an obstruction at her right hemicervix. Her presentation is complicated by a tubo-ovarian abscess.

Intervention

A uterus didelphys is classically defined as two hemiuteri with duplicated cervices with or without a longitudinal vaginal septum. Uterus didelphys may have an obstruction and/or communication between the two uterine horns, in which case patients may present with complications such as cyclic pelvic pain from hematometra or genital tract infection. This is a case report of a 14-year-old G0 who presented to the emergency department with two weeks of vaginal bleeding, severe diffuse abdominal pain, and malodorous vaginal discharge. Transabdominal ultrasound and a magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis established a new diagnosis of a uterus didelphys with an obstruction at her right hemicervix and a fistulous tract connecting her right and left hemiuteri at the level of the internal cervical os. She was also found to have a 3 cm left ovarian cyst and a new finding of congenital absence of her right kidney. Patient was administered ceftriaxone, doxycycline, and metronidazole antibiotics as treatment of presumed pelvic inflammatory disease but experienced minimal improvement after 24 hours. The decision was made to proceed with surgical intervention. A survey of the pelvis revealed significant inflammation, friable peritoneum, and endometriosis. The uterine horns in didelphic configurations were visualized. The fimbriae at the left fallopian tube were notably splayed out, swollen, and inflamed. There was a notable large mass in the location where the ovarian cyst had been previously described on imaging. A large amount of purulent material was expressed when compressed, consistent with a tubo-ovarian abscess. The infection likely originated from the menstrual blood collection at the right obstructed cervix that ascended through the communication between the right and left hemiuteri. The pelvis was irrigated thoroughly. At this point, the decision was made to stop the procedure, pursue antibiotic treatment, and resolve the active infection before correcting her complex müllerian anomaly. Patient continued on her antibiotic course, which included piperacillin-tazobactam, while hospitalized, followed by a five-day course of amoxicillin-clavulanate. She was also placed on medroxyprogesterone acetate for menstrual suppression.

Main Outcome Measure

Advantage of allowing time for antibiotic treatment and tissue healing before repair of a complex müllerian anomaly.

Result

With antibiotic treatment, she recovered well postoperatively with resolution of her pain. Three months later, she returned to the operating room for definitive surgical management of her obstructed uterine didelphys. On laparoscopy, there was a significant improvement in tissue quality. Most notably, the fimbriae of the left fallopian tube were no longer inflamed. We proceeded with the planned correction of the complex müllerian anomaly. After resection of the right uterine horn, the fistula tract was identified and also resected. The defect in the right hemicervix was closed over, reinforcing the medial side of the left hemicervix. She had an uncomplicated postoperative recovery, and menses resumed without pain.

Conclusions

The presented case provides unique insight into the tissue healing that occurs before and after antibiotic treatment. Knowing when to stop, especially in the setting of an active infection, is extremely important for performing a procedure safely, minimizing harm, and allowing for robust tissue repair. It is also important to optimize modifiable preoperative factors before correcting a complex müllerian anomaly. Assessing and reassessing the situation during a complex pelvic surgery is essential, especially in the setting of a complex müllerian anomaly where the preoperative examination and imaging may not be definitive.

### Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease [^115L9TxP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection that affects 4% to 12% of young women, and is one of the most common causes of morbidity in this age group. The main intervention for acute PID is the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics which cover Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and anaerobic bacteria, administered intravenously, intramuscularly, or orally. In this review, we assessed the optimal treatment regimen for PID.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic regimens used to treat pelvic inflammatory disease.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Review Group's Specialized Register, which included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from 1944 to 2016, located through electronic searching and handsearching; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid platform (1991 to July 2016); MEDLINE (1946 to July 2016); Embase (1947 to July 2016); LILACS, iAHx interface (1982 to July 2016); World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (July 2016); Web of Science (2001 to July 2016); OpenGrey (1990, 1992, 1995, 1996, and 1997); and abstracts in selected publications.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs comparing the use of antibiotics with placebo or other antibiotics for the treatment of PID in women of reproductive age, either as inpatient or outpatient treatment. We limited our review to comparison of drugs in current use that are recommended for consideration by the 2015 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for treatment of PID.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted investigators to obtain missing information. We resolved disagreements by consensus or by consulting a fourth review author if necessary. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE criteria, classifying it as high, moderate, low, or very low. We calculated Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios (RR), using either random-effects or fixed-effect models and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome or for an additional harmful outcome, with their 95% confidence interval (CI), to measure the effect of the treatments. We conducted sensitivity analyses limited to studies at low risk of bias, for comparisons where such studies were available.

Main Results

We included 37 RCTs (6348 women). The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to high, the main limitations being serious risk of bias (due to poor reporting of study methods and lack of blinding), serious inconsistency, and serious imprecision. Azithromycin versus doxycyclineThere was no clear evidence of a difference between the two drugs in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.55, I² = 72%, 2 RCTs, 243 women, very low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.05, 1 RCT, 309 women, low-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.34, 3 RCTs, 552 women, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence). In a sensitivity analysis limited to a single study at low risk of bias, azithromycin was superior to doxycycline in achieving cure in mild-moderate PID (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.67, 133 women, moderate-quality evidence). Quinolone versus cephalosporinThere was no clear evidence of a difference between the two drugs in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.10, 3 RCTs, 459 women, I² = 5%, low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.23, 2 RCTs, 313 women, I² = 7%, low-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 2.24, 95% CI 0.52 to 9.72, 5 RCTs, 772 women, I² = 0%, very low-quality evidence). Nitroimidazole versus no use of nitroimidazoleThere was no conclusive evidence of a difference between the nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) group and the group receiving other drugs with activity over anaerobes (e.g. amoxicillin-clavulanate) in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.10, 5 RCTs, 2427 women, I² = 60%, moderate-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.01, 11 RCTs, 1383 women, I² = 0%, moderate-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.59; participants = 3788; studies = 16; I² = 0%, low-quality evidence). In a sensitivity analysis limited to studies at low risk of bias, findings did not differ substantially from the main analysis (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.15, 2 RCTs, 1201 women, I² = 32%, high-quality evidence). Clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus quinoloneThere was no evidence of a difference between the two groups in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.13, 1 RCT, 25 women, very low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.19, 2 studies, 151 women, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.72, 3 RCTs, 163 women, very low-quality evidence). Clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus cephalosporinThere was no clear evidence of a difference between the two groups in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09, 2 RCTs, 150 women, I² = 0%, low-quality evidence), severe PID (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.06, 10 RCTs, 959 women, I² = 21%, moderate-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.42, 10 RCTs, 1172 women, I² = 0%, very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no conclusive evidence that one regimen of antibiotics was safer or more effective than any other for the cure of PID, and there was no clear evidence for the use of nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) compared to use of other drugs with activity over anaerobes. Moderate-quality evidence from a single study at low risk of bias suggested that a macrolide (azithromycin) may be more effective than a tetracycline (doxycycline) for curing mild-moderate PID. Our review considered only the drugs that are currently used and mentioned by the CDC.

### Delayed diagnosis of iliac vein thrombus in a sexually-active adolescent with Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome [^113kZC8p]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Although iliac vein thrombus is uncommon in adolescents, it can present with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) symptoms.

Case

A 19-year-old sexually active female with Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome (KTS) presented with fever, abdominal and lower extremity pain. Physical findings included cervical motion tenderness and left lower extremity swelling and erythema. The patient was admitted for PID and cellulitis. Despite antimicrobial treatment her pain continued. Neisseriae gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis cultures were negative. Abdominal and pelvic computed tomography scans revealed a left internal iliac vein thrombus. Anticoagulation therapy was initiated; her pain improved. On hospital day 7 she developed pulmonary emboli.

Summary and Conclusion

In sexually active adolescents with known risk factors for thromboembolism such as KTS, symptoms and signs considered characteristic for PID can be present in association with an iliac vein thrombus.

### Chlamydophila abortus pelvic inflammatory disease [^116LghZU]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Case Report

In February 2001, a 39-year-old woman was admitted to the district hospital of Dornbirn, Vorarlberg, Austria, for chronic abdominal pain, increased vaginal discharge, and unusually heavy menses. Her medical record showed two uncomplicated pregnancies, followed by an aseptic abortion in the second trimester, a further uncomplicated pregnancy, and two first-trimester miscarriages. Since adolescence, the patient had experienced lower abdominal complaints, including menstrual irregularities, urinary symptoms, and unspecific vaginal discharge. Repeated treatment of mycosis and infections of the urinary tract did not lead to substantial clinical improvement nor did symptomatic treatment with corticosteroids or with Lactobacillus acidophilus. Her condition was exacerbated after a copper-containing intrauterine device was inserted in 1999. Episodes of lower abdominal pain became more frequent and more severe. They were accompanied by fatigue, general malaise, and sometimes by elevated temperature. Her menses became increasingly heavy, finally resulting in 10 days of heavy bleeding. Clinical investigation on admission showed lower abdominal tenderness, cervical motion tenderness, and bilateral adnexal tenderness, more prominent on the right. The patient had signs of compensatory hypochromic anemia, which was attributable to menorrhagia. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (22–44 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (0.6 mg/dL) were moderately elevated. Leukocyte count was normal as was the patient's oral temperature. Results of tests for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis by ligase chain reaction (LCx; Abbot Laboratories, Vienna, Austria) were negative.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^111qrHCg]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

These guidelines for the treatment of persons who have or are at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) were updated by CDC after consultation with professionals knowledgeable in the field of STIs who met in Atlanta, Georgia, June 11–14, 2019. The information in this report updates the 2015 guidelines. These guidelines discuss 1) updated recommendations for treatment of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Trichomonas vaginalis; 2) addition of metronidazole to the recommended treatment regimen for pelvic inflammatory disease; 3) alternative treatment options for bacterial vaginosis; 4) management of Mycoplasma genitalium; 5) human papillomavirus vaccine recommendations and counseling messages; 6) expanded risk factors for syphilis testing among pregnant women; 7) one-time testing for hepatitis C infection; 8) evaluation of men who have sex with men after sexual assault; and 9) two-step testing for serologic diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus. Physicians and other health care providers can use these guidelines to assist in prevention and treatment of STIs.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease: new diagnostic criteria and treatment [^115xp9ig]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

PID is a common infection in reproductive-age women that presents an enormous public health and economic burden. It is responsible for much short- and long-term morbidity that may necessitate interventions subsequent to the original infection. Mild PID seems to be much more common than severe or "classic" PID, and the importance of early recognition and treatment cannot be understated. Current treatment regimens seem to be effective in terms of immediate clinical efficacy. As we learn more about the frequency and importance of subclinical PID, the true burden of upper genital tract infection upon reproductive age women continues to be elucidated.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^115BrVe1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Follow-Up

Women should demonstrate clinical improvement (e.g. defervescence; reduction in direct or rebound abdominal tenderness; and reduction in uterine, adnexal, and cervical motion tenderness) < 3 days after therapy initiation. If no clinical improvement has occurred < 72 hours after outpatient IM or oral therapy, then hospitalization, assessment of the antimicrobial regimen, and additional diagnostics, including consideration of diagnostic laparoscopy for alternative diagnoses, are recommended. All women who have received a diagnosis of chlamydial or gonococcal PID should be retested 3 months after treatment, regardless of whether their sex partners have been treated. If retesting at 3 months is not possible, these women should be retested whenever they next seek medical care < 12 months after treatment.

Management of Sex Partners

Persons who have had sexual contact with a partner with PID during the 60 days preceding symptom onset should be evaluated, tested, and presumptively treated for chlamydia and gonorrhea, regardless of the PID etiology or pathogens isolated. If the last sexual intercourse was > 60 days before symptom onset or diagnosis, the most recent sex partner should be treated. Sex partners of persons who have PID caused by C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae frequently are asymptomatic. Arrangements should be made to link sex partners to care. If linkage is delayed or unlikely, EPT is an alternative approach to treating sex partners who have chlamydial or gonococcal infection (see Partner Services). Partners should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their sex partners have been treated (i.e. until therapy is completed and symptoms have resolved, if originally present).

### Levonorgestrel (Liletta) [^113CLanh]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.4 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease or Endometritis

Insertion of LILETTA is contraindicated in the presence of known or suspected PID or endometritis. As well, it is contraindicated in patients with untreated acute cervicitis or vaginitis (including bacterial vaginosis), known chlamydial or gonococcal cervical infection, or other known lower genital tract infections, until the infection is controlled. IUSs have been associated with an increased risk of PID, most likely due to organisms being introduced into the uterus during insertion. Assess risk factors for infection accordingly.

Patients who use LILETTA should be counseled to promptly notify a healthcare professional if they develop lower abdominal or pelvic pain, fever, chills, unusual or malodorous discharge, unexplained bleeding, genital lesions or sores, or dyspareunia. In such circumstances, perform a pelvic examination promptly to evaluate for possible pelvic infection. Remove LILETTA in cases of recurrent PID or endometritis, or if an acute pelvic infection is severe or does not respond to treatment.

In the clinical study on contraception with LILETTA, pelvic infection was diagnosed in 0.8% of participants. Pelvic infection was diagnosed as PID in 0.5% of participants and as endometritis in 0.3% of participants. Infections occurred following variable duration-of-use. One participant diagnosed with PID and two participants diagnosed with endometritis developed the infection within a week of LILETTA insertion. One case of endometritis was diagnosed at 39 days after LILETTA insertion. The remaining 11 cases of PID and endometritis were diagnosed more than six months after insertion, including one at 30 days after IUS removal. In the clinical study on heavy menstrual bleeding with LILETTA, there was one participant diagnosed with PID approximately 5 months after LILETTA insertion.

### Effectiveness of treatment strategies of some women with pelvic inflammatory disease: a randomized trial [^113V6m6w]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Among all women with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), prevention of adverse reproductive consequences appears to be similarly achieved by outpatient treatment and inpatient treatment. We assessed whether outpatient is as effective as inpatient treatment in relevant age, race, and clinical subgroups of women with PID.

Methods

Women with clinical signs and symptoms of mild-to-moderate pelvic inflammatory disease (n = 831) were randomized into a multicenter trial of inpatient treatment, initially employing intravenous cefoxitin and doxycycline compared with outpatient treatment consisting of a single intramuscular injection of cefoxitin and oral doxycycline. Comparisons between treatment groups during a mean of 84 months of follow-up were made for pregnancies, live births, time to pregnancy, infertility, PID recurrence, chronic pelvic pain, and ectopic pregnancy.

Results

Outpatient treatment assignment did not adversely impact the proportion of women having one or more pregnancies, live births, or ectopic pregnancies during follow-up; time to pregnancy; infertility; PID recurrence; or chronic pelvic pain among women of various races; with or without previous PID; with or without baseline Neisseria gonorrhoeae and/or Chlamydia trachomatis infection; and with or without high temperature/white blood cell count/pelvic tenderness score. This was true even in teenagers and women without a previous live birth. Ectopic pregnancies were more common in the outpatient than the inpatient treatment group, but because these were so rare, the difference did not reach statistical significance (5 versus 1, odds ratio 4.91, 95% confidence interval 0.57–42.25).

Conclusion

Among all women and subgroups of women with mild-to-moderate PID, there were no differences in reproductive outcomes after randomization to inpatient or outpatient treatment.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) with an intrauterine device (IUD) — removal versus retention evidence: Treatment outcomes do not generally differ between patients with PID who retain the IUD and those who have the IUD removed, and appropriate antibiotic treatment and close clinical follow-up are necessary; a systematic review identified four studies of Cu-IUDs or other nonhormonal IUDs comparing removal versus retention. Findings included one RCT where removal led to longer hospitalizations without differences in PID recurrences or subsequent pregnancies, another RCT with no differences in laboratory findings, a prospective cohort with no differences in clinical or laboratory findings but longer hospitalizations in the removal group, and one RCT where the rate of recovery for most clinical signs and symptoms was higher with removal; no evidence was found regarding women using LNG-IUDs (level of evidence: I to II, fair, direct).

### Updated French guidelines for diagnosis and management of pelvic inflammatory disease [^113dpQmR]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is commonly encountered in clinical practice.

Objectives

To provide up-to-date guidelines on management of PID.

Search Strategy

An initial search of the Cochrane database, PubMed, and Embase was performed using keywords related to PID to identify reports in any language published between January 1990 and January 2012, with an update in May 2015.

Selection Criteria

All identified reports relevant to the areas of focus were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

A level of evidence based on the quality of the data available was applied for each area of focus and used for the guidelines.

Main Results

PID must be suspected when spontaneous pelvic pain is associated with induced adnexal or uterine pain (grade C). Pelvic ultrasonography is necessary to exclude tubo-ovarian abscess (grade B). Microbiological diagnosis requires vaginal and endocervical sampling for molecular and bacteriological analysis (grade B). First-line treatment for uncomplicated PID combines ofloxacin and metronidazole for 14days (grade B). Treatment of tubo-ovarian abscess is based on drainage if the collection measures more than 3cm (grade B), with combined ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and doxycycline for 14–21days.

Conclusions

Current management of PID requires easily reproducible investigations and treatment, and thus can be applied worldwide.

### Identification and treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease and associated sequelae [^1179G1r5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an ascending polymicrobial infection of the upper female genital tract. The presentation of PID varies from asymptomatic cases to severe sepsis. The diagnosis of PID is often one of exclusion. Primary treatment for PID includes broad-spectrum antibiotics with coverage against gonorrhea, chlamydia, and common anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. If not clinically improved by antibiotics, percutaneous drain placement can promote efficient source control, as is often the case with large tubo-ovarian abscesses. Ultimately, even with treatment, PID can result in long-term morbidity, including chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy.

### Weighing potential benefits and harms of Mycoplasma genitalium testing and treatment approaches [^111m47AQ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review of the evidence was guided by 2 types of key questions (Table): informational questions outlining data published since the 2015 update to the CDC treatment guidelines and discussion questions outlining how the evidence should inform guidelines. We identified articles published in English since the 2015 treatment guidelines (January 1, 2015–November 30, 2021) by using the search terms mycoplasma AND genitalium OR M. genitalium to search PubMed. One investigator (L.E.M.) reviewed abstracts and manuscripts for inclusion. All authors verified included papers. In this article, we focus on new evidence on disease syndromes and antibiotic therapy and the implications for testing and treatment strategies.

### Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease: an abridged version of a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114Ecs8p]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Thirty-seven trials with 6348 women were included in the review. We found no clear evidence of a difference between any of the regimens studied in terms of effectiveness or safety. Within a sensitivity analysis of cases of mild-moderate PID for the comparison of macrolide (azithromycin) versus tetracycline (doxycycline), we identified a single study at low risk of bias which provided moderate-quality evidence that azithromycin was superior to doxycycline in achieving clinical cure. Some guidelines have recommended the use of nitroimidazoles for PID, but we found no conclusive evidence of a difference in outcomes between the use or not of nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) in successfully treating PID. There was also no clear evidence of a difference in rates of adverse effects between the regimens.

The applicability of the evidence to the target population (women of reproductive age diagnosed with PID) was broad because the included trials were conducted in different clinical settings and implemented varying diagnostic approaches. Additionally, the interventions analysed in the review are currently available and represent the most frequently used treatment regimens in current clinical practice. Given these factors, we consider that the evidence identified applies to a wide range of women with PID varying in disease severity, age, geographical location and diagnostic criteria, which provides external validity.

The trials included in this review cover a period of approximately 30 years and several countries, with 7 out of 37 studies being conducted after the year 2000. The searches for this review were last updated in July 2016 and new evidence may now be available. Considering the availability of additional studies, an update of this review is expected to take place in 2020. Little data are available on temporal variation in bacterial causes of PID because few countries systematically collect this information. Wide variations in the bacterial aetiology of PID may occur in different geographical areas and these may affect the choice of treatment, but few trials were carried out in low-income/middle-income countries. Although we consider that the results of this review are generalisable to a wide range of geographical locations, our conclusions may not be generalisable to low-income/middle-income countries.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease: current concepts in pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^112gPvQq]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is characterized by infection and inflammation of the upper genital tract in women and can cause significant reproductive health sequelae for women. Although a definitive diagnosis of PID is made by laparoscopic visualization of inflamed, purulent fallopian tubes, PID is generally a clinical diagnosis and thus represents a diagnostic challenge. Therefore, diagnosis and treatment algorithms advise a high index of suspicion for PID in any woman of reproductive age with pelvic or abdominal pain. Antibiotic therapy should be started early, and given for an adequate period of time to reduce the risk of complications. Coverage for anaerobic organisms should be considered in most cases.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease [^112vpstP]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2013). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pelvic inflammatory disease is caused by infection of the upper female genital tract and is often asymptomatic. Pelvic inflammatory disease is the most common gynaecological reason for admission to hospital in the US, and is diagnosed in approximately 1% of women aged 16 to 45 years consulting their GP in England and Wales.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: How do different antimicrobial regimens compare when treating women with confirmed pelvic inflammatory disease? What are the effects of routine antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease before intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD) insertion? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up to date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 13 RCTs or systematic reviews of RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (oral, parenteral, different durations, different regimens) and routine antibiotic prophylaxis (before intrauterine device insertion in women at high risk or low risk).

### Failure of cefoxitin and doxycycline to eradicate endometrial Mycoplasma genitalium and the consequence for clinical cure of pelvic inflammatory disease [^115J9wk9]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2008). Low credibility.

Recommended PID treatment regimens are based on clinical trial data demonstrating overall high rates of clinical cure. PID is well recognised though as having a polymicrobial aetiology, and not all microbial infections may respond equally well to the same antimicrobial. In our study of women with clinically suspected PID, we found M genitalium to be associated with endometritis and short-term PID treatment failure, as evidenced by persistent endometritis and continued pelvic pain. We conclude that cefoxitin and doxycycline, a Center for Disease Control recommended PID treatment regimen, is ineffective for the treatment of M genitalium upper genital tract infection.

### Pelvic pain and menstrual related illnesses [^115V1TZQ]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

When approaching the patient with acute pelvic pain, it is imperative to keep in mind the subtle differences each diagnosis can present with. Narrowing down pelvic pain to a specific location in the body while maintaining a high index of suspicion for acute pelvic pain emergencies will aid in a more rapid and accurate diagnosis. Bear in mind that acute pelvic pain is a clinical challenge, and although an exact diagnosis maybe elusive, emergency treatment should always be provided first and foremost despite an exact diagnosis.

### Clinical predictors of endometritis in women with symptoms and signs of pelvic inflammatory disease [^1125oUuJ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Careful detection and treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease are essential for the prevention of adverse sequelae. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic test characteristics of clinical criteria for the diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease.

Study Design

We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the baseline characteristics of 651 patients enrolled in a multicenter randomized treatment trial for pelvic inflammatory disease. Clinical and laboratory findings were recorded for all patients, and endometrial sampling was performed. We calculated sensitivity and specificity and performed receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and multivariate logistic regression, using histologic endometritis as the criterion standard.

Results

The minimal criteria for pelvic inflammatory disease, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had a sensitivity of 83%, in comparison with a 95% sensitivity for adnexal tenderness (P = 0.001). Of the supportive clinical criteria, the finding most highly associated with endometritis was a positive test result for Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae (adjusted odds ratio, 4.3; 95% confidence interval, 2.89–6.63). A multivariate logistic regression model indicated that combinations of criteria significantly improve the prediction of endometritis.

Conclusion

Sensitivity can be maximized by using the presence of adnexal tenderness as a minimal criterion for the diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease, and supportive criteria are helpful in estimating the probability of endometritis.

### Peri-implantation pelvic inflammatory disease with normal pregnancy outcome [^1124Sunj]. Fertility and Sterility (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To report on the presentation, diagnostic assessment, treatment, and outcome of a case of peri-implantation pelvic inflammatory disease.

Design

Case report.

Setting

Emergency department and gynecology ward of a tertiary university hospital.

Patient(S)

A 25-year-old multiparous woman in her 1st month of pregnancy.

Intervention(S)

Diagnostic laparoscopy, antibiotic therapy, and pregnancy surveillance.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Surveillance and outcome of pregnancy.

Result(S)

The patient presented with abdominal pain and fever 26 days after her last menstrual period. Examination revealed peritoneal irritation and cervical tenderness, with free fluid in the pelvis. Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed, with no evidence of ectopic pregnancy. A significant quantity of yellow purulent fluid was drained from the pelvis, which cultured for Escherichia coli. Antibiotic therapy yielded excellent response. The pregnancy continued, with no complications, to healthy term delivery.

Conclusion(S)

This rare diagnosis of peri-implantation pelvic inflammatory disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain in early pregnancy. Timely, rational treatment, including early pelvic drainage and appropriate antibiotic therapy, may save the pregnancy.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^111fVexF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Aerobic vaginitis (AV) — a condition with abnormal vaginal microbiota comprising aerobic enteric commensals or pathogens such as Group B Streptococcus (S. agalactiae), Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and S. aureus and variable inflammation — in shares decreased lactobacilli and increased pH with bacterial vaginosis (BV) but typically shows pH 6, no positive whiff test, a red and edematous vagina with small erosions or ulcerations, yellow‑green discharge, and dyspareunia. AV has been observed in 8%–11% of pregnant women and in 5%–24% of women reporting vaginal complaints. Diagnosis is made by reviewing vaginal discharge and Gram stain or phase contrast microscopy to visualize enteric bacilli and gram‑positive cocci, lack of lactobacilli, and presence of leucocytes and parabasal or immature epithelial cells; accurate distinction from BV is important because treatments differ.

### Tc-99m infecton scan in possible pelvic inflammatory disease [^115NwSx2]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Tc-99m Infecton imaging was used to examine patients thought to have pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) based on clinical and sonographic findings. Twenty-one patients with PID had Tc-99m Infecton scans. Eleven patients underwent a second radionuclide scan after 1 month of antibiotic treatment. The diagnosis of PID was confirmed by laparoscopy in one patient who was later found to have a tubercular infection. In the remaining patients, the diagnosis was based on uterine tenderness, fever and lower abdominal pain that responded to antibiotics, and ultrasound findings. These patients had infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes, the cul-de-sac, or all of these. The Tc-99m Infecton scan appears to be useful in the diagnosis of possible PID and is recommended after a complete course of antibiotics for monitoring treatment response.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease and tubo-ovarian abscess [^116m23m3]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is common infection among reproductive-aged women. The presentation ranges from acute severe illness to a more indolent and mild clinical picture. Attention has turned to subclinical PID as an important entity. The majority of the public health impact from PID comes from its attributable long-term sequelae, including tubal-factor infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. Tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) represents a severe form of PID. Vigilance is required when caring for women who have PID to detect the presence of a TOA given the serious nature of the infection and the potential need for procedural intervention.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^114AuA5A]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) laboratory testing and diagnosis — PID refers to acute and subclinical infection of the upper genital tract in females involving any or all of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries and includes any single or combination of endometritis, tuboovarian abscess, and salpingitis. PID has the highest incidence in ages 15–25 years and can be sexually transmitted (85% of cases) or naturally occurring (15%). Clinical diagnosis remains the most important practical approach, but finding symptoms on physical exam such as cervical motion tenderness and other criteria (elevated temperature or mucopurulent discharge) increases the predictive value of laboratory tests. Testing for CT/NG and consideration for syphilis and HIV are recommended in patients with PID as is a pregnancy test to rule out ectopic pregnancy in those with pelvic pain. Bacterial culture tests from specimens collected in a non-sterile manner (endocervical or dilation and curettage [D and C]) have limited utility in diagnosing PID.

Quality of the evidence

Most of the 37 included studies had unclear or high risk of bias in most domains, and only three were at low risk of bias in most domains. The overall quality of the evidence ranged from very low to high, the main limitations being serious risk of bias (due to poor reporting of study methods and lack of blinding), serious inconsistency and serious imprecision. The only high-quality evidence was for the sensitivity analysis regarding the use (or not) of nitroimidazole. There was moderate-quality evidence in the sensitivity analysis regarding the use of azithromycin in mild-moderate cases of PID, in comparisons between the use or not of nitroimidazole for curing mild-moderate or severe PID, and in comparisons between clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus cephalosporins for curing severe PID.

### Levonorgestrel (skyla) [^115hZd5J]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.4 Pelvic Infection

Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)

Skyla is contraindicated in the presence of known or suspected PID or in women with a history of PID unless there has been a subsequent intrauterine pregnancy [see Contraindications (4)]. IUDs have been associated with an increased risk of PID, most likely due to organisms being introduced into the uterus during insertion. In clinical trials, PID was observed in 0.4% of women overall and occurred more frequently within the first year and most often within the first month after insertion of Skyla.

Promptly examine users with complaints of lower abdominal or pelvic pain, odorous discharge, unexplained bleeding, fever, genital lesions or sores. Remove Skyla in cases of recurrent endometritis or pelvic inflammatory disease, or if an acute pelvic infection is severe or does not respond to treatment.

Women at increased risk for PID

PID is often associated with a sexually transmitted infection (STI), and Skyla does not protect against STI. The risk of PID is greater for women who have multiple sexual partners, and also for women whose sexual partner(s) have multiple sexual partners. Women who have had PID are at increased risk for a recurrence or re-infection. In particular, ascertain whether the woman is at increased risk of infection (for example, leukemia, acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS], intravenous drug abuse).

Subclinical PID

PID may be asymptomatic but still result in tubal damage and its sequelae.

Treatment of PID

Following a diagnosis of PID, or suspected PID, bacteriologic specimens should be obtained, and antibiotic therapy should be initiated promptly. Removal of Skyla after initiation of antibiotic therapy is usually appropriate.

Actinomycosis

Actinomycosis has been associated with IUDs. Remove Skyla from symptomatic women and treat with antibiotics. The significance of actinomyces-like organisms on Pap smear in an asymptomatic IUD user is unknown, and so this finding alone does not always require Skyla removal and treatment. When possible, confirm a Pap smear diagnosis with cultures.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease in the adolescent: understanding diagnosis and treatment as a health care provider [^111PArvN]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a common clinical syndrome with highest rates in adolescents, but no studies have singularly focused on this population in relationship to established guidelines for diagnosis and treatment. The study objective was to assess knowledge of diagnosis and treatment criteria for PID within an adolescent population and to compare factors associated with adherence to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines in outpatient settings.

Methods

Data were collected as part of a retrospective chart review of evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of sexually transmitted infections in adolescent women in an outpatient setting. Participant charts were eligible for review if they were 12 to 21 years of age and were given an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision/chart diagnosis of PID. Two primary outcome variables were utilized: meeting PID diagnosis guidelines (no/yes) and correct treatment for subject meeting criteria with guidelines (no/yes). The study controlled for race, age, medical venue, and current/past infection with gonorrhea/chlamydia.

Results

Subjects (n = 150) were examined for the primary outcome variables; 78% (117/150) met at least 1 criterion for PID diagnosis. Nearly 75% (111/150) had cervical motion tenderness, 34% (51/150) adnexal tenderness, and 5% (7/150) had uterine tenderness; nearly 11% (16/150) were positive for all 3 criteria. Symptoms associated with PID were compared for subjects meeting diagnosis criteria versus subjects not meeting diagnosis criteria: abdominal pain and vomiting were significantly associated with PID diagnosis at P < 0.05.

Conclusions

Our findings show that PID diagnosis/treatment often does not follow guidelines in the adolescent population. Pelvic inflammatory disease and cervicitis appear to be confused by providers in the diagnosis process, and educational tools may be necessary to increase the knowledge base of practitioners in regard to PID.

### Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease [^111sp7H5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) affects 4% to 12% of women of reproductive age. The main intervention for acute PID is broad-spectrum antibiotics administered intravenously, intramuscularly or orally. We assessed the optimal treatment regimen for PID. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic regimens to treat PID.

Search Methods

In January 2020, we searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Review Group's Specialized Register, which included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from 1944 to 2020, located through hand and electronic searching; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; Embase; four other databases; and abstracts in selected publications.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs comparing antibiotics with placebo or other antibiotics for the treatment of PID in women of reproductive age, either as inpatient or outpatient treatment. We limited our review to a comparison of drugs in current use that are recommended by the 2015 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for treatment of PID.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias and conducted GRADE assessments of the quality of evidence.

Main Results

We included 39 RCTs (6894 women) in this review, adding two new RCTs at this update. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to high, the main limitations being serious risk of bias (due to poor reporting of study methods and lack of blinding), serious inconsistency, and serious imprecision. None of the studies reported quinolones and cephalosporins, or the outcomes laparoscopic evidence of resolution of PID based on physician opinion or fertility outcomes. Length of stay results were insufficiently reported for analysis. Regimens containing azithromycin versus regimens containing doxycycline We are uncertain whether there was a clinically relevant difference between azithromycin and doxycycline in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.55; 2 RCTs, 243 women; I² = 72%; very low-quality evidence). The analyses may result in little or no difference between azithromycin and doxycycline in rates of severe PID (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.05; 1 RCT, 309 women; low-quality evidence), or adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.34; 3 RCTs, 552 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). In a sensitivity analysis limited to a single study at low risk of bias, azithromycin probably improves the rates of cure in mild-moderate PID (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.67; 133 women; moderate-quality evidence), compared to doxycycline. Regimens containing quinolone versus regimens containing cephalosporin The analysis shows there may be little or no clinically relevant difference between quinolones and cephalosporins in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.14; 4 RCTs, 772 women; I² = 15%; low-quality evidence), or severe PID (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.23; 2 RCTs, 313 women; I² = 7%; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether there was a difference between quinolones and cephalosporins in adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 2.24, 95% CI 0.52 to 9.72; 6 RCTs, 1085 women; I² = 0%; very low-quality evidence). Regimens with nitroimidazole versus regimens without nitroimidazole There was probably little or no difference between regimens with or without nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09; 6 RCTs, 2660 women; I² = 50%; moderate-quality evidence), or severe PID (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.01; 11 RCTs, 1383 women; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence). The evidence suggests that there was little to no difference in in adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.61; 17 studies, 4021 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). In a sensitivity analysis limited to studies at low risk of bias, there was little or no difference for rates of cure in mild-moderate PID (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.12; 3 RCTs, 1434 women; I² = 0%; high-quality evidence). Regimens containing clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus quinolone We are uncertain whether quinolone have little to no effect in rates of cure for mild-moderate PID compared to clindamycin plus aminoglycoside (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.13; 1 RCT, 25 women; very low-quality evidence). The analysis may result in little or no difference between quinolone vs. clindamycin plus aminoglycoside in severe PID (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.19; 2 studies, 151 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether quinolone reduces adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.72; 3 RCTs, 163 women; I² = 0%; very low-quality evidence). Regimens containing clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus regimens containing cephalosporin We are uncertain whether clindamycin plus aminoglycoside improves the rates of cure for mild-moderate PID compared to cephalosporin (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.09; 2 RCTs, 150 women; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). There was probably little or no difference in rates of cure in severe PID with clindamycin plus aminoglycoside compared to cephalosporin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.06; 10 RCTs, 959 women; I² = 21%; moderate-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether clindamycin plus aminoglycoside reduces adverse effects leading to discontinuation of treatment compared to cephalosporin (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.42; 10 RCTs, 1172 women; I² = 0%; very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain whether one treatment was safer or more effective than any other for the cure of mild-moderate or severe PID Based on a single study at a low risk of bias, a macrolide (azithromycin) probably improves the rates of cure of mild-moderate PID, compared to tetracycline (doxycycline).

Tubo‑ovarian abscess

Infection and destruction of adnexal structures result in a TOA. Imaging findings typically reveal a multilocular complex cystic mass in the adnexa with thick walls, showing hyperaemia on US and uniform enhancement on both CT and MRI (Fig. 2). Associated free peritoneal fluid, surrounding pelvic inflammation, fat stranding and enhancement are common. The complex mass can be difficult to differentiate from an ovarian malignancy, but a dilated fallopian tube and restricted diffusion on DWI sequences suggest infection.

Fig. 2
Surgically confirmed tubo-ovarian abscess in two different patients. a, b Middle-aged woman with lower abdominal pain, fever and vaginal discharge. a Transabdominal grey-scale ultrasound shows a large cystic complex mass representing a tubo-ovarian complex with echogenic content consistent with pus. b Microflow ultrasound imaging demonstrates peripheral vascularity in the walls of the cystic lesion without internal vascularity in keeping with the cystic nature of the mass. c – e Young woman with pelvic pain and raised inflammatory markers. Consecutive axial (a, b) and coronal (c) CECT images, venous phase, show bilateral pyosalpinx (dotted arrows) and a right ovarian abscess (asterisk). Note the fat stranding around the fallopian tubes (arrows) and the markedly thickened uterosacral ligaments (arrowheads)

Peritonitis

Pyometra, pyosalpinx, and TOA can cause peritonitis when an abscess ruptures or pus leaks from the infected organ, but it can also be seen in the absence of such complications.

Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome (perihepatitis)

In this rare complication, peritoneal spread to the liver capsule results in sharp right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain. CT findings include enhancement and thickening of the anterior liver capsule, geographic areas of variable perfusion in subcapsular and periportal areas, fluid and fat stranding extending from the pelvis into the RUQ, and gallbladder wall thickening.

Atypical PID forms

PID can uncommonly progress to involve other pelvic organs such as the bladder, urethra, or bowel. In addition to typical organisms, two further organisms should be considered, especially in unusual or extensive cases: Actinomycosis is suggested when there is extension across tissue planes and fistula formation in the presence of an IUD. Tuberculosis can cause pyosalpinx, endometritis, and peritoneal thickening with deposits that can mimic peritoneal carcinomatosis.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: tubo-ovarian abscess [^116tHkzM]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) is a rare but serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity and even mortality.

Objective

This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of TOA, including diagnosis, initial resuscitation, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on current evidence.

Discussion

TOA is associated with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) as well as intrauterine devices, uterine procedures, multiple sexual partners, diabetes mellitus, and immunocompromised states. While usually arising from a gynecologic infection, TOA can be associated with a gastrointestinal source. History and physical examination are limited, demonstrating predominantly lower abdominal pain, but a minority of patients will present with vaginal symptoms. Half of patients will exhibit systemic illness to include fever, nausea, and vomiting. Laboratory evaluation may reveal elevations in white blood cell count and other inflammatory markers. Transvaginal ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) may be utilized for diagnosis, though CT has higher sensitivity and can differentiate this disease from similarly presenting gastrointestinal pathology. Initial medical management includes antibiotics. Surgical intervention is indicated in those who fail initial medical therapy, which is more likely in those with bilateral abscesses, large abscesses, and older patients.

Conclusions

An understanding of TOA can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this potentially deadly disease.

Follow-up

Overall, 94% (2377/2529) of the women were followed up after 12 months. Nearly half (47%, 1108) replied by email, 32% (n = 760) by postal questionnaire, 8% (n = 199) by telephone, and 13% (n = 310) were followed up by questionnaire to their general practitioner. The 152 women lost to follow-up were younger (mean age 20.0 years (SD 2.5) v 21.0 (SD 2.8); P < 0.01) and more likely to be of black ethnicity (46% (68/149) v 26% (620/2363); P < 0.01) than the remainder. Table 2gives details of the 396 women who were selected, on the basis of questionnaire responses, for more detailed assessment and search of medical records.

### Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease: an abridged version of a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111KPGem]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We found no evidence that one regimen is more effective or safer than any other for the treatment of PID, and there is no clear evidence that the addition of nitroimidazoles is beneficial. Adherence to clinical treatment for PID is an important issue that should be considered when choosing a treatment regimen. Moderate-quality evidence from a single study at low risk of bias suggests that a macrolide (azithromycin) may be more effective than a tetracycline (doxycycline) for curing mild-moderate PID. There remains a need for high-quality RCTs to assess treatments for women with PID, particularly comparing regimens with or without the addition of nitroimidazoles and comparing azithromycin (eg, 1 g once a week for 2 weeks) with doxycycline. The lack of a consistent outcome measure to assess response to therapy is a major limitation, and there is a clear need for core outcome measures to be developed.

Key messages

There is no clear evidence that any one of the currently recommended treatment regimens for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is superior to another.
There is no evidence of improved efficacy when metronidazole is included within a treatment regimen, although this is currently recommended in some guidelines.
There is a need for better understanding of the role of azithromycin in the treatment of PID, given uncertainty about its efficacy compared with doxycycline and concerns about inducing antimicrobial resistance.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease [^112NwNBr]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pelvic inflammatory disease is caused by infection of the upper female genital tract and is often asymptomatic. Pelvic inflammatory disease is the most common gynaecological reason for admission to hospital in the USA and is diagnosed in almost 2% of women aged 16–45 years consulting their GP in England and Wales.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of empirical treatment compared with treatment delayed until the results of microbiological investigations are known? How do different antimicrobial regimens compare? What are the effects of routine antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease before intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD)8 insertion? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to May 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 9 systematic reviews, RCTs or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (oral, parenteral, empirical treatment, treatment guided by test results, different durations, outpatient, inpatient), and routine antibiotic prophylaxis (before intrauterine device insertion in women at high risk or low risk).

A 43-year-old woman with a history of bilateral tubal ligation and bilateral ovarian cysts presented to our hospital with progressively worsening right lower quadrant pain and abdominal distension. Her exam findings of vaginal discharge and cervical motion tenderness, in combination with her marked leucocytosis, were suggestive of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PCR for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae was negative, however, our patient's blood cultures grew group A Streptococcus This exceptionally severe presentation of PID, in combination with uncommon laboratory findings, led to complex multidisciplinary clinical decision making guided by extensive literature review. Here, we present a rare case of group A Streptococcus PID after bilateral tubal ligation, and highlight the role of a family medicine primary team in the medical and surgical management of a complex case at a community hospital.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^114ErhCQ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary

These guidelines for the treatment of persons who have or are at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) were updated by CDC after consultation with professionals knowledgeable in the field of STIs who met in Atlanta, Georgia, June 11–14, 2019. The information in this report updates the 2015 guidelines. These guidelines discuss 1) updated recommendations for treatment of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Trichomonas vaginalis; 2) addition of metronidazole to the recommended treatment regimen for pelvic inflammatory disease; 3) alternative treatment options for bacterial vaginosis; 4) management of Mycoplasma genitalium; 5) human papillomavirus vaccine recommendations and counseling messages; 6) expanded risk factors for syphilis testing among pregnant women; 7) one-time testing for hepatitis C infection; 8) evaluation of men who have sex with men after sexual assault; and 9) two-step testing for serologic diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus. Physicians and other health care providers can use these guidelines to assist in prevention and treatment of STIs.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease: how should it be managed? [^116DUgQF]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the published literature on pelvic inflammatory disease over the past year and put into context the major findings.

Recent Findings

remains the commonest identified cause of pelvic inflammatory disease, and yet our understanding of how it causes mucosal damage and the factors explaining why only a subgroup of women develop pelvic inflammatory disease are not known. The increasing evidence for a chlamydial toxin may help to explain how tissue damage occurs and the indolent nature of many chlamydial infections. The evidence for as an important sexually transmitted cause of pelvic inflammatory disease is growing, with implications for treatment regimens and diagnostic testing. Power Doppler ultrasound has been reported to be both sensitive and specific in diagnosing pelvic inflammatory disease, although larger studies are needed to confirm these early results. Outpatient treatment with cefoxitin and doxycycline appears to be as effective when given in an outpatient setting compared with inpatient management with the same agents in a large randomized controlled trial with almost 3 years' follow-up.

Summary

There remain many gaps in our knowledge of pelvic inflammatory disease, but the reviewed studies increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of infection, and offer the possibility of better diagnosis and reassurance about the long-term success of antibiotic treatment.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^115GfmCT]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Episodes of PID often go unrecognized. Although certain cases are asymptomatic, others are not diagnosed because the patient or the health care provider do not recognize the implications of mild or nonspecific symptoms or signs (e.g. abnormal bleeding, dyspareunia, and vaginal discharge). Even women with mild or asymptomatic PID might be at risk for infertility. Because of the difficulty of diagnosis and the potential for damage to the reproductive health of women, health care providers should maintain a low threshold for the clinical diagnosis of PID. The recommendations for diagnosing PID are intended to assist health care providers to recognize when PID should be suspected and when additional information should be obtained to increase diagnostic certainty. Diagnosis and management of other causes of lower abdominal pain (e.g. ectopic pregnancy, acute appendicitis, ovarian cyst, ovarian torsion, or functional pain) are unlikely to be impaired by initiating antimicrobial therapy for PID. Presumptive treatment for PID should be initiated for sexually active young women and other women at risk for STIs if they are experiencing pelvic or lower abdominal pain, if no cause for the illness other than PID can be identified, or if one or more of the following three minimum clinical criteria are present on pelvic examination: cervical motion tenderness, uterine tenderness, or adnexal tenderness.

More specific criteria for diagnosing PID include endometrial biopsy with histopathologic evidence of endometritis; transvaginal sonography or magnetic resonance imaging techniques demonstrating thickened, fluid-filled tubes with or without free pelvic fluid or tubo-ovarian complex, or Doppler studies indicating pelvic infection (e.g. tubal hyperemia); and laparoscopic findings consistent with PID. A diagnostic evaluation that includes some of these more extensive procedures might be warranted in certain cases. Endometrial biopsy is warranted for women undergoing laparoscopy who do not have visual evidence of salpingitis because endometritis is the only sign of PID for certain women.

Requiring that all three minimum criteria be present before the initiation of empiric treatment can result in insufficient sensitivity for a PID diagnosis. After deciding whether to initiate empiric treatment, clinicians should also consider the risk profile for STIs. More elaborate diagnostic evaluation frequently is needed because incorrect diagnosis and management of PID might cause unnecessary morbidity. For example, the presence of signs of lower genital tract inflammation (predominance of leukocytes in vaginal secretions, cervical discharge, or cervical friability), in addition to one of the three minimum criteria, increases the specificity of the diagnosis. One or more of the following additional criteria can be used to enhance the specificity of the minimum clinical criteria and support a PID diagnosis:

### Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease: an abridged version of a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114aVb5N]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcomes were clinical cure according to the criteria defined by the treating physician (eg, resolution or improvement of signs and symptoms related to PID) and antibiotic-related adverse events leading to discontinuation of therapy. For secondary outcomes, please see the full Cochrane systematic review.

Where studies included women with various types of pelvic infection, we considered only women with endometritis, salpingitis, parametritis or oophoritis (not related to labour, delivery, cancer or surgery). Where studies reported multiple time points, we included outcomes at between 14 and 28 days after initiation of treatment.

Data extraction

Data from each study were extracted independently by two of the three review authors (SF, DGF, RVD) using a data extraction form that the review authors designed and pilot-tested. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by consulting a fourth review author (JR or RFS). If a study had more than two intervention arms, we included or combined only those that met the predefined inclusion criteria. Where studies had multiple publications, we used the main trial report as the reference and derived additional details from secondary papers. We corresponded with study investigators for further data as required.

Quality of evidence

For each included trial, three review authors (SF, DGF, RVD) independently assessed the risk of bias using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane guidelines. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or by involving a third review author (JR or RFS).

Two reviewers (SF, RFS) independently assessed and graded the evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Disagreements were resolved by discussion or by involving a third review author (JR). The GRADE tables are available in the full Cochrane review.

### Concerns regarding the centers for disease control's published guidelines for pelvic inflammatory disease [^111U5c65]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The International-Infectious Disease Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology-USA (I-IDSOG-USA) has concerns about the most recently published Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). I-IDSOG-USA advocates the following changes when the guidelines are revised. We recommend the use of the term "upper genital tract infection" (UGTI), followed by the designation of the etiologic agent, instead of the currently employed term, "pelvic inflammatory disease", or PID. In diagnoses, there should be greater emphasis on signs and symptoms related to subclinical or occult UGTI. Therapeutic recommendation for the treatment of UGTI should be documented for various stages of this diverse disease entity. There should be greater emphasis on hospitalization for infected nulligravida teenagers. This permits monitoring of antibiotic treatment and provides a site for medical educational efforts to teach this medically underserved segment of our society how to protect their future fertility, their health, and their lives.

### Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease: an abridged version of a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114e7zy3]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women is described as an inflammation of the upper genital tract and surrounding structures as a result of ascending infection from the lower genital tract — bacteria spread directly from the cervix to the endometrium and on to the upper genital tract. The signs and symptoms of PID are not specific and may range from asymptomatic to abdominal pain/tenderness, fever, vomiting, dyspareunia and menorrhagia.

The incidence of PID in the UK has been estimated to range between 1.1% and 1.7% among women between 16 and 46 years old. Among women with PID, 10%–20% may become infertile, 40% will develop chronic pelvic pain, and 10% of those who conceive will have an ectopic pregnancy. The cost of pelvic infection has been estimated to exceed US$2.4 billion in the USA, and the mean total cost per episode managed as an outpatient is around US$700. In the UK, the mean cost of an uncomplicated episode of PID is £163, considering an average of two outpatient appointments per woman across all settings.

PID requires effective treatment to reduce the incidence of chronic pelvic pain, infertility and ectopic pregnancy. The main intervention for treating acute PID is the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics which cover Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and anaerobic bacteria, but the optimal treatment strategy is unclear. A variety of antibiotic regimens and routes of administration (intravenous, intramuscular or oral) have been used, with marked geographical variation. Current practice generally involves the use of multiple agents to provide broad antimicrobial cover, but the best combination of agents is unknown. Guidelines have been produced in the USA, and in Europe, to guide therapy, but these have not been based on a systematic review. The authors of the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and International Union against Sexually Transmitted Infections (IUSTI) guidelines state that there is limited evidence for the need to eradicate anaerobes or for the use of alternative regimens, such as azithromycin.

The current review is an abridged version of a Cochrane systematic review and presents the main findings from the primary outcomes and an enhanced discussion section. This review addresses clinical questions raised in the current guidelines on the treatment of PIDregarding the effectiveness and safety of nitroimidazole, the relative benefits of azithromycin versus doxycycline, the use of quinolones, and the relative benefits of cephalosporins compared with clindamycin plus aminoglycoside, to inform future guideline development and clinical practice.

### Fitz-hugh-curtis syndrome lacking typical characteristics of pelvic inflammatory disease [^115reNU4]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

A 23-year-old Japanese woman, previously a commercial sex worker, presented with a 2-day history of right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain, worse on deep inspiration. She had noticed increased vaginal discharge 2months earlier and had developed dull, lower abdominal pain 3weeks prior to presentation. Although pelvic examination and transvaginal ultrasonography revealed neither a tubal nor ovarian pathology, abdominal CT scan with contrast demonstrated early enhancement of the hepatic capsule, a finding pathognomonic for Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome (FHCS). Cervical discharge PCR assay confirmed Chlamydia trachomatis infection. This case highlights that normal gynaecological evaluation may be insufficient to rule out FHCS, for which physicians should have a high index of suspicion when seeing any woman of reproductive age with RUQ pain.

### Role of bedside transvaginal ultrasonography in the diagnosis of tubo-ovarian abscess in the emergency department [^116CGQzW]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Tubo-ovarian Abscess (TOA) is a complication of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) requiring admission, i.v. antibiotics and, possibly, aspiration or surgery. The purpose of this study was to describe the role of emergency department (ED) bedside transvaginal ultrasonography (US) in the diagnosis of TOA. This was a retrospective review of non-pregnant ED patients presenting with pelvic pain who were diagnosed with TOA using bedside transvaginal US. ED US examinations were performed by emergency medicine residents and ultrasound-credentialed attending physicians within 1 h after clinical assessment. ED US logs were reviewed for the diagnosis of TOA. Medical records were reviewed for risk factors, medical and sexual history, physical examination findings, laboratory results, additional diagnostic testing, hospital course, and a discharge diagnosis of TOA by the admitting gynecology service. A total of 20 patients with TOA were identified over a 3-year period. Ages ranged from 14 to 45 years (mean 27 years). Seven (35%) patients reported a prior history of PID or sexually transmitted disease, and 1 (5%) was febrile. All had lower abdominal tenderness and 9 (45%) had cervical motion or adnexal tenderness. The sonographic abnormalities included 14 (70%) with a complex adnexal mass, 5 (25%) with echogenic fluid in the cul-de-sac, and 3 (15%) patients with pyosalpinx. The discharge diagnosis was TOA by the admitting gynecology service for all patients. Our study illustrates the limitations of clinical criteria in diagnosing TOA and supports the use of bedside US when evaluating patients with pelvic pain and symptoms that do not meet classic Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for PID.

Cervicitis and endometritis

Both represent early manifestations of PID. In cervicitis, the cervix may be enlarged and hyperaemic on US, with an enhancing endocervical canal and parametrial fat stranding and free fluid on CT/MRI. Endometritis can occur in PID, during the peripartum period, and after gynaecological procedures. Findings of a thickened heterogenous endometrium on US, abnormal endometrial enhancement relative to the inner myometrium on CT/MR, and fluid within the cavity suggest endometritis. The uterine border may be indistinct from parametrial tissue. Uterine empyema (pyometra) is characterised by complex fluid in the uterine cavity containing gas or air-fluid levels.

Salpingitis, tubal empyema (pyosalpinx)

In salpingitis, the fallopian tube is swollen (> 5 mm diameter) and thickened. In pyosalpinx, pus distends the lumen (echogenic on US) and the mural thickening is hyperaemic on Doppler US, enhancing on CT (Fig. 1). CT may show surrounding pelvic inflammation, including uterosacral ligament thickening and para-aortic lymphadenopathy. CT-multiplanar reconstruction helps identify the tubular contour, while MRI additionally differentiates pyosalpinx from haematosalpinx by the presence of intratubal blood products. In pyosalpinx, there is tubal wall thickening, enhancement and inflammation. On DWI, restricted diffusion suggests pyosalpinx, while unrestricted diffusion suggests hydrosalpinx.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease: diagnosis, management, and prevention [^112c1uL7]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the upper genital tract occurring predominantly in sexually active young women. Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are common causes; however, other cervical, enteric, bacterial vaginosis-associated, and respiratory pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, may be involved. PID can be acute, chronic, or subclinical and is often underdiagnosed. Untreated PID can lead to chronic pelvic pain, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and intra-abdominal infections. The diagnosis is made primarily on clinical suspicion, and empiric treatment is recommended in sexually active young women or women at risk for sexually transmitted infections who have unexplained lower abdominal or pelvic pain and cervical motion, uterine, or adnexal tenderness on examination. Mild to moderate disease can be treated in an outpatient setting with a single intramuscular injection of a recommended cephalosporin followed by oral doxycycline for 14 days. Additionally, metronidazole is recommended for 14 days in the setting of bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, or recent uterine instrumentation. Hospitalization for parenteral antibiotics is recommended in patients who are pregnant or severely ill, in whom outpatient treatment has failed, those with tubo-ovarian abscess, or if surgical emergencies cannot be excluded. Treatment does not change in patients with intrauterine devices or those with HIV. Sex partner treatment is recommended; expedited partner treatment is recommended where legal. Prevention of PID includes screening for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae in all women younger than 25 years and those who are at risk or pregnant, plus intensive behavioral counseling for all adolescents and adults at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections.

### Antibiotic therapy for pelvic inflammatory disease: an abridged version of a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113XwHzX]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic regimens used to treat pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

Design

This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Risk of bias was assessed using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane guidelines. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation.

Data Sources

Eight electronic databases were searched from date of inception up to July 2016. Database searches were complemented by screening of reference lists of relevant studies, trial registers, conference proceeding abstracts and grey literature.

Eligibility Criteria

RCTs comparing the use of antibiotics with placebo or other antibiotics for the treatment of PID in women of reproductive age, either as inpatient or outpatient treatment.

Results

We included 37 RCTs (6348 women). The quality of evidence ranged from very low to high, the main limitations being serious risk of bias (due to poor reporting of study methods and lack of blinding), serious inconsistency and serious imprecision. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the rates of cure for mild-moderate or for severe PID for the comparisons of azithromycin versus doxycycline, quinolone versus cephalosporin, nitroimidazole versus no use of nitroimidazole, clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus quinolone, or clindamycin plus aminoglycoside versus cephalosporin. No clear evidence of a difference between regimens in antibiotic-related adverse events leading to discontinuation of therapy was observed.

Conclusions

We found no conclusive evidence that one regimen of antibiotics was safer or more effective than any other for the treatment of PID, and there was no clear evidence for the use of nitroimidazoles (metronidazole) compared with the use of other drugs with activity against anaerobes. More evidence is needed to assess treatments for women with PID, particularly comparing regimens with or without the addition of nitroimidazoles and the efficacy of azithromycin compared with doxycycline.

### Primary fallopian tube carcinoma: review of MR imaging findings [^116EsZKG]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation

The aetiology of this type of tumour has not been completely explained. Hormonal, reproductive, and genetic factors may play a role, along with the presence of chronic inflammation of the pelvis.

PFTC may have a constellation of characteristic symptoms, namely colicky abdominal or pelvic pain and adnexal mass, relieved by intermittent, profuse, serosanguineous vaginal discharge, which constitute Laztko's triad (seen in only 15% of patients). Hydrops tubae profluens is a syndrome characterized by the relief of pain and shrinkage of the abdominal or pelvic mass by a vaginal discharge, which is caused by filling and emptying of a sub-occluded fallopian tube (seen in only 5% of patients). Typical symptoms, however, occur in only a minority of patients with PFTC, and most women present with less specific symptoms at the time of diagnosis. The age of presentation is commonly between 40 and 60 years, with a mean age of 55 years. The pre-operative diagnosis of PFTC is rarely performed, with clinical signs and symptoms pointing towards the more frequently occurring ovarian cancer or pelvic inflammatory disease. Tumour markers, particularly CA-125, have no role in the diagnosis of PFTC. Elevated CA-125 levels are, nevertheless, indicative of poor prognosis, and can be used during follow-up, as a marker of disease recurrence.

PFTC should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with postmenopausal bleeding with negative diagnostic curettage, cervical smear with intermittent suspicious abnormalities, and unexplained persistent vaginal discharge.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease: multimodality imaging approach with clinical-pathologic correlation [^113rH9K8]. Radiographics (2016). Low credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a common medical problem, with almost 1 million cases diagnosed annually. Historically, PID has been a clinical diagnosis supplemented with the findings from ultrasonography (US) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. However, the diagnosis of PID can be challenging because the clinical manifestations may mimic those of other pelvic and abdominal processes. Given the nonspecific clinical manifestations, computed tomography (CT) is commonly the first imaging examination performed. General CT findings of early- and late-stage PID include thickening of the uterosacral ligaments, pelvic fat stranding with obscuration of fascial planes, reactive lymphadenopathy, and pelvic free fluid. Recognition of these findings, as well as those seen with cervicitis, endometritis, acute salpingitis, oophoritis, pyosalpinx, hydrosalpinx, tubo-ovarian abscess, and pyometra, is crucial in allowing prompt and accurate diagnosis. Late complications of PID include tubal damage resulting in infertility and ectopic pregnancy, peritonitis caused by uterine and/or tubo-ovarian abscess rupture, development of peritoneal adhesions resulting in bowel obstruction and/or hydroureteronephrosis, right upper abdominal inflammation (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome), and septic thrombophlebitis. Recognition of these late manifestations at CT can also aid in proper patient management. At CT, careful assessment of common PID mimics, such as endometriosis, adnexal torsion, ruptured hemorrhagic ovarian cyst, adnexal neoplasms, appendicitis, and diverticulitis, is important to avoid misinterpretation, delay in management, and unnecessary surgery. Correlation with the findings from complementary imaging examinations, such as US and MR imaging, is useful for establishing a definitive diagnosis. (©)RSNA, 2016.

### Of unclear origin causing pelvic inflammatory disease and toxic shock syndrome in a previously healthy young woman [^116nkuXc]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 22-year-old woman presented to the emergency room with right lower abdominal pain. A CT scan suggested potential appendicitis and perforation. She had no relevant medical or surgical history, and she last had vaginal sex 4 years prior to admission. During surgery, turbid fluid, secondary inflammatory changes, and dilated, fluid-filled fallopian tubes pointed to a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), so she was started on azithromycin, metronidazole and piperacillin/tazobactam. The following day, she continued to have abdominal pain and developed tachycardia, hypotension, a marked leukemoid response, haemoconcentration, third space fluid accumulation and acidosis. Culture results led to her being further diagnosed with Clostridium perfringens PID with peritonitis and toxic shock syndrome. A gynaecological infection of C. perfringens leading to toxic shock syndrome is both extremely rare and highly fatal. Her antibiotics were changed to meropenem and clindamycin, and she slowly made a full recovery.

Methods

We used Cochrane methodology, following our published protocol.

Methods for identification of studies

We searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Review Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE Daily Update, Embase, LILACS and Web of Science up to July 2016. The complete search strategy is available in the Cochrane review. We screened the reference lists of all identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and previous systematic reviews on similar topics for additional relevant articles. Furthermore, we searched trial registers, conference proceeding abstracts and grey literature. We contacted the authors of all RCTs identified by other methods, as well as pharmaceutical companies producing 'antibiotic therapy' for 'pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)'.

Types of studies

We included RCTs, including those which did not describe their method of randomisation (ie, where the authors stated that treatment was randomised without providing further details). Trials were included irrespective of publication status, publication year or language. We excluded quasi-randomised trials because they produce effects estimates indicating more extreme benefits when compared with RCTs. We also excluded cross-over and cluster trials.

Selection of studies

Two review authors (DGF and RVD) performed an initial screen of titles and abstracts retrieved by the search, and we retrieved the full text of all potentially eligible studies. Two review authors (DGF and RVD) independently examined these studies for compliance with the inclusion criteria and selected studies that met these criteria. Disagreements regarding eligibility were resolved by discussion or by consulting a third review author (JR).

Inclusion criteria

RCTs were included in the review if the women participating in the trial were of reproductive age (14 years of age or older) diagnosed as having acute PID (symptoms for less than 6 weeks) based on clinical findings, laparoscopy, endometrial biopsy, or detectable N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis in the upper genital tract. We limited our review to comparison of drugs in current use that are recommended for consideration by the 2015 CDC guidelines for treatment of PID.

Treatment

PID treatment regimens should provide empiric, broad-spectrum coverage of likely pathogens. Multiple parenteral and oral antimicrobial regimens have been effective in achieving clinical and microbiologic cure in randomized clinical trials with short-term follow-up. However, only a limited number of studies have assessed and compared these regimens with regard to infection elimination in the endometrium and fallopian tubes or determined the incidence of long-term complications (e.g. tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy) after antimicrobial regimens. The optimal treatment regimen and long-term outcome of early treatment of women with subclinical PID are unknown. All regimens used to treat PID should also be effective against N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis because negative endocervical screening for these organisms does not rule out upper genital tract infection. Anaerobic bacteria have been isolated from the upper genital tract of women who have PID, and data from in vitro studies have revealed that some anaerobes (e.g. Bacteroides fragilis) can cause tubal and epithelial destruction. BV is often present among women who have PID. Addition of metronidazole to IM or oral PID regimens more effectively eradicates anaerobic organisms from the upper genital tract. Until treatment regimens that do not cover anaerobic microbes have been demonstrated to prevent long-term sequelae (e.g. infertility and ectopic pregnancy) as successfully as the regimens that are effective against these microbes, using regimens with anaerobic activity should be considered. Treatment should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made because prevention of long-term sequelae is dependent on early administration of recommended antimicrobials. For women with PID of mild or moderate clinical severity, parenteral and oral regimens appear to have similar efficacy. The decision of whether hospitalization is necessary should be based on provider judgment and whether the woman meets any of the following criteria:

Surgical emergencies (e.g. appendicitis) cannot be excluded
Tubo-ovarian abscess
Pregnancy
Severe illness, nausea and vomiting, or oral temperature > 38.5°C (101°F)
Unable to follow or tolerate an outpatient oral regimen
No clinical response to oral antimicrobial therapy

No evidence is available to indicate that adolescents have improved outcomes from hospitalization for treatment of PID, and the clinical response to outpatient treatment is similar among younger and older women. The decision to hospitalize adolescents with acute PID should be based on the same criteria used for older women.

Pelvic inflammatory disease

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the upper part of the female reproductive genital tract, including the uterus, fallopian tubes, and adjacent pelvic structures and may spread to the abdomen causing peritonitis, caused by bacterial infection spreading from the vagina and cervix. Occasionally, right-upper quadrant pain suggestive of inflammation and adhesion formation in the liver capsule (Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome) can accompany pelvic inflammatory disease.

The sexually transmitted Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis are present in many cases; however, microorganisms including the endogenous vaginal and cervical flora may also cause PID. Genital tract mycoplasmas, most importantly Mycoplasma genitalium, have recently also been implicated as a cause of acute PID. The global epidemiologic profile of pelvic inflammatory disease has not been well defined. Due to financial and logistic reasons, pelvic inflammatory disease prevention programs that are based on screening are simply unavailable in most countries, where the burden of pelvic inflammatory disease may be the greatest.

Patients with tubo-ovarian abscess that does not respond to antibiotics should undergo surgical drainage (Recommendation 1C).

Tubo-ovarian abscesses (TOA) may be a complication of PID. In women of reproductive age, TOA is one of the most common types of pelvic abscess. TOA are classically treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, if antibiotic therapy is not sufficient, surgical drainage should be performed.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) before abortion — We recommend against screening for bacterial vaginosis (BV) before abortion (GRADE 1C). Symptomatic patients with BV should be treated, and abortion should not be delayed while awaiting treatment. BV is common, with a prevalence of approximately 30% in reproductive-age, pregnant-capable persons globally, and is associated with increased risk for pelvic inflammatory disease (adjusted hazard ratio 1.53, 95% CI 1.05–2.21). Randomized trials of perioperative metronidazole or clindamycin showed no statistically significant differences in postabortion upper genital tract infection versus placebo when standard prophylactic antibiotics were provided; one study using treatment dosing with metronidazole 500 mg three times daily orally for 10 days starting 7 days before the abortion procedure significantly reduced the risk of developing PID postprocedure, but these patients did not receive universal prophylactic antibiotics before abortion.

### Sexually transmitted infections part 2: discharge syndromes and pelvic inflammatory disease [^115No2pv]. Pediatrics in Review (2020). Medium credibility.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) disproportionately affect young people, with more than half of the infections occurring in youth aged 15 to 25 years. (1)(2) This review, the second in a 2-part series on STIs, focuses on infections that may cause abnormal vaginal or penile discharge, including trichomonas, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Most infected persons, however, are asymptomatic. Nucleic acid amplification tests are the most sensitive and specific for the detection of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis, and they can be performed on provider- or patient-collected swabs. Providers should have a low threshold for diagnosing and treating PID because untreated PID can have serious long-term complications for young women. Indications for hospitalization for PID include the presence of a tubo-ovarian abscess, severe illness with systemic symptoms, pregnancy, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and failure to respond to outpatient oral treatment (within 48–72 hours) or inability to tolerate the oral treatment.

Intramuscular or Oral Treatment

IM or oral therapy can be considered for women with mild-to-moderate acute PID because the clinical outcomes among women treated with these regimens are similar to those treated with IV therapy. Women who do not respond to IM or oral therapy within 72 hours should be reevaluated to confirm the diagnosis and be administered therapy IV.

Recommended Intramuscular or Oral Regimens for Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
Ceftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days with metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days
or
Cefoxitin 2 g IM in a single dose and probenecid 1 g orally administered concurrently in a single dose
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days with metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days
or
Other parenteral third-generation cephalosporin (e.g. ceftizoxime or cefotaxime)
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days with metronidazole 500 mg orally 2 times/day for 14 days
* For persons weighing ≥ 150 kg, 1 g of ceftriaxone should be administered.

These regimens provide coverage against frequent etiologic agents of PID; however, the optimal choice of a cephalosporin is unclear. Cefoxitin, a second-generation cephalosporin, has better anaerobic coverage than ceftriaxone, and, in combination with probenecid and doxycycline, has been effective in short-term clinical response among women with PID. Ceftriaxone has better coverage against N. gonorrhoeae. The addition of metronidazole to these regimens provides extended coverage against anaerobic organisms and will also effectively treat BV, which is frequently associated with PID.

Data synthesis and analysis

Data analyses were performed using Review Manager V.5.3. A fixed-effect meta-analysis was used for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that trials were estimating the same underlying treatment effect (ie, where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials' populations and methods were sufficiently similar). We conducted separate analyses for mild-moderate and severe PID based on the CDC criteria. If there was clinical heterogeneity sufficient to expect that the underlying treatment effects differed between trials, or if substantial statistical heterogeneity was detected (I² = 40% or greater), a random-effects meta-analysis was planned to produce an overall summary if a mean treatment effect across trials was considered to be clinically meaningful. For random-effects analyses, the results are presented as the mean treatment effect with 95% CIs, and the estimates of the τ² and I² statistics.

For dichotomous data, the number of events in the control and intervention groups was used to calculate the Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios (RR). For the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial (NNTB) or harmful (NNTH) outcome, the recommendations given by Altman were followed. When we observed a treatment effect, we reported the NNTH or NNTB with 95% CIs. NNTB and NNTH are presented in the GRADE tables in the full Cochrane review. When possible, we performed analysis based on intention to treat (ITT). When information for an ITT analysis was not available, we used the results provided by the authors.

We undertook the following sensitivity analysis to investigate whether our conclusions were robust to methodological decisions made by the review authors:

### Familial mediterranean fever presenting as recurrent acute pelvic inflammatory disease [^116vUf6g]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent acute episodes of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) often present a diagnostic dilemma. The differential diagnosis should include reinfection, appendicitis, endometriosis, irritable bowel syndrome, colitis, persistent ovarian cyst, and antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains.

Case

NA young Palestinian woman presented with recurrent episodes of pelvic pain with rebound tenderness, fever, and elevated white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein. The patient underwent extensive workup, multiple courses of intravenous and oral antibiotics, and diagnostic laparoscopies, with continued recurrent episodes. Treatment with colchicine for suspected familial Mediterranean fever resulted in resolution of symptoms.

Conclusion

In patients of Mediterranean ancestry who have symptoms of recurrent PID that are refractory to conventional treatment, familial Mediterranean fever should be included in the differential diagnosis.

### The challenge of pelvic inflammatory disease [^1179pU9a]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the upper genital tract in women that can include endometritis, parametritis, salpingitis, oophoritis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and peritonitis. The spectrum of disease ranges from subclinical, asymptomatic infection to severe, life-threatening illness; sequelae include chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. PID is diagnosed clinically, with laboratory and imaging studies reserved for patients who have an uncertain diagnosis, are severely ill, or do not respond to initial therapy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention diagnostic criteria include uterine, adnexal, or cervical motion tenderness with no other obvious cause in women at risk of PID. Empiric treatment should be initiated promptly and must cover Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; the possibility of fluoroquinolone-resistant N. gonorrhoeae also should be considered. Hospitalization for initial parenteral therapy is necessary for patients with tubo-ovarian abscess and for those who are pregnant, severely ill, unable to follow a prescribed treatment plan, or unable to tolerate oral antibiotics. Patients also should be hospitalized if a surgical emergency cannot be excluded or if no clinical improvement occurs after three days. Routine screening for asymptomatic chlamydial infection can help prevent PID and its sequelae.

### Randomised controlled trial of screening for Chlamydia trachomatis to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease: the POPI (prevention of pelvic infection) trial [^112KSmnj]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

†Abdominal pelvic pain with features of PID, which may have responded to antimicrobial therapy, but no record of cervical excitation or uterine or adnexal tenderness; or long standing abdominal pain consistent with endometriosis, but some features of PID — for example, uterine tenderness, and unable to confirm if antimicrobial therapy had a benefit. 1

Rates of pelvic inflammatory disease were examined in the 137 women with chlamydial infection at baseline who were followed up for 12 months. Seven of 74 women in the deferred screening group developed clinical pelvic inflammatory disease (incidence 9.5%, 4.7% to 18.3%). All seven women were tested for C trachomatis at the time pelvic inflammatory disease was diagnosed and five tested positive. By comparison, only one of 63 (1.6%) screened and treated women positive for chlamydia developed clinical pelvic inflammatory disease (relative risk 0.17, 0.03 to 1.01). Initial treatment for chlamydial infection in this woman was confirmed by telephone but she developed symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease and tested positive for chlamydia 26 weeks after recruitment. On the 12 month questionnaire she reported three sexual partners in the previous year and no use of condoms.

Most cases of pelvic inflammatory disease (79%, 30/38) occurred in women who tested negative for chlamydia at baseline. Chlamydia test results at the time pelvic inflammatory disease was diagnosed were available for 26 (of 38) women, of whom 16 tested positive for chlamydial infection. Ten of these 16 women were negative for chlamydia at baseline. Seventy per cent (21/30) of women with pelvic inflammatory disease who completed the 12 months' questionnaire reported having had two or more sexual partners during the year. The groups showed a slight imbalance for reported symptoms but similar sexual behaviour during the follow-up period (table 4).

Table 4

Independent testing during follow-up

Overall, 527 (22%) participants reported having been tested independently for chlamydia (figure); 15% (n = 38) of the control women and 10% (n = 27) of the screened women said they tested positive. Those women in the deferred screening group (blind to group allocation and baseline chlamydia status) who were positive for chlamydia at baseline were more likely than those who were negative to report having been tested independently (43%, 29/67 v 24%, 229/968; P < 0.001).

### Antibiotic therapy for acute pelvic inflammatory disease: the 2006 centers for disease control and prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines [^116pX4uX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a substantial cause of reproductive morbidity in young women. A systematic review of the literature related to PID management was performed in preparation for the 2006 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines. This search was conducted using PubMed and was limited to articles written in English and published between 1 January 2002 and 31 January 2005 that were related to PID treatment. Studies were evaluated for new data on PID with regard to site, route, and timing of antimicrobial administration; regimen adherence; experience in adolescents and women > 35 years of age; coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus; and management of sex partners. Strong evidence suggests that neither site nor route of treatment administration affects the short- or long-term major outcome of women with mild or moderate clinical presentations. Data on these outcomes in women with more severe clinical presentations are inadequate to provide guidance as to the preferred agents or route of administration. Important contributions to the literature that impact the 2006 guidelines are described in this article.

5.4 Pelvic Infection

Promptly examine users with complaints of lower abdominal or pelvic pain, odorous discharge, unexplained bleeding, fever, genital lesions or sores. Remove Mirena in cases of recurrent endometritis or PID, or if an acute pelvic infection is severe or does not respond to treatment.

Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)

Mirena is contraindicated in the presence of known or suspected PID or in women with a history of PID unless there has been a subsequent intrauterine pregnancy [see Contraindications (4)]. IUDs have been associated with an increased risk of PID, most likely due to organisms being introduced into the uterus during insertion. In clinical trials, total combined upper genital infections were reported in 3.5% of Mirena users. More specifically, endometritis was reported in 2.1%, PID in 0.6%, and all other upper genital infections in ≤ 0.5% of women overall. These infections occurred more frequently within the first year. In a clinical trial with other IUDs1and a clinical trial with an IUD similar to Mirena, the highest rate occurred within the first month after insertion.

Women at increased risk for PID

PID is often associated with a sexually transmitted infection (STI), and Mirena does not protect against STI. The risk of PID is greater for women who have multiple sexual partners, and also for women whose sexual partner(s) have multiple sexual partners. Women who have had PID are at increased risk for a recurrence or re-infection. In particular, ascertain whether the woman is at increased risk of infection (for example, leukemia, acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS], intravenous drug abuse).

Subclinical PID

PID may be asymptomatic but still result in tubal damage and its sequelae.

Treatment of PID

Following a diagnosis of PID, or suspected PID, bacteriologic specimens should be obtained, and antibiotic therapy should be initiated promptly. Removal of Mirena after initiation of antibiotic therapy is usually appropriate.1

Actinomycosis

Actinomycosis has been associated with IUDs. Remove Mirena from symptomatic women and treat with antibiotics. The significance of actinomyces-like organisms on Pap smear in an asymptomatic IUD user is unknown, and so this finding alone does not always require Mirena removal and treatment. When possible, confirm a Pap smear diagnosis with cultures.

### Pelvic inflammatory disease [^116Cuuxg]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection-caused inflammatory continuum from the cervix to the peritoneal cavity. Most importantly, it is associated with fallopian tube inflammation, which can lead to infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. The microbial etiology is linked to sexually transmitted microorganisms, including Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrheae, Mycoplasma genitalium, and bacterial vaginosis-associated microorganisms, predominantly anaerobes. Pelvic pain and fever are commonly absent in women with confirmed PID. Clinicians should consider milder symptoms such as abnormal vaginal discharge, metrorrhagia, postcoital bleeding, and urinary frequency as potential symptoms associated with the disease, particularly in women at risk of sexually transmitted infection. The diagnosis of PID is based on the findings of lower genital tract inflammation associated with pelvic organ tenderness. The outpatient treatment of mild-to-moderate PID should include tolerated antibiotic regimens with activity against the commonly isolated microorganisms associated with PID and usually consists of an extended spectrum cephalosporin in conjunction with either doxycycline or azithromycin. Clinically severe PID should prompt hospitalization and imaging to rule out a tuboovarian abscess. Parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with activity against a polymicrobial flora, particularly gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes, should be implemented. Screening for and treatment of Chlamydia infection can prevent PID.

Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)

Kyleena is contraindicated in the presence of known or suspected PID or in women with a history of PID unless there has been a subsequent intrauterine pregnancy [see Contraindications (4)].

### Small bowel obstruction and perforation attributed to tubo-ovarian abscess following' D' and' C' [^1147hxX4]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Small bowel obstruction is a serious and costly medical condition indicating often emergency surgery. Currently small bowel obstruction required 948,000 hospital days annually, amounting for $3.2 billion, with a rate of 117 hospitalizations per 100,000 people. It constitutes 1.9% of all hospital and 3.5% of all emergency admissions that has led to laparotomy in the United States. Tubo-ovarian abscess is often thought to arise from repeated episodes of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) but may also arise after perforations of septic or even therapeutic abortions; after adnexial surgery or caeserian section; from a ruptured appendix; with pelvic malignancy, or rarely after apparently uncomplicated minor gynaecological procedures including removal or insertion of intra-uterine devices and deliveries. Small bowel obstruction attributed to tubo-ovarian abscesses have been reported but without a link to a precipitating factor such as in this case- the 'D' and 'C' procedure.

Case presentation

A 22-yr old woman (G2 P1011) was admitted as an emergency with a gradual onset severe colicky central abdominal pain 1 week after a termination of pregnancy at 16 weeks gestation. The pain became more frequent on a background of a constant lower abdominal pain. There was associated central abdominal distension, copious bilious vomiting following meals, absolute constipation and fever. There was no vaginal discharge. She had undergone a normal vaginal delivery 15 months previously. On examination she was in great distress, lying still but restless with each episode of colic. She was dehydrated and tachypnoeic. Her blood pressure 100/60 mmHg, heart rate 90/min and temperature 39°C. She had a distended abdomen with visible peristalsis and generalized rebound tenderness. Adnexal structures were unable to be palpated. The clinical impression was small bowel obstruction secondary to peritonitis from a perforated uterus as a complication of the 'D' and 'C'. Her haemoglobin level was 12.2 gms/d but a white cell count was not available. An abdominal ultrasound scan from the referral clinic revealed a non-gravid uterus with dilated loops of bowel and free intraperitoneal fluid. Following resuscitation with intravenous fluids, nasogastric suction, intravenous antibiotics and analgesia she underwent a laparotomy.

Pelvic inflammatory disease is a polymicrobial infection of the upper genital tract. It primarily affects young, sexually active women. The diagnosis is made clinically; no single test or study is sensitive or specific enough for a definitive diagnosis. Pelvic inflammatory disease should be suspected in at-risk patients who present with pelvic or lower abdominal pain with no identified etiology, and who have cervical motion, uterine, or adnexal tenderness. Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are the most commonly implicated microorganisms; however, other microorganisms may be involved. The spectrum of disease ranges from asymptomatic to life-threatening tubo-ovarian abscess. Patients should be treated empirically, even if they present with few symptoms. Most women can be treated successfully as outpatients with a single dose of a parenteral cephalosporin plus oral doxycycline, with or without oral metronidazole. Delay in treatment may lead to major sequelae, including chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. Hospitalization and parenteral treatment are recommended if the patient is pregnant, has human immunodeficiency virus infection, does not respond to oral medication, or is severely ill. Strategies for preventing pelvic inflammatory disease include routine screening for chlamydia and patient education.
