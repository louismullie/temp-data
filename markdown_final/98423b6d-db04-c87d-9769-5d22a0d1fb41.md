## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which category of goods is bought infrequently, used repeatedly, and involves a reasonably high level of consumer risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core consumer behavior and risk features embedded in the stem. Then, I should verify how each option maps to those features. Next, I will consider concrete examples that fit the description and check for exceptions. Finally, I will reconcile any ambiguities and confirm the best-fitting answer with a brief justification.

> Let me first confirm the key descriptors: bought infrequently, used repeatedly, and carrying reasonably high consumer risk. I need to ensure I'm not conflating purchase frequency with usage frequency, because durable goods are typically purchased infrequently but used many times, whereas non-durable goods are purchased frequently and consumed quickly, which would contradict the "used repeatedly" criterion here [^notfound].

> Now, I will examine Option A, impulse goods. Wait, let me verify the purchase pattern: impulse goods are characterized by unplanned, frequent purchases driven by immediate desire, which conflicts with "bought infrequently". They are also usually consumed quickly rather than used repeatedly over time, so this option does not fit the usage pattern either [^notfound].

> Next, Option B, luxury goods. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. While some luxury items are durable and expensive, the defining feature of luxury goods is high price and prestige, not necessarily infrequent purchase, repeated use, or high consumer risk. Moreover, many luxury goods are fashion or accessory items with limited durability or seasonal obsolescence, so they don't reliably meet the "used repeatedly" and "high risk" criteria in a consumer-product safety sense, making this a weak match [^notfound].

> I will now examine Option C, non-durable goods. Let me think about this carefully. Non-durable goods are consumed or depleted quickly, meaning they are purchased frequently and not used repeatedly over long periods, which directly contradicts both "bought infrequently" and "used repeatedly". Therefore, this option is incompatible with the stem's constraints [^notfound].

> Option D, durable goods, aligns with the description. I should double-check: durables are bought infrequently, designed for repeated use over years, and many carry nontrivial consumer risk due to mechanical, electrical, or chemical hazards, which matches the "reasonably high level of consumer risk" phrasing. Examples include appliances, vehicles, and certain medical devices, where infrequent purchase, repeated use, and safety risk are typical features [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the "high risk" aspect is ambiguous? I need to ensure I'm not overstating it. The phrase "reasonably high" is relative and context-dependent; still, durable goods frequently involve safety considerations, warranty issues, and regulatory oversight, which substantiates the risk dimension without implying extreme danger. This fits better than the other options, which either fail on purchase frequency, usage pattern, or risk profile [^notfound].

> Final answer: D. Durable goods. I should confirm that this is the only option that consistently satisfies all three criteria: bought infrequently, used repeatedly, and involving a reasonably high level of consumer risk, whereas impulse goods, luxury goods, and non-durable goods each violate at least one of these constraints [^notfound].

The correct answer is **D. Durable goods**. Durable goods are purchased infrequently, used repeatedly over time, and often involve higher consumer risk due to their cost, complexity, and potential safety or performance issues. Examples include appliances, vehicles, and electronics, which are typically bought infrequently, used repeatedly, and carry meaningful financial, safety, or reliability risks [^notfound].

---

## Characteristics of durable goods

Durable goods are defined by the following characteristics:

- **Infrequent purchase**: Consumers typically buy durable goods infrequently, often lasting several years before replacement. Examples include refrigerators, washing machines, cars, and televisions [^notfound].

- **Repeated use**: These goods are designed for repeated use over an extended period, providing ongoing utility and value to the consumer [^notfound].

- **High consumer risk**: Durable goods often involve significant financial investment, complex functionality, and potential safety or performance risks. Consumers must carefully evaluate these factors before making a purchase decision [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other categories

| **Category** | **Purchase frequency** | **Usage pattern** | **Consumer risk** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Impulse goods | Frequent | Single-use or short-term | Low |
| Luxury goods | Infrequent | Repeated use | High (financial and social) |
| Non-durable goods | Frequent | Single-use or short-term | Low |
| Durable goods | Infrequent | Repeated use | High (financial, safety, performance) |

---

## Examples of durable goods

Examples of durable goods that fit the description include:

- **Home appliances**: Refrigerators, washing machines, dryers, dishwashers, and ovens are purchased infrequently, used repeatedly, and involve significant financial and safety considerations [^notfound].

- **Automobiles**: Cars are a classic example of durable goods, with infrequent purchases, repeated use, and high consumer risk related to safety, reliability, and financial investment [^notfound].

- **Electronics**: Televisions, computers, and smartphones are purchased infrequently, used repeatedly, and involve consumer risk related to performance, reliability, and technological obsolescence [^notfound].

---

## Consumer behavior and decision-making

Consumers exhibit distinct behavior patterns when purchasing durable goods:

- **Extensive research**: Consumers typically conduct thorough research, compare options, and evaluate features, prices, and reviews before making a purchase decision [^notfound].

- **Long-term consideration**: Purchase decisions are influenced by long-term considerations such as durability, reliability, maintenance costs, and resale value [^notfound].

- **Risk assessment**: Consumers carefully assess potential risks, including financial investment, safety concerns, and performance reliability, before committing to a purchase [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

Durable goods are the correct answer because they are **bought infrequently, used repeatedly, and involve a reasonably high level of consumer risk**. This category encompasses products such as home appliances, automobiles, and electronics, which require careful consideration and evaluation by consumers due to their significant financial, safety, and performance implications [^notfound].

### Peanut can Be used as a reference allergen for hazard characterization in food allergen risk management: a rapid evidence assessment and meta-analysis [^537e9bea]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

In most jurisdictions, regional and national legislation mandates the disclosure of "priority" allergens when present as an ingredient in foods. However, this does not extend to the unintended presence of allergens due to the use of shared production facilities. Attempts to alert consumers of this have contributed to a proliferation of precautionary allergen ("may contain") labeling (PAL) that poses considerable difficulties to food-allergic consumers, in part because of a lack of transparency in terms of what PAL actually means. Attempts have been made by industry and regulators to improve allergen risk management to better inform the use of PAL, but to date this has not resulted in a consistent approach; indeed, this is now leading to discordance as some national regulators take different approaches to others. This lack of harmonious approach means that food businesses currently use PAL in different ways.

Currently, there is no global consensus on what levels of allergen exposure cause harm to food-allergic consumers; this is needed to develop a regulatory approach. One strategy has been to establish internationally agreed "reference doses," below which no PAL would be needed., This would provide a regulatory framework for more appropriate and evidence-based use of PAL. Diverse stakeholders including patient representative groups consider that this would result in better informed food choices and thus better protect consumers with food allergy — many of whom currently ignore PAL due to their widespread (and arguably, over-) use and uncertainty in interpretation. There is now a significant evidence base to inform population thresholds for eliciting dose (ED), the dose of allergen predicted to provoke reactions in a defined proportion of the food-allergic population. For example, the amount of allergen expected to cause objective symptoms in 5% of the population with that allergy (ED 05) is a dose predicted to provoke an objective allergic reaction in 5% of the at-risk allergic population. Such data can and have been used to inform the need for PAL, albeit on a voluntary basis. However, until now, the main consideration has been the proportion of allergic individuals who will have objective symptoms at these levels of exposure, and not necessarily a consideration of how "severe" such symptoms may be. Thus, there is also a need to better characterize the hazard, at a given dose — the relationship between a level of allergen exposure (dose) and the nature/severity of any subsequent adverse health outcome — because this relationship is perceived to be of critical importance by allergic consumers and remains the focus of clinical, scientific, and regulatory debate.

### Medicines with one seller and many buyers: strategies to increase the power of the payer [^9dffe8bc]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

For high cost medicines with uncertain benefits, healthcare systems can put conditions on how a medicine is used or paid for using a managed entry agreement. Conditions can be financial discounts and rebates, or more complex arrangements based on outcome. Managed entry agreements often specify collection of additional data to enable future decision making about new products with limited current evidence. Technical and practical challenges exist with such arrangements. Implementation can be limited by technical factors — for example, data collection in routine care can be costly and might yield less evidence than expected. In addition, delisting a treatment can raise objections from patients, who consider that they are being denied treatment, despite efforts to explain that a medicine is less effective than expected.

Buyers can use a variety of tools to improve their spending forecasts. Some can be used while research and development are still under way, as in the case of horizon scanning. Other tools, such as formularies and health technology assessment, allow buyers to select medicines once approved for marketing. In recent years managed entry agreements have reduced financial risk, particularly for medicines with uncertain benefits. Recognition that each of these processes is improved with better data reporting has led to an increased push for transparency and collaboration.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^4e104775]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Drug pricing fosters and directs innovation

The process of developing a new drug, from preclinical research to market, is time-consuming, risky, and costly, often taking more than a decade and costing billions of dollars. The risk is best reflected in the very low probability of a potential drug making it through all stages of clinical trials and securing regulatory approval. Estimates suggest this probability is, on average, less than 10%; however, recent data for oncology show a lower estimate at about 3.5% (Fig. 2). The high "failure rate" depends on the starting point: for example, probably < 0.1% of all molecules tested in preclinical studies end up being FDA-approved. For those that embark on this journey, the odds of reaching the finish are long, and there is no guarantee that costs incurred for failed products will be recovered in any form. Even if a product is successful in clinical trials and secures regulatory approval, it may not generate enough revenue to recoup the multiple investment attempts that went into its development. Thus, pharmaceutical R&D only starts to make sense at the portfolio level, where the cost of planting many seeds and nurturing a whole garden of projects can only be justified by robust financial returns from selling the few prized fruits.

### Quantifying preferences in drug benefit-risk decisions [^fe13d7df]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Benefit-risk assessment is used in various phases along the drug lifecycle, such as marketing authorization and surveillance, health technology assessment (HTA), and clinical decisions, to understand whether, and for which patients, a drug has a favorable or more valuable profile with reference to one or more comparators. Such assessments are inherently preference-based as several clinical and nonclinical outcomes of varying importance might act as evaluation criteria, and decision makers must establish acceptable trade-offs between these outcomes. Different healthcare stakeholder perspectives, such as those from patients and healthcare professionals, are key for informing benefit-risk trade-offs. However, the degree to which such preferences inform the decision is often unclear as formal preference-based evaluation frameworks are generally not used for regulatory decisions, and, if used, rarely communicated in HTA decisions. We argue that for better decisions, as well as for reasons of transparency, preferences in benefit-risk decisions should more often be quantified and communicated explicitly.

### The risks of risk aversion in drug regulation [^05d0c7b2]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2013). Medium credibility.

Drugs are approved by regulatory agencies on the basis of their assessment of whether the available evidence indicates that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. In recent years, regulatory agencies have been criticized both for being overly tolerant of risks or being excessively risk-averse, which reflects the challenge in determining an appropriate balance between benefit and risk with the limited data that is typically available before drug approval. The negative consequences of regulatory tolerance in allowing drugs onto the market that turn out to be unsafe are obvious, but the potential for adverse effects on public health owing to the absence of new drugs because of regulatory risk-aversion is less apparent. Here, we discuss the consequences of regulatory risk-aversion for public health and suggest what might be done to best align acceptance of risk and uncertainty by regulators with the interests of public health.

### Recognizing that evidence is made, not born [^99b694d5]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic product development, licensing and reimbursement may seem a well-oiled machine, but continuing high attrition rates, regulatory refusals, and patients' access issues suggest otherwise; despite serious efforts, gaps persist between stakeholders' stated evidence requirements and actual evidence supplied. Evidentiary deficiencies and/or human tendencies resulting in avoidable inefficiencies might be further reduced with fresh institutional cultures/mindsets, combined with a context-adaptable practices framework that integrates emerging innovations. Here, Structured Evidence Planning, Production, and Evaluation (SEPPE) posits that evidence be treated as something produced, much like other manufactured goods, for which "built-in quality" (i.e., "people" and "process") approaches have been successfully implemented globally. Incorporating proactive, iterative feedback-and-adjust loops involving key decision-makers at critical points could curtail avoidable evidence quality and decision hazards-pulling needed therapeutic products with high quality evidence of beneficial performance through to approvals. Critical for success, however, is dedicated, long-term commitment to systemic transformation.

### Endorsement liability: putting your good name at risk [^31ced3f3]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Endorsements designed to sell products are most effective when the endorser is a celebrity or an expert. If such endorsements contain misrepresentations, the endorser risks personal liability. For products related to health and safety, endorsements are subject to evaluation by reliable independent sources. In a number of high-profile cases, the Federal Trade Commission determined that endorsers must have a reasonable basis for their representations. (Aesthetic Surg J 2001;21:373–374.).

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^4f5871c8]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Pathogen-specific surveillance — interview question design and data capture emphasizes a mix of question types and standardized elements. As appropriate to circumstances, construct the interview to include specific closed-ended questions about exposures as a priori hypotheses, broad open-ended questions, and questions eliciting additional details such as brand and place of purchase or consumption, and when possible use standardized core questions and data elements used by other investigators to enhance data sharing and comparisons across jurisdictions. Questionnaires should be designed with rapid and accurate data entry in mind, and questions with a yes/no check-box format are efficient for variables with low expected exposure frequency; because less than 20% of the population is expected to eat raw spinach a yes/no question can suffice, whereas because more than 75% of the population is expected to eat chicken additional brand or source information is needed; thus using a hybrid approach for low-frequency and high-frequency exposures may be the most effective approach. The use of open-ended questions complicates electronic data entry and analysis, and for jurisdictions relying on electronic data entry, answers to open-ended questions may need to be captured as text fields that can be reviewed as needed.

### Consumer acceptable risk: how cigarette companies have responded to accusations that their products are defective [^876c6b98]. Tobacco Control (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe arguments used by cigarette companies to defend themselves against charges that their cigarettes were defective and that they could and should have done more to make cigarettes less hazardous.

Methods

The data for this paper come from the opening statements made by defendants in four court cases: two class action lawsuits (Engle 1999, and Blankenship 2001) and two individual cases (Boeken 2001, and Schwarz 2002). The transcripts of opening statements were reviewed and statements about product defect claims, product testing, and safe cigarette research were excerpted and coded.

Results

Responses by cigarette companies to charges that their products were defective has been presented consistently across different cases and by different companies. Essentially the arguments made by cigarette companies boil down to three claims: (1) smoking is risky, but nothing the companies have done has made cigarettes more dangerous than might otherwise be the case; (2) nothing the companies have done or said has kept someone from stopping smoking; and (3) the companies have spent lots of money to make the safest cigarette acceptable to the smoker.

Conclusions

Cigarette companies have argued that their products are inherently dangerous but not defective, and that they have worked hard to make their products safer by lowering the tar and nicotine content of cigarettes as recommended by members of the public health community. As a counter argument, plaintiff attorneys should focus on how cigarette design changes have actually made smoking more acceptable to smokers, thereby discouraging smoking cessation.

### An introduction to risk management [^3bb10f93]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Risk management is formally defined as the process by which an organization assesses and addresses its risks. Historically, the role of risk management has been associated with insurance-buying, occupational safety and health, and legal liability management. In recent years managers and physicians alike have begun to recognize that organizational risks are pervasive, that these risks are extraordinarily diverse and complex, and that these risks are not just confined to "insurable" or accident-related situations. They may include risks arising from actions of regulatory bodies, third party payers, hospitals, partners, and employees, in addition to the physiatrist's personal or business investment, management and clinical practice. Furthermore, changing customer and patient preferences and/or expectations make the assessment of risk an even more dynamic and continuous process. This article describes the formal risk management process and suggests ways that physiatrists can apply risk management to their business and clinical practice. In developing this description, physiatrists and their office managers will learn about the overall goals and objectives of risk management, the challenge of identifying and analyzing risks, the tools and treatment options available, and the means by which risk management efforts are effectively implemented.

### Postmarket clinical evidence for high-risk therapeutic medical devices receiving food and drug administration premarket approval in 2010 and 2011 [^19d6b355]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves high-risk medical devices primarily through the premarket approval pathway, which requires clinical evidence assuring device safety and effectiveness. By law, the FDA stipulates only the minimum premarket evidence necessary, which typically includes 1 feasibility study and 1 pivotal study. However, the FDA may require manufacturers to conduct postmarket studies to generate complementary performance data (eg, characterizations of long-term outcomes). In addition, manufacturers and independent investigators may conduct postmarket studies to answer other important questions (eg, benefit-risk assessment for new indications or certain populations).

In 2015, we reported that 13% of all studies initiated after FDA premarket approval were completed within 3 to 5 years, while 75% were ongoing. Now, 5 years later, we sought to determine whether additional studies were completed and reported.

### Generating evidence for new high-risk medical devices [^fb086d74]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2019). High credibility.

Evidence required for HTA and reimbursement decisions

HTA and reimbursement decisions have traditionally presupposed that regulators are fully satisfied with evidence on safety and efficacy. However, by necessity, regulatory decisions typically are made when evidence is incomplete: much of the evidence on use of devices in different patient populations or by different clinicians, and long-term effectiveness and safety can only be generated by "real-world" practice after market approval by regulators. To capture this evidence, systems are needed that enable clinical care information to reach the status of valid scientific evidence fit for regulatory, HTA and health-policy decision-making.

HTA agencies and payers are interested in value for patients and healthcare systems, based on evidence about health outcomes, rather than efficacy alone. In general, HTA organizations evaluate comparative effectiveness to determine whether the new technology performs better than what is in current use. In addition, many of them also use evidence on health utilities to calculate a cost per QALY (quality-adjusted life year).

Evidence generation for health economic evaluation is often neglected by product developers, but through discussion with clinicians, health economists and most importantly HTA organizations, they should be able to identify key information, normally health-related quality of life data, required for health economic modelling, around the time of product launch. Thereafter, resource utilization data will be needed about replacement of the device or component parts, or other necessary interventions, to inform economic modeling.

Finally, healthcare professionals, hospitals/providers and patients will want to know whether the device is safe, whether it works better than the alternatives, how much it costs and whether it is convenient to use. Clinicians are particularly interested in knowing how a device is performing in the hands of colleagues, and they may contribute their own data to trials and registries.

### Elusive quality: the challenges and ethical dilemmas faced by international non-governmental organisations in sourcing quality assured medical products [^b6821fab]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Although a staple method for NDRAs (and one that is encouraged by the WHO), a 'reliance' approach to quality assurance is unfeasible for many iNGOs. This technique involves establishing equivalence of each batch of a medical product with one that is approved by a 'trusted' NDRA, or auditor. This desk-based assessment may be advantageous in terms of cost and personnel security but, as it involves a review of dossiers and documentation for each individual product, it is dependent on access to commercially sensitive information (and staff with the skill to interpret it). Ideally, this is achieved via cross-organisational information-sharing agreements, but iNGOs may lack the negotiating power (that NDRAs enjoy) to broker such an exchange. Instead therefore, they may need to piece together data from public domains (eg, the list of European Medicines Agency-approved manufacturers), the host government, partner organisations and the manufacturer themselves. Not only is this time-consuming, it is unlikely to yield the sufficiently detailed or validated information that is necessary for evidence-based decision-making.

Furthermore, iNGOs that require a range of commodities may prefer wholesalers who are a 'one-stop-shop' and may, therefore, deem the evaluation of individual production lines of a manufacturer to be unworkable (or pointless, if the minimum order quantities are greater than their needs). Thus, based on the same concept of trust and reliance, charities with the risk appetite to do so may conduct remote assessments of vendors (not individual products) using shared or publicly obtainable information. As the procurement habits of a humanitarian organisation are unlikely to overlap with that of an HIC, data from a stringent and reliable NDRA (ie, benchmarked at Level 1 or 2) are in short supply. Reports of a trusted auditor (eg, QUAMED) may be available but are unlikely to yield positive results, or it may only be possible to gather several pieces of vague and decontextualised data — a list of the vendor's customers, for example. This practice, and the uncertainty it creates, may increase the risk of sourcing poor-quality medical products and may even invite exploitation. Given the risks, this area would benefit from scrutiny to understand the extent of (and drivers for) remote assessments and whether poor-quality data have an influence on iNGO decision-making.

### Biomedical innovation: a risky business at risk [^cd5eeade]. Science Translational Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Regulatory and financial challenges conspire to stall the development and market approval of breakthrough medical products. Inconsistent parameters are used to assess the safety and efficacy of drugs, biologics, and devices; this glitch in the system introduces uncertainty, slows or blocks product approvals, and increases the costs of product development. Here, we consider how to balance the benefits and risks to the public in the assessment of innovative medical products. We also discuss the Institute of Medicine's recent report on the medical device approval process.

### Recognizing that evidence is made, not born [^d52c3d8c]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Cooperative risk‐anticipating, monitoring, and corrective actions are built in all along the way

SEPPE would also set aside the limiting and expensive practice whereby, if something goes wrong with the performance of product or evidence, post hoc appraisal and potential scientific or regulatory intervention are deployed to try to save the day. Because SEPPE takes for granted that flaws and problems are bound to occur throughout, a third premise is that explicit, active, preventive and more distributed risk‐managing and risk‐communicating efforts — understanding when and why they need to be taken — must become the norm to minimize the occurrence, frequency and impact of these events. SEPPE would compel the structuring of specific, comprehensive activities in anticipation of the things that could go wrong, in the form of overtly described and well‐controlled monitoring, feedback‐and‐adjustment loops; moreover, these would be iterative in both smaller and larger frames. Key decision‐makers would, thus, be enabled to contribute to — and be comfortable with — initial development strategies and evidence designs, as well as possible continuing adaptations prompted by the evolving evidence and other contextual considerations.

In a nutshell, each participant in planning, production, and evaluation would be responsible for neither making, nor accepting, nor passing along a defect 92 (i.e. avoidable product, decision, and/or evidence problem/uncertainty). A resulting feature of SEPPE‐generated products (i.e. quality evidence and product deliverables) is that these would be explicitly acknowledged by stakeholder partners as "best quality possible" — a decided improvement over the current situation.

### Nutritional labelling for healthier food or non-alcoholic drink purchasing and consumption [^28824102]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

We planned subgroup analyses to assess effect modifiers and explore them as sources of heterogeneity. We chose the potential modifiers based on previous research or as considered in the section How the intervention might work. Due to a lack of information reported in the included studies, we were unable to conduct many of the planned subgroup analyses (see Differences between protocol and review). There were, however, sufficient data to explore two possible moderators of the main effects of nutritional labelling: dietary restraint and study country. We used the generic inverse variance approach to pool the MDs or SMDs, both across studies and within subgroups.

Sensitivity analysis

We repeated meta‐analyses, omitting all studies at high or unclear risk of bias.

Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence

We prepared the Summary of findings table using the main outcomes evaluated in the included studies and as specified in Primary outcomes: food purchased from vending machines, food purchased from a grocery store, food purchased from a restaurant, cafeteria or coffee shop, food consumed in a laboratory setting (where participants were given a range of options), food consumed in a laboratory setting (where participants were given a single option), and harms (food consumed with misleading labels). All of the participants in these studies were from general populations groups, so may be considered medium risk populations. All comparisons presented in the Summary of findings table evaluate nutritional labelling (broadly) versus no labelling (i.e. it was not the remit of this systematic review to compare the effectiveness of different types of nutritional labels). Some of the summary results were presented as MD while others had to be presented using SMD for reasons described above (Measures of treatment effect).

We used the GRADE system to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome (Schünemann 2011). Using the four standard GRADE levels of quality (high, moderate, low and very low) we assigned evidence from RCTs an initial quality rating of high and evidence from non‐RCTS an initial rating of low. We upgraded (for observational studies only) or downgraded these levels based on our judgments regarding risk of bias, precision, consistency, directness and publication bias. We interpreted the overall quality level for each outcome following definitions provided by Balshem 2011.

We report the quality level assigned for each outcome, along with justification for the decisions, in the Results.

### Avoiding conflicts of interest and reputational risks associated with population research on food and nutrition: the food research risK (FoRK) guidance and toolkit for researchers [^6483d6d8]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Drawing on the published literature identified in our systematic reviewand the feedback from the workshop, draft guidance with a series of thinking tools was developed. We completed three rounds of pilot testing incorporating feedback at each stage. This process began with eight different researchers or research groups piloting the initial tool. We then asked all 41 workshop participants to pilot the tool further using a real life example. Twenty one participants provided feedback. Finally, 12 researchers from a range of countries, who had not been involved in the workshop, piloted the guidance.

In developing this guidance, we involved people from across the spectrum of interacting with the commercial food sector, including those who strongly believe that risks outweigh benefits and vice versa. As a result, during the consensus building process, some participants stated that the guidance was too lenient and others stated that it was too restrictive.

Our primary objective is to ensure the integrity of science, and we believe we have achieved a fair and balanced approach in the guidance. However, few absolutes exist in this area. Opinions on these issues are likely to vary according to personal and institutional preferences, as well as ethical and political stances on a wide range of related issues (eg, the morality of wealth and profit). We anticipate that the guidance and toolkit will be refined and developed in accordance with scientific and ethical principles over time. Ultimately, the guidance and toolkit are not prescriptive, but thinking tools should allow researchers to make informed decisions about how to act with integrity, so they should be of value to a wide range of researchers.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^fa992040]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Communication with the public — risk communication for foodborne disease outbreaks — states that "Messages to the public about foodborne disease outbreaks should follow good risk communication practices" and "Ideally, templates for public messages should be prepared before the outbreak and used consistently." "Notify the public if the outbreak involves distributed product," "Provide information about how to handle the suspected product (discard, special preparation instructions, or return to place of purchase)," and "Provide information about the disease, including symptoms, mode of transmission, prevention, and actions to take if illness occurs." If a firm declines to recall, "public health agencies or regulators might issue their own notice to the public" and "The message to the public should describe the situation and provide clear actions." Notification "might include press releases, radio, television, fax, telephone, e-mail, Web posting, social media, or letters," "The manufacturer, public health agencies, regulatory agencies, retail food establishment, or all four can initiate notification," and releases "should be coordinated and include consistent messages to avoid confusing the public." Guidance adds to "Attempt to reach all members of the population at risk, including non–English-speaking and low-literacy populations," "Provide only objective, fact-based information about the outbreak," "Do not give out preliminary, unconfirmed information," and, when a specific food is implicated, inform on retrieval or disposal: "the press releases need to inform consumers whether the local jurisdiction is interested in obtaining the product from households that still have it and, if not, the proper method of disposal." For large or highly virulent events, "consider setting up an emergency hotline so the public can call with questions," ensure "Persons answering the phones should be trained to give consistent responses," and note "The hotline might require having staff work after hours to answer phones after the early evening news or to respond to questions posed on social media." For third-party releases, "relevant local, state, or federal officials should review and approve them before release," and agencies "can provide needed information and help to ensure consistent communication."

### SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies: ethics and risk minimisation [^d446c6fa]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

What risks are reasonable?

There is no consensus within research ethics guidance about whether research with healthy volunteers should be subject to upper levels of acceptable risk. Commentators endorse contrasting approaches. Some argue that there should be no upper limits, provided that studies involve competent, healthy adults and additional conditions, including informed consent and high social value, are met. A contrasting approach endorses limits on upper levels of acceptable risk, justified on grounds including the basis of fiduciary relationships between researchers and participants, equal moral concern for people's basic interests, or the significance of preserving public trust in research. Suggested thresholds to inform the review of research protocols include a 1% risk of death, or risks comparable to those posed by other altruistic activities such as living organ donation. In the context of CHIs, suggested risk limits include a minimal risk threshold, a higher threshold that rules out risks of irreversible, incurable or possibly fatal infections, and approaches drawing on broader norms restricting research risks in healthy volunteers.

In the context of COVID-19 pandemic research, the possibility of accepting higher levels of risk than might otherwise be considered reasonable has been raised, including comparisons with high-risk activities. However, higher risk or more burdensome research is particularly controversial in populations or communities already facing undesirably high degrees of riskand the importance of maintaining scientific and ethical research standards during public health crises has been persuasively emphasised. So too has the critical importance of engaging with local stakeholders and communities about proposed CHIs, including evaluations of the reasonableness and acceptability of risks. Given the novelty of COVID-19 and uncertainties about its long-term health implications, the acceptability of risks of SARS-CoV-2 CHIs should be subjected to particularly careful and continual assessment, in consultation with communities and stakeholders, in light of changing evidence, and taking into account risk minimisation strategies discussed below.

### How should we set consumption thresholds for low risk drinking guidelines? Achieving objectivity and transparency using evidence, expert judgement and pragmatism [^2a353b7d]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

Most high-income nations issue guidelines on low-risk drinking to inform individuals' decisions about alcohol consumption. However, leading scientists have criticized the processes for setting the consumption thresholds within these guidelines for a lack of objectivity and transparency. This paper examines how guideline developers should respond to such criticisms and focuses particularly on the balance between epidemiological evidence, expert judgement and pragmatic considerations. Although concerned primarily with alcohol, our discussion is also relevant to those developing guidelines for other health-related behaviours. We make eight recommendations across three areas. First, recommendations on the use of epidemiological evidence: (1) guideline developers should assess whether the available epidemiological evidence is communicated most appropriately as population-level messages (e.g. suggesting reduced drinking benefits populations rather than individuals); (2) research funders should prioritize commissioning studies on the acceptability of different alcohol-related risks (e.g. mortality, morbidity, harms to others) to the public and other stakeholders; and (3) guideline developers should request and consider statistical analyses of epidemiological uncertainty. Secondly, recommendations to improve objectivity and transparency when translating epidemiological evidence into guidelines: (4) guideline developers should specify and publish their analytical framework to promote clear, consistent and coherent judgements; and (5) guideline developers' decision-making should be supported by numerical and visual techniques which also increase the transparency of judgements to stakeholders. Thirdly, recommendations relating to the diverse use of guidelines: (6) guideline developers and their commissioners should give meaningful attention to how guidelines are used in settings such as advocacy, health promotion, clinical practice and wider health debates, as well as in risk communication; (7) guideline developers should make evidence-based judgements that balance epidemiological and pragmatic concerns to maximize the communicability, credibility and general effectiveness of guidelines; and (8) as with scientific judgements, pragmatic judgements should be reported transparently.

### Generating evidence for new high-risk medical devices [^47a69c6f]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Evidence is the currency that medical device developers create from the data of clinical and other studies to support adoption of their products into healthcare. The evidence is used by a range of stakeholders (box 1) in determining whether a new device will be marketed, paid for by health insurance and adopted. Regulators need evidence on safety, performance and efficacy. Health technology assessment (HTA) organizations, payers and policy-makers are interested in clinical and cost-effectiveness. Clinicians and patients want to know about comparative effectiveness, ease of use, durability, and risks in the short and long term.

Box 1
Range of stakeholders, for whom a spectrum of evidence is needed

Regulators (eg, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA; Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK).
Health Technology Assessment organizations.
Policy-makers.
Payers (commissioners, insurance companies, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)).
Clinicians.
Hospital procurement managers.
Patients and caregivers.

Much has been written about the challenges facing medical device developers in producing all the evidence needed for a new device to become widely used in patient care. These challenges are especially difficult for small companies and developers. Trials are vexed by learning curves and rapid iterations of device design, adding to the difficulties of choosing appropriate comparators and outcomes. Speed of evidence generation matters because it is a costly process. The life cycle of most medical devices is short, so delays in getting the device to market will reduce the duration of profitable marketing and may make it non-viable. If a new device offers real advantages to patients, there are public health reasons for enabling patient access with minimal delay.

This article explores the evidence needed to satisfy the range of stakeholders. It describes changes being introduced by regulators in the evidence they require for high-risk devices. While challenging, efficient generation of evidence can be achievable through good planning early in the product development cycle.

### Qualitative assessment of risk for monkeypox associated with domestic trade in certain animal species, United States [^69bd6572]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Risk Characterization

Table 2 provides summary information on the qualitative variables considered in the risk characterization. We evaluated the probability of human monkeypox infection that resulted from certain types of exposure or contact (direct or indirect) to animals (infected or noninfected) and qualitatively estimated the probability and, to a lesser extent, the possible severity of infection. Most confirmed human cases in the United States were associated with direct, close contact with infected prairie dogs. We characterize as type I direct contact with the animal and as type II direct contact that also involves bites, scratches, or other contact with the mucous membranes or nonintact skin of the affected person. Infection through aerosolized particles without direct animal contact, or by some other less direct method, as well as human-to-human transmission, cannot be ruled out. The probability of infection is dependent on whether the animal is infectious (shedding virus) and varies with the level of shedding and the nature of human-animal interactions (type, frequency, and duration of contact). We assume, on the basis of the data described above, that the primary means of transmission affecting the risk would be from animal to human.

Table 2
Variables considered in characterizing risk for human monkeypox cases and the degree of uncertainty associated with these variables

Several categories were established to define and qualitatively characterize the risks. Low risk denoted no direct human contact with a captive animal(s); even if animal infection status was unknown or the animal was infected, the exposure to the animal was likely insufficient for animal-to-human disease transmission to occur. Medium risk described human contact that was direct but the exposure involved type I contact with a potentially infected animal or animal(s) of unknown infectious status. High risk designated direct human contact and involved a type II contact with a captive animal(s) infected with MPXV or with unknown infection status but likely MPXV exposure. Finally, the term severity of infection and illness denoted any individual infection with MPXV that should be considered serious and potentially fatal. The risk to the persons and the risk for the spread of the disease to others made MPXV infection a potentially serious public health matter.

### Newborn health benefits or financial risk protection? An ethical analysis of a real-life dilemma in a setting without universal health coverage [^6f9f441b]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Health benefits or financial risk protection?

The stakes are high in the micro-level dilemmas families and health workers face in settings without UHC. The empirically derived case is constructed, but we have reason to believe that patients, next of kins and healthcare professionals face similar choices in settings where healthcare is largely financed OOP. The ethical dilemma concerns what to do when family members or health workers cannot both improve health and protect against financial risk. For the father and mother: should they sell their seeds to pay for treatment, or not? For the health worker: should she advise the parents to seek care at the hospital, or not? At worst, their choices can cause newborn death, economic disaster or both.

Central in this dilemma is the value judgement on whether to take well-being beyond health outcomes into account or not. Should we consider only direct health benefits or include non-health and indirect benefits? Brock has argued that "different activities have different distinct purposes". The purposes of these activities, such as healthcare services to improve health, should determine their "proper sphere", and goods and resources should be distributed based on the activities they produce. While the argument to separate allocation of health and non-health benefits may hold in an ideal world, the pragmatic reality seen in the real-life dilemmas illustrated in our case shows how spheres are not separated at household level. As long as patients pay OOP for healthcare services, families' decisions are constrained by one budget, and both health and non-health concerns are taken into account in intra-household decisions. Persad and du Toit argue that relying on separate spheres through "tunnel-vision approaches" in health policies is a mistake.

### Altering the availability or proximity of food, alcohol, and tobacco products to change their selection and consumption [^16e70424]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Overconsumption of food, alcohol, and tobacco products increases the risk of non-communicable diseases. Interventions to change characteristics of physical micro-environments where people may select or consume these products - including shops, restaurants, workplaces, and schools - are of considerable public health policy and research interest. This review addresses two types of intervention within such environments: altering the availability (the range and/or amount of options) of these products, or their proximity (the distance at which they are positioned) to potential consumers.

Objectives

1. To assess the impact on selection and consumption of altering the availability or proximity of (a) food (including non-alcoholic beverages), (b) alcohol, and (c) tobacco products.2. To assess the extent to which the impact of these interventions is modified by characteristics of: i. studies, ii. interventions, and iii.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and seven other published or grey literature databases, as well as trial registries and key websites, up to 23 July 2018, followed by citation searches.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials with between-participants (parallel group) or within-participants (cross-over) designs. Eligible studies compared effects of exposure to at least two different levels of availability of a product or its proximity, and included a measure of selection or consumption of the manipulated product.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used a novel semi-automated screening workflow and applied standard Cochrane methods to select eligible studies, collect data, and assess risk of bias. In separate analyses for availability interventions and proximity interventions, we combined results using random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression models to estimate summary effect sizes (as standardised mean differences (SMDs)) and to investigate associations between summary effect sizes and selected study, intervention, or participant characteristics. We rated the certainty of evidence for each outcome using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 24 studies, with the majority (20/24) giving concerns about risk of bias. All of the included studies investigated food products; none investigated alcohol or tobacco. The majority were conducted in laboratory settings (14/24), with adult participants (17/24), and used between-participants designs (19/24). All studies were conducted in high-income countries, predominantly in the USA (14/24). Six studies investigated availability interventions, of which two changed the absolute number of different options available, and four altered the relative proportion of less-healthy (to healthier) options. Most studies (4/6) manipulated snack foods or drinks. For selection outcomes, meta-analysis of three comparisons from three studies (n = 154) found that exposure to fewer options resulted in a large reduction in selection of the targeted food(s): SMD -1.13 (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.90 to -0.37) (low certainty evidence). For consumption outcomes, meta-analysis of three comparisons from two studies (n = 150) found that exposure to fewer options resulted in a moderate reduction in consumption of those foods, but with considerable uncertainty: SMD -0.55 (95% CI -1.27 to 0.18) (low certainty evidence). Eighteen studies investigated proximity interventions. Most (14/18) changed the distance at which a snack food or drink was placed from the participants, whilst four studies changed the order of meal components encountered along a line. For selection outcomes, only one study with one comparison (n = 41) was identified, which found that food placed farther away resulted in a moderate reduction in its selection: SMD -0.65 (95% CI -1.29 to -0.01) (very low certainty evidence). For consumption outcomes, meta-analysis of 15 comparisons from 12 studies (n = 1098) found that exposure to food placed farther away resulted in a moderate reduction in its consumption: SMD -0.60 (95% CI -0.84 to -0.36) (low certainty evidence). Meta-regression analyses indicated that this effect was greater: the farther away the product was placed; when only the targeted product(s) was available; when participants were of low deprivation status; and when the study was at high risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

The current evidence suggests that changing the number of available food options or altering the positioning of foods could contribute to meaningful changes in behaviour, justifying policy actions to promote such changes within food environments. However, the certainty of this evidence as assessed by GRADE is low or very low. To enable more certain and generalisable conclusions about these potentially important effects, further research is warranted in real-world settings, intervening across a wider range of foods - as well as alcohol and tobacco products - and over sustained time periods.

### Valuing utility offsets to regulations affecting addictive or habitual… [^f33e9bb6]. aspe.hhs.gov (2015). Low credibility.

There are several reasons to believe that consumption of addictive and habitual goods does not conform to the simple economics of consumer choice. First, consumers may not be fully informed about all costs, benefits and risks associated with such products. Information may be costly to acquire, complex and difficult to interpret. Or it may be deliberately distorted by companies aiming to promote their products. A second set of factors relates to the nature of the addictive and habitually-consumed products and ability to make rational choices. For example in the case of cigarettes young people may systematically misjudge or deny their likelihood of becoming addicted. Regular smokers may misjudge their ability to quit or underweight consequences of their consumption that occur in the distant future. Addiction and habituation will tend to make such errors in choice cumulate over time.

For example, advertisements that make smoking appear sophisticated, mature, or "cool" might induce people to smoke without fully considering the long-term health costs. It also may occur if consumers find it difficult to act in accordance with their preferences, instead acting impulsively and finding it challenging to exercise self-control, or reacting emotionally without carefully considering the consequences of their behavior. Examples abound – we make numerous decisions in the face of limited information, and often have problems eating less, exercising more, and engaging in other activities that are likely to provide significant benefits in the long run, even as we express a desire to do so. In some cases, the product itself has attributes that make it difficult to consume in a rational way. This is a particular concern in the case of addictive or habitual goods.

Even when people know about the long-term health costs of a product, they may believe that they will not become addicted, that the health harms will happen only to others, or that quitting will be easy when they are eventually motivated to do so. In such cases, regulation may aid individuals in becoming better informed and acting more in accordance with their own preferences. Consumption decisions are not driven solely by health considerations. Other factors likely to affect willingness to pay include the utility people receive from consuming the product. For cigarettes, these may potentially include relaxation, increased attention, projecting a certain identity, or enjoying the experience of smoking. For foods that are high in calories, fats, or sugar, they may include taste, convenience, or brand loyalty.

3 Taken as a whole, the analysis shows that regulatory analyses need to directly address the degree to which regulatory-induced changes in consumption of addictive or habitual goods add to or subtract from welfare, rather than simply make assumptions based on economic theory.

### European perspective on risk management and drug safety [^2c0746e1]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Risk management is an approach that has been used for many years in areas of business and government such as finance and insurance, but its use in the regulation of medicines has until recently been limited to tools such as the prescription status of a medicine (prescription-only or over-the-counter), the information provided to health-care professionals and patients, and the collection and evaluation of postmarketing safety reports.

### Personalised risk communication for informed decision making about taking screening tests [^aeba7571]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

There is a trend towards greater patient involvement in healthcare decisions. Adequate discussion of the risks and benefits associated with different choices is often required if involvement is to be genuine and effective. Achieving both the adequate involvement of consumers and informed decision making are now seen as important goals for any screening programme. Personalised risk estimates have been shown to be effective methods of risk communication in general, but the effectiveness of different strategies has not previously been examined.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different types of personalised risk communication for consumers making decisions about taking screening tests.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (1985 to December 2005), EMBASE (1985 to December 2005), CINAHL (1985 to December 2005), and PsycINFO (1989 to December 2005). Follow-up searches involved hand searching Preventive Medicine, citation searches on seven authors, and searching reference lists of articles. For the original version of this review (Edwards 2003c) we also searched CancerLit (1985 to 2001) and Science Citation Index Expanded (searched March 2002).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials addressing the decision by consumers of whether or not to undergo screening, incorporating an intervention with a 'personalised risk communication element' and reporting cognitive, affective, or behavioural outcomes. A 'personalised risk communication element' is based on the individual's own risk factors for a condition (such as age or family history). It may be calculated from an individual's risk factors using formulae derived from epidemiological data, and presented as an absolute or relative risk or as a risk score, or it may be categorised into, for example, high, medium or low risk groups. It may be less detailed still, involving a listing, for example, of a consumer's risk factors as a focus for discussion and intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed each trial for quality and extracted data. We extracted data about the nature and setting of the intervention, and relevant outcome data, along with items relating to methodological quality. We then used standard statistical methods of the Consumers and Communication Review Group to combine data using MetaView, including analysis according to different levels of detail of personalised risk communication, different condition for screening, and studies based only on high risk participants rather than people at 'average' risk.

Main Results

Twenty-two studies were included, nine of which were added in the 2006 update of this review. There was weak evidence, consistent with a small effect, that personalised risk communication (whether written, spoken or visually presented) increases uptake of screening tests (odds ratio (OR) 1.31 (random effects, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.77). In three studies the interventions showed a trend towards more accurate risk perception (OR 1.65 (95% CI 0.96 to 2.81), and three other trials with heterogenous outcome measures showed improvements in knowledge with personalised risk interventions. There was little other evidence from these studies that the interventions promoted or achieved informed decision making by consumers about participation in screening. More detailed personalised risk communication may be associated with a smaller increase in uptake of tests. That is, for personalised risk communication which used and presented numerical calculations of risk, the OR for test uptake was 0.82 (95% CI 0.65 to 1.03). For risk estimates or calculations which were categorised into high, medium or low strata of risk, the OR was 1.42 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.89). For risk communication that simply listed personal risk factors the OR was 1.42 (95% CI 0.95 to 2.12). Over half of the included studies assessed interventions in the context of mammography. These studies showed similar effects to the overall dataset. The five studies examining risk communication in high risk individuals (individuals at higher risk due to, for example, a family history of breast cancer or other conditions) showed larger odds ratios for uptake of tests than the other studies (random effects OR 1.74; 95% CI 1.05 to 2.88). There were insufficient data from the included studies to report odds ratios on other key outcomes such as: intention to take tests, anxiety, satisfaction with decisions, decisional conflict, knowledge and resource use.

Authors' Conclusions

Personalised risk communication (as currently implemented in the included studies) may have a small effect on increasing uptake of screening tests, and there is only limited evidence that the interventions have promoted or achieved informed decision making by consumers.

### EANM guideline on quality risk management for radiopharmaceuticals [^f49fdb23]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

3) Risk control

The outcome of risk control is a conscious decision regarding risk acceptance or reduction. The aim is to reduce all risks to an acceptable level, if possible and appropriate. The rationale for accepting the risk must be stated on a case-by-case basis:
Which risks can be accepted because of their low level?
Which risks can and need to be reduced or eliminated?
Which risks cannot be reduced but are acceptable or require the cancellation of the assessed project?

In the first case (a), the risk is deemed acceptable, because its level is so low that specific actions are not necessary.

In the second case (b), the impact on product quality, efficacy or patient safety is so severe (unacceptable), that control measures must be implemented to reduce or eliminate the risk. These risk reducing activities can either decrease the occurrence (by validation and training activities) or increase the detectability (by additional quality controls or checks). It is not possible to change the severity for any given risk. The decision to reduce the risk may entail implementation of corrective and preventative actions, redesign of processes and writing or reviewing of documents.

In the third case (c), the risk is estimated unacceptable, but it is not possible to reduce it, or reduction is not considered feasible, so that the proposed control measures are rejected.

4) Risk communication

The extent of risk communication is related to the size and complexity of the production site and organisation but is of utmost importance. Risk communication should occur throughout the whole risk assessment process and should therefore be embedded in the risk management process. The importance of risk communication and who should be informed at which stage of the process should be clearly described in the associated procedure. While initiating a risk assessment process, it can be helpful to share the information for risk identification and evaluation with all relevant personnel in the organisation. At the very least, the completed risk assessment document should be adequately communicated to all relevant personnel.

5) Risk review

Once an assessment has been completed and corrective/preventative actions implemented when deemed appropriate, a review of the entire assessment process must be performed to assess its effectiveness. The risk review process should be embedded in the risk management process and should be clearly described in the risk management procedure. The outcome of the assessment should be reviewed:
Regularly to consider new knowledge and experience
After changes to assess their impact

### Characteristics of clinical studies conducted over the total product life cycle of high-risk therapeutic medical devices receiving FDA premarket approval in 2010 and 2011 [^72773fac]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves high-risk medical devices, those that support or sustain human life or present potential unreasonable risk to patients, via the Premarket Approval (PMA) pathway. The generation of clinical evidence to understand device safety and effectiveness is shifting from predominantly premarket to continual study throughout the total product life cycle.

Objective

To characterize the clinical evidence generated for high-risk therapeutic devices over the total product life cycle.

Design and Setting

All clinical studies of high-risk therapeutic devices receiving initial market approval via the PMA pathway in 2010 and 2011 identified through ClinicalTrials.gov and publicly available FDA documents as of October 2014.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Studies were characterized by type (pivotal, studies that served as the basis of FDA approval; FDA-required postapproval studies [PAS]; or manufacturer/investigator-initiated); premarket or postmarket; status (completed, ongoing, or terminated/unknown); and design features, including enrollment, comparator, and longest duration of primary effectiveness end point follow-up.

Results

In 2010 and 2011, 28 high-risk therapeutic devices received initial marketing approval via the PMA pathway. We identified 286 clinical studies of these devices: 82 (28.7%) premarket and 204 (71.3%) postmarket, among which there were 52 (18.2%) nonpivotal premarket studies, 30 (10.5%) pivotal premarket studies, 33 (11.5%) FDA-required PAS, and 171 (59.8%) manufacturer/investigator-initiated postmarket studies. Six of 33 (18.2%) PAS and 20 of 171 (11.7%) manufacturer/investigator-initiated postmarket studies were reported as completed. No postmarket studies were identified for 5 (17.9%) devices; 3 or fewer were identified for 13 (46.4%) devices overall. Median enrollment was 65 patients (interquartile range [IQR], 25–111), 241 patients (IQR, 147–415), 222 patients (IQR, 119–640), and 250 patients (IQR, 60–800) for nonpivotal premarket, pivotal, FDA-required PAS, and manufacturer/investigator-initiated postmarket studies, respectively. Approximately half of all studies used no comparator (pivotal: 13/30 [43.3%]; completed postmarket: 16/26 [61.5%]; ongoing postmarket: 70/153 [45.8%]). Median duration of primary effectiveness end point follow-up was 3.0 months (IQR, 3.0–12.0), 9.0 months (IQR, 0.3–12.0), and 12.0 months (IQR, 7.0–24.0) for pivotal, completed postmarket, and ongoing postmarket studies, respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among high-risk therapeutic devices approved via the FDA PMA pathway, total product life cycle evidence generation varied in both the number and quality of premarket and postmarket studies, with approximately 13% of initiated postmarket studies completed between 3 and 5 years after FDA approval.

### Avoiding conflicts of interest and reputational risks associated with population research on food and nutrition: the food research risK (FoRK) guidance and toolkit for researchers [^f5f92f56]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

How to use the FoRK guidance and toolkit

Here, we briefly summarise how the FoRK guidance and toolkit should be used. Figure 1 illustrates the stages of the research process at which each tool should be used. We encourage researchers to use the toolkit when they are first considering interacting with a commercial food sector organisation (eg, a food company, a trade association, or industry funded think tank). Familiarisation with the challenges of safely interacting with such organisations, as well as the kinds of information needed to make decisions, will help researchers use the tools effectively. The toolkit is divided into two parts. Tools A and B are intended to help researchers decide about interacting with a commercial food sector organisation, whereas tools C-E are intended to support decision making among researchers committed to working with a commercial food sector organisation. Tools C-E thus aim to minimise the negative impacts of an interaction on scientific integrity.

We recommend that researchers start by using tool A, part 1 when they are thinking about interacting with a commercial food sector organisation. This tool takes researchers through several questions that will help achieve clarity on whether to interact with an organisation (including circumstances under which interaction might or should be avoided), and if proceeding with industry interaction, how to minimise the risk of undue industry influence. The tool focuses in particular on the levels of risk associated with different types of organisations. Tool A, part 2 goes a step further by exploring the types of interactions that are envisaged and helps researchers to assess the risks and benefits of each. The two parts of tool A enable researchers to see that there are greater risks to research integrity associated with some types of organisation and interaction. Through a systematic process, completing these tools will help researchers to decide the level of risk they are prepared to accept for anticipated benefits. Tool B brings together the risk and benefit assessments completed in tool A to provide an overall assessment. While such an overall score is ultimately arbitrary, it provides a helpful guide to the overall level of risk for researchers to consider before proceeding.

### The burden of proof studies: assessing the evidence of risk [^2ff53cef]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

While the general public and committees formulating guidelines on individual behaviors — such as recommended diets — should pay attention to the star ratings, policy-makers should consider the impact of all risk–outcome pairs, not only those with high star ratings. These higher-star relationships should reassure decision-makers that the evidence supporting a risk factor is strong, but it would be unwise for decision-makers to ignore all one- and two-star risk–outcome pairs. The precautionary principle implies that public policy should pay attention to all potential risks. Lower star rating risk–outcome pairs may turn out to be null as evidence accumulates, but it is unlikely that a set of one-star risks will all turn out to be null. Public policy to address risks, even those where the BPRF indicates that risk is small or even nonexistent, will, on average, improve health. At the same time, investing in more widespread data collection for pairs with lower star ratings will reduce uncertainty and allow policy-makers to be more strategic in addressing potential risks (as star ratings may go up or down with more evidence). For example, due to very high heterogeneity between studies, a conservative interpretation of the available evidence suggests that there is weak to no evidence of an association between red meat consumption and ischemic heart disease. There is, therefore, a critical need for more large-scale, high-quality studies on red meat consumption so policy-makers can make better-informed decisions about how to prioritize policies that address this potential risk. Moreover, public policy should pay attention not only to the risk functions that are supported by evidence but the prevalence of exposure to those risks. For example, a two-star risk with high prevalence of exposure could pose a greater risk at the population level than a five-star risk with low prevalence of exposure. The GBD CRA – provides a framework for incorporating the BPRF, the prevalence of exposure and the background rates of specific outcomes to help policy-makers evaluate the importance of risk–outcome pairs across the full range of star ratings. In the future, risk–outcome pairs with one- and two-star ratings should be investigated further through more robust, well-powered research, especially for those risks where exposure and outcome are common, so policy-makers and individuals alike can better understand whether there is a real association between risk and outcome.

### Beyond the 510 (k): the regulation of novel moderate-risk medical devices, intellectual property considerations, and innovation incentives in the FDA's De novo pathway [^114ac98e]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Moderate-risk medical devices constitute 99% of those that have been regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since it gained authority to regulate medical technology nearly five decades ago. This article presents an analysis of the interaction between the 510(k) process -the historically dominant path to market for most medical devices- and the De Novo pathway, a more recent alternative that targets more novel devices, including those involving new technologies, diagnostics, hardware, and software. The De Novo pathway holds significant potential for innovators seeking to define new categories of medical devices, as it represents a less burdensome approach than would have otherwise been needed historically. Moreover, it supports the FDA in its effort to modernize the long-established 510(k) pathway by promoting the availability of up-to-date device "predicates" upon which subsequent device applications can be based, reflecting positive spillovers that are likely to encourage manufacturers to adopt current state-of-the-art technologies and modern standards of safety and effectiveness. We analyze the of characteristics all the De Novo classification requests to date, including the submission type, trends, FDA review times, and device types. After characterizing how the De Novo process has been used over time, we discuss its unique challenges and opportunities with respect to medical device software and AI-enabled devices, including considerations for intellectual property, innovation, and competition economics.

### Precision reimbursement for precision medicine: using real-world evidence to evolve from trial-and-project to track-and-pay to learn-and-predict [^58448ec6]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

NEW THERAPIES CREATE CHALLENGES FOR TRADITIONAL HEALTHCARE REIMBURSEMENT

Reliance on average results from RCTs for pricing and access will become even more problematic in the context of precision medicine when, due to small numbers of patients available and/or ethical considerations, RCTs may not be feasible or are so small that projections to real‐world populations effectiveness creates such large confidence intervals that a priori average results are not useful for value determination. Measuring effect size in precision medicine can be additionally complicated by uncertainty in durability of effect and for individualized treatments.

Innovative precision medicines often come with additional challenges for payors: price tags to match, nonconventional administration schedules or treatment settings, and a range of uncertainties unresolved by their regulatory‐oriented clinical trials. In addition, these therapies may serve significant underserved populations whose seeking of relief may create financial tsunamis for payors. Paradoxically, innovations for ultra‐rare diseases can also create financial challenges for smaller payors due to their actuarial volatility. Furthermore, high price tags and limited types of "traditional" evidence may create conflict by limiting payors' willingness to cover drugs in populations that were not explicitly studied but where there may be a reasonable likelihood of a positive response based upon the underlying biology. Rare, expensive events make budgeting difficult in small populations.

The development of cell‐ and gene‐based therapies raises the possibility that (rare) diseases with severe unmet need may be significantly slowed down or cured after a single course of treatment. These therapies represent another foreseeable reimbursement challenge to current healthcare systems: upfront cost can be substantial and is often incurred all‐at‐once, but patient benefits are accrued over a longer period. Durability could extend for years or even a lifetime but may be unknown at the time of initial access discussions. Depending on healthcare environment, patients may move from payor to payor, so the benefit may occur in another payor when the original payor had paid the claim. This disrupts the normal payment paradigm for chronic treatments for chronic diseases, wherein reimbursement occurs in parallel with the recognition of benefits. However, this is not different from many other (non‐drug) medical interventions with evidence gaps.

Thus, performance uncertainty, payment timing, and actuarial risk issues converge to present novel financial challenges for healthcare payors. Unsurprisingly, payors have been increasingly wary of covering for such drugs within their traditional trial‐and‐project frameworks. Their reluctance creates obstacles for timely patient access to precision medicines.

### The law of diminishing returns in clinical medicine: how much risk reduction is enough? [^29e1cf88]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The law of diminishing returns, first described by economists to explain why, beyond a certain point, additional inputs produce smaller and smaller outputs, offers insight into many situations encountered in clinical medicine. For example, when the risk of an adverse event can be reduced in several different ways, the impact of each intervention can generally be shown mathematically to be reduced by the previous ones. The diminishing value of successive interventions is further reduced by adverse consequences (eg, drug-drug, drug-disease, and drug-nutrient interactions), as well as by the total expenditures of time, energy, and resources, which increase with each additional intervention. It is therefore important to try to prioritize interventions based on patient-centered goals and the relative impact and acceptability of the interventions. We believe that this has implications for clinical practice, research, and policy.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^19e247c8]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Interpretation of results of hypothesis-generating interviews — Good judgment is required and a general approach assumes that a sufficient number of cases have been interviewed (e.g., at least eight); if none of the persons interviewed report a specific exposure, the hypothesis is no longer viable and most likely can be dropped from subsequent study; if more than 50% of persons interviewed report an exposure, that exposure should be studied further; if fewer than 50% of persons report an exposure, that exposure still might be of interest, particularly if it is difficult to recognize or unusual; implicated food items should have been eaten by most of the cases, but previously identified risk factors should not be ruled out just because fewer than half of cases reported the exposure, particularly if the exposure is unusual or difficult to recognize.

### Current and future trends in the consumption, sale and purchasing of alcohol-free and low-alcohol products in great britain, 2014 to 2023 [^1c1dbd5d]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Indicators of no/lo sales, purchasing and consumption

We use seven indicators of no/lo sales, purchasing and consumption, which are calculated from our four datasets and are, therefore, available for different time periods (see Supporting information, Appendix A1 for dataset, time period and the frequency and number of data points). Indicators using sales and purchasing data may be affected by stockpiling, where consumers buy products and keep them for some time before consumption. We selected these indicators in consultation with the UK Department of Health and Social Care as the current analyses were designed to inform their policy development and monitoring. Our indicators are as follows:
Percentage of total on‐trade alcohol sales volume that is no/lo: the numerator and denominator are both expressed in servings (see above).
Percentage of total off‐trade alcohol sales volume that is no/lo: the numerator and denominator are both expressed in servings (see above).
Percentage of on‐trade outlets offering a no/lo beer on draught: draught beer is dispensed into glass from a tap on the bar, as opposed to sold in a bottle or can, and is, therefore, more visible to the consumer. The denominator for the percentage is the total number of licensed outlets. Increasing the availability of draught no/lo beer is attractive to policy‐makers because it makes these products more visible and normalised. It may also improve perceived value for money by increasing the serving size of no/lo beers and improve perceived quality where consumers prefer draught beer to packaged alternatives.
Percentage of households who do not normally purchase alcohol that are purchasing no/lo products (off‐trade only): calculated in KWP for each week based on whether households in the sample in that week have purchased no/lo and alcoholic drinks in the preceding year. Households not present continuously in the survey for at least 12 months were excluded from analyses using this measure as they could not be robustly identified as non‐alcohol purchasers in the last year.
Percentage of increasing or higher risk households who are increasing their purchasing of no/lo products relative to alcohol products (off‐trade only): increasing or higher risk households are those that purchased more than 14 units (1 UK unit = 8 g/10 mL ethanol) of alcohol per adult in the household per week on average over the previous 12 months. For each increasing or higher risk household in KWP each week, we calculated the number of no/lo servings and standard alcohol servings purchased during the previous 52 weeks. We, then, calculated no/lo servings and standard alcohol servings purchased during the current week and previous 51 weeks, and identified whether they purchased a greater proportion of no/lo servings compared to standard alcohol servings in this more recent period. We, then, calculated the percentage of households whose no/lo purchasing increased relative to standard alcohol. As above, households not present continuously in the survey for at least 12 months and 1 week consecutively were excluded from analyses using this measure.
Percentage of households who are increasing their purchasing of no/lo products and decreasing their purchasing of alcohol products: this is similar to indicators 4 and 5 except indicator 6 includes all alcohol‐purchasing households and, instead of calculating a ratio, identifying households where there was an increase in purchased servings of no/lo drinks and a decrease in servings of standard alcoholic drinks.
Percentage of hazardous or harmful drinkers who are trying to cut down their alcohol consumption that used no/lo products in their most recent attempt: the ATS did not include no/lo products as a method of cutting down in England in five waves (May 2022, July 2022, September 2022, November 2022, December 2022, July 2023), but did include it in Wales and Scotland. We, therefore, used multiple imputations to estimate data for England in these waves (see Supporting information, Appendix Section 3 for details). We calculated a monthly time series for the percentage of respondents per wave who used no/lo in their most recent attempt to cut down. The analysis was not pre‐registered, and therefore, the results should be considered exploratory.

### Nutritional labelling for healthier food or non-alcoholic drink purchasing and consumption [^23a0345f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Potential harms associated with labelling

Based on the analyses described above, there was no evidence that nutritional labelling had the unintended harm of increasing energy purchased or consumed. Indirect evidence concerning potential harm came from five laboratory studies that involved mislabelling content for a single nutrient (i.e. placing low energy or low fat labels on high‐energy foods) during a snack or meal. A meta‐analysis of these five studies did not demonstrate a statistically significant increase in energy (kcal) consumed, and the effect size was small (Cohen 1988). However, the confidence intervals were wide, suggesting uncertainty in the true effect size. We considered the quality of the evidence from these studies to be very low, providing very little confidence in the effect estimate.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

We used an extensive search strategy involving a comprehensive range of databases and other sources and, whilst possible, it is unlikely that we missed relevant references. In addition, we included only studies with objectively assessed outcomes, thus increasing the applicability of the evidence to actual behaviour. However, the applicability of the evidence was limited by several study characteristics. Most (21/28) studies took place in the USA and none were in low‐ or middle‐income countries. Furthermore, many of the studies took place in university settings (19/28), and 17 took place in artificial or laboratory settings. While the review results are necessarily limited to the foods and drinks evaluated in the included studies, these encompassed a range of foods including fast food and other meals, soft drinks and snacks. The extent to which the results of this review are applicable beyond North American university settings or laboratory settings is uncertain. For one of the meta‐analyses (Analysis 4.1), we acknowledge that the probable lack of consistency in the distributions of values associated with the different outcome measures is a potential limitation, constraining the extent to which the SD units are comparable across the studies.

One of the strengths of this review is that we included all types of nutritional labels. This review, however, did not set out to compare labels in terms of content or format. Thus, the results apply to nutritional labelling in general.

Quality of the evidence

We assessed the quality of the evidence included in this review as low or very low using GRADE criteria. These low ratings were largely due to the large number of studies with a high risk of bias, imprecision in the pooled effect estimates, and unknown applicability of laboratory studies to real‐world settings.

### Refining the benefit-risk framework for the assessment of medicines: valuing and weighting benefit and risk parameters [^ec032b1d]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

A common framework is necessary for the transparent articulation of the benefits and risks of a therapeutic product across disparate stakeholders. The assignment of value and weighting to each component parameter presents challenges deriving from different stakeholder objectives, methods, and perspectives. Building on prior experiences with a validated framework approach, this forum focused on identifying challenges and approaches to the assignment of values and weightings using a case study applied to a hypothetical medicinal product.

Workshop participants were asked to take the first steps toward defining a framework for benefit-risk (BR) assessment. The framework identifies the essential elements that both regulators and companies should consider throughout the development, review, and postmarketing experience of new medicines in order to apply a consistent approach toward the assessment of BR balance.

### Financial challenges of being on long-term, high-cost medications [^db14bced]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

How Medications Are Approved and Priced

United States

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves medications for use after rigorous testing and safety evaluations. The first stage involves preclinical research, in which the drug is tested using cell cultures, animal testing, and biological assays for both safety and therapeutic purposes. The drug sponsor must submit an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) before conducting human trials. The drug then undergoes Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 testing before filing for a New Drug Application (NDA). Traditionally, Phase 1 trials involve testing the drug's safety in a group of healthy volunteers (although this is often not the case for oncology drugs which are typically tested in patients with relapsed/refractory malignancies), Phase 2 tests the drug in people who have the condition the drug is meant to treat and seeks to optimize its dose and treatment schedule, and Phase 3 studies are larger, often randomized, trials that are used to confirm the drug's effectiveness and side effect profile. These phases are not fixed and may differ based on the disease, especially for rare cancers. After these phases, the sponsor files an NDA with the FDA, which then determines whether to approve the drug for human use. Postmarketing surveillance, also called Phase 4 testing, refers to ongoing monitoring after a drug's approval to confirm safety and efficacy. Many other countries use a similar system to approve drugs, although, unlike the United States, almost all other high-income countries have a 2-step approval process, where the second step, health technology assessment (HTA), assesses the incremental clinical value of a drug in its disease context and, in many jurisdictions, its cost-effectiveness.

### Who is responsible for evaluating the safety and effectiveness of medical devices? The role of independent technology assessment [^13e62dc8]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

The global medical technology industry brings thousands of devices to market every year. However, significant gaps persist in the scientific literature, in the medical device approval process, and in the realm of postmarketing surveillance. Although thousands of drugs obtain approval only after review in randomized controlled trials, relatively few new medical devices are subject to comparable scrutiny.

Objective

To improve health outcomes, we must enhance our scrutiny of medical devices, and, without simply deferring to the Food and Drug Administration, we must ask ourselves: Who is responsible for evaluating the safety and effectiveness of medical devices?

Conclusions

Technology assessments by independent organizations are a part of the solution to this challenge and may motivate further research focused on patient outcomes.

### Avoiding conflicts of interest and reputational risks associated with population research on food and nutrition: the food research risK (FoRK) guidance and toolkit for researchers [^42a1c4ed]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Development of the FoRK guidance and toolkit

The FoRK guidance and toolkit were developed using a systematic, iterative process. We began with an event in 2015 for a diverse group of academic experts, debating the principles of how to engage the commercial food sector in population health research to serve the public interest. This event was followed by a systematic scoping review to identify the principles that have been used or proposed to govern interactions between the commercial food sector and population health researchers. The principles identified in the review then formed the basis of a two stage Delphi study of population health researchers to identify and build consensus on these key principles; and a survey of relevant, non-academic stakeholders, to identify their views on the principles.

While these studies identified key areas of consensus among researchers (ie, research governance, transparency, and publication), areas of disagreement remained. The principles that had the highest level of disagreement related to which commercial sector food organisations were considered by population health researchers to be appropriate to interact with, and whether interactions should involve accepting direct funding, attending industry sponsored events, or accepting in-kind funding.

We convened an international workshop to resolve the issues in April 2018. Forty one population health researchers from high, middle, and low income countries came together for two days in an independently facilitated event. We aimed to achieve clarity regarding minimising risks arising from interactions with the commercial food sector. Participants included leading figures in the specialty as well as early and mid-career researchers. The researchers represented the full breadth of interests at which the guidance is aimed. Participants also had a range of experiences of interacting with the commercial food sector, ranging from no contact at all (n = 30, 73%) to actively collaborating (n = 2, 5%) or receiving research grants from the commercial food sector (n = 9, 22%).

A range of issues was considered, with most of the workshop involving in-depth discussion of five themes identified from our previous researchrelevant to preventing or managing conflicts of interest: publication, transparency, research governance, funding, and risk assessment. The development of overarching guidance and associated tools to aid decision making throughout the research process received strong support, particularly in relation to risk assessment of potential commercial food sector organisations and governance of research processes, including protocol development, implementation of fieldwork and analysis, and publication.

### High radiative forcing climate scenario relevance analyzed with a ten-million-member ensemble [^aa1e58de]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

For the third application, low-probability but high-impact events are often of relevance to policymakers. As discussed further in the following paragraphs, the precise probability of exceedance becomes relevant in assessing risk in these contexts. This discussion of probability is also relevant to the choice of the high-end anchor for damage functions or by-degree analyses and for deciding the hottest post-2100 potential climate for which to simulate an analog. The question then becomes at what likelihood does a scenario become relevant. This depends in large part on the impact of the event in question. On the conservative end, Ansolabehere et al.recommended an annual risk of 1 in a million for a large, early release of radioactivity from a nuclear plant. On the risk-accepting end, few people would carry an umbrella with them if the probability of rain was less than 10%. However, these examples do not provide a good context for the appropriate choice of likelihood for a high-end climate scenario. Many potential examples involve repeated probabilities for individual events that can happen at multiple locations (e.g. the nuclear example or the choice of the 1 in 100-year flooding event for floodplain analysis). In contrast, climate change involves a global, accumulating problem where the probability of a high-end scenario is a function of socioeconomic assumptions and uncertainty in basic scientific parameters. We choose 1% as a policy relevant probability for a high-end scenario for generalized climate analysis purposes, though recognizing that others could choose a different threshold. Several considerations are relevant for these three applications. There is the choice to focus on the probability of exceeding radiative forcing rather than emissions. There are challenges involved in characterizing uncertainty, particularly for low-probability tails of distributions. And there is the recognition that even if there are good reasons to include a high scenario in an analysis, that scenario is not necessarily the most plausible scenario.

### What role should the commercial food system play in promoting health through better diet? [^859b06fc]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Achieving growth

The commercial food system has achieved continual economic growth through a range of actions: increased agricultural productivity reducing the cost of inputs; increased processing that simultaneously reduces the costs of production and distribution, lowers prices, and increases palatability and convenience of foods to consumers; intensive and targeted marketing of foods with the greatest added value from processing; and increased economies of scale, consolidation, and extension of markets across nations. Economies of scale have been achieved through acquisitions, mergers, vertical and horizontal integration across the supply chain, proliferation of multinational companies, and using low wage economies (fig 1 and table 1).

Fig 1
The commercial processed food system, influences on human health, and external costs to society (NCDs = non-communicable diseases)

Table 1
Key characteristics of the commercial food system, actions to deal with challenges to population health, and unanswered research questions

Highly processed foods are palatable and satisfy human taste for salty and sweet foods. Despite their convenience, palatability, longer shelf life, improved food safety, endless choice, and affordability for consumers, highly processed foods are widely criticised for not contributing to a healthy diet. Aggressive marketing of such foods, often accompanied by health and nutrition claims (for example, "high in vitamins") that can obscure potential harms, drives and distorts consumer demand. Processed foods thus present a dilemma for public health, food policy, and consumer choice.

Recent growth in the sales of processed food, especially soft drinks, in low and middle income countries has been extraordinarily rapid. In many countries, a small number of food companies and retailers hold substantial economic power, owing to their size and the collective efforts of their trade associations. This power translates into substantial political influence nationally and internationally. Where the profitability of such companies is reliant on high volume sales of processed foods, their influence is often in direct conflict with health and sustainability efforts. In such circumstances, profits usually come first, resulting in food governance and public health policy that does not adequately balance public and commercial interests. Critically, the commercial food system does not adequately account for external costs, such as the environmental effects of intensive farming and food processing, the social costs of relying on low wage economies, and the effect on health of overconsumption of foods high in unhealthy ingredients and low in healthy ingredients (fig 1 and table 1). Food prices are therefore often artificially low, particularly for less healthy foods and those that have greater cost to the environment.

### Implications of the concept of minimal risk in research on informed choice in clinical practice [^7c35f1b3]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2015). Low credibility.

In terms of information regarding clinical procedures, the elements of disclosure and the reasonable patient standard may be suitable particularly for procedures that are deemed the standard of care as recommended in professional practice guidelines or resulting from legal cases. For less common clinical procedures, the subjective standard of disclosure may also be used as it enables clinicians to identify necessary information through communication with the patient as well as the patient's medical and social backgrounds. However, considering the time constraints of clinicians' practice, implementing a clinical minimal risk concept could further facilitate the process of determining risks to be discussed and those that require discussion only if raised by the patient. A clinical minimal risk concept may complement currently employed criteria regarding clinicians' risk disclosure in identifying whether a particular risk should be discussed for the patient's informed decision-making.

A clinical minimal risk concept may also have a role in evaluating a variety of risks in the patient's everyday life such as unhealthy diet, substance use or exposure to environmental chemicals, some of which remain uncertain in terms of their potential harm or are not necessarily addressed by clinical guidelines. Needless to say, it is ideal if all risk factors are evaluated at the level of professional bodies, regulatory agencies or society in general. Nonetheless, regulatory responses may not necessarily be timely enough for all potential health risks that are emergent while patients may be anxious about numerous risk factors through the media. Regarding some of these risks, it could be in the patient's best interest to be informed about them particularly if they potentially have significant consequences on health, that is, clearly above minimal risk, and if they are avoidable although uncertainties and the lack of regulatory recommendations should be communicated. Concerning these miscellaneous health risks, a clinical minimal risk concept may be used together with the existing criteria to guide clinicians.

### Strategies to manage drugs and devices approved based on limited evidence: results of a modified Delphi panel [^dc4d539f]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

Prescription drugs and medical devices are increasingly coming to market through expedited US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pathways that require only limited evidence of safety and efficacy, such as nonrandomized, unblinded trial data in small numbers of patients, or the use of surrogate end points. Reliance on more limited evidence means that there is often greater uncertainty about risks and benefits. Using a modified Delphi process, we sought to identify promising policy approaches that address physician-patient decision-making needs about the use of such drugs and medical devices. We convened 13 national leaders from academia, government, nonprofits, payors, and industry who had expertise in medical product regulation, payor policymaking, bioethics, physician practice, patient advocacy, public health expertise/advocacy, clinical trials, the pharmaceutical and device industry, institutional review board oversight, and real-world evidence. Through multiple rounds of voting and meetings focused on evaluating the feasibility and impact of various interventions, the 13 participants reached the broadest consensus on 4 interventions: strengthening FDA post-approval study requirements to ensure postmarket evidence is generated in a timely manner, better informing patients about the risks and benefits and level of evidence supporting therapies via simplified and patient-centered product information "boxes" modeled on nutrition labels, limiting prices for drugs and medical devices approved based on surrogate end point data until confirmatory clinical evidence is generated, and improving health professional education about FDA regulation to better support clinician use of drugs and devices as well as communication with patients.

### I 131 mini [^2bd129ad]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

I-131 THERAPY CAPSULE MARKET BACKGROUND

I-131 Therapy Capsule formulations provide an enhanced safety profile for nuclear medicine professionals. Oral solutions raise the risk for spills during administration in addition to the not uncommon scenario where very ill patients reject oral solution treatment; whereupon vomiting episodes create large areas of high level radiation spill. Oral solutions, however, are sold at deep discounts as compared to Therapy Capsules.

While many U.S. facilities have moved to adopt ALARA recommendations to reduce radiation exposure to healthcare workers which reasonably include routinely ordering encapsulated high activity I-131; the scenario also exists that the intended patient may not be able to swallow the Therapy Capsule for reasons including: the large size of competitive suppliers, as well as intubated, quadriplegia and/or severe swallowing difficulties. In these instances, it is particularly beneficial to have the ability to dissolve the capsule so that the patient may be treated on the same day, without having to order additional preparation.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^3932a726]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Pathogen-specific surveillance interview design — Interview forms that use a combination of question types should be used, as appropriate to the outbreak, and can include closed-ended questions to collect information about specific exposures, prompts to further describe exposures, and open-ended questions to identify unanticipated exposures. No one questionnaire will work for all investigations or surveillance systems, so investigators should consider the specifics of the outbreak and setting, the importance of collecting the information, and the likely trade-offs before deciding on content. Regardless of interview content, use of a standardized interview form with which the interviewer is familiar will decrease time spent on staff training and decrease errors in data collection; use of standardized core questions and data elements (e.g., asking about the same high-risk exposures such as sprouts, raw milk, ground beef, and leafy green vegetables) will enhance data sharing, enable comparisons among jurisdictions in multijurisdictional outbreaks, and possibly speed the resolution of commercial product outbreaks.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^69791a67]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Interpret results — integrated analysis and critical appraisal are directed. The outbreak investigator must use all available information to construct a coherent narrative of what happened and why. Results of epidemiologic studies must be integrated with results of informational product tracebacks, interviews of food workers, environmental health assessments, and food-product and environmental testing, and when all of these data elements support and explain the primary hypothesis, strong conclusions can be drawn. In this process, investigators should consider their data critically; statistical associations between exposure and illness may reflect a causal link but may also reflect confounding, bias, chance, and other factors, and conversely, failure to achieve a statistically significant association between illness and exposure may result from small sample size, contamination of multiple vehicles or unrecognized ingredients, or high background rates of exposure. Investigators should be wary of explanations that depend upon implausible scenarios, and minor inconsistencies are common and may be ignored, but large numbers of inconsistencies might indicate that alternate hypotheses need to be considered.

### Developing a social practice-based typology of British drinking culture in 2009–2011: implications for alcohol policy analysis [^37f5e202]. Addiction (2016). Low credibility.

Typology of occasions

Table 3 presents summaries of the eight types of drinking practice identified, with the full statistical results provided in Table 4. The most common practice is 'Light drinking at home with a partner', which accounts for 19.6% of occasions. Taken alongside 'Light drinking at home with family' and 'Drinking at home alone' this generally low‐risk, brief, regular, relaxing home drinking accounts for almost half (46.0%) of all occasions. However, home drinking is not always low risk. 'Heavy drinking at home with a partner' accounts for 9.4% of occasions. This practice always involves increasing or high‐risk consumption levels and is characterized typically by chilling out with wine on weekend evenings. Similarly, 'Get‐together at someone's house' accounts for 14.4% of occasions, and although these typically lengthy weekend gatherings of friends and/or family are often diverse in character, 46.0% involved drinking at increasing or high‐risk levels.

Table 3
Summary of the eight types of drinking occasion or practices identified by the latent class analysis of British drinking occasions 2009–11. a

Table 4
Full latent class model results characterizing eight types of drinking occasion.

High‐risk drinking was most likely to be found in a diverse practice described here as 'Mixed location heavy drinking'. This practice was more difficult to characterize but tended towards heavier drinking split between on‐ and off‐trade locations for a range of purposes, motivations and participants. It appears to incorporate nights out in urban centres with pre‐loading, relaxing drinking throughout the day with changes in location and company and also having a night out followed by a nightcap at home. The familiar urban centre 'big night out' with associated binge drinking may be split between this occasion type and 'Going out with friends', which does not include any off‐trade drinking (i.e. no pre‐loading) and accounts for 11.1% of all occasions, although many were low risk (50.0%) and simply provided an opportunity for friends to get together at the local pub over a pint or two.

### Neural traits characterize unconditional cooperators, conditional cooperators, and noncooperators in group-based cooperation [^2eecf804]. Human Brain Mapping (2019). Medium credibility.

Contributing to and maintaining public goods are important for a functioning society. In reality, however, we see large variations in contribution behavior. While some individuals are not cooperative, others are highly so. Still others cooperate only to the extent they believe others will. Although these distinct behavioral types clearly have a divergent social impact, the sources of heterogeneity are poorly understood. We used source-localized resting electroencephalography in combination with a model-free clustering approach to participants' behavior in the Public Goods Game to explain heterogeneity. Findings revealed that compared to noncooperators, both conditional cooperators and unconditional cooperators are characterized by higher baseline activation in the right temporo-parietal junction, an area involved in social cognition. Interestingly, conditional cooperators were further characterized by higher baseline activation in the left lateral prefrontal cortex, an area involved in behavioral control. Our findings suggest that conditional cooperators' better capacities for behavioral control enable them to control their propensity to cooperate and thus to minimize the risk of exploitation by noncooperators.

### Health care clinicians and product promotion by industry [^af878400]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Promotion through research — documented risks of bias in industry-sponsored research include manipulation of study entry criteria and selection of study populations, manipulation of drug dosages to favor a company product, selective use of data, nonpublication or delayed publication of unfavorable trials, underreporting, biased or selective reporting of results, nonreporting of adverse events, deviations from accepted standards for data analysis leading to biased results, and biased and selective descriptions of findings and conclusions. Industry funding of studies greatly increases the chances of proindustry results, and reanalyses by independent investigators have found published findings to be dangerously misleading, with postmarketing evidence of risk sometimes suppressed.

### Assessment of the opportunities for increasing the availability of EU data on consumer product-related injuries [^3121956a]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Can the private sector contribute to data on product safety?

Case study with toy manufacturers

With the assistance of the association Toy Industries of Europe, one large toy manufacturer provided information on handling data on product safety customer complaints. The toy company provided information on their in-house data collection system in which they store data such as claims, complaints, the batch code of the involved product, the injuries caused by their products, the circumstances which lead to the injury and the customer contact details. The data entry input mask includes free-text boxes where the occurred injury can be described in detail. The most common complain reason can be selected from a pull-down menu. Most information stored in this system is provided by the customers directly, the reseller or company agents. Many of the larger toy manufacturers hold in-house registers of customer complaints and on faulty products, however the data have limited access.

Insurance companies

Insurance companies were thought to be an interesting potential source of information on product-related causes of injuries and/or death. Types of insurances which were addressed for this purpose were umbrella insurance associations, personal accident insurances, medical and health insurances. The information recovered by survey from the representatives of associations/companies from sources 62–69 (table 2) suggests that the use of the data from insurance companies could be quite challenging.

Details on the circumstance of accidents, including some detail on possibly involved consumer products, may be held at the private insurer level, however all companies will have their own methods of data compilation and statistical data analyses. Insurers would not intentionally collect information about a faulty product. Information on the external cause of accidents/involved products, if any, would not be shared at the higher level such as with roof insurance associations. Other than that, data protection concerns and high fragmentation of this sector would provide major obstacles for the direct usage of data in the short term. Other observations are given in table 4.

The interest of the private sector to collaborate and share information was low in the course of this project. The concerns about sharing data/information were mainly associated with the potential of data misinterpretation and/or unfair stigmatisation of products/companies. On the other hand, private sector representatives showed interest in using the available data on injuries caused by unsafe products. There are currently ongoing discussions on data sharing in a business-to-government context between the Commission services, stakeholders and the involvement of newly appointed Experts Group on Business-to-Government Data Sharing.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^29ec381c]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In summary, traditional CEA often considers the narrow view of just the patient and healthcare system in the present, ignoring other factors that affect patients, their caregivers, the healthcare system, and society as a whole. Once these factors are incorporated, it may turn out the market forces are finding a price at which many medicines provide considerable value for society's money. Whether these prices are high enough to keep driving innovation is a separate but related question; they appear to be in most cases judging from current pace of R&D in many therapeutic areas. In a few cases, such as for hospital-administered antibiotics, expected market prices cannot adequately make up for the low volume of prescriptions and therefore expected revenues and profits are too low to spur investment in needed R&D. In these cases, government interventions (e.g. via novel payment models) are needed to address the market failure. But where cost-effective market prices are adequate to incentivize investment in further R&D of cost-effective medicines that will eventually go generic, price controls risk creating a market failure where there is not one.

In our view, pricing regulations should focus on upholding the purpose of the patent system, which is to make sure that drugs become generic or biosimilar after an adequate period of market-based "reward". The markets may offer a small reward or a large one depending on whether the product is valued by patients, doctors, payors, and society as a whole, but regulations would best not interfere with market-driven pricing during the period intended by the patent system. If medicines have been worth their prices, then it means that the market-based pricing mechanisms that bring about those prices (i.e. many drug companies negotiating with many payers, public and private) have been getting value for society, and it is worth considering the merits of continuing to rely on those mechanisms (rather than overriding them with price controls, as some academics and policymakers propose from time to time) as long as they are generating value for society.

### Safely returning America to work: part I: general guidance for employers [^577a3dbc]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) risk assessment and exposure levels — criteria and proximity: Risk assessment includes whether an employee was in close contact with someone exposed to the virus, the duration of that contact, whether they were using any personal protective equipment (PPE) and the type of PPE used. OSHA has divided job tasks into four risk exposure levels: very high, high, medium, and lower risk, and the level of risk depends on industry type and the need for contact within six feet of individuals who are suspected of being infected or are infected with the virus, or the need for repeated or extended contact. Very high exposure risk jobs are those with elevated potential for exposure to known or suspected sources of COVID-19 during specific medical, laboratory, or post-mortem procedures.

### Energy drinks: a contemporary issues paper [^82efb3b0]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

ACSM evidence statement and recommendations note that the serious and detrimental impacts of energy drink consumption are well documented in case reports (ACSM Evidence Category C), and the ACSM writing group concurs that energy drink consumption, especially in vulnerable populations can be potentially hazardous (ACSM Evidence Category D). Recommended actions include that the message that these beverages are not intended for children needs to be re-enforced and widely disseminated and that warnings should be prominently displayed on the front of products naming vulnerable populations, including those younger than 18 yr, who should avoid energy drink use. Regulatory actions are needed, with examples including Health Canada mandates to improve transparency and provide labels and proposals for labeling transparency, clearly labeled warnings, and restriction on sales to those younger than 18 yr until safety and efficacy data are provided by energy drink manufacturers.

### Risk assessment and child health [^56eebe6c]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Risk assessment, an approach for organizing information about hazards to health, safety, and the environment, provides a framework for gauging the threat to child health from environmental pollutants. A qualitative risk assessment has 4 components: hazard identification, dose-response assessment, exposure assessment, and risk characterization. In a risk assessment, consideration can be given to a population group that potentially has increased susceptibility, whether arising from having a high level of exposure or from increased susceptibility to the agent of concern on a biological basis. Children have been proposed as being at increased risk from some environmental agents, and there has long been concern and debate that the current approach of determining acceptable exposure levels or intake for a person may not yield safe intake limits for infants and children, who may be placed at greater risk than adults because of exposure patterns and inherent susceptibility. The persistence of debate on this critical public health issue reflects, in part, the difficulty of developing sufficiently sensitive and validated animal bioassays for critical outcomes. Epidemiologic studies can play only a limited role, given the complexity of establishing cohorts and tracking exposures from conception forward to assess risks across the lifespan. Meeting society's call for healthy environments for children poses an extraordinary challenge to researchers and to the policy makers who seek to develop evidence-based policies to protect children.

### Market competition among manufacturers of novel high-risk therapeutic devices receiving FDA premarket approval between 2001 and 2018 [^994c9a63]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates high-risk medical devices through the premarket approval (PMA) pathway, which requires clinical evidence assuring safety and effectiveness for approval. After approval, manufacturers may face barriers to successful commercialization, such as uncertainties about reimbursement or limited market exclusivity. These clinical, financial and operational hurdles may discourage market entry by manufacturers, thereby limiting competitive innovation. We sought to evaluate the extent of market entry by manufacturers of first-in-class devices and subsequent competitors.

### Portion, package or tableware size for changing selection and consumption of food, alcohol and tobacco [^58cbe01c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Overeating and harmful alcohol and tobacco use have been linked to the aetiology of various non-communicable diseases, which are among the leading global causes of morbidity and premature mortality. As people are repeatedly exposed to varying sizes and shapes of food, alcohol and tobacco products in environments such as shops, restaurants, bars and homes, this has stimulated public health policy interest in product size and shape as potential targets for intervention.

Objectives

1) To assess the effects of interventions involving exposure to different sizes or sets of physical dimensions of a portion, package, individual unit or item of tableware on unregulated selection or consumption of food, alcohol or tobacco products in adults and children.2) To assess the extent to which these effects may be modified by study, intervention and participant characteristics.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, eight other published or grey literature databases, trial registries and key websites up to November 2012, followed by citation searches and contacts with study authors. This original search identified eligible studies published up to July 2013, which are fully incorporated into the review. We conducted an updated search up to 30 January 2015 but further eligible studies are not yet fully incorporated due to their minimal potential to change the conclusions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials with between-subjects (parallel-group) or within-subjects (cross-over) designs, conducted in laboratory or field settings, in adults or children. Eligible studies compared at least two groups of participants, each exposed to a different size or shape of a portion of a food (including non-alcoholic beverages), alcohol or tobacco product, its package or individual unit size, or of an item of tableware used to consume it, and included a measure of unregulated selection or consumption of food, alcohol or tobacco.

Data Collection and Analysis

We applied standard Cochrane methods to select eligible studies for inclusion and to collect data and assess risk of bias. We calculated study-level effect sizes as standardised mean differences (SMDs) between comparison groups, measured as quantities selected or consumed. We combined these results using random-effects meta-analysis models to estimate summary effect sizes (SMDs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)) for each outcome for size and shape comparisons. We rated the overall quality of evidence using the GRADE system. Finally, we used meta-regression analysis to investigate statistical associations between summary effect sizes and variant study, intervention or participant characteristics.

Main Results

The current version of this review includes 72 studies, published between 1978 and July 2013, assessed as being at overall unclear or high risk of bias with respect to selection and consumption outcomes. Ninety-six per cent of included studies (69/72) manipulated food products and 4% (3/72) manipulated cigarettes. No included studies manipulated alcohol products. Forty-nine per cent (35/72) manipulated portion size, 14% (10/72) package size and 21% (15/72) tableware size or shape. More studies investigated effects among adults (76% (55/72)) than children and all studies were conducted in high-income countries - predominantly in the USA (81% (58/72)). Sources of funding were reported for the majority of studies, with no evidence of funding by agencies with possible commercial interests in their results. A meta-analysis of 86 independent comparisons from 58 studies (6603 participants) found a small to moderate effect of portion, package, individual unit or tableware size on consumption of food (SMD 0.38, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.46), providing moderate quality evidence that exposure to larger sizes increased quantities of food consumed among children (SMD 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.31) and adults (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.52). The size of this effect suggests that, if sustained reductions in exposure to larger-sized food portions, packages and tableware could be achieved across the whole diet, this could reduce average daily energy consumed from food by between 144 and 228 kcal (8.5% to 13.5% from a baseline of 1689 kcal) among UK children and adults. A meta-analysis of six independent comparisons from three studies (108 participants) found low quality evidence for no difference in the effect of cigarette length on consumption (SMD 0.25, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.65). One included study (50 participants) estimated a large effect on consumption of exposure to differently shaped tableware (SMD 1.17, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.78), rated as very low quality evidence that exposure to shorter, wider bottles (versus taller, narrower bottles) increased quantities of water consumed by young adult participants. A meta-analysis of 13 independent comparisons from 10 studies (1164 participants) found a small to moderate effect of portion or tableware size on selection of food (SMD 0.42, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.59), rated as moderate quality evidence that exposure to larger sizes increased the quantities of food people selected for subsequent consumption. This effect was present among adults (SMD 0.55, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.75) but not children (SMD 0.14, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.34). In addition, a meta-analysis of three independent comparisons from three studies (232 participants) found a very large effect of exposure to differently shaped tableware on selection of non-alcoholic beverages (SMD 1.47, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.43), rated as low quality evidence that exposure to shorter, wider (versus taller, narrower) glasses or bottles increased the quantities selected for subsequent consumption among adults (SMD 2.31, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.83) and children (SMD 1.03, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.65).

Authors' Conclusions

This review found that people consistently consume more food and drink when offered larger-sized portions, packages or tableware than when offered smaller-sized versions. This suggests that policies and practices that successfully reduce the size, availability and appeal of larger-sized portions, packages, individual units and tableware can contribute to meaningful reductions in the quantities of food (including non-alcoholic beverages) people select and consume in the immediate and short term. However, it is uncertain whether reducing portions at the smaller end of the size range can be as effective in reducing food consumption as reductions at the larger end of the range. We are unable to highlight clear implications for tobacco or alcohol policy due to identified gaps in the current evidence base.

### Avoiding conflicts of interest and reputational risks associated with population research on food and nutrition: the food research risK (FoRK) guidance and toolkit for researchers [^c003e119]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations

The principles embodied in the tools were derived from a systematic review of existing research and other scholarly contributions, on which we derived partial consensus through a formal Delphi process. Further rigour was attained by convening an independently facilitated, two day workshop of international experts, at which additional consensus was achieved about the principles and agreement reached on the format of the guidance and toolkit. Finally, piloting of prototype versions of the guidance and toolkit by experts provided detailed feedback enabling modifications to improve comprehension and usefulness. Nevertheless, the guidance and toolkit would benefit from further field testing and feedback to determine their strengths and limitations, and to facilitate continuous improvement. Concepts within the guidance and toolkit could apply to other research fields within healthcare or population health and could also be adapted to assess interactions between researchers and public sector or non-governmental organisations. We encourage users to test the materials and provide feedback to the authors so that we can refine them and improve their usefulness.

Empirical work in this specialty is limited, and therefore many subjective judgments had to be made in developing the materials, particularly the risk assessment tool. Through multiple rounds of piloting, we attempted to strengthen the scoring methodology. However, we acknowledge its subjective nature, and emphasise that there are no right or wrong answers; the decisions made by researchers as a result will necessarily involve a degree of personal judgment, informed by the principles set out in the guidance. We acknowledge that no single solution exists to resolve the challenges posed by conflicts of interest in population health research of the commercial food sector, but we anticipate that using the FoRK guidance and toolkit will be an important step in achieving clarity of thought and transparency of actions and reporting.

While these tools assist and guide individual research teams to make decisions about industry interactions, they do not deal with broader concerns about the involvement of the commercial food sector in research. An example of such a concern is the systemic focus of industry funded research on industry friendly topics, such as studies about nutrients and production styles. Further concerns include funding of guideline committee members, advocacy groups, and journals by the commercial food sector. These strategies put researchers at risk of influence from the commercial food sector, often without the researchers realising it. Further work is needed to address these concerns.

### Personalised risk communication for informed decision making about entering screening programs [^a246cff5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

There is a trend towards greater patient involvement in health care decisions. Adequate discussion of the risks and benefits associated with different choices is often required if involvement is to be genuine and effective. Achieving adequate involvement of consumers and informed decision making are now seen as important goals for any screening programme. Individualised risk estimates have been shown to be effective methods of risk communication in general, but the effectiveness of different strategies has not previously been examined.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different types of individualised risk communication for consumers making decisions about participating in screening.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group specialised register (searched March 2001), MEDLINE (1985 to 2001), EMBASE (1985 to 2001), CancerLit (1985 to 2001), CINAHL (1985 to 2001), ClinPSYC (1989 to 2001), and the Science Citation Index Expanded (searched March 2002). Follow-up searches involved hand searching Preventive Medicine, citation searches on seven authors, and searching reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials addressing the decision by consumers of whether or not to undergo screening, incorporating an intervention with a 'personalised risk communication element' and reporting cognitive, affective, or behavioural outcomes. A 'personalised risk communication element' is based on the individual's own risk factors for a condition (such as age or family history). It may be calculated from an individual's risk factors using formulae derived from epidemiological data, and presented as an absolute risk or as a risk score, or it may be categorised into, for example, high, medium or low risk groups. It may be less detailed still, involving a listing, for example, of a consumer's risk factors as a focus for discussion and intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data about the nature and setting of the intervention, and the relevant outcome data were extracted, along with items relating to methodological quality.

Main Results

Thirteen studies were included. Personalised risk communication (whether written, spoken or visually presented) was associated with increased uptake of screening tests (odds ratio (OR) 1.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11 to 2.03). There was no evidence from these studies that this increase in uptake of tests was related to informed decision making by consumers. More detailed personalised risk communication was associated with a smaller increase in uptake of tests. That is, for personalised risk communication which used and presented numerical calculations of risk, the OR for test uptake was 1.22 (95% CI 0.56 to 2.68). For risk estimates or calculations which were categorised into high, medium or low strata of risk, the OR was 1.42 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.88). For risk communication that simply listed risk personal risk factors the OR was 1.7 (95% CI 1.17 to 2.48). Most of the included studies addressed mammography programmes. These studies showed slightly smaller effects than the overall dataset, again with numerical calculated risk estimates being associated with lower ORs for uptake of tests (OR 1.13; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.29) than the other categories of (less detailed) personalised risk communication. The four studies examining risk communication in high risk individuals showed larger odds ratios for uptake of tests than the other studies. The OR for numerical calculated risk estimates was 1.48 (95% CI 1.06 to 2.07), compared to 4.66 (95% CI 2.24 to 9.69) for categorised risk estimates and 2.64 (95% CI 1.42 to 4.9) for listed personal risk factors. There were insufficient data from the included studies to report odds ratios on other key outcomes such as: intention to take tests, anxiety, satisfaction with decisions, decisional conflict, knowledge and risk perception.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Personalised risk communication (as currently implemented in the included studies) is associated with increased uptake of screening programmes, but this may not be interpretable as evidence of informed decision making by consumers.

A moderate recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and the quality of evidence is good but not excellent (or is unobtainable)," implying "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a moderate recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences." A weak recommendation (based on low-quality evidence) is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa), but the quality of evidence is weak," with the implication "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a weak recommendation but should remain alert to new information and very sensitive to patient preferences." A weak recommendation (based on balance of benefits and harms) is defined as "Weak recommendation is provided when the aggregate database shows evidence of both benefit and harm that appear to be similar in magnitude for any available courses of action," implying "Clinicians should consider the options in their decision-making, but patient preference may have a substantial role."

### Portion, package or tableware size for changing selection and consumption of food, alcohol and tobacco [^f0c50cba]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Abstract

Background

Overeating and harmful alcohol and tobacco use have been linked to the aetiology of various non‐communicable diseases, which are among the leading global causes of morbidity and premature mortality. As people are repeatedly exposed to varying sizes and shapes of food, alcohol and tobacco products in environments such as shops, restaurants, bars and homes, this has stimulated public health policy interest in product size and shape as potential targets for intervention.

Objectives

1) To assess the effects of interventions involving exposure to different sizes or sets of physical dimensions of a portion, package, individual unit or item of tableware on unregulated selection or consumption of food, alcohol or tobacco products in adults and children.

2) To assess the extent to which these effects may be modified by study, intervention and participant characteristics.

Search methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, eight other published or grey literature databases, trial registries and key websites up to November 2012, followed by citation searches and contacts with study authors. This original search identified eligible studies published up to July 2013, which are fully incorporated into the review. We conducted an updated search up to 30 January 2015 but further eligible studies are not yet fully incorporated due to their minimal potential to change the conclusions.

Selection criteria

Randomised controlled trials with between‐subjects (parallel‐group) or within‐subjects (cross‐over) designs, conducted in laboratory or field settings, in adults or children. Eligible studies compared at least two groups of participants, each exposed to a different size or shape of a portion of a food (including non‐alcoholic beverages), alcohol or tobacco product, its package or individual unit size, or of an item of tableware used to consume it, and included a measure of unregulated selection or consumption of food, alcohol or tobacco.

Data collection and analysis

We applied standard Cochrane methods to select eligible studies for inclusion and to collect data and assess risk of bias. We calculated study‐level effect sizes as standardised mean differences (SMDs) between comparison groups, measured as quantities selected or consumed. We combined these results using random‐effects meta‐analysis models to estimate summary effect sizes (SMDs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)) for each outcome for size and shape comparisons. We rated the overall quality of evidence using the GRADE system. Finally, we used meta‐regression analysis to investigate statistical associations between summary effect sizes and variant study, intervention or participant characteristics.

Main results

The current version of this review includes 72 studies, published between 1978 and July 2013, assessed as being at overall unclear or high risk of bias with respect to selection and consumption outcomes. Ninety‐six per cent of included studies (69/72) manipulated food products and 4% (3/72) manipulated cigarettes. No included studies manipulated alcohol products. Forty‐nine per cent (35/72) manipulated portion size, 14% (10/72) package size and 21% (15/72) tableware size or shape. More studies investigated effects among adults (76% (55/72)) than children and all studies were conducted in high‐income countries ‐ predominantly in the USA (81% (58/72)). Sources of funding were reported for the majority of studies, with no evidence of funding by agencies with possible commercial interests in their results.

A meta‐analysis of 86 independent comparisons from 58 studies (6603 participants) found a small to moderate effect of portion, package, individual unit or tableware size on consumption of food (SMD 0.38, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.46), providing moderate quality evidence that exposure to larger sizes increased quantities of food consumed among children (SMD 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.31) and adults (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.52). The size of this effect suggests that, if sustained reductions in exposure to larger‐sized food portions, packages and tableware could be achieved across the whole diet, this could reduce average daily energy consumed from food by between 144 and 228 kcal (8.5% to 13.5% from a baseline of 1689 kcal) among UK children and adults. A meta‐analysis of six independent comparisons from three studies (108 participants) found low quality evidence for no difference in the effect of cigarette length on consumption (SMD 0.25, 95% CI ‐0.14 to 0.65).

One included study (50 participants) estimated a large effect on consumption of exposure to differently shaped tableware (SMD 1.17, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.78), rated as very low quality evidence that exposure to shorter, wider bottles (versus taller, narrower bottles) increased quantities of water consumed by young adult participants.

A meta‐analysis of 13 independent comparisons from 10 studies (1164 participants) found a small to moderate effect of portion or tableware size on selection of food (SMD 0.42, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.59), rated as moderate quality evidence that exposure to larger sizes increased the quantities of food people selected for subsequent consumption. This effect was present among adults (SMD 0.55, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.75) but not children (SMD 0.14, 95% CI ‐0.06 to 0.34).

In addition, a meta‐analysis of three independent comparisons from three studies (232 participants) found a very large effect of exposure to differently shaped tableware on selection of non‐alcoholic beverages (SMD 1.47, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.43), rated as low quality evidence that exposure to shorter, wider (versus taller, narrower) glasses or bottles increased the quantities selected for subsequent consumption among adults (SMD 2.31, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.83) and children (SMD 1.03, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.65).

Authors' conclusions

This review found that people consistently consume more food and drink when offered larger‐sized portions, packages or tableware than when offered smaller‐sized versions. This suggests that policies and practices that successfully reduce the size, availability and appeal of larger‐sized portions, packages, individual units and tableware can contribute to meaningful reductions in the quantities of food (including non‐alcoholic beverages) people select and consume in the immediate and short term. However, it is uncertain whether reducing portions at the smaller end of the size range can be as effective in reducing food consumption as reductions at the larger end of the range. We are unable to highlight clear implications for tobacco or alcohol policy due to identified gaps in the current evidence base.

### Patient and public involvement in the benefit-risk assessment and decision concerning health products: position of the scientific advisory board of the French national agency for medicines and health products safety (ANSM) [^8bebec8e]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Different forms of involvement considered

There are different profiles of 'people concerned' that need to be considered depending on the subject and the regulatory process. All patients have an experience of the use or conditions of use of health products that can contribute to BR assessmentand some of them have built up specific knowledge from their experience, through continuous training or a reflective process with their peers or within patient organisations. The contribution of the 'people concerned' in the BR assessment varies according to their engagements, their motivationsand the agencies' expectations, ranging from simple information or consultation to collaboration or coconstruction. Interface committees and scientific committees are two different forms of patient participation.

The form of involvement expected in the different committees should be made explicit, and the profiles of the 'people concerned' adapted according to the various levels of participation, in the same way as it is currently established for medical experts. The parallelism mentioned highlights the interactions developed with the medical experts within committees, the dialogue with representatives of learnt societies, or the use of external expertise in a specific field. The different profiles such as users, caregivers, patients, patients' representatives, victims, support organisations and patient partners, their contributions and skills should be considered.

Adapt feedback from 'people concerned' for the BR assessment

The regulators are committed to ensuring that the patient's voice is included in BR assessments. Recommendations for the evaluation of health products are currently evolving to integrate the experiential knowledge. In this perspective, the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use has proposed new guidelines to advance patient-centred drug development, integrating patient experience throughout development and thus supporting regulatory decisions. The subject of Patient-Reported Outcomes, once validated and effectively aggregated, analysed and verified by the 'people concerned', should be addressed as a concrete form of patient involvement in BR assessment. Already implemented at national level for health technology assessment, it would be appropriate to integrate them into the marketing authorisation process and thus to develop the European guidelines. Depending on the pilot phase conducted by the EMA, health products regulatory agencies could move forward, allowing for the establishment of ways to collect and use evidence based on experience and results perceived by 'people concerned' for decision-making on BR. This improvement would allow for the integration of input expressed by the patients, thus developing a health democracy approach.

### Measurement and expression of risk: optimizing decision strategies [^4ea6e089]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

A significant proportion of the > 6 million articles published annually present data in terms of risk and risk reduction. While the measurement of risk and risk reduction is often straightforward, there are a variety of ways that risk may be expressed. Risk is defined as the rate of an occurrence of a particular disease or adverse event and is determined by the number of events divided by the person-years or number of individuals in the at-risk population. The portrayal of risk can be achieved using different techniques but is typically provided in demographic maps, time-trend charts, or incidence bar graphs. Risk can be expressed in relative terms such as relative risk or absolute measures such as attributable risk or number needed to treat. Understanding risk determination as well as the differences in risk depiction and expression is necessary to ascertain the relevance of the data to one's clinical practice as well as to make optimal clinical and pharmacoeconomic treatment decisions. A review of terms, together with examples, is presented, such that clinicians evaluating the medical literature will be able to identify differences in the way that risk-related results are expressed and optimize the application of such evidence to their practice.

### Protecting children from tobacco, nicotine, and tobacco smoke [^fbcb63d6]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Table 1 — Guideline definitions for evidence-based statements delineates four categories with implications for practice. Strong recommendation is made when "the anticipated benefits of the recommended intervention clearly exceed the harms… and the quality of the supporting evidence is excellent," and in some circumstances "strong recommendations may be made when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain and the anticipated benefits strongly outweigh the harms," with the implication that "Clinicians and policy makers should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present." Recommendation applies when "the anticipated benefits exceed the harms, but the quality of evidence is not as strong," and "recommendations may be made when high-quality evidence is impossible to obtain but the anticipated benefits outweigh the harms," implying "Clinicians and policy makers would be prudent to follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences." Option is used when "either the quality of evidence is suspect or carefully performed studies have shown little clear advantage to one approach over another," implying "Clinicians and policy makers should consider the option in their decision-making, and preference may play a substantial role." No recommendation indicates "a lack of pertinent published evidence and that the anticipated balance of benefits and harms is presently unclear," implying "Clinicians and policy makers should be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm."

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^5204208e]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Consider that when some medications are prescribed and adhered to, healthcare spending declines by lowering emergency admissions. Eleven such medications reduce emergency admissions by hundreds of thousands annually. These drugs essentially displace a non-genericizable service with a genericizable medicine, a logical way to save money in the long run, and yet, if one only scrutinizes the drug's temporary branded cost without considering the alternative of forever relying on emergency department services to manage patients, society could easily end up misallocating resources away from developing such a medicine. Reasons for not performing value assessments on hospital procedures may include a lack of randomized controlled trial data which are important inputs into cost-effectiveness analyses. However, this and other reasons are not insurmountable, and real-world data can provide important information on the effectiveness of an intervention potentially through time series analyses if comparators are not obvious. Comprehending the potential cost-effectiveness of all varieties of healthcare interventions is paramount for enhancing the efficiency of healthcare systems and optimizing the health of populations.

Recommendation strength interpretation — language cues and definitions: Strong and moderate recommendations are associated with "should" and "should not" statements, whereas a weak recommendation may be recognized by "may" or "need not." A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or, for a strong negative recommendation, the harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the supporting evidence quality is excellent; clinicians are advised to follow such guidance unless a clear and compelling rationale for acting in a contrary manner is present. A moderate recommendation means the committee believes benefits exceed harms (or harms exceed benefits for a negative recommendation) but the evidence on which the recommendation is based is not as strong, and clinicians are encouraged to follow such guidance while remaining alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. A weak recommendation means the existing evidence quality is suspect or well-designed, well-conducted studies have shown little clear advantage to one approach versus another, offering clinicians flexibility in decision-making, although boundaries on alternatives may be set.

### Regulating cancer risk prediction: legal considerations and stakeholder perspectives on the Canadian context [^c80d7882]. Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Notably, some stakeholders were unclear about whether risk prediction tools would qualify as medical devices in Canada (Applying the Regulatory Framework in Canada). This was mainly due to needing device specific information-particularly about intended use. Other reasons included that the output of such software is not individualized but stratified by risk group, that the output is just one piece of information in clinical management, and that the medical condition is not yet present. When asked to anticipate potential risk classification should risk prediction models be subject to regulation, stakeholders gave a range of responses. The advocates, researchers and developers predicted relatively lower risk classifications (1 or 2, with 4 stakeholders predicting it could be level 1). The regulators and decision-makers stated that they would require detailed information specific to a particular tool to provide an actual estimate — reiterating the importance of patient safety and product effectiveness, labeling and usability. They postulated such models could be low to medium risk (2 or 3), depending on their specific characteristics.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^5eeb57a8]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Contemporary debates about drug pricing feature several widely held misconceptions, including the relationship between incentives and innovation, the proportion of total healthcare spending on pharmaceuticals, and whether the economic evaluation of a medicine can be influenced by things other than clinical efficacy.

Main body

All citizens should have access to timely, equitable, and cost-effective care covered by public funds, private insurance, or a combination of both. Better managing the collective burden of diseases borne by today's and future generations depends in part on developing better technologies, including better medicines. As in any innovative industry, the expectation of adequate financial returns incentivizes innovators and their investors to develop new medicines. Estimating expected returns requires that they forecast revenues, based on the future price trajectory and volume of use over time. How market participants decide what price to set or accept can be complicated, and some observers and stakeholders want to confirm whether the net prices society pays for novel medicines, whether as a reward for past innovation or an incentive for future innovation, are commensurate with those medicines' incremental value. But we must also ask "value to whom?"; medicines not only bring immediate clinical benefits to patients treated today, but also can provide a broad spectrum of short- and long-term benefits to patients, their families, and society. Spending across all facets of healthcare has grown over the last 25 years, but both inpatient and outpatient spending has outpaced drug spending growth even as our drug armamentarium is constantly improving with safer and more effective medicines. In large part, this is because, unlike hospitals, drugs typically go generic, thus making room in our budgets for new and better ones, even as they often keep patients out of hospitals, driving further savings.

Conclusion

A thorough evaluation of drug spending and value can help to promote a better allocation of healthcare resources for both the healthy and the sick, both of whom must pay for healthcare. Taking a holistic approach to assessing drug value makes it clear that a branded drug's value to a patient is often only a small fraction of the drug's total value to society. Societal value merits consideration when determining whether and how to make a medicine affordable and accessible to patients: a drug that is worth its price to society should not be rendered inaccessible to ill patients by imposing high out-of-pocket costs or restricting coverage based on narrow health technology assessments (HTAs). Furthermore, recognizing the total societal cost of un- or undertreated conditions is crucial to gaining a thorough understanding of what guides the biomedical innovation ecosystem to create value for society. It would be unwise to discourage the development of new solutions without first appreciating the cost of leaving the problems unsolved.

### Health care clinicians and product promotion by industry [^32699d0a]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Drug samples and gifts — effects on prescribing and permitted gifts are described as follows: The evidence suggests that the availability of drug samples does change physician prescribing behavior, with physicians likely to write a prescription for the same drug for which samples were provided; physicians who dispense samples appear to write fewer prescriptions for generic medications, and physicians are more likely to stray from published treatment guidelines when a sample is available for a drug that is not considered first line. Since 2009, industry guidelines still allow "occasional" educational gifts not valued at more than $100 and allow gifts of food with a connection to informational presentations, and restrictions have not eliminated the sense of obligation that comes with receipt of any gift or meal, no matter the value.

Social Risk Exposures

The primary exposure was a composite measure of social risk defined as self-reported experience with financial strain, housing instability, and/or food insecurity during the past 12 months using validated survey instruments. Financial strain was determined using 2 questions that asked about difficulty paying for basic needs ("How hard is it for you to pay for the very basics like food, housing, medical care, and heating?" Responses included very hard, hard, somewhat hard, not very hard, and not hard at all) and if there was money left at the end of each month to make ends meet ("Thinking about the past 12 months, would you say that at the end of each month you generally ended up with… " Responses included "more than enough to make ends meet," "some left over to make ends meet," "just enough to make ends meet," "almost enough to make ends meet," and "not enough to make ends meet"). Housing instability was determined via 4 questions that assessed ability to pay mortgage or rent on time ("In the past 12 months, was there a time when you were not able to pay the mortgage or rent on time?" yes or no), number of places lived ("In the past 12 months, how many places have you lived?" 1, 2, or 3 or more), unsteady place to sleep ("In the past 12 months, was there a time when you did not have a steady place to sleep or slept in a shelter?" yes or no), and living situation ("What is your living situation today?" Responses included "you have a steady place to live"; "you have a steady place to live but are worried about losing it in the future"; "you do not have a steady place to live"). Food insecurity was assessed via 3 questions: "Within the past 12 months, you worried whether your food would run out before you got money to buy more" (never true, sometimes true, often true); "Within the past 12 months, the food you bought just didn't last and you didn't have money to get more" (never true, sometimes true, often true); "Within the past 12 months, it was hard for you to get enough healthy food" (never true, sometimes true, often true). Social risk was assessed at 2 time points (1.0 and 2.0 survey waves). The level of social risk exposure at each time point was determined by categorizing a respondent's survey responses into 1 of 2 mutually exclusive levels (our composite social risk exposure): (1) no social risk: no reported experience with financial strain, housing instability, or food insecurity; (2) social risk: reporting any experience with one or more of the observed social risk factors (eTable 1 in Supplement 1 describes criteria used to define social risk exposure). In a secondary analysis, we examined each of the social risk factors individually (ie, financial strain, housing instability, food insecurity) and the count of social risks reported.

Food additives — government and policy recommendations specify that the generally recognized as safe (GRAS) process is in need of substantial revision with a more robust and transparent evaluation that includes additional toxicity testing, and that the GRAS system should be revised as soon as possible and should fully document and disclose conflicts of interest; the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should leverage expertise and technical evaluations from other agencies; the FDA should establish requirements for prioritization and retesting of previously approved chemicals; Congress should provide the FDA authority to collect information about the use of food additives and to require additional data when gaps and potential safety concerns are raised; there should be dedicated resources for research and testing to support a revised FDA safety review process; the FDA should update the scientific foundation for the FDA safety assessment process, including expanding the recommended testing battery, ensuring adequate safety factors for pregnant and breastfeeding women and additional vulnerable populations, and developing strategies to integrate emerging testing techniques; the FDA should consider cumulative and mixture effects from dietary sources; the FDA should establish requirements for labeling of additives with limited or no toxicity data and those not reviewed for safety by the FDA; and the federal government should encourage provisions that ensure transparency and public access to information, including potential conflicts of interest.

### Predictors and patterns of gambling behaviour across the COVID-19 lockdown: findings from a UK cohort study [^6ea055a0]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

This study has a number of strengths including its large sample size, its longitudinal tracking of participants' gambling behaviour at two points during lockdown, and its rich inclusion of measures on psychological and social experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are several limitations. The study is not nationally representative, although it does have good stratification across all major sociodemographic groups and analyses were weighted on the basis of population estimates of core demographics. Whilst the recruitment strategy deliberately over-sampled from groups such as low-income backgrounds, individuals with no or few educational qualifications, and individuals who were unemployed, it is possible that more extreme experiences were not adequately captured. Furthermore, there was a slightly greater risk of dropout amongst individuals engaging in higher levels of gambling and it is therefore possible that the sampling was selective towards infrequent or non-gamblers (which makes our finding of higher levels of gambling and increases in gambling than previous figures more concerning). Additionally, we recognise gender is not binary, and that due to insufficient sample size, had to treat it as such. We therefore realise there is a need for research which acknowledges a wider range of genders. All gambling questions were gathered via self-report on their past gambling each time period as opposed to consistently reporting their current gambling suggesting the results may be subject to recall bias. Additionally, we had good spread across possible responses for each of the measures included in the gambling questions and the sample remained heterogeneous even with attrition. Gambling questions only assessed common types of gambling still available to people during the lockdown and did not measure problematic gambling. We were also unable to examine changes in type of gambling and expenses spent on gambling due to data limitations. Future data collection (i.e. during regional or national lockdowns) may consider examining these factors.

### Implications of the concept of minimal risk in research on informed choice in clinical practice [^e70c04eb]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2015). Low credibility.

Informed consent in clinical practice

Informed consent is an essential part of standard of care in clinical practice. Unlike clinical research, there has been little focus in clinical practice on below what risk level a potential complication of a therapeutic or diagnostic procedure need not be discussed with a patient. However, circumstances seem to exist which allow clinicians to proceed with certain clinical procedures with implicit consent, suggesting that conditions for not requiring formal consent or risk disclosure may exist.

Elements of information provision in clinical practice

As part of information provision regarding clinical therapies and procedures, the elements of disclosure must take into consideration (1) the patient's diagnosis, (2) the nature of the procedure, (3) alternatives, (4) risks and benefits of the proposed procedure and the alternatives and (5) prognosis with and without the therapy or procedure. These elements of disclosure commonly appear in professional guidelines for cliniciansas part of the information which need to be communicated to the patient in considering diagnostic or therapeutic procedures.

The law has given much emphasis on the risk component of disclosure and this has considerably influenced clinical practice. According to court cases, risks that (1) are so obvious, (2) are known to the patient, (3) are very unlikely or (4) could not be known to the clinician at the time of disclosure can be exempt from disclosure. Nevertheless, legal obligations differ across jurisdictionsand no clear legal rule exists to specify the level or types of risks that need not be disclosed. The criteria developed from the court cases seem to refer to the familiarity of the risk to the patient and the clinical community rather than to the risk level. For a clinician's liability protection, Appelbaum et al recommend that clinicians should disclose risks that are (1) relatively minor but likely to occur and (2) extremely unlikely but very serious — even if not deemed an obligation — as there is no guarantee that all agents involved will agree on what risk qualifies for non-disclosure (p.55). Their recommendation includes consideration to the frequency and seriousness of risk, which may be similar to how minimal risk in research is framed but obviously less concrete.

### Portion, package or tableware size for changing selection and consumption of food, alcohol and tobacco [^31d7502f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Quality of the evidence

Ratings of the overall quality of evidence incorporated into this review ranged between moderate and very low, which leaves open the possibility that our estimates of intervention effects differ substantially from true effects. Confidence in estimates of effects was diminished by serious concerns about study limitations, which were primarily raised by unclear and incomplete reporting of study methods and procedures by authors of included studies. Indeed, we identified limitations in study reporting and/or conduct with respect to each of the domains judged most critical to 'Risk of bias' assessment in this review: random sequence generation (selection bias); allocation concealment (selection bias); blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias); and baseline comparability of participant characteristics between groups (other bias). Given the nature of the included studies, we could not identify any obvious reason to prevent the straightforward implementation of unbiased methods and procedures for random sequence generation and allocation concealment. The use of within‐subjects designs precluded the blinding of participants in over half of the included studies, but we did not judge lack of blinding to place studies at high risk of bias in this domain due to a general lack of evidence for the presence and potential influence of carry‐over effects among included studies. We did not consider blinding of personnel (that is, intervention providers) to be a relevant consideration in assessing risk of bias in included studies because personnel were not judged instrumental in delivery of the intervention. Finally, while it may not always be practical to test such differences in applied field settings, in many instances baseline comparability of participant characteristics between comparison groups can and should be examined.

Incomplete outcome data

Among the 13 studies that reported selection outcomes, we judged two to be at high risk of bias for this domain (Fisher 2003; Fisher 2013), with the remaining 11 studies judged to be at low risk of bias. Of the 65 studies that reported consumption outcomes, we judged eight to be at high risk of bias (Coelho do Vale 2008 (S2); Fisher 2003; Fisher 2007c; Fisher 2013; Leahy 2008; Looney 2011; Marchiori 2011; Mathias 2012), with four studies assessed as at unclear risk of bias (Mishra 2012 (S1); Mishra 2012 (S2); Rolls 2007a; Russell 1980). We judged the remaining 53 studies as at low risk of bias. We judged studies to be at high risk of bias for this domain if > 10% of participants' data had been excluded from the analysis due to low (or zero) levels of selection or consumption, or due to being outliers.

Selective reporting

We judged 67 of 72 studies to be at unclear risk of bias in this domain. This was determined by searching for record(s) containing details of the study protocol in online trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)) and finding no corresponding records. As such, there was insufficient information to permit judgement of 'low risk' or 'high risk'. We assessed this domain to be at low risk of bias in four studies for which records were found and the comparison of the trial registry entries and published studies confirmed no selective outcome reporting (Ebbeling 2007; Fisher 2007b; Looney 2011; Raynor 2009). We classified one study as being at high risk of bias due to a discrepancy between the trial registry entry and the published study regarding the specified primary outcomes (Raynor 2007).

### Health care clinicians and product promotion by industry [^b7fd1c6c]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Health care clinicians and product promotion by industry — this section describes psychological influence techniques used by industry representatives, including commitment/consistency tactics in which clinicians are asked to try a product on the next 5 or 10 patients, after which continued use is more likely. Social proof underlies peer advocacy among physicians, liking is leveraged by friendly and attractive interactions, appeals to authority rely on deference to experts, and scarcity encourages rapid acceptance of offered opportunities. Reciprocity is emphasized: gifts create an obligation to reciprocate and take many forms, including free product samples, pens, mugs, speaking or consulting opportunities, meals, trips, free CME, publication and authorship opportunities, and research grants. The section explains that much cognitive activity occurs without conscious awareness, that favors and gifts independent of monetary value influence behavior at a subconscious level, and that although clinicians may assume prescribing is rational, much human decision making does not use a rational assessment of pros and cons.

### Is the price right? Paying for value today to get more value tomorrow [^dc67772c]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Pricing as a reflection of value

Pricing based on the R&D costs of one approved molecule does not account for all the others that did not make it to the market. Additionally, while we tend to focus on the successful products in the existing R&D ecosystem, the literature has shown that both successful and failed R&D efforts have generated important scientific knowledge that has improved the efficiency of our R&D system. Put simply, it is impossible to innovate without failure, and it is important to recognize that failures are valuable, too, because what we learn — as an R&D ecosystem — from our failures helps us to eventually succeed.

If we agree that providing sufficient rewards is essential to incentivize biopharmaceutical R&D, what should society pay? Firstly, this may seem a strange question to those who operate in the actual market-based system, because the answer they often encounter is that payers try to pay as little as possible. If faced with enough choices, payers, specifically PBMs in the USA, can simply play companies off against one another and take the best offers. Understandably pre-occupied with their own priorities, none of these individual payers is directly concerned with rewarding innovation from the societal perspective. Innovators are constantly trying to invent something uniquely useful in the hope that they will not face too much competition and will therefore have pricing power. In other words, they want to be able to control the supply of a product that buyers want badly enough to pay the price that the innovator sets, and even where there are a few competitors, companies tend to be savvy enough not to trigger a ruinous price war, which is why it often takes loss of exclusivity and many generic competitors entering the market to drive a drug's price down steeply.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^83076e30]. PES (2012). Medium credibility.

Development of food preferences and eating behaviors — determinants and exposure needs: The development of food preferences in childhood is important because early preference patterns have a long-term influence on dietary intake later in life, and research in this area generally does not include RCTs that address CV risk factors with no studies identified in this evidence review. Children's food preferences develop from a complex interplay of innate, familial, and environmental factors, with innate preferences for sweet and salty tastes demonstrated from early infancy, and one of the most important influences is experience, including maternal diet experienced by the fetus and the breastfed baby and specific exposures affecting subsequent dietary preferences. Repeated exposures to selected foods in early infancy are associated with acceptance and then preference, and between 5 and 14 exposures to a new food are needed to see increased preference in both infants and children. Parents powerfully shape early experiences with food by deciding availability, accessibility, quantities, and eating patterns, and parents and siblings model eating behavior from birth onward with parent-child and sibling similarities in food preferences and eating behavior described.

### Injury prevention programmes (IPPs) for preventing anterior cruciate ligament injuries [^e66d3936]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Certainty of the evidence assessment

Two review authors will independently assess the certainty of the evidence for each of the critical outcomes using the GRADE approach; we will resolve disagreements through discussion or involvement of a third review author, if necessary. The GRADE approach assesses the certainty of a body of evidence based on the extent to which we can be confident that an estimate of effect or association reflects the outcome being assessed. Evaluation of the certainty of a body of evidence considers five GRADE domains: overall risk of bias, directness of the evidence (indirectness), heterogeneity of the data (inconsistency), precision of the effect estimates (imprecision) and risk of publication bias. The certainty of the evidence could be high, moderate, low or very low, being downgraded by one or two levels depending on the presence and extent of concerns in each of the five GRADE domains. We will explain reasons for downgrading the certainty of the evidence for each outcome, and we will use these judgements when drawing conclusions in the review.

We will construct summary of findings tables for the following two comparisons.

IPPs (using either a single component or multiple components) versus control (no IPP or standard advice (such as generic warm‐up))
IPPs (using multiple components) versus IPPs (using a single component)

In the summary of findings tables, we will include data for the critical outcomes at the time point that is most frequently reported (i.e. that provides the most substantial body of evidence). We will report a single pooled estimate (if available) for each outcome in these two comparisons. However, in order to provide more information to the reader, we will also present the outcome data stratified according to exercise components. We will use GRADEpro GDT software to construct these tables.

Consumer involvement

We will aim to recruit two consumers who will provide input into this review. They will ensure the plain language summary reads clearly and accurately reflects the whole review. We will involve consumers with the dissemination of results. We will also ensure that the review undergoes peer review by an external consumer.

### Heat as a prognostic factor for the development and progression of diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0721b006]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Certainty of the evidence assessment and summary of findings table

We will present separate summary of findings tables for heat as a prognostic factor for the incidence of diabetes and for the critical outcomes of diabetes progression in people living with diabetes. Moreover, we will present separate summary of findings tables for each heat exposure category (heatwaves, increasing temperatures, and seasonal variations of temperatures) in combination with these outcomes, where applicable. Two review authors will independently use the validated GRADE approach for prognostic reviews to assess the certainty of evidence of the meta‐findings. The certainty of evidence can be downgraded by one or two levels for the following reasons: risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. Conversely, it may also be upgraded by one level in the event of a large summary effect, plausible confounding, or dose‐response analysis. The GRADE system employs a four‐point classification system to categorise the certainty of evidence, as follows.

High: we are very confident that the variation in risk associated with the prognostic factor (probability of future events in those with/without the prognostic factor) is similar to that of the estimate.
Moderate: we have moderate confidence that the variation in risk associated with the prognostic factor (probability of future events in those with/without the prognostic factor) is likely to be close to the estimate; however, there is a possibility that it is substantially different.
Low: our confidence in the estimate is limited, and there is a possibility that the variation in risk associated with the prognostic factor (probability of future events in those with/without the prognostic factor) may be substantially different from the estimate.
Very low: we have very little confidence in the estimate, with a high probability that the variation in risk associated with the prognostic factor (probability of future events in those with/without the prognostic factor) is likely to be substantially different from the estimate.

Consumer involvement

No consumer has been involved in the protocol, but the review authors may reconsider this for the review.

### Effect of alcohol label designs with different pictorial representations of alcohol content and health warnings on knowledge and understanding of low-risk drinking guidelines: a randomized controlled trial [^ddc2bf4e]. Addiction (2021). Medium credibility.

We randomized a large number of individuals to each condition, which is a strength of our trial. The main limitation of our trial is that we ran an on‐line experiment and our results may not generalize well to field settings, including supermarkets, which are the places where people are most likely to see a label of the type we tested on a bottle before they buy it. In our on‐line setting the labels were presented on a screen, and although the size of the labels on mobile screens were comparable to the size of labels on a bottle, participants could zoom in if they wished. Labels that display a large amount of information (e.g. the food label serving and container design) or which are wide in design (e.g. the risk gradient) may perform worse in real life if they need to be shrunk to fit onto standard alcohol packaging. Furthermore, although the average participant in our experiment spent approximately 60 seconds reviewing the various example labels, we know from laboratory studies that people pay little attention to alcohol health warnings or responsible drinking statements [29, 36], and we expect that they would pay even less attention to them at point of sale. Lastly, although our sample was designed to be representative of basic population characteristics, our participants were a self‐selecting group who had agreed to be on a panel and answer questions for money. Potentially, their behaviour may not be representative of the average member of the population. Therefore, although our study shows that our labels would improve knowledge and understanding if people pay attention to them, we cannot be sure to what extent those results would generalize to a field setting where people might not pay attention.

### Choosing wisely® in preventive medicine: the American College of Preventive Medicine's top 5 list of recommendations [^6e75ae62]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Direct-to-consumer advertising for prescription medications and over-the-counter supplements — survey findings show that in a 2003 U.S. Food and Drug Administration survey, about half of physicians reported pressure to prescribe and 9% reported that a patient had attempted to influence treatment in a manner that would have been harmful. Primary care physicians reported more pressure than specialists, with 22% of primary care physicians feeling "somewhat" or "very pressured" compared with 13% of specialists. Approximately 73% of primary care physicians and 63% of specialists felt patients came expecting a prescription. Only 40% of physicians believed patients understood risks and 65% believed patients were confused about relative risks and benefits. In patient interviews, only 5%–6% expected a prescription because of an advertisement, yet approximately half reported their doctor prescribed the specific drug they asked about.

### Personalised risk communication for informed decision making about taking screening tests [^b35d1d35]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There is a trend towards greater patient involvement in healthcare decisions. Although screening is usually perceived as good for the health of the population, there are risks associated with the tests involved. Achieving both adequate involvement of consumers and informed decision making are now seen as important goals for screening programmes. Personalised risk estimates have been shown to be effective methods of risk communication.

Objectives

To assess the effects of personalised risk communication on informed decision making by individuals taking screening tests. We also assess individual components that constitute informed decisions.

Search Methods

Two authors searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2012), MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), CINAHL (EbscoHOST) and PsycINFO (OvidSP) without language restrictions. We searched from 2006 to March 2012. The date ranges for the previous searches were from 1989 to December 2005 for PsycINFO and from 1985 to December 2005 for other databases. For the original version of this review, we also searched CancerLit and Science Citation Index (March 2001). We also reviewed the reference lists and conducted citation searches of included studies and other systematic reviews in the field, to identify any studies missed during the initial search.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials incorporating an intervention with a 'personalised risk communication element' for individuals undergoing screening procedures, and reporting measures of informed decisions and also cognitive, affective, or behavioural outcomes addressing the decision by such individuals, of whether or not to undergo screening.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed each included trial for risk of bias, and extracted data. We extracted data about the nature and setting of interventions, and relevant outcome data. We used standard statistical methods to combine data using RevMan version 5, including analysis according to different levels of detail of personalised risk communication, different conditions for screening, and studies based only on high-risk participants rather than people at 'average' risk.

Main Results

We included 41 studies involving 28,700 people. Nineteen new studies were identified in this update, adding to the 22 studies included in the previous two iterations of the review. Three studies measured informed decision with regard to the uptake of screening following personalised risk communication as a part of their intervention. All of these three studies were at low risk of bias and there was strong evidence that the interventions enhanced informed decision making, although with heterogeneous results. Overall 45.2% (592/1309) of participants who received personalised risk information made informed choices, compared to 20.2% (229/1135) of participants who received generic risk information. The overall odds ratios (ORs) for informed decision were 4.48 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.62 to 5.53 for fixed effect) and 3.65 (95% CI 2.13 to 6.23 for random effects). Nine studies measured increase in knowledge, using different scales. All of these studies showed an increase in knowledge with personalised risk communication. In three studies the interventions showed a trend towards more accurate risk perception, but the evidence was of poor quality. Four out of six studies reported non-significant changes in anxiety following personalised risk communication to the participants. Overall there was a small non-significant decrease in the anxiety scores. Most studies (32/41) measured the uptake of screening tests following interventions. Our results (OR 1.15 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.29)) constitute low quality evidence, consistent with a small effect, that personalised risk communication in which a risk score was provided (6 studies) or the participants were given their categorised risk (6 studies), increases uptake of screening tests.

Authors' Conclusions

There is strong evidence from three trials that personalised risk estimates incorporated within communication interventions for screening programmes enhance informed choices. However the evidence for increasing the uptake of such screening tests with similar interventions is weak, and it is not clear if this increase is associated with informed choices. Studies included a diverse range of screening programmes. Therefore, data from this review do not allow us to draw conclusions about the best interventions to deliver personalised risk communication for enhancing informed decisions. The results are dominated by findings from the topic area of mammography and colorectal cancer. Caution is therefore required in generalising from these results, and particularly for clinical topics other than mammography and colorectal cancer screening.
