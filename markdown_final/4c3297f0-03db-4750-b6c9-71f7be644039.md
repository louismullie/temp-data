## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the ICD-10 diagnostic code for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether there is a single standard ICD-10-CM code used consistently in clinical and epidemiologic datasets. Then, I should verify this across multiple high-credibility sources and note any historical ICD-9 predecessor for completeness. Next, I will check if there are any valid subcodes or suffixes (for example, "E28.2x") that clinicians might encounter. Finally, I will confirm the concise code to report back to the user, ensuring consistency with authoritative usage in the literature [^112dTi7a].

> Let me first confirm the core code used in large, peer-reviewed, population-based studies. The 2023 American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology study identifying PCOS cases explicitly used International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision code E28.2 to define PCOS, which supports that E28.2 is the standard diagnostic code in ICD-10-CM for this condition [^112f6mFe].

> I should double-check this against an independent dataset to avoid anchoring on a single source. The 2024 BMC Endocrine Disorders analysis of diabetes screening in women with PCOS also ascertained PCOS using ICD-10 code E28.2, which independently corroborates the same code across a different national claims database and time frame [^111mKj4y].

> Wait, let me verify something I initially noticed in another cohort: a 2025 study in adolescent and young adult military dependents referenced "ICD-10; code E28.2x", which might imply sub-classifications exist; however, hold on, I should verify whether "E28.2x" is an officially recognized ICD-10-CM subcode or simply a wildcard notation used by analysts to capture all E28.2 variants in their extraction logic. On rechecking, standard US ICD-10-CM coding for PCOS is recorded as E28.2 without sanctioned subdigits, and multiple high-credibility sources consistently use E28.2 alone, suggesting that the "x" was a study-specific wildcard rather than an official subcategory, so the correct clinical code to report is E28.2 [^116yu7u9] [^112f6mFe] [^111mKj4y].

> I need to ensure historical context is consistent as well. Older studies mapping forward from ICD-9 typically list 256.4 as the predecessor code for PCOS, with transition to ICD-10 E28.2 in contemporary datasets; this aligns with the coding conventions observed in population-based cohorts and confirms continuity across revisions, though the user's request is specifically for ICD-10 [^112f6mFe] [^111mKj4y].

> Final check before concluding: across independent, high-credibility sources and diverse databases, the ICD-10 code for polycystic ovary syndrome is E28.2, with no routinely used official subcodes in ICD-10-CM for this entity, and any appearance of "E28.2x" should be interpreted as nonstandard/wildcard notation rather than a formal billable code [^112f6mFe] [^111mKj4y] [^116yu7u9].

> ICD-10 code for PCOS: E28.2 [^112f6mFe] [^111mKj4y].

---

The ICD-10 code for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is **E28.2** [^112f6mFe]. This code is used to document PCOS in medical records and billing systems, supporting accurate diagnosis, management, and epidemiologic tracking [^112dTi7a]. PCOS is diagnosed clinically by the presence of **at least two of the following** — hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, or polycystic ovarian morphology — after excluding other causes [^116qoTAs]. The E28.2 code is essential for coordinating care, enabling appropriate screening for metabolic and cardiovascular risks, and facilitating insurance reimbursement [^111mKj4y].

---

## ICD-10 code for PCOS

For PCOS, the **ICD-10 code** is **E28.2**, and the description is Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) [^111mKj4y].

---

## Clinical criteria for diagnosing PCOS

The diagnosis of PCOS is based on **clinical criteria** established by international guidelines [^1166eTPA]. The most commonly used criteria include:

- **Hyperandrogenism**: Clinical (hirsutism, acne) or biochemical evidence of elevated androgens.
- **Ovulatory dysfunction**: Oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea.
- **Polycystic ovarian morphology**: Ultrasound evidence of polycystic ovaries [^116eSXUN].

Per Endocrine Society guidelines, a PCOS diagnosis **requires at least two** of the above criteria after excluding other disorders that mimic PCOS [^116qoTAs].

---

## Clinical features associated with PCOS (ICD-10 code E28.2)

PCOS is characterized by a range of **clinical features**, including:

- **Menstrual irregularities**: Oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea.
- **Hyperandrogenism**: Hirsutism, acne, alopecia [^116qoTAs].
- **Metabolic abnormalities**: Insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia [^112B9Cfj].
- **Infertility**: Due to chronic anovulation [^112JwwLd].
- **Psychological symptoms**: Anxiety, depression.

---

## Common comorbidities and complications

Women diagnosed with PCOS (ICD-10 code E28.2) are at **increased risk** for several comorbidities and complications, including:

- **Type 2 diabetes mellitus**: Increased risk due to insulin resistance [^112B9Cfj].
- **Cardiovascular disease**: Elevated risk of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular events [^112L6jzE].
- **Endometrial hyperplasia and cancer**: Due to chronic anovulation and unopposed estrogen exposure.
- **Obesity**: Commonly associated with PCOS, exacerbating metabolic complications [^1171aEaW].

---

## Treatment and management strategies

Management of PCOS involves a **multidisciplinary approach** [^1116kF4t]. Lifestyle modifications include **weight loss**, dietary changes, and regular exercise [^1171aEaW]. Pharmacologic treatments may include **metformin** [^113UP7xK], oral contraceptives [^113CWGcc], anti-androgens, and ovulation induction agents (clomiphene citrate, letrozole) [^112Jeb8N]. Surgical interventions such as **laparoscopic ovarian drilling** or bariatric surgery are considered in selected cases [^1161Y8rv].

---

## Importance of accurate ICD-10 coding

Accurate ICD-10 coding for PCOS (E28.2) is **essential** for clinical documentation, clear communication among healthcare providers, and billing, facilitating appropriate insurance claims [^112dTi7a]. It also enables epidemiologic tracking of PCOS prevalence and incidence [^112f6mFe].

---

## Limitations and challenges of ICD-10 coding for PCOS

Despite its importance, ICD-10 coding for PCOS faces several challenges. Clinical heterogeneity and variability in **diagnostic criteria** (NIH, Rotterdam, AE-PCOS) complicate consistent coding [^111DBTpN]. Underdiagnosis also leaves many women uncoded, leading to underreporting [^1114anoP].

---

## Recent updates and changes in ICD-10 coding for PCOS

Recent developments in ICD-10 coding for PCOS include **increased awareness**, reflecting greater recognition of PCOS as a significant endocrine disorder, and an **emphasis on metabolic complications**, highlighting the importance of screening for metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk factors.

---

The ICD-10 code for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is **E28.2**; accurate coding supports clinical documentation, billing, and epidemiologic tracking [^112f6mFe].

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116qoTAs]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome, the ES 2013 guidelines recommend considering the diagnosis of PCOS in patients meeting at least two of the following criteria, in the absence of disorders mimicking PCOS:

- **Androgen excess**: Elevated levels of male hormones which can lead to physical signs such as excess facial or body hair.

- **Ovulatory dysfunction**: Irregular or absent menstrual periods due to infrequent, irregular, or absent ovulation.

- **Polycystic ovaries**: Ovaries that are enlarged and contain numerous small cysts.

These criteria aim to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of PCOS.

### Incidence, prevalence, and trends in polycystic ovary syndrome diagnosis: A United States population-based study from 2006 to 2019 [^112f6mFe]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age, yet US incidence estimates do not exist, and prevalence estimates vary widely. A population-based US study estimated the incidence, prevalence, and trends of polycystic ovary syndrome by age, race and ethnicity, and diagnosing provider type.

- **Study design**: A retrospective cohort study of patients enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Washington from 2006 to 2019 was conducted. All members identified as female, aged 16 to 40 years, with at least 3 years of enrollment and at least 1 healthcare encounter during that time, were eligible for inclusion. Individuals were excluded if they had a history of oophorectomy or hysterectomy. Polycystic ovary syndrome cases were identified using the International Classification of Diseases diagnosis codes (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, 256.4 or International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, E28.2).

- **Exclusions and adjustments**: Individuals with a polycystic ovary syndrome diagnosis before study entry were excluded from incidence rate estimations. The incidence rates were adjusted by age using direct standardization to the 2010 US census data.

- **Trends and validations**: Temporal trends in incidence were assessed using weighted linear regression (overall) and Poisson regression (by age, race and ethnicity, and provider type). Prevalent cases were defined as patients with a polycystic ovary syndrome diagnosis at any time before the end of 2019. Medical record review of 700 incident cases diagnosed in 2011–2019 was performed to validate incident cases.

### Diabetes screening among women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a descriptive study of commercial claims, 2011–2019 [^111mKj4y]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder that affects 6–12% of United States women of reproductive age. Because women with PCOS are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, clinical practice guidelines from several organizations (e.g. American Diabetes Association, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, US Preventive Services Task Force) recommend that individuals with PCOS are routinely screened for diabetes. Guidelines further indicate that an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) should be used for diabetes screening in women with PCOS, as opposed to an A1C or fasting plasma glucose test. The purpose of this study is twofold: to estimate rates of diabetes screening among a nationwide sample of commercially insured women with PCOS and to report the percentage of women screened using each test (OGTT, A1C, fasting plasma glucose) among those who were screened.

- **Methods**: We used the MarketScan Commercial Claims database (2011–2019) to identify a sample of women aged 18–64 years with PCOS who were free from diabetes at baseline and had ≥ 5 years of continuous enrollment in their insurance plan. PCOS was ascertained using International Classification of Disease diagnosis codes (ICD-9: 256.4; ICD-10: E28.2). Diabetes screening was ascertained using Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes (A1C: 83036–83037; Fasting blood sugar: 82947; OGTT: 82950). Diabetes screening rates were calculated for the overall study sample as well as across subgroups defined by age, overweight/obesity, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia.

### Clustering identifies subtypes with different phenotypic characteristics in women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^115HQgmr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

In conclusion, we successfully replicated the three PCOS subtypes — reproductive, metabolic, and background — in a large cohort of girls and women with PCOS meeting the Rotterdam criteria. Importantly, we demonstrate that additional traits not used for clustering differ significantly among these subtypes and align with the reproductive and metabolic pathways implicated. Our findings suggest that these PCOS subtypes have different underlying etiologies and clinical characteristics. The applicability of our findings is twofold: First, clustering will enable data-driven diagnosis of PCOS; second, the identification of mechanistically distinct subtypes will facilitate precision medicine approaches to screening, therapy, and prevention of adverse health outcomes.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome and risk of adverse obstetric outcomes: A retrospective population-based matched cohort study in England [^113dfU1P]. BMC Medicine (2022). High credibility.

We considered four primary outcomes identified from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data: (1) preterm birth, (2) mode of delivery, (3) high or low birthweight, and (4) stillbirth.

Gestational age recorded within the HES maternity tail at the time of delivery, and relevant ICD-10 codes were used to identify the outcome of preterm birth (gestational age at birth < 37 weeks).

- **Mode of delivery**: All modes of delivery were assessed, including vaginal deliveries and cesarean sections.
- **Birthweight identification**: High or low birthweight (> 90th centile or < 10th centile, respectively) were identified using the INTERGROWTH 21st project and their software tools. This involved comparing the birthweight and gestational age recorded in HES data to international anthropometric standards.

Evaluation of algorithm performance

We found little difference between the PPVs calculated for the PCOS keyword-strict algorithm using two distinct chart review methods. The PCOS keyword-strict yielded a PPV of 96% using our first method of chart review and a PPV of 95% when it was tested against the clinician gold standard definition in our second manual review method. Despite this, the PCOS keyword-strict algorithm had a sensitivity of only 50% and specificity of 29% when evaluated using the gold-standard definition.

When compared to our broader algorithms, the performance of the PCOS keyword-strict algorithm was most similar to the PCOS coded-strict algorithm, which had a slightly higher PPV of 98%. The text mining criteria did not significantly improve the accuracy of PCOS keyword-strict over PCOS coded-strict. The accuracy of the "broad" criteria decreased compared to the "strict" algorithms. Our broadest algorithm, PCOS coded-broad, had the lowest performance, with a PPV of 30%. This is likely due to the large number of patients who had only an irregular menstruation ICD code with no other diagnosed PCOS symptoms. Interestingly, the addition of the text-mined PCOS keyword significantly improved the PPV of the broad criteria algorithm from 30% (PCOS coded-broad) to 82% (PCOS keyword-broad). Unlike the extreme broad criteria, the other algorithm phenotypes were similarly prevalent. This was also true for the race-stratified cohorts, for which there were little to no differences in prevalence across algorithms.

### Cardiovascular profile of pharmacological agents used for the management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^112B9Cfj]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder among reproductive-aged women. A recent systematic analysis suggests that the prevalence is between 6% (National Institutes of Health criteria) and 10% (Rotterdam and Androgen Excess Society guidelines). PCOS leads to irregular periods, infertility, and increased androgen levels causing hirsutism and acne. Women with PCOS show increased cardiovascular risk through a higher incidence of hypertension, an adverse lipid profile, and insulin resistance (IR).

Obesity affects the majority of women with PCOS, and they have a higher prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), reported as 4.7%, and a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), reported as 2.4–5.1% in cross-sectional studies, compared with a baseline prevalence of diabetes in non-PCOS women of 1%.

- **Increased risk of T2D**: A diagnosis of PCOS is said to confer a 5–10-fold increased risk of developing T2D. Recent guidelines report IGT in obese and nonobese women with PCOS in the United States of America in 30–35% and 10–15%, respectively, with an additional 3–10% and 1–2%, respectively, having T2DM. A recent Finnish study suggested that obese but not nonobese PCOS women were at an increased risk of T2D; however, up to 60% of women with PCOS have insulin resistance, up to 40% have impaired glucose tolerance, and 10% may develop T2D by the age of 40 years.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^11266VbB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for polycystic ovary syndrome, particularly in adolescent patients, the 2013 ES guidelines recommend considering a diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome based on the presence of clinical and/or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism. This diagnosis should only be made after the exclusion of other pathologies and in the presence of persistent oligomenorrhea.

### Renaming Pcos — a two-state solution [^111DNsid]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

It has become evident over the past 30 years that polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is more than a reproductive disorder. It has metabolic sequelae that can affect women across the lifespan. Diagnostic criteria based on the endocrine features of the syndrome, hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria, identify women at high metabolic risk. The additional phenotypes defined by the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria identify women with primarily reproductive rather than metabolic dysfunction.

- **Objective**: The aim is to discuss the rationale for a separate name for the syndrome that is associated with high metabolic risk while maintaining the name for the phenotypes with primarily reproductive morbidity.

- **Intervention**: The NIH Office for Disease Prevention-sponsored Evidence-Based Methodology Workshop on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome recommended that a new name is needed for PCOS.

- **Positions**: The authors propose that PCOS be retained for the reproductive phenotypes and that a new name be created for the phenotypes at high metabolic risk.

- **Conclusions**: There should be two names for the PCOS phenotypes: those with primarily reproductive consequences should continue to be called PCOS, and those with important metabolic consequences should have a new name.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American College of Endocrinology, and Androgen Excess and PCOS Society disease state clinical review: Guide to the best practices in the evaluation and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome — part 1 [^1166eTPA]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is recognized as the most common endocrine disorder of reproductive-aged women worldwide. This document, produced by the collaboration of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society (AES), aims to highlight the most important clinical issues confronting physicians and their patients with PCOS. It is a summary of best practices in 2015.

PCOS has been defined using various criteria, including menstrual irregularity, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM). General agreement exists among specialty society guidelines that the diagnosis of PCOS must be based on the presence of at least two of the following three criteria: chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism (clinical or biological), and polycystic ovaries. There is a need for careful clinical assessment of women's history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation, emphasizing the accuracy and validity of the methodology used for both biochemical measurements and ovarian imaging.

Free testosterone (T) levels are more sensitive than the measurement of total T for establishing the existence of androgen excess and should ideally be determined through equilibrium dialysis techniques. The value of measuring levels of androgens other than T in patients with PCOS is relatively low. New ultrasound machines allow diagnosis of PCOM in patients having at least 25 small follicles (2 to 9 mm) in the whole ovary. Ovarian size at 10 mL remains the threshold between normal and increased ovary size.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^116jAJc6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

The Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society identified the diagnosis and treatment of PCOS as a priority area in need of practice guidelines and appointed a Task Force to formulate evidence-based recommendations. The Task Force adhered to the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) group, an international group with expertise in developing and implementing evidence-based guidelines. A detailed description of the grading scheme has been published elsewhere.

The Task Force utilized the best available research evidence to develop the recommendations, employing consistent language and graphical descriptions to indicate both the strength of a recommendation and the quality of evidence. Strong recommendations are denoted by the phrase "we recommend" and the number 1, while weak recommendations use the phrase "we suggest" and the number 2. The quality of evidence is indicated by cross-filled circles: ⊕○○○ signifies very low quality; ⊕⊕○○, low quality; ⊕⊕⊕○, moderate quality; and ⊕⊕⊕⊕, high quality.

The Task Force is confident that individuals who receive care according to the strong recommendations will experience, on average, more benefits than harm. Weak recommendations necessitate more careful consideration of the individual's circumstances, values, and preferences to determine the optimal course of action. Each recommendation is linked to a description of the evidence and the values that the panelists considered.

### Incidence and prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome in adolescent and young adult US military dependents from 2018 to 2022 [^116yu7u9]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2025). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder among people who menstruate. Adolescent and young adult (AYA) military dependents, a large, diverse subset of the United States population, have not been represented in prior reports of PCOS. This study estimates the incidence and prevalence of probable-PCOS (PCOS symptoms in the absence of a documented PCOS diagnosis) and PCOS in AYA military dependents, and describes the length of time between probable-PCOS and first documented PCOS diagnosis for those who met both criteria during the surveillance period.

- **Methods**: This retrospective cohort study reviewed military electronic medical records and TRICARE insurance claims from the US Military Health System from 2018–2022. Researchers identified female dependents aged 15–21 years with PCOS (International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10); code E28.2x) or possible-PCOS (i.e. having both androgen excess and an amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea ICD-10 code within a 12-month period) who received care through TRICARE due to their insurance sponsor's military service.

- **Results**: A total of 8,385 AYA military dependents had PCOS or possible-PCOS. Across the five-year period, the average yearly incidence was 59/10,000 people (range 54–64) and the average yearly prevalence was 182/10,000 people (range 159–195). It was lowest among Black (139/10,000 people) and Asian (132/10,000 people) AYA.

- **Conclusion**: Rates of PCOS in AYA military dependents are comparable to rates estimated from medical record data in US civilian populations. Identifying barriers to PCOS detection and diagnosis remains crucial for enhanced healthcare outcomes.

### Characterizing the clinical and genetic spectrum of polycystic ovary syndrome in electronic health records [^114EG6vt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the leading causes of infertility, yet diagnostic criteria are ineffective at identifying patients whose symptoms reside outside strict diagnostic criteria. As a result, PCOS is underdiagnosed and its etiology is poorly understood.

- **Objective**: We aim to characterize the phenotypic spectrum of PCOS clinical features within and across racial and ethnic groups.

- **Methods**: We developed a strictly defined PCOS algorithm (PCOSkeyword-strict) using the International Classification of Diseases, ninth and tenth revisions, and keywords mined from clinical notes in electronic health records (EHRs) data. We then systematically relaxed the inclusion criteria to evaluate the change in epidemiological and genetic associations, resulting in three subsequent algorithms (PCOScoded-broad, PCOScoded-strict, and PCOSkeyword-broad). We evaluated the performance of each phenotyping approach and characterized prominent clinical features observed in racially and ethnically diverse PCOS patients.

- **Results**: The best performance came from the PCOScoded-strict algorithm, with a positive predictive value of 98%. Individuals classified as cases by this algorithm had significantly higher body mass index (BMI), insulin levels, free testosterone values, and genetic risk scores for PCOS compared to controls. Median BMI was higher in African American females with PCOS compared to White and Hispanic females with PCOS.

- **Conclusions**: PCOS symptoms are observed across a severity spectrum that parallels the continuous genetic liability to PCOS in the general population.

### Metformin use in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): Opportunities, benefits, and clinical challenges [^112mc8XW]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

The role of metformin in the management of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) presents numerous opportunities and benefits, yet it also brings forth distinct clinical challenges. The drug's potential to improve insulin sensitivity and its implications for ovulation induction are particularly noteworthy.

- **Clinical benefits**: Metformin has been shown to enhance insulin sensitivity, which is crucial for women with PCOS who often experience insulin resistance. This, in turn, can have a positive effect on ovulation rates and menstrual regularity.

- **Challenges and considerations**: Despite these benefits, the clinical application of metformin is not without its challenges. Patients may experience side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort, and there is a need for careful monitoring when integrating metformin with other treatment modalities.

- **Future prospects**: Continued research is necessary to fully understand the long-term effects of metformin use in women with PCOS and to optimize treatment protocols.

The study underscores the importance of individualized patient assessment and the potential for metformin to play a key role in managing PCOS, when used in conjunction with lifestyle modifications and other therapeutic strategies.

### Risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection among women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^114a2Hei]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). High credibility.

To determine whether women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) had a higher incidence of testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) than those without PCOS and evaluate whether PCOS diagnosis independently increased the risk of moderate or severe disease in those with positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, a retrospective cohort study was conducted using the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C).

- **Design**: Retrospective cohort study using the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C).

- **Setting**: National COVID Cohort Collaborative.

- **Patients**: Adult nonpregnant women (age 18–65 years) enrolled in the N3C with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 testing for any indication. Sensitivity analyses were conducted in women aged 18–49 years who were obese (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m²).

- **Interventions**: The exposure was PCOS, as identified by the N3C clinical diagnosis codes and concept sets, which are a compilation of terms, laboratory values, and International Classification of Diseases codes for the diagnosis of PCOS. To further capture patients with the symptoms of PCOS, those who had concept sets for both hirsutism and irregular menses were also included.

- **Main outcome measures**: Odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and odds of moderate or severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the PCOS cohort compared with those in the non-PCOS cohort.

In the study, 2,089,913 women were included, of whom 39,459 had PCOS. In the overall cohort, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 0.98 (95% confidence interval, 0.97–0.98) in women with PCOS compared to women without PCOS. The aORs of disease severity were assessed within the study; however, the sentence appears truncated and further results are not provided.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome and the risk of premenstrual disorders: A nationwide register-based study in Sweden [^117Nr5uW]. Depression and Anxiety (2025). Low credibility.

- **Ascertainment of PCOS**: As described elsewhere, clinical diagnoses of PCOS were identified from the NPR using the Swedish version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. The NPR comprises all hospitalization records since 1987 and more than 80% of hospital-based outpatient records from 2001. We only included PCOS diagnoses made after 1990, when the National Institute of Health (NIH) diagnostic criteria for PCOS were established. To ensure specificity, women with comorbid conditions that may have similar symptoms to PCOS were not classified as having PCOS, following the NIH and the Rotterdam criteria that PCOS is a diagnosis of exclusion. These conditions included pituitary adenoma, disorders of the pituitary glands, Cushing's syndrome, adrenogenital disorders including congenital adrenal hyperplasia, other disorders of the adrenal glands, and Turner's syndrome.

Exposure to PCOS was treated as time-varying. Individuals diagnosed with PCOS during follow-up contributed person-time to the unexposed group until the date of the first recorded PCOS diagnosis, and contributed person-time to the exposed group thereafter.

- **Ascertainment of PMDs**: As described elsewhere, clinical diagnoses of PMDs were obtained from the NPR using ICD codes. To capture diagnoses made in primary care, we also identified specific prescriptions for PMDs recorded in the Prescribed Drug Register. Briefly, we retrieved all dispensed prescriptions of antidepressants and hormonal contraceptives using Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) codes.

### Implications of polycystic ovary syndrome for pregnancy and for the health of offspring [^1118Dm6Y]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) on obstetric and perinatal outcomes, as well as on the health of offspring during childhood.

- **Methods**: Using statewide data linkage systems within Western Australia, 2,566 hospitalized women with a PCOS diagnosis and at least one pregnancy at 20 weeks of gestation or greater, between 1997 and 2011, were compared with 25,660 randomly selected age-matched women not hospitalized with a PCOS diagnosis. The comparison focused on perinatal outcomes, congenital anomalies, and the general health of offspring. Hospitalizations were categorized by International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision diagnoses, and rates over 10 years using Kaplan-Meier estimates. The effects of polycystic ovary syndrome were summarized using adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) after controlling for maternal and perinatal characteristics, including maternal diabetes and obesity.

- **Results**: Among women with PCOS (n = 1,789), 69.7% had one or more births, compared to 62.9% (n = 16,139) of women without PCOS. Hospitalizations up to 31 years were examined for 38,361 offspring. Offspring of women with PCOS were at higher risk of preterm birth (15.5% compared with 7.6%, OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.53–1.98), perinatal mortality (2.3% compared with 0.7%, OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.02–2.18), more postnatal hospitalizations (14.1% compared with 7.9%, OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.05–1.40), more congenital anomalies (6.3% compared with 4.9%, OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.03–1.40), and cardiovascular (1.5% compared with 1.0%, OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.01–1.87), and urogenital defects (2.0% compared with 1.4%, OR 1.36…).

- **MI + DCI vs MI + DCI**: Different ratios of MI:DCI were compared in two trials. In one trial (n = 55), seven ratios were compared: 0:1, 1:3.5, 2.5:1, 5:1, 20:1, 40:1 (standard), and 80:1 for three months. The total dose of MI + DCI was 4 g daily. In another trial (n = 34), a 3.6:1 ratio was compared with the standard 40:1, also for three months. There was no difference between groups in either trial for the critical outcome of HOMA-IR. A higher ratio of MI:DCI (40:1 vs 5:1) resulted in lower FT levels (0.55 ng/dL, ± 0.4 vs 1.35 ng/dL, ± 0.7), improved menstrual regularity (5/8, 62.5% vs 1/8, 12.5%), and fasting insulin (16 mU/mL, ± 5 vs 20 mU/mL, ± 13) in one trial. The evidence was of very low certainty.

- **MI + DCI + FA vs MI + FA**: One study (n = 22), with very low certainty, evaluated MI 1.1 g + DCI 27.6 mg and FA 400 μg taken daily to MI 4 g + FA 400 μg daily after three and six months. Both arms also included dietary interventions. There was no difference for the outcomes of hirsutism, weight, BMI, WHR, or waist circumference at three months or six months.

- **GRADE assessments**: The majority of outcomes were assessed as being low to very low certainty, as outlined in Tables 2 to 4. Within the comparison of MI vs metformin, the outcomes of total testosterone, clinical pregnancy rate, GI AEs, menstruation, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and waist circumference were assessed as moderate certainty. The main reasons for downgrading included the risk of bias (e.g. most studies had a high or moderate risk of bias), inconsistency due to wide CIs or CIs not overlapping, and imprecision resulting from a small number of studies or samples.

### Drug treatments for polycystic ovary syndrome [^1129czrJ]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome is a condition present in approximately 5 to 10 percent of women of childbearing age. Diagnosis can be difficult because the signs and symptoms can be subtle and varied. These may include hirsutism, infertility, menstrual irregularities, and biochemical abnormalities, most notably insulin resistance. Treatment should target specific manifestations and individualized patient goals.

When choosing a treatment regimen, physicians must take into account comorbidities and the patient's desire for pregnancy. Lifestyle modifications should be used in addition to medical treatments for optimal results. Few agents have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration specifically for use in polycystic ovary syndrome, and several agents are contraindicated in pregnancy.

Insulin-sensitizing agents are indicated for most women with polycystic ovary syndrome because they have positive effects on insulin resistance, menstrual irregularities, anovulation, hirsutism, and obesity. Metformin has the most data supporting its effectiveness. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are also effective for ameliorating hirsutism and insulin resistance. Metformin and clomiphene, alone or in combination, are first-line agents for ovulation induction. Insulin-sensitizing agents, oral contraceptives, spironolactone, and topical eflornithine can be used in patients with hirsutism.

Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is recognized as the most common endocrine disorder of reproductive-aged women around the world. This document, produced by the collaboration of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the Androgen Excess Society, aims to highlight the most important clinical issues confronting physicians and their patients with PCOS. It is a summary of best practices in 2014. Insulin resistance is believed to play an intrinsic role in the pathogenesis of PCOS. The mechanism by which insulin resistance or insulin give rise to oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenemia, however, is unclear.

Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies have shown that both obese and lean women with PCOS have some degree of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is implicated in the ovulatory dysfunction of PCOS by disrupting the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Given the association with insulin resistance, all women with PCOS require evaluation for the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and the possible risk of clinical events, such as acute myocardial infarction and stroke. Obese women with PCOS are at increased risk for MetS with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; 31 to 35%) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; 7.5 to 10%). Rates of progression from normal glucose tolerance to IGT, and in turn to T2DM, may be as high as 5 to 15% within 3 years. Data suggest the need for a baseline oral glucose tolerance test every 1 to 2 years based on family history of T2DM as well as body mass index.

- **MI vs DCI**: One study in euglycemic women undergoing ovulation induction for ICSI (n = 84) with unclear risk of bias suggests that 4 g MI daily for 8 weeks before FSH administration improves the total pregnancy rate [22 (51%) vs. 10 (24%), P < 0.05] compared to 1.2 g DCI daily. However, there is no difference in clinical pregnancy, biochemical pregnancy, and miscarriage rates. The evidence is of low certainty.

- **MI + DCI vs MI alone**: Two studies (n = 84) reported no differences between MI + DCI and MI alone for critical outcomes such as HOMA-IR, BMI, and FG score. One study (n = 22) reported no difference in any anthropometric or menstrual outcomes. Another study (n = 50) reported improvements in free and total testosterone levels (0.44 ng/dL ± 0.08 vs. 0.65 ng/dL ± 0.09, P < 0.05 and 50.4 ng/dL ± 10.2 vs. 60.3 ng/dL ± 12.7, P < 0.05, respectively), DHEAS (278 µg/dL ± 32 vs. 320 µg/dL ± 31, P < 0.05), fasting glucose (85.9 mg/dL ± 7.2 vs. 93.2 mg/dL ± 10.9, P < 0.05), and AUC glucose (12,358 mg/dL/min ± 515 vs. 16,209 mg/dL/min ± 447, P < 0.05) but found no differences in anthropometric outcomes (including WHR). All outcomes had a very low certainty of evidence. Doses were 1100 mg MI + 27.6 mg DCI (Inofolic Combi) daily versus 4 g MI daily for 3 to 6 months, with or without 400 mcg FA daily for 12 weeks.

New diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) were proposed in Rotterdam in 2003, which expanded the previous definition that arose from an expert conference sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1990. However, these newer criteria give rise to phenotypes that may not actually represent PCOS, and a simple modification of the 1990 NIH/National Institute of Child Health and Human Disease diagnostic criteria may be more consistent with currently available data.

### Inositol for polycystic ovary syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis to inform the 2023 update of the international Evidence-based PCOS guidelines [^112NnpXS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

- **Inositol vs CHC**: One trial (n = 70) assessed outcomes after 6 months of treatment and again 3 months after stopping treatment with MI + DCI compared to CHC. Results suggested no significant difference in weight, BMI, WHR, HOMA-IR, fasting insulin, fasting blood glucose, or testosterone after 6 months of treatment. There was improvement in HOMA-IR and fasting insulin level in the MI + DCI group when assessed 3 months after stopping treatment. Menstrual cycle length was shorter in the CHC group.

- **Inositol + metformin vs metformin alone**: One study (n = 50) showed no difference between groups for BMI, weight, and fasting insulin. Women received either 1 g MI + 1 g metformin daily or 1 g metformin only daily for 4 months. Supplemental analyses adding studies at moderate risk of compromised integrity for the critical outcome of BMI still showed no differences between groups (see Supplementary Data S7, Fig. 1).

- **MI + DCI + metformin vs metformin**: One study (n = 72) suggests there were improvements in menstrual irregularity (38.9% vs 63.9%, P = 0.034), cholesterol (31.58 mg/dL ± 23.99 vs 146.75 mg/dL ± 36.37, P = 0.040), HDL (47.25 mg/dL ± 15.92 vs 41.53 mg/dL ± 6.38, P = 0.049), LDL (85.89 mg/dL ± 19.84 vs 106.16 mg/dL ± 22.78, P = 0.0001), and postprandial insulin (35.30 mIU/L ± 18.94 vs 57.82 mIU/L ± 37.52, P = 0.005) with 1.1 g MI + 0.3 g DCI + 1 g metformin vs metformin alone for 6 months, with low certainty of evidence. There were no differences for hirsutism, androgens, anthropometry, or glucose, with low certainty of evidence.

### Rising incidence, health resource utilization, and costs of polycystic ovary syndrome in the United Kingdom [^111AUsWa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

The study was conducted using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) primary care (Aurum) and linked Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) datasets. The CPRD Aurum database is a longitudinal, anonymized research database derived from 1,489 primary care practices in England. CPRD Aurum contains records for 41 million patients and is representative of the English population in terms of age, sex, ethnicity, and deprivation.

Around 70% of practices engage in a linkage scheme, wherein their patient records are linked with various data sources. This includes integration with the HES dataset, detailing both inpatient and outpatient interactions across National Health Service hospitals in the United Kingdom. Additionally, patient records are linked to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) mortality dataset.

CPRD Aurum captures diagnostic information through both SNOMED CT (UK edition) and the Read code classification, a standard in UK primary care practices. Diagnoses within HES and ONS data are reported using the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) classification. Surgical procedures documented in HES employ the OPCS Classification of Interventions and Procedures version 4 (OPCS-4) classification.

### Chinese herbal medicine for subfertile women with polycystic ovarian syndrome [^113HRmgT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common reproductive endocrinology abnormalities, affecting 5% to 10% of women of reproductive age. Western medicines, such as oral contraceptives, insulin sensitizers, and laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD), have been used to treat PCOS. Recently, many studies have considered Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) as an alternative treatment for women with PCOS.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of CHM for subfertile women with PCOS.

- **Search methods**: We searched sources, including the following databases, from inception to 9 June 2016: the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED), PsycINFO, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP, Wanfang, and trial registries. In addition, we searched the reference lists of included trials and contacted experts in the field to locate trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that considered the use of CHM for the treatment of subfertile women with PCOS.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently screened appropriate trials for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias in included studies, and extracted data. We contacted primary study authors for additional information. Meta-analyses were conducted. We reported dichotomous data using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the quality of the evidence using the grading of recommendations.

### Statins for women with polycystic ovary syndrome not actively trying to conceive [^115XbYdb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Statins are lipid-lowering agents with pleiotropic actions. Experts have proposed that in addition to improving the dyslipidemia associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), statins may also exert other beneficial metabolic and endocrine effects, such as reducing testosterone levels. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2011.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of statin therapy in women with PCOS who are not actively trying to conceive.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group specialized register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHLs, along with four ongoing trials registers on 7 November 2022. We also handsearched relevant conference proceedings and the reference lists of relevant trials for any additional studies, and we contacted experts in the field for any further ongoing studies.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of statin therapy in women with PCOS not actively trying to conceive. Eligible comparisons were statin versus placebo or no treatment, statin plus another agent versus the other agent alone, and statin versus another agent. We performed statistical analysis using Review Manager 5, and we assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE methods.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methodology. Our primary outcomes were the resumption of menstrual regularity and the resumption of spontaneous ovulation. Our secondary outcomes were clinical and physiological measures including hirsutism and acne severity.

### Clustering identifies subtypes with different phenotypic characteristics in women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^112xXJx4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

In contrast, data-driven approaches to PCOS classification using unsupervised hierarchical clustering of quantitative traits identified three reproducible subtypes in cases with the NIH phenotype of OD and HA. These subtypes were designated: 1) "reproductive", characterized by higher luteinizing hormone (LH) and sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) levels with relatively low body mass index (BMI) and insulin levels; 2) "metabolic", characterized by increased glucose and insulin levels with lower SHBG and LH levels; and 3) "background", for the cases that demonstrated no distinguishable pattern regarding their relative phenotypic trait distributions. Each subtype was associated with unique genome-wide significant loci, suggesting that the subtypes had distinct genetic architecture. Further, these significant genetic associations provided orthogonal validation that the subtypes captured biologically distinct groups.

We undertook this study to investigate whether these subtypes were present in more broadly ascertained PCOS cases using the Rotterdam criteria. Further, we investigated whether the subtypes thus identified had differences in additional PCOS-related clinical variables not used for clustering and whether the differences aligned with distinct biologic pathways.

### Inositol for polycystic ovary syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis to inform the 2023 update of the international evidence-based PCOS guidelines [^112Y9TTA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Two studies trialed DCI alone. Twenty studies compared MI alone at doses of 1 to 4 g daily, either alone or in combination with FA 200 to 400 mcg daily, against comparators such as metformin, FA alone, or placebo. Three studies compared the combination of 550 mg MI + 13.8 mg DCI + 200 mcg FA twice daily to FA alone. Two studies compared varying ratios of MI and DCI.

One trial evaluated MI + DCI + metformin and one MI + metformin. Another had three arms comparing MI + monacolin K to MI alone and also to metformin alone. We included data only from the MI and metformin arms, as the comparison with MI + monacolin K was not considered relevant. One trial evaluated MI + DCI compared to a combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC).

Most trials provided interventions for at least six weeks, up to a maximum of six months. One study did not clearly define treatment duration, and one study only provided inositol during IVF stimulation. Follow-up ranged from eight weeks to six months and was not reported by one study.

- **Comparator**: Three studies were placebo-controlled. Ten studies used FA at doses ranging from 200 to 400 mcg daily. Twelve studies used metformin at doses of 1000 mg to 2000 mg daily, alone or in combination with FA as a comparator. Three studies used different combinations of MI + DCI as a comparator. One study used DCI 1.2 g daily alone as a comparator. One study used a CHC, 20 µg ethinyl estradiol and 3 mg drospirenone, as a comparator.

### Inositol for polycystic ovary syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis to inform the 2023 update of the international evidence-based PCOS guidelines [^114XeqhP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

We assessed risk of bias for each trial using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 1.0 tool. Two reviewers independently assessed random sequence generation (selection bias), allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias), blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective reporting (reporting bias), and other biases. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion.

The certainty of evidence was assessed by M. A. and V.F. using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach, as outlined in the GRADE handbook. The GRADE approach uses five considerations: risk of bias, inconsistency of effect, indirectness, imprecision, and other biases including publication bias. The evidence can be downgraded from "high quality" by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments of these domains.

- **Data analysis**: The key contacts (clinical leads) for the guideline judged the following outcomes as critical (for GRADE purposes): free testosterone (FT), homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), 2-hour glucose, and BMI. The remaining outcomes were judged as important but not critical. Outcome data were extracted from original intention-to-treat results wherever possible or from per-protocol results if these were the only outcomes available. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² statistic. Outcomes from individual studies were pooled using random effects models.

### A genome-wide association study of polycystic ovary syndrome identified from electronic health records [^116poZZy]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age. A number of criteria have been developed for the clinical diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome, with the Rotterdam criteria being the most inclusive. Evidence suggests that polycystic ovary syndrome is significantly heritable, and previous studies have identified genetic variants associated with polycystic ovary syndrome diagnosed using different criteria. The widely adopted electronic health record system provides an opportunity to identify patients with polycystic ovary syndrome using the Rotterdam criteria for genetic studies.

- **Objective**: To identify novel associated genetic variants under the same phenotype definition, we extracted polycystic ovary syndrome cases and unaffected controls based on the Rotterdam criteria from the electronic health records and performed a discovery-validation genome-wide association study.

- **Study design**: We developed a polycystic ovary syndrome phenotyping algorithm on the basis of the Rotterdam criteria and applied it to three electronic health record-linked biobanks to identify cases and controls for genetic study. In the discovery phase, we performed an individual genome-wide association study using the Geisinger MyCode and the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics cohorts, which were then meta-analyzed. We attempted validation of the significant association loci (P < 1×10⁻⁶) in the BioVU cohort. All association analyses used logistic regression, assuming an additive genetic model, and adjusted for principal components to control.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome: Pathophysiology and therapeutic opportunities [^1151xY7o]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Genetic loci identified by genome-wide association studies currently account for only 10% of the known heritability, which is about 70%, of polycystic ovary syndrome, suggesting other influences on the pathogenesis of the disease. Emerging evidence indicates that polycystic ovary syndrome might have its origins in utero and thus could be subject to developmental programming and epigenetic modifications.

Prenatal exposure to androgens in several preclinical models resulted in a permanent polycystic ovary syndrome-like phenotype postnatally. A programming effect might also persist transgenerationally because pregnant mice treated with dihydrotestosterone produced female offspring with polycystic ovary syndrome-like phenotypes from the first to the third generations of offspring. Cautious interpretation is needed, however, because these models might not accurately reflect the human phenotype.

Levels of anti-müllerian hormone might also be involved with in utero programming. These levels increased significantly in pregnant women with polycystic ovary syndrome (P < 0.001), and use of this hormone caused gonadotrophin releasing hormone neuronal hyperactivity as well as androgen excess in pregnant mice. Epigenetic mechanisms might also be involved in mediating susceptibility to polycystic ovary syndrome, with differential methylation patterns and microRNA expression detected in adipose tissue and ovarian tissue of patients with polycystic ovary syndrome compared with controls.

### International classification of disease coding for obstructive lung disease: Does it reflect appropriate clinical documentation [^112dTi7a]. Chest (2010). Low credibility.

International Classification of Disease coding is widely used by physicians, hospitals, healthcare payers, and governments to assess the health of populations and as a means of reimbursement for medical care based on diagnosis and severity of illness. The classification system, International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition (ICD-9), will soon be replaced by the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10). When the codes related to COPD and asthma are examined, the clinical relevance of the categories in International Classification of Disease coding must be questioned.

In the future, a more simplified terminology consistent with clinical usage could improve the accuracy and ease of coding. At present, however, clinicians should become familiar with the current ICD-9 and future ICD-10 codes so that their descriptions of illnesses in medical records more accurately reflect coding terminology.

### Impact of metformin on the clinical and metabolic parameters of women with polycystic ovary syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113UP7xK]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Subgroup analysis was performed at different levels where data from at least two RCTs were available on the same outcome. The analysis was based on the administered dosage of metformin (e.g. 500, 750, 1000, 1500, and 2000 mg), frequency of administration (once a day - QD, twice a day - BID, or three times a day - TDS), and duration of the intervention (weeks/months/years). Moreover, outcome-specific weighted effect estimates, regardless of the dosage of metformin and the frequency and duration of administration, were quantified and reported. Data collected immediately after the intervention or at follow-up were included in the analysis. The funnel plot of the RevMan with standard error (SE) was used to assess publication bias where more than 10 RCTs were meta-analyzed.

### Clinical practice guidelines on the diagnosis and management of polycystic ovary syndrome: A systematic review and quality assessment study [^1116kF4t]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). High credibility.

Our electronic search identified 575 titles and abstracts. We screened 26 articles in full against our inclusion criteria and included a total of 5 national and 8 international PCOS CPGs (n = 13).

- **Selection and inclusion process**: The majority of included CPGs were published within the last 10 years (range 2007–2018), and all but one were reported as peer-reviewed. Most CPGs used simple panel discussions to reach consensus among coauthors. Only 15% (2/13) used an established consensus methodology such as the Delphi method. Seven CPGs (54%) utilized a clear evidence grading system when making recommendations. Merely two guidelines (15%) provided clear implementation tools for integrating evidence into clinical practice.

The median number of recommendations per guideline was 26, with a range from 6 to 90. Screening for and managing metabolic disease was the most commonly covered disease domain in 92% (12/13) of the CPGs, followed by recommendations on cardiovascular risk assessment (77%, 10/13). In contrast, management of mental health (62%, 8/13) and diagnosis in adolescents (54%, 7/13) were the least commonly addressed disease domains.

### The reproductive phenotype in polycystic ovary syndrome [^112JwwLd]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

The symptoms of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) include hirsutism and irregular menstrual bleeding due to ovarian androgen excess and chronic anovulation. Typically, these features emerge late in puberty or shortly thereafter. The proposed mechanisms responsible for increased ovarian androgen production include heightened theca cell responsiveness to gonadotropin stimulation, increased pituitary secretion of luteinizing hormone, and hyperinsulinemia. The cause of ovulatory dysfunction is not well understood but is linked to abnormal follicle growth and development within the ovary. As a result, infertility is common among women with PCOS, and in many instances, it is the initial presenting complaint.

Insulin resistance and obesity are frequently associated with PCOS and probably contribute to the severity of symptoms. The polycystic ovary that accompanies the syndrome has recently been defined as having 12 or more follicles per ovary or an ovarian volume greater than 10 ml, as determined by ultrasonography. In addition, there is an increased number of growing follicles in the polycystic ovary. Despite this distinctive appearance, the cause and development of the polycystic ovary are completely unknown.

In meta-analyses of prevalence studies, there was a significant association between PCOS and CVD events. Pooled results demonstrated an increased OR for composite CVD (10 studies; 148,470 PCOS versus 341,047 controls; OR, 1.68 [95% CI, 1.26–2.23]; I² = 71.0%), composite IHD (8 studies; 34,974 PCOS versus 141,222 controls; OR, 1.48 [95% CI, 1.07–2.05]; I² = 81.0%), MI (9 studies; 148,145 PCOS versus 315,879 controls; OR, 2.50 [95% CI, 1.43–4.38]; I² = 83.3%), and stroke (10 studies; 160,484 PCOS versus 391,560 controls; OR, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.20–2.44]; I² = 81.4%).

There was no statistically significant relationship between PCOS and cardiovascular death (3 studies; 369 PCOS versus 712 controls; OR, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.65–2.02]; I² = 0%).

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^113CWGcc]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

- **Hcs: Indications and screening**: We recommend HCs (i.e. oral contraceptives, patch, or vaginal ring) as first-line management for the menstrual abnormalities and hirsutism/acne of PCOS, which treat these two problems concurrently (refer to hirsutism guidelines in recommendation 2.1.1). We recommend screening for contraindications to HC use via established criteria. For women with PCOS, we do not suggest one HC formulation over another.

- **3.1–3.2 Evidence**: In women with PCOS, the progestin in HCs suppresses LH levels and thus ovarian androgen production, and the estrogen increases SHBG, reducing bioavailable androgen. Some progestins have antiandrogenic properties due to their antagonizing effects on the androgen receptor and/or the inhibition of 5α-reductase activity. This has led to claims of increased efficacy for specific formulations, although there is no supporting level 1 clinical trial evidence. The choice of oral vs. parenteral HC (i.e. patch or vaginal ring) remains uncertain, although risk-benefit ratios may vary among preparations and with different progestins in oral contraception. There is some evidence that extended-cycle HCs (vs. cyclic therapy) offer greater hormonal suppression and prevent rebound ovarian function during the pill-free interval.

The outcomes reported were heterogeneous. Follow-up duration ranged from completion of an IVF cycle to 6 months after treatment. Up to 23 studies reported on metabolic outcomes, including fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index, area under the curve (AUC) insulin, and AUC glucose. Twelve studies reported total cholesterol, while 10 reported low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglyceride levels. Twenty-nine studies reported on BMI, 16 on waist-hip ratio (WHR), 12 on weight, and 8 on waist circumference.

Androgenicity outcomes were reported by up to 14 studies. These included hirsutism, reported as the Ferriman-Gallwey (FG) or modified Ferriman-Gallwey scores, total and FT levels, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEAS), androstenedione, and free androgen index. Reproductive outcomes were reported by up to 13 studies, specifically menstrual regularity, ovulation rate, pregnancy rates, and live birth rate. Gastrointestinal adverse events (GI AEs) were reported by 6 trials, and other adverse events were reported by 2 trials. One study comparing MI and metformin reported on psychological outcomes, including depression and quality of life.

- **Risk of bias**: Figure 2A and 2B describe the risk of bias across studies. Around half to one-third of included trials were judged at low risk of selection bias (16/30 low risk for randomization, 11/30 for allocation concealment). Few trials were judged at low risk of bias for one or more aspects of performance (7/30).

### Women with polycystic ovary syndrome have an increased risk of major cardiovascular events: A population study [^1165DzzX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). High credibility.

This was a retrospective cohort study utilizing primary care data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Aurum database, a longitudinal and anonymized research database derived from 883 primary care practices in England. CPRD Aurum contains records for more than 28 million patients and is representative of the English population in terms of age, sex, and deprivation.

Approximately 70% of practices participate in a linkage scheme, allowing their patient records to be linked to other data sources, including the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) dataset, which provides data on all inpatient and outpatient contacts occurring within National Health Service hospitals in the United Kingdom, and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) mortality dataset. HES and ONS data are available for patients participating in the linkage scheme outside the period of primary care registration.

Diagnostic information in CPRD Aurum is recorded using a combination of SNOMED CT (UK Edition) and Read code classification, a UK primary-care practice standard. Diagnoses in HES and ONS data are recorded using the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems classification (ICD-10). Surgical procedures in HES are recorded using the OPCS Classification of Interventions and Procedures version 4 (OPCS-4) classification.

- **Patient selection and matching of controls**: The study was conducted using data from CPRD Aurum and linked HES and ONS mortality datasets. This study included patients identified by CPRD as being of an affected population group.

### No. 362-ovulation induction in polycystic ovary syndrome [^115hCB4p]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of polycystic ovary syndrome, specifically in terms of ovulation induction, the 2018 SOGC guidelines recommend considering the initiation of gonadotropins as a second-line therapy for fertility in patients with PCOS who have anovulatory cycles. It is important to obtain both ultrasound and laboratory monitoring during gonadotropin treatment, recognizing that this approach is associated with high costs, a high risk of cancellation due to higher than acceptable follicular development, a risk of multiple births, and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.

### Polycystic ovaries are common in women with hyperandrogenic chronic anovulation but do not predict metabolic or reproductive phenotype [^113PGXtu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous disorder of unexplained hyperandrogenic chronic anovulation. Experts have recommended including the morphology and volume of the ovary in the diagnostic criteria for PCOS. We conducted this study to determine whether there was an association between the morphology and size of the ovaries and markers of insulin sensitivity, as determined by dynamic testing within women with PCOS or compared with a group of control women. Subsequently, we examined reproductive parameters.

We studied 88 unrelated PCOS women and 21 control women, aged 17–45 years. All participants were in the early follicular phase or its equivalent, characterized by no follicle with a diameter greater than 10 mm and anovulatory serum progesterone levels less than 3 ng/ml. Subjects underwent phlebotomy for baseline hormones, a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test, and transvaginal ultrasound to determine the morphology and volume of the ovaries, all on the same day.

Ninety-five percent (84 of 88) of women with PCOS and 48% (10 of 21) of the control women had polycystic ovaries according to the criteria of at least one ovary greater than 10 cm³ (PCOV) and/or polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM), using the identification of 10 or more peripheral follicular cysts 8 mm in diameter or less in one plane along with increased central ovarian stroma. PCOM was a better discriminator than PCOV between PCOS and control women. The odds of women with PCOS having PCOM were elevated 50-fold compared with controls (odds ratio, 50; 95% confidence interval, 10–240; P < 0.0001), whereas the odds of PCOV were elevated 5-fold in women with PCOS (odds ratio, 4.6; 95% confidence interval…).

### Acog practice bulletin no. 108: Polycystic ovary syndrome [^113Ma6bM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries. Its etiology remains unknown, and treatment is largely symptom-based and empirical. PCOS has the potential to cause substantial metabolic sequelae, including an increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. These factors should be considered when determining long-term treatment. The purpose of this document is to examine the best available evidence for the diagnosis and clinical management of PCOS.

### Characterizing the clinical and genetic spectrum of polycystic ovary syndrome in electronic health records [^1114anoP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the leading causes of infertility; however, diagnostic criteria are ineffective at identifying patients whose symptoms reside outside strict diagnostic parameters. As a result, PCOS is underdiagnosed, and its etiology remains poorly understood. We aim to characterize the phenotypic spectrum of PCOS clinical features within and across racial and ethnic groups.

We developed a strictly defined PCOS algorithm (PCOS keyword-strict) using the International Classification of Diseases, ninth and tenth revisions, and keywords mined from clinical notes in electronic health records (EHRs) data. We systematically relaxed the inclusion criteria to evaluate changes in epidemiological and genetic associations, resulting in three subsequent algorithms: PCOS coded-broad, PCOS coded-strict, and PCOS keyword-broad. We evaluated the performance of each phenotyping approach and characterized prominent clinical features observed in racially and ethnically diverse PCOS patients.

The best performance was demonstrated by the PCOS coded-strict algorithm, with a positive predictive value of 98%. Individuals classified as cases by this algorithm showed significantly higher body mass index (BMI), insulin levels, free testosterone values, and genetic risk scores for PCOS compared to controls. Median BMI was higher among African American females with PCOS compared to White and Hispanic females with the condition.

In conclusion, PCOS symptoms manifest across a severity spectrum that parallels the continuous genetic liability to PCOS.

### Risk of type 2 diabetes, MASLD, and cardiovascular disease in people living with polycystic ovary syndrome [^111ArTwv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

- **Methods**: The study population was derived from the UK Biobank (UKBB), a nationwide, longitudinal, biomedical database containing in-depth health information. Recruitment of over 500,000 participants, aged 40 to 69, occurred between 2006 and 2010 by postal invitation. Approximately 60,000 participants have undergone multiorgan MRI.

Participants attended one of 22 assessment centers in England, Scotland, or Wales, where they completed demographic, medical history, and lifestyle questionnaires during a baseline assessment visit. Additionally, self-reported doctor-diagnosed medical conditions were verified and coded during face-to-face interviews, and a physical examination was performed, with the collection of blood and urine samples. All participants consented to linkage of their electronic health records to enable prospective data collection, including death and cancer records held by the Office for National Statistics and the Registrar General's Office, as well as hospital records held by the Department of Health's Hospital Episode Statistics and Scottish Morbidity Records. At the time of analysis, mortality and hospital admission data were available up to April 2023. Ethics approval was granted by the North West Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee, and permission to access UKBB data was approved under project 74170.

- **Inclusion criteria**: We identified all participants within the UKBB who had a previous PCOS diagnosis at their baseline assessment. PCOS was defined using an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth/Tenth Revision (ICD-9/10) code or a doctor-verified self-reported diagnosis.

### Role of metformin for ovulation induction in infertile patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): a guideline [^111SW7Cb]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for polycystic ovary syndrome, specifically concerning insulin sensitizers, the ASRM 2017 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of metformin to increase the ovulation rate in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome. However, it is recognized that metformin alone is less effective than clomiphene citrate alone for achieving ovulation induction, clinical pregnancy, and live birth.

### Characterizing the clinical and genetic spectrum of polycystic ovary syndrome in electronic health records [^111DBTpN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder that is the leading cause of infertility in females. The genetic, environmental, and metabolic variables that contribute to its complex architecture also influence clinical heterogeneity among individuals with PCOS, resulting in a broad spectrum of symptoms. The heterogeneous clinical presentation of PCOS makes it difficult to diagnose, and an estimated 75% of females with PCOS remain undiagnosed.

There are three commonly used diagnostic criteria for PCOS that each have specific symptom requirements for diagnosis. The first diagnostic definition was put forth by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which required an ovulatory phenotype (e.g. oligomenorrhea) and hyperandrogenism for diagnosis. Subsequently, the second diagnostic definition for PCOS was created by the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, commonly referred to as the Rotterdam criteria. The Rotterdam diagnostic criteria were designed to expand the PCOS definition from the strict NIH definition by requiring any two of the following three symptoms: oligoanovulation, hyperandrogenism, or polycystic ovaries. However, the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society argued that hyperandrogenism is the primary driver of PCOS and thus created a third diagnostic criterion that requires both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction (e.g. oligoanovulation or polycystic ovaries). PCOS diagnostic criteria were developed to improve and standardize diagnoses; however, patients identified by each approach may have differing clinical presentations.

Regarding specific circumstances for polycystic ovary syndrome, especially concerning pregnant patients, the ES 2013 guidelines recommend obtaining a preconceptual assessment of BMI, BP, and oral glucose tolerance. This is due to the increased risk of pregnancy complications, such as gestational diabetes, preterm delivery, and preeclampsia, which are exacerbated by obesity in patients with PCOS.

### Genomic correlation, shared loci, and causal relationship between obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome: A large-scale genome-wide cross-trait analysis [^111Nwk2G]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

To identify individual SNPs affecting both obesity-related traits and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), we conducted a pairwise CPASSOC analysis. As shown in Table 2, we identified a total of 9 independent loci shared between BMI and PCOS (adult: 5 loci — rs10938397, rs705696, rs1569979, rs10142183, and rs11672660; childhood: 4 loci — rs12641981, rs10987375, rs8050136, and rs7228430). Additionally, we discovered 6 independent loci shared between WHR and PCOS (rs3767846, rs13032835, rs188488867, rs7774737, rs1421085, and rs310011), and 5 independent loci shared between WHR adjusted for BMI and PCOS (rs3767846, rs13032835, rs7774737, rs11057429, and rs310011). All these SNPs fulfilled P single trait < 1×10^−3 and P CPASSOC < 5×10^−8. Notably, none of these 16 SNPs identified by CPASSOC were previously reported to be associated with PCOS at genome-wide significance (0 out of 16 SNPs), while most of them were associated with obesity-related traits (14 out of 16 SNPs).

For adult BMI and PCOS, the most significant shared SNP was rs10938397 (P CPASSOC = 1.25×10^−49), located in an intergenic region. The second most significant shared SNP, rs11672660 (P CPASSOC = 1.87×10^−32), was located near GIPR, a gene associated with BMI and glucose tolerance, and MIR642A, a gene involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Among the 5 adult BMI-PCOS shared SNPs, rs705696 was near ERBB3, a locus known to be associated with PCOS. For childhood BMI and PCOS, the most significant shared SNP, rs8050136 (P CPASSOC = 1.56×10^−21), was near FTO, a locus known to affect BMI and th.

### Perspectives on polycystic ovary syndrome: Is polycystic ovary syndrome research underfunded [^115Z6msC]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine-metabolic abnormality with a worldwide prevalence of 4% to 21%, depending on diagnostic criteria. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the largest single funding agency in the world; it invests nearly $30.0 billion annually in biomedical research.

- **Evidence acquisition**: Using the NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting tool, we searched for all grants awarded by the NIH for PCOS and three other disorders with similar degrees of morbidity and similar or lower mortality and prevalence [rheumatoid arthritis (RA), tuberculosis (TB), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)].

- **Evidence synthesis**: We compared funding by the NIH for PCOS, RA, TB, and SLE research for the years 2006 to 2015, inclusive.

- **Conclusion**: PCOS, compared with RA, TB, and SLE, was relatively less funded (total mean 10-year funding was $215.12 million vs. $454.39 million, $773.77 million, and $609.52 million, respectively). Funding for PCOS was largely provided by one NIH Institute/Center (ICs) vs. at least two ICs for SLE and RA. More individual Research Project Grants were awarded for RA, SLE, and TB than for PCOS, whereas PCOS funding was more likely to be through General Clinical Research Centers Program or Specialized Centers Program awards. Our data suggest that PCOS research may be underfunded considering its prevalence, economic burden, metabolic morbidity, and negative impact on quality of life. Greater education of NIH leaders, including those at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, is essential.
