## Question

What is the best treatments and supplements for PCOS?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best treatments and supplements for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching guideline framework and diagnostic anchors that shape treatment choices. Then, I should verify first-line lifestyle therapy and its evidence base. Next, I will examine pharmacologic management for menstrual and hyperandrogenic symptoms, followed by metabolic therapy and infertility treatment. After that, I need to scrutinize supplements, especially inositol and vitamin D, and clarify where the evidence is weak or experimental. Finally, I will integrate adolescent-specific considerations, shared decision-making, and a practical, phenotype-driven algorithm, making sure I double-check any conflicting recommendations along the way.

> Let me first confirm the guideline foundation so I don't jump to conclusions. The 2023 International Evidence-Based Guideline for PCOS is the most authoritative, multidisciplinary, and consumer-engaged source, updating the 2018 framework and emphasizing individualized, shared decision-making across reproductive, metabolic, and psychological domains; it also aligns with the Rotterdam-based diagnostic criteria and now allows AMH as an alternative to ultrasound in adults, which will matter for tailoring therapy and monitoring expectations [^114PNgub] [^111T6jk3] [^114NbQzh].

> I need to ensure the hierarchy of treatments is clear. The guideline consistently positions supported healthy lifestyle as foundational across the lifespan, with pharmacologic therapy layered based on symptoms, goals, and risk profile. Supplements are generally not recommended as primary therapy due to limited and uncertain evidence, so I should be cautious not to overstate their role [^114WFy5x] [^113sngUN] [^114RQjqV].

> Now, let me verify first-line lifestyle therapy. There is no single superior diet composition. Any sustainable, calorie-appropriate pattern consistent with general healthy-eating principles works, and even modest weight loss (about 5–10%) can improve insulin sensitivity, androgen markers, and ovulatory function. I should emphasize flexibility, cultural tailoring, and family engagement to improve adherence, and avoid weight stigma during counseling [^113sngUN] [^112KNJQq] [^114WFy5x]. For physical activity, at least 150 minutes per week of moderate–vigorous intensity plus resistance training is reasonable, with structured support improving outcomes. I should confirm that the evidence base is smaller but directionally consistent with metabolic and anthropometric benefits, including reduced waist circumference and improved insulin dynamics [^112DZkRb].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of weight management beyond diet and exercise. In those with higher weight, structured, intensive programs and ongoing support yield clinically meaningful improvements. Anti-obesity pharmacotherapy and bariatric/metabolic surgery can be considered in selected adults per general-population obesity guidelines, but for PCOS-specific reproductive outcomes, anti-obesity agents should be limited to research settings pending stronger evidence, so I need to be explicit about this boundary [^114DncuV] [^113drmbc] [^115gjgoa].

> Next, I will examine pharmacologic management of menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism. Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs) are first-line for cycle control and androgen-related symptoms; lower ethinyl estradiol doses are preferred, and there is no specific formulation mandated, so I should tailor to risk profile and patient preference while reviewing contraindications and potential metabolic effects, especially in those with higher BMI or cardiovascular risk [^117BX9Sd] [^111myZ3G]. Wait, let me verify the anti-androgen role: spironolactone can be added for hirsutism after 6 months of COCP if response is inadequate or used when COCPs are contraindicated, but it should be paired with reliable contraception due to teratogenic risk; evidence does not support anti-androgens preferentially over COCPs for hyperandrogenism, so sequencing matters [^115e28uf] [^112dxxiT].

> I should double-check metformin's place in non-fertility care. Metformin is recommended primarily for metabolic indications in adults with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m², improving insulin resistance, glucose and lipid profiles; it can be considered in lean adults for metabolic features, acknowledging weaker evidence, and in adolescents for cycle regulation with limited data; typical dosing is 500–850 mg twice daily, titrated slowly to reduce GI effects, with awareness of B12 monitoring over time [^111WRzTZ] [^111GXWnL]. But wait, what if someone cannot tolerate metformin? In that scenario, myo-inositol may be considered as an alternative for metabolic outcomes, recognizing that metformin generally has greater efficacy for central adiposity and hirsutism, albeit with more GI side effects; I should frame inositol as conditional and variable in quality [^1122iLFP] [^112GM5Ta].

> Let me now review infertility treatment, since this is often the pivot point. Letrozole is first-line for ovulation induction in anovulatory women with PCOS, with dose escalation and careful pregnancy testing before initiation; clomiphene citrate remains an alternative, and metformin alone is less effective but may be considered when first-line agents are unsuitable or unavailable, with shared decision-making about off-label status and monitoring needs [^115tdTX5] [^1166Mcnz] [^114KMFar]. I should confirm that gonadotropins are second-line with intensive monitoring to mitigate multiple pregnancy risk, and IVF is third-line when prior strategies fail, using PCOS-specific protocols to reduce OHSS risk [^1164E4zM] [^1166Mcnz].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought clomiphene was still broadly first-line based on older guidance. Hold on, I should verify the timing of recommendations. The 2023 international guideline explicitly elevates letrozole to first-line, reflecting accumulating RCT evidence, whereas some earlier documents listed clomiphene first; reconciling this, I will state letrozole as current first-line and note clomiphene as an accepted alternative, especially where letrozole access or policy differs [^115tdTX5] [^1129JGvG] [^112qQf35].

> I will now examine supplements, starting with inositol. Myo-inositol shows small signals for metabolic parameters but has limited and uncertain effects on ovulation, pregnancy, and live birth. The 2023 guideline concludes inositol should be considered experimental for infertility and cannot recommend specific types, doses, or combinations due to heterogeneity and low-quality evidence, so I should not overpromise benefit and must discuss cost, regulation, and variability with patients [^115TGnwJ] [^1122iLFP]. Let me reconsider metformin versus inositol: metformin remains preferred for clinically important outcomes like central adiposity and hirsutism, with inositol as a conditional alternative mainly for those intolerant to metformin, ideally within shared decision-making that acknowledges limited clinical benefit [^112GM5Ta] [^1122iLFP].

> Next, I should review vitamin D. Deficiency is common in PCOS, but evidence for supplementation improving core PCOS outcomes is limited and inconsistent. Routine supplementation is not guideline-endorsed for PCOS-specific indications, though correcting deficiency for general health is reasonable, and I should avoid implying reproductive or metabolic benefits beyond what trials have shown [^115vcT3q]. But wait, what if a patient is already taking vitamin D? I should confirm levels, replete if deficient, and frame continuation as general bone and immune health rather than a PCOS-targeted therapy [^115vcT3q].

> I need to check other supplements. Selenium has only very limited RCT data and cannot be recommended for PCOS management. Omega-3 fatty acids and chromium are sometimes discussed, but again, high-quality PCOS-specific evidence is sparse, so I should discourage routine use outside of research or specific deficiencies. In-silico modeling suggesting combinations like myo-inositol with melatonin and alpha-lipoic acid is hypothesis-generating, not practice-changing, and should not guide clinical decisions yet [^115Wge5k] [^112WUrdg] [^114RQjqV].

> Let me consider adolescent-specific management so I don't overgeneralize from adults. In adolescents, both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required for diagnosis, and ultrasound or AMH should not be used diagnostically; management emphasizes healthy lifestyle, weight gain prevention, and cycle control with COCPs when needed, with metformin considered for cycle regulation or metabolic indications in selected cases and careful attention to psychosocial health and weight stigma [^111T6jk3] [^111myZ3G] [^111WRzTZ]. Hold on, I should verify that anti-obesity pharmacotherapy is not established for adolescents with PCOS; indeed, evidence is lacking and adult obesity guidance cannot be extrapolated to youth with PCOS, reinforcing lifestyle-first approaches [^113Qfaci].

> I should confirm the principle of shared decision-making and off-label counseling, since many PCOS treatments are not formally approved for this indication. Clinicians must explain evidence quality, potential benefits and harms, and cost or access issues, aligning choices with patient values and local regulations; this is especially critical for ovulation induction agents and for complementary therapies like inositol, where regulation and product quality vary widely [^114uX3F8] [^115TGnwJ] [^1122iLFP].

> Let me synthesize a practical, phenotype-guided approach while keeping the evidence limitations front and center. For all patients, start with supported healthy lifestyle and screen for metabolic and psychological comorbidities. For menstrual irregularity and/or hirsutism, use COCPs as first-line pharmacotherapy with add-on spironolactone if needed. For metabolic features, prioritize metformin in those with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m², consider metformin in lean patients with metabolic risk, and consider myo-inositol only if metformin is not tolerated and goals are modest. For infertility, use letrozole first-line with careful monitoring, reserving gonadotropins and IVF as stepwise options. Throughout, revisit goals, side effects, and adherence at regular intervals and adjust the plan collaboratively [^114PNgub] [^117BX9Sd] [^111WRzTZ] [^115tdTX5] [^1166Mcnz].

> Finally, I should double-check that I have not overstated any claims. The evidence base for PCOS management remains largely low to moderate quality, so I need to communicate uncertainty transparently, avoid weight stigma, and emphasize realistic, sustainable lifestyle goals. Supplements should not displace guideline-supported therapies, and any experimental use should be documented with informed consent and safety monitoring, consistent with the 2023 international guideline's emphasis on evidence-based, patient-centered care [^114PNgub] [^114WFy5x] [^115TGnwJ].

---

The best treatments for PCOS are **lifestyle therapy** (weight loss, diet, exercise) [^113sngUN] and **metformin** for metabolic features [^111WRzTZ]; **letrozole** is first-line for ovulation induction [^115tdTX5], with clomiphene or gonadotropins as alternatives [^1166Mcnz]. Combined oral contraceptives are first-line for menstrual regulation and hyperandrogenism [^117BX9Sd] [^1117rGpu]. Supplements are not routinely recommended: inositol may be considered for mild metabolic benefits but is inferior to metformin [^1122iLFP] [^112GM5Ta]; vitamin D is only for deficiency [^115vcT3q]; omega-3s, chromium, and NAC have limited or uncertain evidence [^114RQjqV]. Management should be **individualized** [^114uX3F8], with shared decision-making [^114uX3F8] and regular monitoring of metabolic and reproductive outcomes [^1166Mcnz].

---

## Lifestyle interventions

Lifestyle interventions are the cornerstone of PCOS management, providing broad benefits across metabolic, reproductive, and psychological domains [^114WFy5x].

- **Weight loss**: Even modest weight loss (5–10%) significantly improves insulin sensitivity, menstrual regularity, androgen levels, and fertility outcomes [^115EXVUd] [^1153znYR].

- **Diet**: No specific diet is superior; sustainable, calorie-restricted diets with reduced refined carbohydrates and saturated fats are recommended [^113sngUN] [^115EXVUd].

- **Exercise**: Regular aerobic and resistance training improve insulin sensitivity, weight management, and psychological well-being [^112DZkRb].

---

## Pharmacological treatments

Pharmacological therapy is tailored to symptoms, fertility goals, and metabolic risk [^114NbQzh].

| **Clinical goal** | **First-line pharmacological treatment** | **Alternative treatments** |
|-|-|-|
| Menstrual regulation and hyperandrogenism | Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs) [^117BX9Sd] | - Metformin (if COCPs contraindicated) [^112uYBUj] <br/> - Anti-androgens (spironolactone, finasteride) for hirsutism [^112dxxiT] |
| Metabolic features (insulin resistance, dyslipidemia) | Metformin [^111WRzTZ] | - Thiazolidinediones (limited use) [^114sxcpZ] <br/> - GLP-1 agonists (emerging evidence) [^112U3AEh] |
| Ovulation induction | Letrozole [^115tdTX5] | - Clomiphene citrate [^1129JGvG] <br/> - Gonadotropins [^1164E4zM] <br/> - Laparoscopic ovarian drilling [^1166Mcnz] |

---

## Supplements

Evidence for supplements is limited; they should not replace evidence-based therapies [^113Qfaci].

- **Inositol (myo- and D-chiro-inositol)**: May modestly improve insulin sensitivity and menstrual regularity, but evidence is limited and inconsistent; not superior to metformin [^1122iLFP] [^112GM5Ta].

- **Vitamin D**: Supplementation is recommended only for documented deficiency; routine use is not supported [^notfound].

- **Omega-3 fatty acids**: Limited evidence suggests potential benefits for metabolic parameters, but more research is needed [^notfound].

- **Chromium and N-acetylcysteine (NAC)**: Insufficient evidence to support routine use [^113Qfaci].

---

## Emerging therapies

Emerging therapies show promise but require further research. GLP-1 agonists (e.g. liraglutide) demonstrate benefits for weight loss and metabolic parameters [^112U3AEh], and **SGLT2 inhibitors** are under investigation for metabolic improvements [^112U3AEh]. Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) are also being explored for **hyperandrogenism**, though evidence remains preliminary [^notfound].

---

## Individualized care and monitoring

PCOS management should be **individualized**, incorporating patient preferences, cultural factors, and reproductive goals [^117ACvpo]. Regular monitoring of metabolic parameters, menstrual regularity, and psychological well-being is essential [^113xdTro].

---

Lifestyle interventions and metformin are the **best-supported treatments** for PCOS, with letrozole first-line for ovulation induction [^113xdTro]. Supplements have limited evidence and should be used cautiously. Individualized, evidence-based care with regular monitoring is essential for optimal outcomes [^114PNgub].

5 | DISCUSSION

The International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide clinicians with a quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by the five GDGs. Detailed methods for stakeholder engagement and guideline development can be found at. The guideline provides 166 recommendations: EBR = 31, CCR = 59, and CPP = 76. Overall evidence is low to moderate quality, requiring significant research expansion in this neglected, yet common condition.

We endorse the Rotterdam PCOS Diagnostic Criteria in adults (two of oligo- or anovulation, clinical and/or biochemical hyperandrogenism, or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound), after exclusion of related disorders. Where both oligo- or anovulation and hyperandrogenism are present, ultrasound is not necessary for diagnosis. In adolescents, both oligo-anovulation and hyperandrogenism are required, with ultrasound not recommended for diagnosis. Ultrasound criterions are refined with advancing technology. Antimüllerian hormone levels are not yet adequate for diagnosis of PCOS. Insulin resistance is recognized as a key feature of PCOS, yet clinical measurement is not recommended at the current time. Once diagnosed, assessment and management includes reproductive, metabolic, and psychological features. Education, self-empowerment, multidisciplinary care, and lifestyle intervention for prevention or management of excess weight are prioritized. Depressive and anxiety symptoms should be screened, assessed and managed and health professionals should be aware of other impacts on emotional wellbeing and quality of life. Combined oral contraceptive pills are first-line pharmacological management for menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism, with no specific formulation recommended and with low dose preparations preferred. Metformin is recommended in addition or alone, primarily for management of metabolic features. Letrozole is first-line pharmacological infertility therapy; with clomiphene and metformin both having a role alone and in combination. In women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility, gonadotrophins are second line. In the absence of an absolute indication for IVF, women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility, could be offered IVF third line where other ovulation induction therapies have failed.

What Does This Mean for Those With PCOS?

Building on the 2018 International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), this Guideline updates and expands clinical questions, aiming to ensure that women with PCOS receive optimal, evidence-based care that meets their needs and improves health outcomes. The guideline and translation program were developed with full consumer participation at all stages including priority topics and outcomes for those with PCOS. The aim is to support women and their healthcare providers to optimize diagnosis, assessment and management of PCOS. There is an emphasis on improved education and awareness of healthcare professionals, partnership in care, and empowerment of women with PCOS. Personal characteristics, preferences, culture and values are considered, in addition to resource availability across different settings. With effective translation, the Guideline will address priorities identified by women with PCOS, upskill healthcare professionals, empower consumers, improve care and outcomes, identify key research gaps, and promote vital future research.

### Inositol for polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis to inform the 2023 update of the international evidence-based PCOS guidelines [^114Rx7Uk]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to inform the 2023 update of the International Evidence-based Guideline on the Assessment and Management of PCOS and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD 42022356057). The review informed the guideline recommendation for the question "In adolescents and adults with PCOS, is inositol alone or in combination with other therapies effective for management of hormonal and clinical PCOS features, weight, and reproductive outcomes?" The PROSPERO registration includes the reproductive outcomes of interest; the other outcomes were inadvertently left off the registration. However, all the outcomes including hormonal, clinical, anthropometric, and reproductive were determined a priori by the guideline evidence synthesis team.

Information Sources

We searched the following databases from inception until August 5, 2022: Medline (OVID), PsycInfo (EBSCO), EMBASE (OVID), All EBM (OVID), and CINAHL (EBSCO). A hand-search of reference lists of relevant recent systematic reviews was conducted to identify any trials that were not captured in our search. We asked experts in the field to identify any trials that were not identified in our search.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^116F48UG]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — unique management concerns — Therapy for PCOS is complicated by cosmetic, menstrual control, and metabolic goals. The combined oral contraceptive (COC) is the standard medication to control menses, reduce endometrial and ovarian cancer risk, and reduce hirsutism, and the more estrogenic oral contraceptives are effective for hirsutism control. Spironolactone may be used concomitantly to reduce 5-alpha reductase–mediated dihydrotestosterone, and the major risk associated with COC use is thrombotic.

Pharmacology treatment principles in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — Shared decision making between the patient (and parent/s or guardian/s, if the patient is a child) and the healthcare professional is required. An individual's characteristics, preferences and values must be elicited and considered when recommending any intervention alone or in combination. Understanding how individual adults and adolescents value treatment outcomes is essential when prescribing medications. Medical therapy is generally not approved for use specifically in PCOS and recommended use is therefore evidence-based, but off-label. Healthcare professionals need to inform adults, adolescents and their parents/s or guardian/s and discuss the evidence, possible concerns and side effects. Regulatory agencies should consider approval of evidence-based medications for use in PCOS.

Adolescent PCOS — management considerations: Generally, combined steroid oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) — either containing or not containing an antiandrogen — may be safely used, but the usual contraindications to administration should be carefully considered, and lipid patterns should be evaluated before and after a few months of treatment. Special attention should be given to body weight because obesity during adolescence may influence ovarian function; psychological and dietary treatment should be used in obese adolescent girls, and in some patients, especially if glucose intolerance is present, metformin may be added. Many patients with milder phenotypes may only need symptomatic treatment of hirsutism, and cardiovascular and metabolic risks are much lower in patients with mild PCOS phenotypes.

### A review of therapeutic options for managing the metabolic aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome [^112U3AEh]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. Metabolic sequelae associated with PCOS range from insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Insulin resistance plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of PCOS and it is a reliable marker for cardiometabolic risk. Although insulin sensitising agents such as metformin have been traditionally used for managing metabolic aspects of PCOS, their efficacy is low in terms of weight reduction and cardiovascular risk reduction compared with newer agents such as incretin mimetics and SGLT2 inhibitors. With current pharmaceutical advances, potential therapeutic options have increased, giving patients and clinicians more choices. Incretin mimetics are a promising therapy with a unique metabolic target that could be used widely in the management of PCOS. Likewise, bariatric procedures have become less invasive and result in effective weight loss and the reversal of metabolic morbidities in some patients. Therefore, surgical treatment targeting weight loss becomes increasingly common in the management of obese women with PCOS. Newer emerging therapies, including twincretins, triple GLP-1 agonists, glucagon receptor antagonists and imeglemin, are promising therapeutic options for treating T2DM. Given the similarity of metabolic and pathological features between PCOS and T2DM and the variety of therapeutic options, there is the potential to widen our strategy for treating metabolic disorders in PCOS in parallel with current therapeutic advances. The review was conducted in line with the recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome 2018.

### Best practices of ASRM and ESHRE: a journey through reproductive medicine [^112qQf35]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) — diagnostic definitions and treatment guidance include the following: "Of the three definitions of PCOS, the one suggested by NIH, as well as the definition put forward by the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society, includes the presence of hyperandrogenism as a required criterion", whereas "the Rotterdam definition… allows for several possible phenotypes, being defined by two of three of the following criteria: menstrual irregularity, polycystic ovaries on ultrasound and hyperandrogenism. Thus, it is possible for PCOS to be diagnosed in the absence of documented hyperandrogenism". For management, "prior to initiation of any intervention, emphasis should be given to the importance of lifestyle management, especially weight reduction", and "the recommended first-line treatment for ovulation induction remains the anti-estrogen clomifene citrate (CC)". "The use of aromatase inhibitors for ovulation induction seems to be as effective as CC, but insufficient evidence is currently available on its efficacy and safety", while "Metformin alone is less effective than CC", and adding metformin to CC "should be restricted to women with glucose intolerance"; accordingly, "the routine use of this drug in ovulation induction is not recommended". If ovulation fails or no pregnancy occurs, "the proposed second-line intervention includes either exogenous gonadotropins or laparoscopic ovarian surgery (LOS)", with exogenous gonadotropins "associated with increased chances for multiple pregnancies" requiring "careful monitoring of ovarian response".

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^115gjgoa]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) lifestyle and weight management — In those with higher weight, weight management can be associated with significant clinical improvements and key points need to be considered including a lifelong focus on prevention of further weight gain, a tailored energy deficit when weight loss is the goal, the value of improvement in central adiposity or metabolic health, and the need for ongoing assessment and support. Healthcare professionals should be aware of weight stigma when discussing lifestyle management with women with PCOS. Healthy lifestyle and optimal weight management, in the context of structured, intensive, and ongoing clinical support, appears equally effective in PCOS as in the general population. In those who are not overweight, in the adolescent and at key life points, the focus should be on healthy lifestyle and the prevention of excess weight gain. Although insulin resistance is a pathophysiological factor in PCOS, clinically available insulin assays are of limited clinical relevance and should not be used in routine care.

### The effects of old, new and emerging medicines on metabolic aberrations in PCOS [^116Q1Nwk]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age that is associated with significant adverse short- and long-term health consequences. Multiple metabolic aberrations, such as insulin resistance (IR) and hyperinsulinaemia, high incidence of impaired glucose tolerance, visceral obesity, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, hypertension and dyslipidemia are associated with the syndrome. Assessing the metabolic aberrations and their long term health impact in women with PCOS is challenging and becomes more important as therapeutic interventions currently available for the management of PCOS are not fully able to deal with all these consequences. Current therapeutic management of PCOS has incorporated new treatments resulting from the better understanding of the pathophysiology of the syndrome. The aim of this review is to summarize the effect of old, new and emerging therapies used in the management of PCOS, on the metabolic aberrations of PCOS.

Discussion

The International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS and the related translation program aims to provide a high quality, reliable source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide consistent clinical practice and to empower women with evidence-based information. All recommendations were formulated after an assessment of the best available evidence, multidisciplinary clinical expertise, consumer preferences and structured review by five GDGs. The guideline provides 77 evidence-based and 54 consensus recommendations, with 123 practice points underpinned by a technical report on evidence synthesis and GRADE detailed considerations (∼6000 pages). The evidence has generally improved over the past five years but remains of low to moderate quality, requiring significant research investment into this neglected, yet common condition.

Key recommendations and updates include that PCOS should be diagnosed using the 2018 International Evidence-based Guideline criteria, which built on the consensus based 2003 Rotterdam criteria. This requires the presence of two of the following: i) clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism; ii) ovulatory dysfunction; and iii) polycystic ovaries on ultrasound; and here in 2023, alternatively anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) can now be used instead of ultrasound. Exclusion of other aetiologies. Importantly, where irregular menstrual cycles and hyperandrogenism are present, diagnosis is simplified and ultrasound or AMH are not required for diagnosis. In adolescents, both hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction are required, with ultrasound and AMH not recommended due to poor specificity. AMH was highlighted as a rapidly evolving area in 2018 and evidence is now strong enough to make this new recommendation. This will significantly change practice and offers women a low cost, convenient option, without evidence of overdiagnosis.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex syndrome that affects menstrual regularity, causes hyperandrogenism, increases the risk of metabolic dysfunction and infertility, and is associated with higher rates of mental health disorders. The symptoms of PCOS are unique to each individual and will evolve throughout their reproductive lifespan and beyond. Thus, care should be personalized and provided by an appropriate team of multidisciplinary physicians and clinicians, such as dieticians and psychologists.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) preconception risk factors and counselling include that women with PCOS should be counselled on the adverse impact of excess weight on clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, and live birth rates, following infertility treatment. Consistent with routine preconception care, in women with PCOS planning pregnancy, weight, blood pressure, smoking, alcohol, diet and nutritional status, folate supplementation (higher dose in those with BMI > 30 kg/m²), exercise, sleep and mental, emotional and sexual health should be considered and optimized to improve reproductive and pregnancy outcomes and overall health. A reproductive life plan and age-appropriate education on optimizing reproductive health is recommended in adolescents and women with PCOS, including healthy lifestyle, prevention of excess weight gain, and optimizing preconception risk factors. Healthcare professionals are encouraged to seek permission and, if given, to assess weight and BMI and initiate a dialogue on the importance of weight and lifestyle on women's health before pregnancy. Chronic conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, anxiety, depression and other mental health conditions, should be optimally managed and women should be counselled regarding the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) infertility — general principles include that all fertility treatment in PCOS should be guided by the fertility treatment algorithm (Algorithm 2). Those with PCOS should be reassured that pregnancy can often be successfully achieved either naturally or with assistance. Prenatal vitamins supplementation should be commenced with ovulation induction therapy aligned to routine preconception care. Pregnancy should be excluded prior to ovulation induction therapy. The use of ovulation induction agents, including letrozole, metformin and clomiphene citrate, is off-label in many countries, and where off-label use of ovulation induction agents is allowed, healthcare professionals need to inform women and discuss the evidence, possible concerns, and side effects. There should be ongoing monitoring of patients for adverse effects, and infants for congenital anomalies, in all studies conducted with ovulation induction agents and these should be reported in any published papers.

### Treatment of obesity in polycystic ovary syndrome: a position statement of the Androgen Excess and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Society [^113b8a35]. Fertility and Sterility (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To summarize current evidence on lifestyle management (dietary, exercise, or behavioral interventions) of obesity in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), to indicate gaps in knowledge, and to review the medical and surgical alternatives for weight management.

Design

Expert panel appointed by the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society (AEPCOS Society) to review the literature and draft the initial report after a consensus process via electronic communication. The initial report was reviewed and critiqued by all expert panel members and the AEPCOS Society Board of Directors and modified based on their comments.

Conclusion(S)

Lifestyle management should be used as the primary therapy in overweight and obese women with PCOS for the treatment of metabolic complications. For reproductive abnormalities, lifestyle modification may improve ovulatory function and pregnancy. Data are preliminary for improvement in pregnancy and live-birth rates, and further research is needed. There is currently no evidence that modifying dietary macronutrient composition offers additional benefits over conventional dietary approaches for weight loss, and further research is needed. Emerging evidence suggests that exercise offers additional benefits to dietary energy restriction for reproductive features of PCOS.

While the current PCOS guideline is comprehensive, considering all available evidence at the time of development and providing best-practice recommendations for necessary screening, risk assessment and management, it could not possibly cover all aspects of PCOS care. An International Delphi process was used to prioritise clinical questions, with consensus reached through extensive consultation with both consumers and multidisciplinary clinicians with expertise in PCOS care. Therapies, such as traditional, complementary and integrative medicine (TCIM), supplement use, sleep and meditation interventions are either briefly considered or not at all included in the 2018 PCOS guideline. Many of these therapies are novel and there is a paucity of evidence to support intervention efficacy on PCOS outcomes. However, as patient interest in these types of non-pharmacological interventions are growing, it is prudent to provide more guidance to healthcare providers in this area on their potential efficacy in PCOS. Whole person or holistic care recognises that the doctor-patient relationship should be one of open dialogue, where healthcare providers involve the patient in negotiating their care and recognises patient's autonomy to guide treatment (Figure 1).

'Importance of therapeutic relationship' emphasises patient autonomy and responsibility. 'Acknowledges humanity of the doctor' considers the doctors' ability to self-reflect on how they engage in the care of the patient. 'Health as more than absence of disease' incorporates the mental, emotional, physical, environmental and social needs of the patient. 'Employs a range of treatment modalities' promotes continuity of care across health disciplines, and while it may include traditional, complementary and integrative medicine (TCIM), TCIM is not holistic if used in isolation and without adequate integration into conventional healthcare

Discussion

Summary of Main Findings

We captured a high number of evidence-based CPGs produced over the last decade covering varied disease domains with a consistently increasing number of recommendations. Guideline quality was varied with poor stakeholders involvement and a substantial lack of clear implementation pathways.

Reassuringly, most of the included CPGs recommended the use of homogenous PCOS diagnostic criteria. Still, there were variations in the recommended diagnostic reference ranges for biochemical hyperandrogenism and on the diagnostic value of anti-Müllerian hormone in adolescents with PCOS.

Most CPGs recommended routine screening for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in affected women; however, the recommended frequency of screening, measurement tools, and associated risk factors varied substantially (Table 3). Mental health was particularly underrepresented in most of the included CPGs with much uncertainty on the most effective screening and treatment pathways for women with PCOS.

Most of the included CPGs emphasized the importance of LST as the first-line treatment strategy for PCOS, although details on specific dietary regimes were lacking. Similarly, the role of anti-obesity medications and insulin sensitizers was varied across included CPGs. Few CPGs recommended particular treatments for hyperandrogenism that could be linked to the limitations of available evidence on this domain. Lastly, with a growing body of evidence on fertility treatments for women with PCOS, there were clearer recommendations on the treatment pathways for anovulation and subfertility. Variations existed on the role of letrozole as the primary ovulation induction agent; however, this is unsurprising giving the evolution of evidence on its effectiveness and safety over the last decade. There was limited guidance about the optimal ovarian stimulation protocols and adjuvant treatments to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in women with PCOS.

Metformin — adults and adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): Metformin alone should be considered in adults with PCOS and a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² for anthropometric and metabolic outcomes including insulin resistance, glucose, and lipid profiles; metformin alone could be considered in adolescents at risk of or with PCOS for cycle regulation, acknowledging limited evidence; and metformin alone may be considered in adults with PCOS and BMI < 25 kg/m², acknowledging limited evidence. Where metformin is prescribed the following need to be considered: shared decision making needs to consider feasibility and effectiveness of active lifestyle intervention and women should be informed that metformin and active lifestyle intervention have similar efficacy; mild adverse effects, including gastrointestinal side-effects are generally dose dependent and self-limiting; starting at a low dose, with 500mg increments 1–2 weekly and extended-release preparations may minimize side effects and improve adherence; suggested maximum daily dose is 2.5 g in adults and 2g in adolescents; use appears safe long-term, based on use in other populations, however indications for ongoing requirement needs to be considered; and use may be associated with low vitamin B12 levels, where monitoring should be considered.

Infertility management pathway for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) follows a stepwise medical approach beginning with diagnosis/baseline investigations and lifestyle optimization, then first-, second-, and third-line treatments. Baseline investigations include an endocrine profile, pelvic ultrasound, BMI/BP/glycemic assessment, routine preconception checks, and consideration of semen analysis and tubal patency assessment. Healthy lifestyle "should be recommended in all those with PCOS". First line medical treatment is letrozole with dose escalation, with off-label status noted and clinicians advised to inform women of evidence, concerns, and side effects; metformin and gonadotrophins have differing efficacy, cost, and multiple pregnancy profiles, and either may be an alternative first-line choice for informed women. If further treatment is required, second line is gonadotrophins with US monitoring or consideration of laparoscopic ovarian surgery. If needed, third line is in vitro fertilization with PCOS-specific protocols to minimize ovarian hyperstimulation risk and consideration of in vitro maturation; the pathway also includes repeated cycles with shared decision-making considering age and resources then to IVF.

### Vitamin D in the aetiology and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^115vcT3q]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is common in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), with the 67–85% of women with PCOS having serum concentrations of 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) < 20 ng/ml. Vitamin D deficiency may exacerbate symptoms of PCOS, with observational studies showing lower 25OHD levels were associated with insulin resistance, ovulatory and menstrual irregularities, lower pregnancy success, hirsutism, hyperandrogenism, obesity and elevated cardiovascular disease risk factors. There is some, but limited, evidence for beneficial effects of vitamin D supplementation on menstrual dysfunction and insulin resistance in women with PCOS. Vitamin D deficiency may play a role in exacerbating PCOS, and there may be a place for vitamin D supplementation in the management of this syndrome, but current evidence is limited and additional randomized controlled trials are required to confirm the potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation in this population.

### Alternatives to metformin for patients with PCOS… [^115PZGtT]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the best insulin-sensitizing medication for patients with polycystic ovary syndrome who cannot tolerate metformin. Evidence-Based Answer Compared with placebo, thiazolidinediones decrease systolic blood pressure and fasting blood glucose and insulin levels while improving menstrual irregularities in women with PCOS. Metformin and TZDs have similar effects on pregnancy rates, ovulation, and menstrual frequency, but TZDs can cause weight gain and lower free testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone levels to a greater degree, whereas metformin reduces body mass index and serum triglyceride levels to a greater degree.

A 2012 systematic review of 44 RCTs evaluated metabolic and reproductive outcomes for insulin-sensitizing drugs, including metformin, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, and D-chiro-inositol in women with oligomenorrhea, subfertility, and PCOS. 1 Only six of the 44 studies involved agents other than metformin; two studies used rosiglitazone, two used pioglitazone, and two used D-chiro-inositol. Menstrual cycle regularity improved with rosiglitazone and pioglitazone compared with placebo.

A 2012 meta-analysis of eight RCTs analyzed the effectiveness of TZDs in the treatment of PCOS compared with placebo.

Methods

Search strategy

A comprehensive literature search was carried out to identify all potentially relevant articles using the PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science database from their inception to December 2022. All search methods were based on a systematic approach in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). And after "snowball search", all relevant literatures were included.

Searches for terms ("Selenium"[Mesh] OR "Selenium"[Text Word] OR "Selenium-80" OR "Selenium 80") AND ("Polycystic Ovary Syndrome"[Mesh] OR "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome"[Text Word] OR (Ovary Syndrome, Polycystic) OR (Syndrome, Polycystic Ovary) OR "Stein-Leventhal Syndrome" OR "Stein Leventhal Syndrome" OR (Syndrome, Stein-Leventhal) OR "Sclerocystic Ovarian Degeneration" OR (Ovarian Degeneration, Sclerocystic) OR "Sclerocystic Ovary Syndrome" OR "Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome" OR (Ovarian Syndrome, Polycystic) OR "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome 1" OR "Sclerocystic Ovaries" OR (Ovary, Sclerocystic) OR "Sclerocystic Ovary") were performed. The GRADE approach was followed and uncertainty assessment per-formed for studies included in meta-analysis.

Selection criteria

Two reviewers performed the literature search, evaluated potentially eligible studies for inclusion, and extracted the data independently. When required, disagreements were resolved by consultation with a third reviewer. Authors of the original studies were contacted for additional data, if necessary.

The main selection criteria are as follows:
Randomized controlled clinical trials, case–control studies. Patients took selenium or selenium combined with probiotics in the selenium group. Patients took placebo in the control group.
Study population: patients with PCOS and obesity. PCOS was diagnosed on the basis of the revised Rotterdam 2003 criteria. The presence of 2 out of 3 criteria (oligo or/and anovulation, clinical or/and biochemical signs of hyperandro-genism, and polycystic ovary) was recommended as diagnostic of PCOS.
Aged 20–40 years
Studies that reporting weighted mean difference (WMD) or Standard mean difference (SMD) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) or providing other ways to calculate or obtain these values.

Method of Development of Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines

The Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society deemed the diagnosis and treatment of PCOS a priority area in need of practice guidelines and appointed a Task Force to formulate evidence-based recommendations. The Task Force followed the approach recommended by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) group, an international group with expertise in development and implementation of evidence-based guidelines. A detailed description of the grading scheme has been published elsewhere. The Task Force used the best available research evidence to develop the recommendations. The Task Force also used consistent language and graphical descriptions of both the strength of a recommendation and the quality of evidence. In terms of the strength of the recommendation, strong recommendations use the phrase "we recommend" and the number 1, and weak recommendations use the phrase "we suggest" and the number 2. Cross-filled circles indicate the quality of the evidence, such that ⊕○○○ denotes very low quality evidence; ⊕⊕○○, low quality; ⊕⊕⊕○, moderate quality; and ⊕⊕⊕⊕, high quality. The Task Force has confidence that persons who receive care according to the strong recommendations will derive, on average, more good than harm. Weak recommendations require more careful consideration of the person's circumstances, values, and preferences to determine the best course of action. Linked to each recommendation is a description of the evidence and the values that panelists considered in making the recommendation; in some instances, there are remarks, a section in which panelists offer technical suggestions for testing conditions, dosing, and monitoring. These technical comments reflect the best available evidence applied to a typical person being treated. Often this evidence comes from the unsystematic observations of the panelists and their values and preferences; therefore, these remarks are considered.

### Inositol for polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis to inform the 2023 update of the international evidence-based PCOS guidelines [^112GM5Ta]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Metformin was more efficacious than MI for clinically important outcomes such as central adiposity (WHR) and hirsutism (Ferriman-Gallwey score). Although moderate certainty evidence also suggests that metformin results in a substantially greater number of GI AEs than MI, we note that these adverse events are generally mild and self-limiting and that a sensitivity analysis on studies judged to be at low risk of bias did not detect a difference between groups for GI AEs. Metformin is recommended in the PCOS guidelines for management of anthropometric and metabolic outcomes in women with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² and should be used as a first-line treatment. However, it may be reasonable to consider the use of MI as an alternative to metformin in women who cannot tolerate metformin and who require management of anthropometric and metabolic outcomes. It is unclear whether there is any benefit from using a combination of metformin and MI.

Data on the prevalence of use of complementary therapies in PCOS has not been updated for almost 10 years. A 2014 survey of Australian women reported that 70% of respondents used complementary medicines, which were mostly nutritional and herbal supplements. In the general population, individuals choose complementary medicines for a number of reasons including feeling unsatisfied with conventional therapy results, alignment with the ideology of holistic health, and for preventive health and well-being, an increased sense of control over one's health, and a perception of safety. Similarly, women with PCOS use complementary therapies because they wish to concurrently manage comorbidities such as sleep problems and to improve general well-being.

Nevertheless, 70% of women with PCOS cited disadvantages of using complementary medicine such as financial cost and lack of supporting scientific evidence. It is important for clinicians to be provided with evidence-based guidance and to understand the motivations for use of complementary therapies and the potential risks, including financial cost, when engaging with patients in informed discussions about use of inositol for PCOS. While complementary medicines are often perceived to be safer than pharmaceuticals, it is important to note that regulation of nutrient supplements varies globally. Most nutritional supplements are not regulated by the European Medicines Agency or US Food and Drug Administration. Studies showing safety and efficacy are generally lacking. In addition, manufacturing standards may vary resulting in inconsistent quality. The cost of inositol is also greater than the cost of metformin. Clinicians should incorporate these considerations together with scientific evidence and individual patient values and preferences when engaging in shared decision-making with their patients about the benefits and risks of using inositol for managing PCOS.

### Nutritional management in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a review study [^115EXVUd]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age, which leads to reproductive, hormonal and metabolic abnormalities. Due to the presence of insulin resistance, PCOS increases the risk of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes, hypertension, lipid disorders, cardiovascular diseases and malignancies such as breast and endometrial cancer. The actual cause of this syndrome is unknown but environmental factors such as dietary habits play an important role in prevention and treatment and lifestyle modifications are the most important therapeutic strategies in these patients. The approach of the diet therapy in these patients must be to reach specific goals such as improving insulin resistance, metabolic and reproductive functions that will be possible through the design of low-calorie diet to achieve weight loss or maintaining a healthy weight, limit the intake of simple sugars and refined carbohydrates and intake foods with a low glycemic index, reduction of saturated and trans fatty acids and attention to possible deficiencies such as vitamin D, chromium and omega-3. Given the prevalence of overweight and obesity and insulin resistance, a relatively low reduction in weight, about 5%, can improve problems such as insulin resistance, high levels of androgens, reproductive system dysfunctions and fertility in these women.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^115WW1tR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Processes aligned with all elements of the AGREE-II tool for quality guideline assessment, with extensive evidence synthesis and meta-analysis. Integrity assessment was integrated into guideline evidence synthesis processes and followed the Research Integrity in Guideline Development (RIGID) framework, with studies assessed against criteria from the Research Integrity Assessment (RIA) tool and the Trustworthiness in RAndomised Controlled Trials (TRACT) checklist. Evidence synthesis methods are outlined in the full guideline and followed best practice Guideline recommendations are presented by category, terms used, evidence quality and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework considerations. Category includes evidence-based (sufficient evidence in PCOS) or consensus (insufficient evidence in PCOS, also evidence in general or relevant populations was considered) recommendations and accompanying practice points (implementation considerations) (Table 1).

Table 1.
Categories of PCOS guideline recommendations

The terms include "should", "could" and "should not", which are informed by the nature of the recommendation (evidence or consensus), the GRADE framework and the evidence quality and are independent descriptors reflecting GDG judgement. They refer to overall interpretation and practical application of the recommendation, balancing benefits and harms. "Should" is used where benefits of the recommendation exceed harms and where the recommendation can be trusted to guide practice. Conditional recommendations are reflected using the terms "could" or "should/could consider" which are used where evidence quality was limited or available studies demonstrate little clear advantage of one approach over another, or the balance of benefits to harms was unclear. "Should not" applies when there is a lack of appropriate evidence, or harms may outweigh benefits.

### Treatment considerations for the cardiometabolic signs of polycystic ovary syndrome: a review of the literature since the 2013 endocrine society clinical practice guidelines [^111jctzM]. JAMA Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Polycystic ovary syndrome is characterized by an excess in androgen levels, ovarian dysfunction, and polycystic ovarian morphology but is also associated with metabolic dysfunction and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. To our knowledge, there are few therapeutic recommendations for these cardiometabolic risk factors and little evidence of their long-term clinical relevance to cardiovascular health.

Objective

To determine metabolic and/or cardiovascular outcomes in polycystic ovary syndrome treatment literature since the publication of the most recent Endocrine Society clinical practice guidelines in 2013.

Evidence Review

We searched PubMed using a string of variations of polycystic ovary syndrome, therapy/treatment, and adolescence, and we included English-language original research articles published while the 2013 clinical practice guidelines were disseminated (ie, articles published from January 1, 2011, to June 1, 2015). Articles that appeared relevant based on a review of titles and abstracts were read in full to determine relevancy. References from relevant articles were reviewed for additional studies.

Findings

Four topic areas emerged: (1) lifestyle modification, (2) metformin vs placebo or estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives, (3) insulin-sensitizing agents, and (4) estrogen-progestin formulations. Most studies assessed the role of metformin as a monotherapy or dual therapy supplement and found significant benefit when including metformin in polycystic ovary syndrome treatment regimens. Studies showed improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors and, in several, androgen excess and cutaneous and menstrual symptoms. Studies were limited by sample size (range,22–171), few adolescent participants, and short-term outcomes.

Conclusions and Relevance

Findings show potential for metformin and estrogen-progestin dual therapy but warrant longitudinal studies examining outcomes from adolescence through middle age to determine the effect on long-term cardiovascular health.

Summary

Study Question:

What is the recommended assessment and management of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference?

Summary Answer:

International evidence-based guidelines including 166 recommendations and practice points, addressed prioritized questions to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes of women with PCOS.

What is Known Already:

Previous guidelines either lacked rigorous evidence-based processes, did not engage consumer and international multidisciplinary perspectives, or were outdated. Diagnosis of PCOS remains controversial and assessment and management are inconsistent. The needs of women with PCOS are not being adequately met and evidence practice gaps persist.

Study Design, Size, Duration:

International evidence-based guideline development engaged professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II-compliant processes were followed, with extensive evidence synthesis. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength.

Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods:

Governance included a six continent international advisory and a project board, five guideline development groups (GDGs), and consumer and translation committees. Extensive health professional and consumer engagement informed guideline scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included pediatrics, endocrinology, gynecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, and translation experts. Thirty-seven societies and organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty face-to-face meetings over 15 months addressed 60 prioritized clinical questions involving 40 systematic and 20 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus voting within the five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, with final recommendations approved across all panels.

Main Results and the Role of Chance:

The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS is generally of low to moderate quality. The guideline provides 31 evidence based recommendations, 59 clinical consensus recommendations and 76 clinical practice points all related to assessment and management of PCOS. Key changes in this guideline include: (a) considerable refinement of individual diagnostic criteria with a focus on improving accuracy of diagnosis; (b) reducing unnecessary testing; (c) increasing focus on education, lifestyle modification, emotional wellbeing and quality of life; and (d) emphasizing evidence based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management.

Limitations, Reasons for Caution:

Overall evidence is generally low to moderate quality, requiring significantly greater research in this neglected, yet common condition, especially around refining specific diagnostic features in PCOS. Regional health system variation is acknowledged and a process for guideline and translation resource adaptation is provided.

Wider Implications of the Findings:

The international guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS provides clinicians with clear advice on best practice based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation program supports the guideline with an integrated evaluation program.

### Recent advances in individualized clinical strategies for polycystic ovary syndrome: evidence from clinical trials and emerging pharmacotherapies [^1135EpuD]. Clinical Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Clinical trials are advancing the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), an endocrine disorder affecting 8–13% of women. Lifestyle interventions, including nutritional plans, physical activity, and stress management, can improve reproductive hormones and metabolic health. Novel pharmacotherapies targeting hormonal, metabolic, and reproductive abnormalities are being explored for individualized treatment. Combination therapies and lifestyle interventions like acupuncture, high-intensity interval training, and vitamin D3 supplementation are also being explored.

Methods

We conducted a narrative review by searching English-language studies across electronic databases such as PubMed, Science direct, and Google Scholar for articles related to the topics of PCOS and novel drug therapies such as metformin, LIK-066, elagolix, saxenda, exenatide, clomiphene, letrozole, and other diagnostic interventions. Our review excluded preclinical studies and articles not in english.

Findings

In addition to pharmacological treatments, lifestyle interventions such as Tung's acupuncture, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), and vitamin D3 supplementation have proven effective in managing symptoms of PCOS and enhancing overall health outcomes. These interventions offer a complementary approach to traditional medical therapies, emphasizing the importance of integrating lifestyle modifications into the treatment plan for women with PCOS.

Implications

This comprehensive approach underscores the importance of tailored treatments in optimizing clinical outcomes and quality of life for women with PCOS. The aim of this review is to highlight recent advancements in the treatment of PCOS through clinical trials and emerging pharmacotherapies, emphasizing the need for individualized and multifaceted treatment approaches.

### Efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112c5kMa]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Anti-androgens and combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs) may mitigate hyperandrogenism-related symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, their efficacy and safety in PCOS remain unclear as previous reviews have focused on non-PCOS populations. To inform the 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline in PCOS, we conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of hormonal and clinical features of PCOS.

Methods

We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, All EBM reviews, and CINAHL up to 28th June 2023 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining oral anti-androgen use, alone or in combination with metformin, COCPs, lifestyle, or other interventions, in women of any age, with PCOS diagnosed by Rotterdam, National Institutes of Health or Androgen Excess & PCOS Society criteria, and using a form of contraception. Non-English studies and studies of less than 6 months duration or which used the same anti-androgen regimen in both/all groups were excluded in order to establish efficacy for the clinical outcomes of interest. Three authors screened articles against selection criteria and assessed risk of bias and quality using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) framework. Critical outcomes (prioritised during guideline development for GRADE purposes) included weight, body mass index (BMI), irregular cycles, hirsutism, liver function, and quality of life. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted where appropriate. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42022345640.

Findings

From 1660 studies identified in the search, 27 articles comprising 20 unique studies were included. Of these, 13 studies (n = 961) were pooled in meta-analysis. Seven studies had a high risk of bias, nine moderate and four low. Anti-androgens included finasteride, flutamide, spironolactone, or bicalutamide. In meta-analysis, anti-androgens + lifestyle were superior to metformin + lifestyle for hirsutism (weighted mean difference [WMD] [95% CI]: -1.59 [-3.06, -0.12], p = 0.03; I² = 74%), SHBG (7.70 nmol/l [0.75, 14.66], p = 0.03; I² = 0%), fasting insulin and fasting insulin: glucose ratio (-2.11 μU/ml [-3.97, -0.26], p = 0.03; I² = 0% and -1.12 [-1.44, -0.79], p < 0.0001, I² = 0%, respectively), but were not superior to placebo + lifestyle for hirsutism (-0.93, [-3.37, 1.51], p = 0.45; I² = 76%) or SHBG (9.72 nmol/l [-0.71, 20.14], p = 0.07; I² = 31%). Daily use was more effective for hirsutism than use every three days (-3.48 [-4.58, -2.39], p < 0.0001, I² = 1%), and resulted in lower androstenedione levels (-0.30 ng/ml [-0.50, -0.10], p = 0.004; I² = 0%). Combination treatment with anti-androgens + metformin + lifestyle resulted in lower testosterone compared with metformin + lifestyle (-0.29 nmol/l [-0.52, -0.06], p = 0.01; I² = 61%), but there were no differences in hirsutism when anti-androgens + metformin + lifestyle were compared with either anti-androgens + lifestyle or metformin + lifestyle. In limited meta-analyses (n = 2 trials), combining anti-androgens with COCP resulted in poorer lipid profiles compared with COCP ± placebo, with no differences in other outcomes.

Interpretation

Current evidence does not support the use of anti-androgens preferentially to COCPs to treat hyperandrogenism in PCOS. Anti-androgens could be considered to treat hirsutism in PCOS, where COCPs are contraindicated, poorly tolerated, or present a sub-optimal response after a minimum 6-month period, with consideration of clinical context and individual risk factors and characteristics.

### PCOS [^114Wdj7Z]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is diagnosed in up to 10% of women attending gynaecology clinics, but the prevalence in the population as a whole is unclear. PCOS has been associated with hirsutism, infertility, acne, weight gain, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and endometrial hyperplasia.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 24 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: finasteride, flutamide, metformin, spironolactone, cyproterone acetate-ethinylestradiol (co-cyprindiol), interventions to achieve weight loss, ketoconazole, and mechanical hair removal.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^113sngUN]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) dietary intervention — Healthcare professionals and women should consider that there is no evidence to support any one type of diet composition over another for anthropometric, metabolic, hormonal, reproductive or psychological outcomes. Any diet composition consistent with population guidelines for healthy eating will have health benefits and, within this, healthcare professionals should advise sustainable healthy eating tailored to individual preferences and goals. Tailoring of dietary changes to food preferences, allowing for a flexible, individual and co-developed approach to achieving nutritional goals, and avoiding unduly restrictive and nutritionally unbalanced diets, are important, as per general population guidelines. Barriers and facilitators to optimize engagement and adherence to dietary change should be discussed, including psychological factors, physical limitations, socioeconomic and sociocultural factors, as well as personal motivators for change. The value of broader family engagement should be considered. Referral to suitably trained allied healthcare professionals needs to be considered when women with PCOS need support with optimizing their diet.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117MaXiA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Objective:

The aim was to formulate practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Participants:

An Endocrine Society-appointed Task Force of experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer developed the guideline.

Evidence:

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process:

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Committees and members of The Endocrine Society and the European Society of Endocrinology reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of these guidelines. Two systematic reviews were conducted to summarize supporting evidence.

Conclusions:

We suggest using the Rotterdam criteria for diagnosing PCOS (presence of two of the following criteria: androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, or polycystic ovaries). Establishing a diagnosis of PCOS is problematic in adolescents and menopausal women. Hyperandrogenism is central to the presentation in adolescents, whereas there is no consistent phenotype in postmenopausal women. Evaluation of women with PCOS should exclude alternate androgen-excess disorders and risk factors for endometrial cancer, mood disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Hormonal contraceptives are the first-line management for menstrual abnormalities and hirsutism/acne in PCOS. Clomiphene is currently the first-line therapy for infertility; metformin is beneficial for metabolic/glycemic abnormalities and for improving menstrual irregularities, but it has limited or no benefit in treating hirsutism, acne, or infertility. Hormonal contraceptives and metformin are the treatment options in adolescents with PCOS. The role of weight loss in improving PCOS status per se is uncertain, but lifestyle intervention is beneficial in overweight/obese patients for other health benefits. Thiazolidinediones have an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio overall, and statins require further study.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome… [^111Lzib7]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome is found in 7 percent of women. It is thought to be caused by a disordered feedback loop between the ovary and the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, which leads to derangements in the release of luteinizing hormone in the presence of normal follicle-stimulating hormone. There also appears to be concomitant insulin resistance with compensatory hyperinsulinemia. Obesity probably increases glucose intolerance. Women with PCOS have higher rates of infertility and are at increased risk of pregnancy loss and complications, including gestational diabetes. Diagnostic criteria for PCOS include oligoovulation or anovulation and clinical or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism in the absence of other etiologies. Clinically, hyperandrogenism manifests as acne and hirsutism, although these findings may be absent.

Testosterone levels are not reliable and can be affected by a number of factors. Polycystic ovaries are detected by ultra-sonography and typically involve 10 to 12 small follicles closely spaced bilaterally on the peripheral edge of the ovaries. The differential diagnosis includes congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing's syndrome, hyperprolactinemia, thyroid disease, and tumor. Recommendations: Treatment should be individualized. Weight loss is recommended when indicated to reduce cardiovascular risks and risks associated with diabetes. Women with PCOS have been shown to be successful in losing modest amounts of weight. Metformin in combination with lifestyle changes may be helpful in promoting weight loss in obese patients with PCOS. A glucose tolerance test should be performed regardless of weight. Clomiphene and metformin are useful in inducing ovulation in patients seeking fertility, but evidence does not support their use in combination.

Metformin may be continued into pregnancy and may decrease miscarriage rates. Oral contraceptives can be used to regulate periods and to decrease the risk of endometrial cancer, which is associated with obesity and chronic anovulation. Progestin-only pills can be used in patients with a strong history of thrombophilia.

### Lifestyle changes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^112DZkRb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 4% to 18% of reproductive-aged women and is associated with reproductive, metabolic and psychological dysfunction. Obesity worsens the presentation of PCOS and weight management (weight loss, maintenance or prevention of excess weight gain) is proposed as an initial treatment strategy, best achieved through lifestyle changes incorporating diet, exercise and behavioural interventions.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of lifestyle treatment in improving reproductive, anthropometric (weight and body composition), metabolic and quality of life factors in PCOS.

Search Strategy

Electronic databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, AMED) (date of last search 7/9/2010), controlled trials register, conference abstracts, relevant journals, reference lists of relevant papers and reviews and grey literature databases, with no language restrictions applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing lifestyle treatment (diet, exercise, behavioural or combined treatments) to minimal or no treatment in women with PCOS.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials, assessed methodological quality and risk of bias and extracted data.

Main Results

Six studies were included with n = 164 participants. Three studies compared physical activity to minimal dietary and behavioural advice or no advice. Three studies compared combined dietary, exercise and behavioural interventions to minimal intervention. Risk of bias varied with 4/6 having adequate sequence generation and clinician or outcome assessor blinding and 3/6 having adequate allocation concealment, complete outcome data and being free of selective reporting. There were no studies assessing the fertility primary outcomes of pregnancy, live birth and miscarriage and no data for meta-analysis on ovulation or menstrual regularity. Lifestyle intervention provided benefits when compared to minimal treatment for secondary reproductive, anthropometric and reproductive outcomes. These included endpoint values for total testosterone (mean difference (MD) -0.27 nmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.46 to -0.09, P = 0.004), hirsutism or excess hair growth by the Ferriman-Gallwey score (MD -1.19, 95% CI -2.35 to -0.03, P = 0.04), weight (MD -3.47 kg, 95% CI -4.94 to -2.00, P < 0.00001), waist circumference (MD -1.95 cm, 95% CI -3.34 to -0.57, P = 0.006) and fasting insulin (MD -2.02 µU/mL, 95% CI -3.28 to -0.77, P = 0.002). There was no evidence of effect of lifestyle for body mass index, free androgen index, sex hormone binding globulin, glucose or cholesterol levels; and no data for quality of life, patient satisfaction or acne.

Authors' Conclusions

Lifestyle intervention improves body composition, hyperandrogenism (high male hormones and clinical effects) and insulin resistance in women with PCOS. There was no evidence of effect for lifestyle intervention on improving glucose tolerance or lipid profiles and no literature assessing clinical reproductive outcomes, quality of life and treatment satisfaction.

### Recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^114n5z6q]. Fertility and Sterility (2018). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting reproductive aged women, with a prevalence of between 8% and 13% depending on the population studied and definitions used. PCOS is complex with reproductive, metabolic and psychological features. Clinical practice in the assessment and management of PCOS is inconsistent, with key evidence practice gaps, whilst women internationally have highlighted delayed diagnosis and dissatisfaction with care. Current guidelines either are limited in breadth, do not follow rigorous best practice in development, have not involved consumers, or are outdated, resulting in inconsistent guidance for clinicians and women alike. To address these identified gaps, here we summarize the development process and recommendations from the first international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS, bringing together extensive consumer engagement and international collaboration with leading societies and organizations, multidisciplinary experts, and primary care representatives. In this process, the guideline development groups unanimously supported the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for adult women.

This comprehensive evidence-based guideline builds on prior high quality guidelines and culminates from a rigorous, Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II (AGREEII)-compliant, evidence-based guideline development process. It provides a single source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide clinical practice with the opportunity for adaptation in relevant health systems. Together with an extensive translation program, the aim is to reduce worldwide variation in care and promote high quality service provision to improve health outcomes and quality of life in women with PCOS. The guidelines are supported by a multifaceted international translation program with co-designed resources to enhance the skills of health professionals and empower women with PCOS, with an integrated comprehensive evaluation program.

4.5 Strengths and weaknesses

The strengths of this systematic review include the well‐defined and clinically relevant question regarding COCP treatment in PCOS, with outcomes that have been defined and prioritised by multiple international stakeholders including consumers, clinicians and researchers. These results will directly inform the updated international PCOS guidelines. Limitations include the lack of RCTs precluding meta‐analysis, small participant numbers, as well as the high RoB of the included studies.

### Efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112nwbCN]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

While anti-androgens and their mechanisms of action allude to plausible benefits, the 2018 PCOS guidelinesconcluded that evidence was lacking for the use of all identified anti-androgen medications in PCOS. Existing systematic reviews, including a network meta-analysis, have focused on women with idiopathic hirsutismor broader hirsute populationsand, to our knowledge, no systematic reviews have examined the use of anti-androgens in the management of PCOS. In response to this identified gap, recent published studies have appealed for re-examination of the potential benefits of anti-androgens in PCOS. Therefore, as part of the updated 2023 International Evidence-based Guidelines in PCOS, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of anti-androgens, alone or in combination, on anthropometric, hormonal and clinical features of PCOS.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — inositol for infertility: Inositol in any form alone, or in combination with other therapies, should be considered experimental therapy in women with PCOS with infertility, with benefits and risks currently too uncertain to recommend the use of these agents as fertility therapies. There is limited evidence with uncertain results, on the effect of inositol on ovulation, clinical pregnancy and live birth rates. Side effects and safety are not known for inositol. Women need to be aware that these agents can have limited regulation with variable dose, quality, consistency, and combination with other agents. Women's personal goals and preferences should be considered when discussing complimentary therapies.

### Polycystic ovary syndrome [^114NbQzh]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 5–18% of women, and is a reproductive, metabolic, and psychological condition with impacts across the lifespan. The cause is complex, and includes genetic and epigenetic susceptibility, hypothalamic and ovarian dysfunction, excess androgen exposure, insulin resistance, and adiposity-related mechanisms. Diagnosis is recommended based on the 2003 Rotterdam criteria and confirmed with two of three criteria: hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical), irregular cycles, and polycystic ovary morphology. In adolescents, both the criteria of hyperandrogenism and irregular cycles are needed, and ovarian morphology is not included due to poor specificity. The diagnostic criteria generates four phenotypes, and clinical features are heterogeneous, with manifestations typically arising in childhood and then evolving across adolescent and adult life. Treatment involves a combination of lifestyle alterations and medical management. Lifestyle optimisation includes a healthy balanced diet and regular exercise to prevent excess weight gain, limit PCOS complications and target weight reduction when needed. Medical management options include metformin to improve insulin resistance and metabolic features, combined oral contraceptive pill for menstrual cycle regulation and hyperandrogenism, and if needed, anti-androgens for refractory hyperandrogenism. In this Review, we provide an update on the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and clinical features of PCOS, and discuss the needs and priorities of those with PCOS, including lifestyle, and medical and infertility treatment. Further we discuss the status of international evidence-based guidelines (EBG) and translation, to support patient self management, healthcare provision, and to set research priorities.

Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus voting within the five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, with final recommendations approved across all panels.

Main Results and The Role Of Chance

The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS is generally of low to moderate quality. The guideline provides 31 evidence based recommendations, 59 clinical consensus recommendations and 76 clinical practice points all related to assessment and management of PCOS. Key changes in this guideline include: (a) considerable refinement of individual diagnostic criteria with a focus on improving accuracy of diagnosis; (b) reducing unnecessary testing; (c) increasing focus on education, lifestyle modification, emotional wellbeing and quality of life; and (d) emphasizing evidence based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management.

Limitations, Reasons For Caution

Overall evidence is generally low to moderate quality, requiring significantly greater research in this neglected, yet common condition, especially around refining specific diagnostic features in PCOS. Regional health system variation is acknowledged and a process for guideline and translation resource adaptation is provided.

Wider Implications Of The Findings

The international guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS provides clinicians with clear advice on best practice based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation program supports the guideline with an integrated evaluation program.

### Update on PCOS: consequences, challenges, and guiding treatment [^1111HKxW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common reproductive endocrine disorders in women and despite this, diagnostic challenges, delayed diagnosis, and less-than-optimal treatment regimens plague the condition. The International PCOS network, consisting of geographically diverse international experts in PCOS as well as consumers, engaged in a multi-year international evidence-based guideline development process that was jointly sponsored by the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM). The guideline was published in 2018 and endorsed by more than 40 international societies involved in PCOS. Translation of this evidence-based guideline to medical practice and consumer groups remains a priority. However, there remain many challenges to both understanding the diagnosis and treatment of PCOS. Evidence suggests that both clinicians and consumers are not satisfied with the timeliness of diagnosis and treatment options. This review summarizes the important findings for diagnosis and treatment from the guidelines and expands on recent developments in the literature since its publication. Special attention to diagnosis at the ends of the reproductive spectrum are discussed and remaining areas of controversy are noted. Additionally, the review highlights some of the remaining challenges in the understanding and management of PCOS to help guide clinicians and investigators in this perplexing condition.

### Special considerations for the adolescent with obesity: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement (CPS) 2024 [^113Qfaci]. Obesity Pillars (2024). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in adolescents with obesity — management focuses on insulin resistance reduction, lifestyle change, and selective adjuncts: Treatment of adolescent PCOS in the setting of obesity focuses on both reducing insulin resistance to improve androgen levels and restore menstrual function and fertility, and there is no consensus regarding what treatment to first initiate and then add a second or third line of treatment. The 2018 guidelines for management of PCOS recommend a low-calorie diet to promote weight loss in women with PCOS and obesity, but there are no recommendations on which diet works best; in general, a diet that results in lower caloric intake and weight loss will improve insulin sensitivity and can improve biochemical and clinical parameters of PCOS. Micronutrients and supplements are often suggested, but there is not enough evidence to recommend supplements in the treatment of PCOS, whereas at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity at least 3 days a week have been suggested. Adjunctive weight loss options such as AOMs or MBS are considered to optimize weight loss and improve insulin resistance; GLP-1 agonists have been studied in women with obesity and PCOS and found to reduce body weight and improve hyperandrogenism and ovulatory function, and MBS as a treatment for PCOS has not been studied in adolescents, with adult studies indicating weight loss and improvement in ovarian function, insulin resistance, and menstrual regulation.

In women with PCOS, metformin is usually prescribed at starting doses of 500–850 mg daily and can be titrated up to 2000 mg/day if tolerated. Higher metformin doses have been beneficial in reducing weight and improving lipid profiles, particularly in obese PCOS population. There is also evidence of the development of vitamin B12 deficiency with long-term metformin use. – Therefore, due to metformin intolerance and its associated adverse events, it is important to consider other therapeutic options for the treatment of metformin intolerant women with PCOS.

Study Question

What is the recommended assessment and management of those with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference?

Summary Answer

International evidence-based guidelines address prioritized questions and outcomes and include 254 recommendations and practice points, to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes in PCOS.

What Is Known Already

The 2018 International PCOS Guideline was independently evaluated as high quality and integrated multidisciplinary and consumer perspectives from six continents; it is now used in 196 countries and is widely cited. It was based on best available, but generally very low to low quality, evidence. It applied robust methodological processes and addressed shared priorities. The guideline transitioned from consensus based to evidence-based diagnostic criteria and enhanced accuracy of diagnosis, whilst promoting consistency of care. However, diagnosis is still delayed, the needs of those with PCOS are not being adequately met, evidence quality was low and evidence-practice gaps persist.

Study Design, Size, Duration

The 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline update reengaged the 2018 network across professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Extensive evidence synthesis was completed. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II (AGREEII)-compliant processes were followed. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength and diversity and inclusion were considered throughout.

Participants/ Materials, Setting, Methods

This summary should be read in conjunction with the full Guideline for detailed participants and methods. Governance included a six-continent international advisory and management committee, five guideline development groups, and paediatric, consumer, and translation committees. Extensive consumer engagement and guideline experts informed the update scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included paediatrics, endocrinology, gynaecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, obesity care, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, statisticians and translation experts. Thirty-nine professional and consumer organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty meetings and five face-to-face forums over 12 months addressed 58 prioritized clinical questions involving 52 systematic and 3 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus across five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, independently reviewed for methodological rigour, and approved by the Australian Government National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).

Main Results and The Role Of Chance

The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS has generally improved in the past five years, but remains of low to moderate quality. The technical evidence report and analyses (∼6000 pages) underpins 77 evidence-based and 54 consensus recommendations, with 123 practice points. Key updates include: i) further refinement of individual diagnostic criteria, a simplified diagnostic algorithm and inclusion of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels as an alternative to ultrasound in adults only; ii) strengthening recognition of broader features of PCOS including metabolic risk factors, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, very high prevalence of psychological features, and high risk status for adverse outcomes during pregnancy; iii) emphasizing the poorly recognized, diverse burden of disease and the need for greater healthcare professional education, evidence-based patient information, improved models of care and shared decision making to improve patient experience, alongside greater research; iv) maintained emphasis on healthy lifestyle, emotional wellbeing and quality of life, with awareness and consideration of weight stigma; and v) emphasizing evidence-based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management.

Limitations, Reasons For Caution

Overall, recommendations are strengthened and evidence is improved, but remain generally low to moderate quality. Significantly greater research is now needed in this neglected, yet common condition. Regional health system variation was considered and acknowledged, with a further process for guideline and translation resource adaptation provided.

Wider Implications Of The Findings

The 2023 International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS provides clinicians and patients with clear advice on best practice, based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation programme supports the Guideline with an integrated evaluation program.

### Efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112dxxiT]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Anti-androgens and combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs) may mitigate hyperandrogenism-related symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, their efficacy and safety in PCOS remain unclear as previous reviews have focused on non-PCOS populations. To inform the 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline in PCOS, we conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of hormonal and clinical features of PCOS.

Methods

We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, All EBM reviews, and CINAHL up to 28th June 2023 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining oral anti-androgen use, alone or in combination with metformin, COCPs, lifestyle, or other interventions, in women of any age, with PCOS diagnosed by Rotterdam, National Institutes of Health or Androgen Excess & PCOS Society criteria, and using a form of contraception. Non-English studies and studies of less than 6 months duration or which used the same anti-androgen regimen in both/all groups were excluded in order to establish efficacy for the clinical outcomes of interest. Three authors screened articles against selection criteria and assessed risk of bias and quality using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) framework. Critical outcomes (prioritised during guideline development for GRADE purposes) included weight, body mass index (BMI), irregular cycles, hirsutism, liver function, and quality of life. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted where appropriate. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42022345640.

Findings

From 1660 studies identified in the search, 27 articles comprising 20 unique studies were included. Of these, 13 studies (n = 961) were pooled in meta-analysis. Seven studies had a high risk of bias, nine moderate and four low. Anti-androgens included finasteride, flutamide, spironolactone, or bicalutamide. In meta-analysis, anti-androgens + lifestyle were superior to metformin + lifestyle for hirsutism (weighted mean difference [WMD] [95% CI]: −1.59 [−3.06, −0.12], p = 0.03; I² = 74%), SHBG (7.70 nmol/l [0.75, 14.66], p = 0.03; I² = 0%), fasting insulin and fasting insulin: glucose ratio (−2.11 μU/ml [−3.97, −0.26], p = 0.03; I² = 0% and −1.12 [−1.44, −0.79], p < 0.0001, I² = 0%, respectively), but were not superior to placebo + lifestyle for hirsutism (−0.93, [−3.37, 1.51], p = 0.45; I² = 76%) or SHBG (9.72 nmol/l [−0.71, 20.14], p = 0.07; I² = 31%). Daily use was more effective for hirsutism than use every three days (−3.48 [−4.58, −2.39], p < 0.0001, I² = 1%), and resulted in lower androstenedione levels (−0.30 ng/ml [−0.50, −0.10], p = 0.004; I² = 0%). Combination treatment with anti-androgens + metformin + lifestyle resulted in lower testosterone compared with metformin + lifestyle (−0.29 nmol/l [−0.52, −0.06], p = 0.01; I² = 61%), but there were no differences in hirsutism when anti-androgens + metformin + lifestyle were compared with either anti-androgens + lifestyle or metformin + lifestyle. In limited meta-analyses (n = 2 trials), combining anti-androgens with COCP resulted in poorer lipid profiles compared with COCP ± placebo, with no differences in other outcomes.

Interpretation

Current evidence does not support the use of anti-androgens preferentially to COCPs to treat hyperandrogenism in PCOS. Anti-androgens could be considered to treat hirsutism in PCOS, where COCPs are contraindicated, poorly tolerated, or present a sub-optimal response after a minimum 6-month period, with consideration of clinical context and individual risk factors and characteristics.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114sxcpZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim was to formulate practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Participants

An Endocrine Society-appointed Task Force of experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer developed the guideline.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe both the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications enabled consensus. Committees and members of The Endocrine Society and the European Society of Endocrinology reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of these guidelines. Two systematic reviews were conducted to summarize supporting evidence.

Conclusions

We suggest using the Rotterdam criteria for diagnosing PCOS (presence of two of the following criteria: androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, or polycystic ovaries). Establishing a diagnosis of PCOS is problematic in adolescents and menopausal women. Hyperandrogenism is central to the presentation in adolescents, whereas there is no consistent phenotype in postmenopausal women. Evaluation of women with PCOS should exclude alternate androgen-excess disorders and risk factors for endometrial cancer, mood disorders, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Hormonal contraceptives are the first-line management for menstrual abnormalities and hirsutism/acne in PCOS. Clomiphene is currently the first-line therapy for infertility; metformin is beneficial for metabolic/glycemic abnormalities and for improving menstrual irregularities, but it has limited or no benefit in treating hirsutism, acne, or infertility. Hormonal contraceptives and metformin are the treatment options in adolescents with PCOS. The role of weight loss in improving PCOS status per se is uncertain, but lifestyle intervention is beneficial in overweight/obese patients for other health benefits. Thiazolidinediones have an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio overall, and statins require further study.

### Efficacy of optimal nutraceutical combination in treating PCOS characteristics: an in-silico assessment [^112WUrdg]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a serious health condition affecting women of reproductive age. High prevalence of PCOS and associated metabolic complications needs effective treatment and management. This study evaluated the efficacy of optimal nutraceutical combinations in improving PCOS characteristics using system biology-based mathematical modelling and simulation.

Methods

A shortlisting of eight potent nutraceuticals was carried out with literature search. Menstrual cycle model was used to perform simulations on an in-silico population of 2000 individuals to test individual and combined effects of shortlisted nutraceuticals on five PCOS characteristics [oligomenorrhea, anovulation, hirsutism, infertility, and polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM)] for a duration of 6 months. Efficacy was tested across lean and obese phenotypes and age groups.

Results

Individual assessment of nutraceuticals revealed seven most potent compounds. Myo-inositol among them was observed to be the most effective in alleviating the PCOS characteristics. The in-silico population analysis showed that the combination of melatonin and ALA along with myo-inositol was efficacious in restoring the hormonal balance across age-groups and Body Mass Index (BMI) categories.

Conclusion

Supplementation with the combination of myo-inositol, melatonin, and ALA demonstrated potential in managing PCOS symptoms in our in-silico analysis of a heterogeneous population, including lean and obese phenotypes across various severities and age groups, over a 6-month period. Future clinical studies are recommended to validate these findings.

### Recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^113k9CJ8]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

2 | INTRODUCTION

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy affecting reproductive aged women, with a prevalence of between 8% to 13% depending on the population studied and definitions used. PCOS is complex with reproductive, metabolic and psychological features. Clinical practice in the assessment and management of PCOS is inconsistent, with key evidence practice gaps, whilst women internationally have highlighted delayed diagnosis and dissatisfaction with care. – Current guidelines either are limited in breadth, do not follow rigorous best practice in development, have not involved consumers, or are outdated, – resulting in inconsistent guidance for clinicians and women alike. To address these identified gaps, here we summarize the development process and recommendations from the first international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of PCOS, bringing extensive consumer engagement and international collaboration with leading societies and organizations, multidisciplinary experts, and primary care representatives. In this process, the guideline development groups unanimously supported the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for adult women.

This comprehensive evidence-based guideline builds on prior high quality guidelines and culminates from a rigorous, AGREEII-compliant, evidence-based guideline development process. It provides a single source of international evidence-based recommendations to guide clinical practice with the opportunity for adaptation in relevant health systems. Together with an extensive translation program, the aim is to reduce worldwide variation in care and promote high quality service provision to improve health outcomes and quality of life in women with PCOS. The guidelines are supported by a multifaceted international translation program with co-designed resources to upskill health professionals and empower women with PCOS, with an integrated comprehensive evaluation program.

### Efficacy and safety of anti-androgens in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114hzE9V]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Anti-androgens and COCPs can reduce hirsutism via different mechanisms. The COCP increases SHBG production and decreases luteinising hormone (LH)-induced stimulation of theca cells, leading to reduced circulating free testosterone concentrations. Conversely, anti-androgens promote reductions in clinical hyperandrogenism by competitively inhibiting androgen-binding receptors, likely via inhibiting 5-α-reductase, as well as by other mechanisms which are hitherto not well-understood. Although early research indicated that spironolactone may interfere with androgen synthesis, these data have not been replicated or validated using modern techniques. Therefore, further studies elucidating the mechanisms of action of anti-androgens are warranted.

This is, to our knowledge, the first systematic review and meta-analysis examining the use of anti-androgens specifically in women with PCOS. We conducted a comprehensive search, using international gold-standard methodology for identifying, evaluating, and appraising the literature (including the GRADE tool), in line with the internationally endorsed PCOS guideline methodology. All data extraction and quality assessments were conducted in duplicate and/or cross-checked to limit subjectivity bias and maximise accuracy. We included both adult and adolescent populations, with a wide range of outcomes relevant to PCOS as determined by experts and consumer groups in the guideline development process, thereby providing broad insights into the efficacy of anti-androgens, with or without other interventions, in managing key features of PCOS.
