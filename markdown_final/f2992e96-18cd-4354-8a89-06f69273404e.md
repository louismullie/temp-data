## Question

For pyelonephritis with E coli

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to manage pyelonephritis due to Escherichia coli, preserving the thinking process and self-verification along the way. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and obtaining cultures before antibiotics. Then, I should assess severity and whether the infection is complicated or uncomplicated. Next, I will select empiric therapy based on severity, local resistance, and patient-specific factors, followed by definitive therapy once susceptibilities return. After that, I need to determine duration and when to switch to oral therapy. I will then consider special populations, evaluate response and source control, and finally address antimicrobial stewardship and follow-up testing, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and secure cultures before starting antibiotics, because I need to ensure we are treating true pyelonephritis and preserve the opportunity to tailor therapy. Urinalysis with pyuria and bacteriuria supports the diagnosis, and a urine culture with susceptibilities should be obtained in all suspected cases, ideally prior to antibiotics, with blood cultures reserved for those with sepsis, immunocompromise, or diagnostic uncertainty [^1131pFnX] [^111SjmRZ] [^116DKHYK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should classify whether this is uncomplicated versus complicated pyelonephritis and assess severity, since that drives empiric choices and disposition. Uncomplicated pyelonephritis typically occurs in nonpregnant, immunocompetent women without structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities, whereas complicated disease includes men, pregnant patients, immunocompromised hosts, structural or functional abnormalities, recent instrumentation, or suspected obstruction. Severity should be stratified using Sepsis-3 criteria, with sepsis defined by a SOFA increase of 2 or more or presumptive identification via qSOFA or SIRS, which signals life-threatening organ dysfunction and mandates aggressive parenteral therapy and inpatient care [^1137mL9p] [^117Vq6gK] [^114JeXVq].

> Next, I should review empiric therapy for sepsis or severe illness. Wait, let me verify the preferred agents and avoid overextending to newer agents unnecessarily. For patients with sepsis due to complicated UTI, recommended initial regimens include a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin, a carbapenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, or a fluoroquinolone, selected via a four-step assessment rather than defaulting to novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors or cefiderocol; if broader coverage is needed for suspected Pseudomonas, enterococci, or MRSA, I should add appropriate agents, and I must account for local antibiograms, aiming for ≥ 90% susceptibility in septic shock and ≥ 80% in sepsis without shock [^113pxm2L] [^116uk3Ge].

> For patients without sepsis but with complicated UTI, I need to ensure I balance spectrum with stewardship. Third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones are reasonable empiric options, while reserving carbapenems for high ESBL risk or critical illness. I should avoid agents to which the patient had a resistant organism on prior cultures and avoid fluoroquinolones if there was exposure in the past 12 months, as recent exposure better predicts current resistance [^1136ebsk] [^1158sxbc] [^117VnNgC].

> For uncomplicated pyelonephritis managed as an outpatient, I should double-check local fluoroquinolone resistance before choosing a fluoroquinolone. If resistance exceeds 10%, I should give an initial parenteral dose of ceftriaxone or a consolidated aminoglycoside dose before stepping down to a fluoroquinolone, and I must avoid agents with inadequate renal parenchymal penetration such as nitrofurantoin or fosfomycin for pyelonephritis. TMP-SMX is not appropriate empirically due to high resistance, though it can be used if the isolate is susceptible and the patient cannot take a fluoroquinolone [^116N2vgn] [^111pVC8n] [^117H4oaD].

> Let me consider special populations carefully. In pregnancy, I should admit and treat with parenteral therapy, typically a second- or third-generation cephalosporin, and avoid fluoroquinolones and TMP-SMX. In pediatrics, short-course therapy around 7 days appears noninferior to longer courses in observational data, and IV-to-oral switch strategies with total 7–14 days are acceptable. In older adults or those with structural disease, I should have a lower threshold for imaging and source control if response is suboptimal [^114ct4XY] [^113TcUvx] [^112M3bSK] [^113GGCdL].

> Once cultures return, I need to ensure definitive therapy is narrowed promptly. I should select the narrowest effective agent active against the identified E. coli, discontinue unnecessary broad-spectrum coverage, and avoid agents to which there was prior resistance on paired cultures, recognizing that more recent cultures better predict current resistance than distant ones [^112gtP1T] [^1158sxbc] [^116v63pm].

> Now, duration; hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought many patients still require 10–14 days, but current guidance supports shorter courses when clinically improving. For complicated UTI including pyelonephritis, 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone is recommended if the patient is improving, with therapy counted from the first day of effective treatment. Even with Gram-negative bacteremia, 7 days is sufficient if improving, and uncomplicated pyelonephritis can be treated with a 5–7 day fluoroquinolone course, with TMP-SMX 14 days as an alternative when susceptible [^114Rndbn] [^111669ub] [^117G4Hrr] [^11279yxK].

> I should confirm when to transition to oral therapy. Once the patient is clinically improving, can tolerate oral intake, and has an effective oral option available, switching from IV to oral is preferred, and for bacteremic patients the oral agent must achieve therapeutic levels in blood, urine, and tissue. This IV-to-oral switch reduces line-related complications and length of stay without compromising outcomes [^114ebzwp] [^111L65vJ] [^112BXcnZ].

> Next, I should review response and source control. If there is no prompt clinical improvement within 48–72 hours, I need to check for an ongoing nidus requiring intervention such as obstruction, abscess, or foreign body, repeat cultures, and obtain imaging, typically with renal ultrasound or contrast-enhanced CT depending on the clinical context and patient factors, because delayed source control increases morbidity and mortality [^113XMyaH] [^113GGCdL] [^116CkcWi].

> I need to ensure antimicrobial stewardship principles are embedded throughout. Avoid empiric fluoroquinolones in patients with prior exposure in the past 12 months, avoid agents with prior documented resistance, and de-escalate based on cultures. These steps reduce selection pressure and adverse effects while maintaining efficacy [^117VnNgC] [^1158sxbc] [^112gtP1T].

> Finally, I should double-check follow-up. Routine test-of-cure urine cultures are not needed in asymptomatic patients after therapy, but if symptoms persist or recur, I should repeat cultures and reassess for complications or alternative diagnoses, and in high-risk patients or those with atypical courses, imaging and further evaluation are appropriate [^111SjmRZ] [^113GGCdL].

Pyelonephritis due to E. coli is best managed with **empiric therapy tailored to local resistance** and patient risk factors, then narrowed to culture results [^112gtP1T]. For uncomplicated cases, use **fluoroquinolones (5–7 days) or TMP-SMX (7–14 days)** if susceptible; if local fluoroquinolone resistance exceeds 10%, give a single IV dose of ceftriaxone or an aminoglycoside before oral therapy [^116N2vgn] [^11279yxK]. For complicated cases or sepsis, start IV ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, or a carbapenem, then step down to oral therapy when stable; total duration is 7–14 days, shorter if clinically improving [^114Rndbn] [^117G4Hrr]. Avoid fluoroquinolones if resistance is high or there has been recent exposure, and do not use nitrofurantoin or fosfomycin for pyelonephritis [^117VnNgC] [^111pVC8n]. Obtain urine culture before antibiotics, repeat if no improvement in 48–72 hours, and image if obstruction or abscess is suspected [^1131pFnX] [^113GGCdL].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Clinical presentation**: Fever, chills, flank pain, dysuria, frequency, urgency, and systemic symptoms [^111SjmRZ].

- **Laboratory tests**: Urinalysis (pyuria, bacteriuria), urine culture with susceptibility testing, and CBC. Blood cultures are indicated for severe illness or suspected bacteremia [^1131pFnX] [^114xDhpU].

- **Imaging**: Not routine; use renal ultrasound or CT if no improvement in 48–72 hours, obstruction is suspected, or in complicated cases [^113GGCdL].

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric therapy should be guided by **local resistance patterns**, patient-specific factors, and illness severity [^116uk3Ge] [^111xwYMR] [^117Vq6gK].

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| Uncomplicated pyelonephritis | - Fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO BID or levofloxacin 750 mg PO daily) for 5–7 days [^11279yxK] [^11642ttZ] <br/> - If local fluoroquinolone resistance > 10%, give a single IV dose of ceftriaxone or an aminoglycoside before oral therapy [^116N2vgn] |
| Complicated pyelonephritis or sepsis | - IV ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, or carbapenems (ertapenem, meropenem) [^113pxm2L] <br/> - Adjust based on culture results and clinical response [^111SjmRZ] |

---

## Definitive antibiotic therapy

Definitive therapy should be **narrowed to culture and susceptibility results**:

- **Fluoroquinolones**: Ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin for 5–7 days if susceptible [^114Rndbn].

- **TMP-SMX**: 7–14 days if susceptible [^116DKHYK].

- **Beta-lactams**: Amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone, or cefepime for 7–14 days, especially for resistant organisms [^116DKHYK].

---

## Duration of therapy

Uncomplicated pyelonephritis is treated for **5–7 days with fluoroquinolones** or 7–14 days with TMP-SMX or beta-lactams [^116DKHYK] [^11279yxK], whereas **complicated pyelonephritis** is treated for 7–14 days, with shorter courses (7 days) if the patient is clinically improving [^117G4Hrr] [^117Smpys].

---

## Adjunctive measures

Adjunctive measures include **supportive care** — hydration, analgesics, and antipyretics — and **source control** with imaging and intervention for obstruction, abscess, or structural abnormalities if indicated [^116CkcWi].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up should include **clinical reassessment** within 48–72 hours; if there is no improvement, repeat cultures and imaging should be obtained [^111SjmRZ] [^116DKHYK]. Routine **post-treatment cultures** are not required for asymptomatic patients, but they should be obtained if symptoms persist or recur [^116D2UjH].

---

## Special considerations

Special considerations include **pregnancy**, for which initial inpatient management with parenteral beta-lactams is recommended [^111cqEBQ], and **pediatric patients**, for whom short-course therapy (7 days) may be effective and is supported by emerging evidence [^113TcUvx] [^112M3bSK].

---

## Prevention of recurrence

Prevention of recurrence focuses on **patient education** on hygiene, hydration, and symptom recognition, and on identifying and managing modifiable risk factors such as obstruction, diabetes, or immunosuppression [^115fxkfK].

---

Pyelonephritis due to E. coli requires **prompt empiric therapy** aligned with local resistance, followed by culture-directed narrowing. Fluoroquinolones or TMP-SMX are first-line for uncomplicated cases, while IV cephalosporins or carbapenems are reserved for severe or complicated disease. Duration is typically 5–7 days for uncomplicated and 7–14 days for complicated cases, with close follow-up to ensure clinical response and address any complications.

Introduction

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the fourth most common infection requiring antibiotic treatment, with over 404 million cases and 236,790 deaths being estimated globally in 2019. UTIs are a significant economic burden resulting in > 6 billion dollars (~$ 18 per person in the US) in direct health care costs globally each year. Importantly, in Europe, there were 48,700 deaths attributed to antimicrobial-resistant UTIs in 2019.

The predominant cause of UTIs is Escherichia coli, with a prevalence of 75% in uncomplicated UTIs. UTIs caused by E. coli are associated with high levels of recurrence of infection (40%), and ~40–52.6% of patients with E. coli bacteraemia are thought to have a urinary source. Currently, the recommended first-line antibiotics to treat uncomplicated UTIs in the UK are trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin for 3–5 days. If there is no improvement in symptoms after initial treatment, second-line antibiotics such as pivmecillinam or fosfomycin are recommended. However, a high prevalence of resistance has been identified in pathogens causing UTIs, as found by the English Surveillance Programme for Antimicrobial Utilisation and Resistance (ESPAUR). The report found that in 2018, 31.9% of all bacterial isolates from UTI samples were resistant to trimethoprim, while 11.7% were resistant to nitrofurantoin and 7.9% were resistant to fosfomycin. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is not normally performed in primary care for UTIs prior to prescribing antibiotics, and with the insufficient development of novel antimicrobials continuing, there is a requirement to develop new strategies to maintain efficacy in current antibiotics and optimise their use.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to definitive therapy, IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to regard an antibiogram as local if derived from the same healthcare facility, recent if based on data from the prior 12 months, and relevant to the patient if based on organisms from a similar patient population. Consider selecting an antibiotic for which ≥ 90% of the most relevant organisms are susceptible in patients in septic shock, or for which ≥ 80% of the most relevant organisms are susceptible in patients with sepsis without shock.

ESBL-E pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) — agents to avoid are specified as follows: Nitrofurantoin does not achieve adequate renal parenchymal levels and is not advised for pyelonephritis or cUTI, doxycycline is also not advised for ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTIs due to limited urinary excretion, and fosfomycin is not suggested for prostatitis caused by gram-negative organisms other than E. coli due to fosA-mediated inactivation. In an observational series of chronic bacterial prostatitis, fosfomycin was associated with clinical cure in 36 (82%) of 44 males.

Patient-specific risk factors for resistant uropathogens — recent antibiotic class exposure: In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis), we suggest avoiding fluoroquinolones if the patient has been exposed to that class of antibiotic in the past 12 months (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Remarks note that more recent antibiotic exposure may be a better guide than more distant antibiotic exposure.

### The current management strategies for community-acquired urinary tract infection [^117BsxsL]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Acute uncomplicated UTI is one of the most common problems for which young women seek medical attention and accounts for considerable morbidity and health care costs. Acute cystitis or pyelonephritis in the adult patient should be considered uncomplicated if the patient is not pregnant or elderly, if there has been no recent instrumentation or antimicrobial treatment, and if there are no known functional or anatomic abnormalities of the genitourinary tract. Most of these infections are caused by E. coli, which are susceptible to many oral antimicrobials, although resistance is increasing to some of the commonly used agents, especially TMP-SMX. In women with risk factors for infection with resistant bacteria, or in the setting of a high prevalence of TMP-SMX-resistant uropathogens, a case can be made for using a fluoroquinolone or nitrofurantoin. Use of nitrofurantoin for the empiric treatment of mild cystitis is supportable from a public health perspective in an attempt to decrease uropathogen resistance because it does not share cross-resistance with more commonly prescribed antimicrobials. Beta-lactams and fosfomycin should be considered second-line agents for empiric treatment of cystitis. Acute pyelonephritis in an otherwise healthy woman may be considered an uncomplicated infection. Fluoroquinolone regimens are superior to TMP-SMX for empiric therapy because of the relatively high prevalence of TMP-SMX resistance among uropathogens causing pyelonephritis. TMP-SMX, effective for patients with mild to moderate disease, is an appropriate drug if the uropathogen is known to be susceptible. It is reasonable to use a 7- to 10-day oral fluoroquinolone regimen for outpatient management of mild to moderate pyelonephritis in the setting of a susceptible causative pathogen and rapid clinical response to therapy. Most women with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis are now managed safely and effectively as outpatients. Acute uncomplicated cystitis or pyelonephritis in healthy adult men is very uncommon but is generally caused by the same spectrum of uropathogens with the same antimicrobial susceptibility profile as that seen in women. The choice of antimicrobials is similar to that recommended for cystitis in women except that nitrofurantoin is not considered a good choice. Treatment duration should generally be longer than that recommended for women.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to definitive therapy, IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider selecting a definitive effective antibiotic with a targeted spectrum based on the results of urine culture (identification and susceptibility) as soon as these are available in patients with confirmed complicated UTI, rather than continuing empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for the complete duration of treatment.

### Evaluation of local prescribing patterns and antimicrobial resistance in women with acute pyelonephritis caused by… [^117Y45Tc]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Owing to increasing local Escherichia coli resistance and current guidelines for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis (APN) over 14 years old, an evaluation of local prescribing patterns is warranted.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate local prescribing patterns and appropriateness of antibiotics in acute uncomplicated APN.

Methods

This is a retrospective cohort study of female patients aged 18 to 89 years diagnosed with APN and positive urine culture growing E. coli. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, immunocompromised status, and complicated urinary tract infections. Outcomes included antibiotic appropriateness and its effects on hospital admission, hospital length of stay, and 30-day readmission.

Results

Between 2017 and 2022, 308 female patients were diagnosed with APN and had positive urine cultures, with 104 seen only in the emergency department (ED) and 109 admitted to the hospital. Patients seen in the ED had a significant increase in E. coli resistance to discharge antibiotics (12.5% vs 2.8%, P = 0.0070). In those patients discharged on antibiotics resistant to E. coli, significantly more patients returned to the ED in 30 days (31.3% vs 10.7%, P = 0.0155).

Conclusion and Relevance

Patients seen only in the ED were more likely to have resistant organisms to discharge antibiotics compared with those admitted to the hospital. Patients discharged on antibiotics resistant to E. coli had a 3-fold increase in returning to the ED within 30 days regardless of admitted location. Follow-up of all cultures should be performed, and patients resistant to discharge antibiotics should be contacted and antibiotic regimens changed.

### Assessment and optimization of the empiric treatment of urinary tract infections in an academic emergency department observation unit [^1157MHaP]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Poor adherence to evidence-based guidelines and overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics has been noted in the emergency department (ED). There is limited evidence on guideline-congruent empiric therapy for urinary tract infections (UTIs) and uropathogen susceptibilities in the ED observation unit (EDOU).

Objective

The primary objective was to evaluate the prescribing patterns for the empiric treatment of UTI in the EDOU. Secondary objectives were to analyze uropathogen susceptibilities in the EDOU and implement an algorithm for the empiric treatment of UTI.

Methods

This study retrospectively reviewed adult patients who received empiric UTI treatment in the EDOU from January 1, 2018 to April 1, 2018. Eligible patients were categorized as having either uncomplicated or complicated cystitis, or pyelonephritis based on their clinical diagnosis. Antimicrobial therapy was evaluated in accordance with national practice guidelines, institutional guidelines, and local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns.

Results

Patients with uncomplicated or complicated cystitis (n = 115) were provided guideline-congruent empiric treatment in 87% of cases. Patients with pyelonephritis (n = 35) were provided guideline-congruent empiric treatment in 57% of cases. Susceptibility patterns of uropathogens isolated from this patient sample differed slightly from the institutional antibiogram, notably depicting a lower Escherichia coli susceptibility rate. Fluoroquinolones were prescribed for a longer than recommended duration in 18 patients (60%).

Conclusions

The majority of patients in this study were provided guideline-congruent empiric therapy. Nevertheless, there are opportunities to optimize empiric UTI treatment and improve antibiotic stewardship in the EDOU.

ESBL-E pyelonephritis/cUTI clinical evidence and panel preference — A randomized, open-label clinical trial included 66 patients with ESBL-producing E. coli pyelonephritis or cUTI randomized to either piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours or ertapenem 1 g IV every 24 hours, with clinical success similar at 94% for piperacillin-tazobactam and 97% for ertapenem; these studies suggest noninferiority between piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems for pyelonephritis or cUTIs. In the subgroup of 231 patients with ESBL-E bloodstream infections from a urinary source in the aforementioned trial, higher mortality was identified in the piperacillin-tazobactam group (7% vs 3%) although not achieving statistical significance. Evaluating the totality of the data, the panel prefers carbapenem therapy (or oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin, if susceptible) for the treatment of ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI; if piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated as empiric therapy and clinical improvement occurs, the decision to continue should be made with the understanding that theoretically there may be an increased risk for microbiological failure with this approach.

### Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride [^1122zPGb]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute Uncomplicated Cystitis

Ciprofloxacin tablets are indicated in adult female patients for treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis caused by Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus saprophyticus.

Because fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin tablets, have been associated with serious adverse reactions [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1 to 5.16)] and for some patients acute uncomplicated cystitis is self-limiting, reserve ciprofloxacin tablets for treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in patients who have no alternative treatment options.

Complicated Urinary Tract Infection and Pyelonephritis in Pediatric Patients

Ciprofloxacin tablets are indicated in pediatric patients aged one to 17 years of age for treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) and pyelonephritis due to Escherichia coli [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.4)].

Although effective in clinical trials, ciprofloxacin tablets are not a drug of first choice in the pediatric population due to an increased incidence of adverse reactions compared to controls, including reactions related to joints and/or surrounding tissues. Ciprofloxacin tablets, like other fluoroquinolones, is associated with arthropathy and histopathological changes in weight-bearing joints of juvenile animals [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.13), ADVERSE REACTIONS (6.1), USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.4) and NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY (13.2)].

Acute uncomplicated urinary tract infection and acute pyelonephritis are very common infections affecting many women throughout their lives. The determinants of infection have been well described and current strategies to prevent recurrent infections are highly effective. While antimicrobial management is straightforward for most episodes, the evolution of antimicrobial susceptibility of E. coli in community-acquired infection requires continuing re-evaluation of appropriate empiric therapy.

Question 1.2 — ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) treatment: Suggested approach states that TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred treatment options for pyelonephritis or cUTIs caused by ESBL-E, with ertapenem, meropenem, and imipenem-cilastatin preferred when resistance or toxicities preclude TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides as alternative options. The rationale specifies that these agents are preferred assuming in vitro susceptibility; carbapenems are also preferred when resistance or toxicities prevent use or early if the patient is critically ill, and if a carbapenem is initiated and susceptibility to TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin is demonstrated, transitioning to oral formulations is preferred over completing a carbapenem course. Aminoglycosides are considered alternative because of nephrotoxicity risk; in a clinical trial of 609 adults receiving plazomicin once daily compared to meropenem for cUTI and pyelonephritis, an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.5 mg above baseline occurred in 7% vs 4%. Additional considerations include that in 2023 the CLSI revised gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin breakpoints for Enterobacterales; aminoglycosides may be reasonable for completing treatment courses given prolonged renal cortical activity and convenience of once daily dosing, and duration-dependent nephrotoxicity risks should be considered. Fosfomycin is not suggested for pyelonephritis or cUTI given limited renal parenchymal concentrations; more data are needed, and a clinical trial of 97 women with E. coli pyelonephritis reported approximately half with bacteremia, up to 5 days of IV therapy, and participants subsequently transitioned to either once-daily 3 g.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^113pxm2L]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotics, community-acquired pyelonephritis, IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider administering a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin, a carbapenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, or a fluoroquinolone for initial management of patients with sepsis due to complicated UTI, using the four-step assessment, rather than newer agents such as novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors, cefiderocol, plazomicin, or older aminoglycosides. Consider administering agents with a broader spectrum of activity against organisms other than Enterobacterales, such as P. aeruginosa, enterococci, or MRSA, for patients with sepsis in whom the diagnosis of complicated UTI is not clear or who are suspected to have complicated UTI due to these pathogens.

### Diagnosis and management of urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis [^115e9Bwk]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections treated in the outpatient setting and range in severity from minimally symptomatic cystitis to severe septic shock in a wide array of patients. Diagnosis of uncomplicated cystitis can be inferred from history and physical, and confirmed by urinalysis. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy should rapidly improve symptoms in all UTIs. Treatment can be further tailored according to severity of illness, analysis of individualized risk factors, and antimicrobial resistance patterns. This article discusses treatment options in light of bacterial resistance in the twenty-first century.

### The expanding role of fluoroquinolones [^111SR2jC]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

There has been a growing rate of resistance among common urinary tract pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, to traditional antimicrobial therapies including the "gold standard" trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Consequently, fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents have taken on an expanding management role for UTIs. In fact, the recent Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical management guidelines for UTI recommend fluoroquinolones as first-line therapy for uncomplicated UTI in areas where resistance is likely to be of concern. Fluoroquinolones have demonstrated high bacteriologic and clinical cure rates, as well as low rates of resistance, among most common uropathogens. There are currently 7 fluoroquinolones with indications for UTI in the United States. However, only 3 are commonly used: levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and, to a lesser extent, gatifloxacin. Many of the fluoroquinolone agents have once-daily dosing regimens, enhancing patient adherence. In addition, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin have same-dose bioequivalency between their intravenous and oral formulations, allowing for "switch" or step-down therapy from parenteral to oral formulations of the same agent at the same dose. Fluoroquinolones are indicated for the management of acute uncomplicated UTIs, as well as complicated and severe UTI and pyelonephritis, in adults. They are the first-line treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis in patients who cannot tolerate sulfonamides or TMP, who live in geographic areas with known resistance > 10% to 20% to TMP-SMX, or who have risk factors for such resistance. Fluoroquinolone properties include a broad spectrum of coverage, low rates of resistance, and good safety profiles.

Acute pyelonephritis is a common bacterial infection of the renal pelvis and kidney most often seen in young adult women. History and physical examination are the most useful tools for diagnosis. Most patients have fever, although it may be absent early in the illness. Flank pain is nearly universal, and its absence should raise suspicion of an alternative diagnosis. A positive urinalysis confirms the diagnosis in patients with a compatible history and physical examination. Urine culture should be obtained in all patients to guide antibiotic therapy if the patient does not respond to initial empiric antibiotic regimens. Escherichia coli is the most common pathogen in acute pyelonephritis, and in the past decade, there has been an increasing rate of E. coli resistance to extended-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics. Imaging, usually with contrast-enhanced computed tomography, is not necessary unless there is no improvement in the patient's symptoms or if there is symptom recurrence after initial improvement. Outpatient treatment is appropriate for most patients. Inpatient therapy is recommended for patients who have severe illness or in whom a complication is suspected. Practice guidelines recommend oral fluoroquinolones as initial outpatient therapy if the rate of fluoroquinolone resistance in the community is 10 percent or less. If the resistance rate exceeds 10 percent, an initial intravenous dose of ceftriaxone or gentamicin should be given, followed by an oral fluoroquinolone regimen. Oral beta-lactam antibiotics and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are generally inappropriate for outpatient therapy because of high resistance rates. Several antibiotic regimens can be used for inpatient treatment, including fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and cephalosporins.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^112M3bSK]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Pyelonephritis, an infection of the upper urinary tract, can lead to both short-term and long-term morbidity, including sepsis, acute kidney injury, renal scarring, and chronic hypertension. To alleviate symptoms during the acute phase of the infection and reduce the potential for long-term consequences, pediatric guidelines recommend treating pyelonephritis with a total of 7 to 14 days of antibiotic therapy.

A growing body of evidence supports the noninferiority of short durations of therapy (in the range of 5–7 days) compared with prolonged durations for producing clinical cure in adults with pyelonephritis. However, limited data explore this question in children. Moreover, there is a need for more robust evidence in children with urological abnomalities. The benefits of a short course of antibiotic therapy for pyelonephritis include improved patient convenience, a decreased likelihood of adverse drug events, a reduced risk of the emergence of antibiotic resistant organisms, and reduced abdominal discomfort.

Since 2016, The Johns Hopkins Hospital Pediatric Antibiotic Treatment Guidelines, accessible to clinicians at all 5 of the hospitals contributing data to the current study, recommend treating children with pyelonephritis with 7 days of antibiotic therapy (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). These guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary team including primary care clinicians, emergency medicine clinicians, hospitalists, urologists, nephrologists, intensivists, and infectious diseases clinicians based on a review of the available evidence in adult and pediatric populations and expert opinion where gaps in data were evident. However, despite the availability of local treatment guidelines, variability remains in prescribed treatment durations for children with pyelonephritis, providing an opportunity to investigate the association between varying durations of antibiotic therapy and patient outcomes. Our objective was to compare the clinical outcomes of children receiving a short-course (< 10 days) vs a prolonged-course (≥ 10 days) of antibiotics for the treatment of pyelonephritis.

Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and carbapenems are alternative agents for uncomplicated cystitis caused by ESBL-E, and although effective, their use is discouraged when nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX are active. An aminoglycoside (as a single dose) and oral fosfomycin (for E. coli only) are also alternative treatments for uncomplicated cystitis caused by ESBL-E, and treatment suggestions for ESBL-E infections assume that in vitro activity of preferred and alternative antibiotics has been demonstrated.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^1137mL9p]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotics (guidance for selection), IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider guiding the selection of empiric antibiotic therapy for patients with suspected complicated UTI, including pyelonephritis, by the severity of illness, specifically whether the patient is in sepsis.
Use the Sepsis-3 definition, which defines sepsis as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Identify patients by an increase in the SOFA score of ≥ 2 points, indicating an in-hospital mortality risk > 10%, or presumptively identify using screening tools such as qSOFA or Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome.

### Long-term antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^111iiYvC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children. Symptoms include fever, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. UTI is caused by Escherichia coli in over 80% of cases and treatment is a course of antibiotics. Due to acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and harms of long-term antibiotics to prevent recurrent UTI in children.

Search Strategy

In November 2010 we searched without language restriction MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL (in the Cochrane Library), the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, reference lists of review articles and contacted content experts.

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of antibiotics with other antibiotics, placebo or no treatment to prevent recurrent UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed and extracted information. A random-effects model was used to estimate risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) for recurrent UTI with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Twelve studies (1557 children) were identified with six (five analysed, 1069 children) comparing antibiotics with placebo/no treatment. Duration of antibiotic prophylaxis varied from 10 weeks to 12 months. Compared to placebo/no treatment, when all studies were included, antibiotics did not appear to reduce the risk of symptomatic UTI (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.53) however when we evaluated the effects of antibiotics in studies with low risk of bias, there was a statistically significant reduction (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.95). The effect was similar in children with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.07) compared to those without VUR (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.12). There was no consistency in occurrence of adverse events. Three studies reported antibiotic resistance, showing a non-significant increased risk for resistance to the antibiotic in the active treatment groups (RR 2.4, 95% CI 0.62 to 9.26). Five studies (4 analysed, 367 children) compared one antibiotic with another but all compared different combinations or different outcomes and studies were not pooled. Two studies reported microbial resistance, nitrofurantoin having a significantly lower risk of resistance than cotrimoxazole (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.92). One study compared alternate with every day cefadroxil treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Long-term antibiotics appear to reduce the risk of repeat symptomatic UTI in susceptible children but the benefit is small and must be considered together with the increased risk of microbial resistance.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114SU4wm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with diabetes — In patients with diabetes, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Remarks: The recommendation for nontreatment of men is inferred from observations in studies which have primarily enrolled women. In a randomized trial, antimicrobial treatment of ASB did not lead to a difference in rates of symptomatic UTI (40% vs 42% over the entire study period), and rates of pyelonephritis were not significantly different between antimicrobial and placebo groups (0.13 vs 0.28 per 100 patient-days; RR, 2.13 [95% CI, .81–5.62]); during the 6-week blinded portion, pyelonephritis was numerically higher with antimicrobials (8% vs 2%). Treatment-related adverse effects were more common with antimicrobials (18% vs 6%), and treated subjects received nearly 5 times more days of antimicrobial therapy; in prospective cohorts there were no between-group differences in symptomatic UTI, diabetic complications, or mortality, men with diabetes were included in only 1 cohort study with similar outcomes, and there is high-quality evidence that antimicrobials increase the risk of adverse effects.

### Pyelonephritis (acute) in non-pregnant women [^114UacDQ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pyelonephritis is usually caused by ascent of bacteria (most often Escherichia coli) from the bladder, and is more likely in people with structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities. The prognosis is good if pyelonephritis is treated appropriately, but complications include renal abscess, renal impairment, and septic shock.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of antibiotic treatments for acute pyelonephritis in non-pregnant women with uncomplicated infection? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to November 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found four studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (intravenous), antibiotics (oral), and antibiotics (switch therapy).

### Integrating Escherichia coli antimicrobial susceptibility data from multiple surveillance programs [^117MJMVZ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

E. coli is the most common cause of infections by gram-negative bacilli and the bacterial organism most often isolated from blood cultures. It is a frequent cause of outpatient urinary tract infections in women worldwide, of hospitalization due to pyelonephritis and septicemia, and of nosocomial infections among hospitalized patients. Meningitis caused by E. coli in neonates is frequently fatal. Resistance to recommended first- and second-line agents, such as penicillins, cephalosporins, sulfa drugs, and fluoroquinolones is high in many countries and is commonly associated with treatment failure.

### Diagnosis and management of acute pyelonephritis in adults [^116DKHYK]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

There are approximately 250,000 cases of acute pyelonephritis each year, resulting in more than 100,000 hospitalizations. The most common etiologic cause is infection with Escherichia coli. The combination of the leukocyte esterase test and the nitrite test (with either test proving positive) has a sensitivity of 75 to 84 percent and a specificity of 82 to 98 percent for urinary tract infection. Urine cultures are positive in 90 percent of patients with acute pyelonephritis, and cultures should be obtained before antibiotic therapy is initiated. The use of blood cultures should be reserved for patients with an uncertain diagnosis, those who are immunocompromised, and those who are suspected of having hematogenous infections. Outpatient oral antibiotic therapy with a fluoroquinolone is successful in most patients with mild uncomplicated pyelonephritis. Other effective alternatives include extended-spectrum penicillins, amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium, cephalosporins, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Indications for inpatient treatment include complicated infections, sepsis, persistent vomiting, failed outpatient treatment, or extremes of age. In hospitalized patients, intravenous treatment is recommended with a fluoroquinolone, aminoglycoside with or without ampicillin, or a third-generation cephalosporin. The standard duration of therapy is seven to 14 days. Urine culture should be repeated one to two weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy. Treatment failure may be caused by resistant organisms, underlying anatomic/functional abnormalities, or immunosuppressed states. Lack of response should prompt repeat blood and urine cultures and, possibly, imaging studies. A change in antibiotics or surgical intervention may be required.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^117H4oaD]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Acute urinary tract infection (UTI) with complicating factors — empiric management and pyelonephritis exclusions: When empiric therapy of an acute UTI with complicating factors is initiated, treatment should be reevaluated once urine culture and sensitivity results are available; the initial selection of empiric therapy should reflect the patient's individual uropathogen history, current treatment (eg, if currently on UTI suppression antibiotics), and response to prior therapy, and if clinically reasonable, antimicrobial therapy should be delayed pending culture results and organism susceptibility so antimicrobial treatment can be targeted based on the uropathogen profile. For pyelonephritis, several otherwise useful UTI antibiotics are not recommended for acute pyelonephritis treatment, including nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin; TMP-SMX is not recommended for empiric treatment because of high rates of TMP-SMX resistance, and empirically initiated antibiotics should be refined when the urine culture results are available.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^112BXcnZ]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI — In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, sepsis or septic shock, immunocompromised states, severe renal insufficiency, and functional or structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, and some patients in these subpopulations may need an individualized plan of therapy. An effective antimicrobial agent means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

### Fluoroquinolone-resistant and extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli infections in patients with pyelonephritis, United States (1) [^116BWWsy]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Escherichia coli, the predominant cause of community-acquired urinary tract infection (UTI) worldwide, is increasingly resistant to available antimicrobial drugs. In the United States, in vitro resistance of E. coli to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) became prevalent in the 1990s. Over the past decade, fluoroquinolone resistance rates have increased to > 10% in some surveys.

In many parts of the world, E. coli fluoroquinolone resistance rates are > 20% among patients with community-acquired uncomplicated UTI and > 50% among patients with complicated infections. In addition, infections resulting from extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)–producing E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae are becoming increasingly common in these same areas and are associated with sequence type (ST) 131, a globally disseminated, multidrug-resistant clone that frequently produces CTX-M-15 ESBL. These E. coli isolates are generally resistant to cephalosporins and often to other antimicrobial drug classes. In North America, ESBL-producing E. coli infections have occurred predominantly in patients with healthcare exposure and have not become prevalent as a cause of community-acquired infections.

The 2010 international treatment guidelines of the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommend for acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis a fluoroquinolone and an initial dose of an agent from another antimicrobial drug class (e.g. ceftriaxone or gentamicin) if the fluoroquinolone resistance rate is > 10%. For uncomplicated cystitis, the guidelines discourage use of an antimicrobial drug if its resistance rate is > 20%. The guidelines do not address a scenario in which ESBL-producing uropathogens have become prevalent among patients with community-acquired infections. Use of antimicrobial drugs for which the uropathogen shows in vitro resistance has been associated with substantially reduced response rates, which can lead to serious consequences, particularly for patients with pyelonephritis. Given rapid changes in global resistance patterns and a lack of recent active and prospective surveillance of community-acquired UTI in the United States, the extent to which the prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance has increased and multidrug-resistant ESBL-producing strains have emerged in the community is unknown.

We sought to determine the prevalence of E. coli antimicrobial resistance among patients with acute pyelonephritis who sought care at a US emergency department (ED)–based sentinel research network. We focused on fluoroquinolone-resistant and ESBL-producing isolates from these patients and examined risk factors for antimicrobial drug resistance.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112Tn8oB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in children — evidence and research needs: In girls with ASB, symptomatic reinfections after therapy occurred in 7 of 46 (15%), all with new E. coli strains isolated, whereas bacteriuria persisted in all girls treated with erythromycin and none developed symptomatic infection following antimicrobial therapy. Screening modeling projected substantial test burden and cost: screening of 100 000 hypothetical preschool children using standard culture techniques would result in nearly 20 000 false-positive tests and 143 false negatives, with total costs estimated at nearly $2 million dollars in 1992. The rationale states there is moderate-quality evidence that there is no benefit and high-quality evidence of harm; ASB is uncommon in infants and boys and occurs in about 1%–3% of healthy girls; there is no evidence of a higher risk for subsequent renal scarring or renal insufficiency; and there is no evidence that treatment prevents symptomatic UTI, including pyelonephritis, renal scarring, or renal insufficiency. It also notes studies addressing ASB in children were performed > 40 years ago without indications that incidence or outcomes would differ today, and identifies research needs: future studies of antimicrobial therapy should include renal scarring as a primary outcome, and studies enrolling children with neuromuscular disorders and immunocompromised states should be a priority.

### Diagnosis and management of uncomplicated urinary tract infections [^1156Fvm4]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Most uncomplicated urinary tract infections occur in women who are sexually active, with far fewer cases occurring in older women, those who are pregnant, and in men. Although the incidence of urinary tract infection has not changed substantially over the last 10 years, the diagnostic criteria, bacterial resistance patterns, and recommended treatment have changed. Escherichia coli is the leading cause of urinary tract infections, followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has been the standard therapy for urinary tract infection; however, E. coli is becoming increasingly resistant to medications. Many experts support using ciprofloxacin as an alternative and, in some cases, as the preferred first-line agent. However, others caution that widespread use of ciprofloxacin will promote increased resistance.

DISCUSSION

Our study of contemporary patients from 15 centers across the US found that the prevalence of FQ‐resistant E. coli exceeded 15% at 14 of the 15 sites and was > 20% at 7 of the 15 sites signifying that geographic variation exists in E. coli FQ‐resistance. Patients presenting with a complicated UTI had E. coli FQ resistance prevalences that exceeded 50% at many sites, whereas those with uncomplicated pyelonephritis and cystitis had resistance prevalences being 29.3% and 29.9% for pyelonephritis and cystitis, respectively. Previous studies have shown that prevalence of E. coli resistance to FQs has been increasing over the past two decades. In an analysis of over 12 million urine specimens, E. coli resistance to FQs was reported to be 3% in 2000 but increased to 17.1% in 2010. A study enrolling participants from 2013 to 2014 evaluated the prevalence of FQ‐resistant E. coli in patients presenting to the ED with acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis and found that 19.9% of isolates were resistant. The combined E. coli FQ‐resistance rate at all sites in this study was 22.1% (range 10.5%–29.7% by site) demonstrating that resistance continues to increase across the US.

The most recent IDSA guidelines (published > 10 years ago) for the treatment of uncomplicated pyelonephritis recommend empiric FQ treatment unless the local prevalence of E coli resistance is greater than 10%, in which case, an initial parenteral antibiotic (e.g. ceftriaxone, consolidated 24‐hour dose of an aminoglycoside) dose is recommended to be administered before the patient is discharged home. All 15 sites in our study reported E. coli FQ‐resistance > 10%, suggesting that empiric antimicrobial regimens should be modified for patients with pyelonephritis. For uncomplicated cystitis, FQ‐resistant was reported in 29.9% of all of E. coli isolates. Fortunately, current guidelines recommend nitrofurantoin as first‐line treatment for uncomplicated cystitis as resistance rates have remained low. In the total cohort, we found E. coli resistance to nitrofurantoin was 2%, with it being slightly lower at 1.9% in patients with uncomplicated cystitis suggesting that nitrofurantoin remains a viable treatment option for uncomplicated cystitis.

### Rational antibiotic treatment of outpatient genitourinary infections in a changing environment [^115e4DU4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

In the outpatient setting, genitourinary infections (GUIs) remain costly to treat and are a significant cause of morbidity. Recent evidence supports more substantial roles for pathogens other than Escherichia coli, particularly gram-positive pathogens, in the pathogenesis of GUIs. Broad-spectrum agents should be considered in order to address this etiologic change appropriately. Criteria for antimicrobial selection set forth by the Council for Appropriate and Rational Antibiotic Therapy (CARAT) recommend using antibiotics that are supported by strong clinical evidence, have good susceptibility profiles, are safe, are cost-effective, and are used for the optimal duration. Evidence-based guidelines recommend considering local E coli resistance rates to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and using fluoroquinolones as second-line therapy when resistance is high. Fluoroquinolones are recommended for the treatment of pyelonephritis and prostatitis. Among the fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin offer coverage for the gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, which may make them preferable in treating urinary tract infections empirically in such patient groups. For the treatment of bacterial prostatitis, only trimethoprim and the fluoroquinolones possess both the appropriate bactericidal activity and the ability to diffuse into the prostate. Levofloxacin shows particularly good penetration into prostatic tissue. Safety issues to consider include imbalances in intestinal microflora caused by antimicrobial agents that may lead to overgrowth of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea. Once the optimal agent is identified, the optimal duration of treatment should be determined to maximize treatment success while minimizing the potential for resistance. Finally, cost considerations include the costs of treatment failure due to inappropriate therapy or nonadherence to the therapeutic regimen.

The commensal gut microbiota is the primary reservoir of UTI-causing E. coli, with gut carriage profiles mirroring UTI from the perspectives of clonal composition and drug-resistance profiles of E. coli as well as patient age demographics. In particular, elderly women are colonized more often by FQREC and are at a higher risk for FQR forms of UTI than younger women. As recently as 2016, FQs were the most prescribed antibiotic for treating UTIs. However, accumulated evidence for adverse effects combined with a sharp rise in FQ resistance of uropathogenic enterobacteria led to FDA, CDC, and IDSA recommendations for curbing FQ use in the treatment of uncomplicated UTI. However, FQ continues to be recommended for patients who have no alternative treatment options, complicated UTIs, pyelonephritis, or other severe infections where the benefits of FQ outweigh the risks of adverse effects. Thus, resistance to FQ in uropathogens remains a significant clinical problem, and a reduction in gut carriage of FQREC would be a welcome development. This is especially important because the FQR phenotype of E. coli has a strong association with UTI-caused bacteremia in individuals aged 50+ yo and overall sepsis mortality rates in adults.

### Procalcitonin and pyuria-based algorithm reduces antibiotic use in urinary tract infections: a randomized controlled trial [^1155AHnb]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with complicated febrile UTI were older and had multiple comorbidities. Especially in this population with the highest disease burden, in whom the longest antibiotic therapy is recommended by current guidelines, our algorithm proved to be effective.

The safety subgroups were small, but no trend for difference in rates of persistent infection was shown at 7 days after end of therapy or at 30 days after enrollment. The slightly higher, but non-significant, rate of bacteriuria and asymptomatic infection in the PCT-pyuria group should not be viewed as an unsuccessful treatment. There is vast evidence that asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be treated. In fact, asymptomatic bacteriuria might be protective against future development of pyelonephritis, as elegantly shown in a prospective Italian study of young women with asymptomatic bacteriuria, who benefited from symptomatic treatment versus antibiotics. There is evidence that in older patients with isolated non-specific signs or non-infectious symptoms, such as delirium, urine testing and subsequent antibiotic therapy should not be ordered.

Furthermore, the follow-up mid-stream urine cultures in the PCT-pyuria group yielded in the majority of cases Enterococcus faecalis (Table 2), which has recently been shown to have a low positive predictive value for uropathogen growth in the bladder.

The antibiotics chosen in our algorithm, derived from international guidelines, should not deter from the necessity to adapt antibiotic choices to local epidemiology and resistance data. In Switzerland, 18.5% of Escherichia coli were resistant to fluoroquinolones in 2013, compared to 22.3% in the European Union in 2012.

A major strength was the innovative study design with antibiotic guidance based on the combination of the systemic and local response against a control group receiving antibiotic therapy according to the low end of currently recommended guidelines.

Potential limitations

Our study has the following limitations. First, the small sample size due to slow recruitment and the heterogeneity of patients within the predefined subgroups limit the power of the analysis, especially regarding safety outcomes. Second, the follow-up mode by telephone interview and by urine samples which were returned by mail harbors potential recall bias and underreporting, which we tried to counteract by contacting the primary care physician and by obtaining discharge letters of subsequent hospitalizations. Third, the analysis of the recurrence rate in the subgroup of patients with bacteremia was limited due to the small numbers. Further studies will have to clarify whether this algorithm needs to be adapted for patients with bacteremia.

UTIs are common, potentially severe infections that the emergency physician must manage efficiently and effectively. In most cases, this entity is well recognized, and the clinician will be confident of the correct course. However, in certain populations, complications are common, and the best therapy has yet to be proven. Tailoring the evaluation and treatment to the risk of complications is imperative. With careful evaluation, individualized therapy and close follow-up, the majority of patients can be expected to do well.

### Medical treatment for urinary tract infections [^113wS4eQ]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common source of morbidity and require significant health care resources for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Antimicrobials represent the mainstay for the treatment of UTIs. Established guidelines exist for the antimicrobial treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTIs; however, antimicrobial dependence and overuse have led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Nonantimicrobial alternatives are an ongoing area of research and should be considered when clinically appropriate based on available evidence.

### A meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials comparing short-and long-course antibiotic therapy for urinary tract infections in children [^111118Ux]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Short-course antibiotic regimens, ranging in duration from a single dose to 3 days, are the current standard of care for the treatment of acute lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) in adult women. Despite multiple small randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) showing no difference in efficacy between short-course (≤ 3 days) and long-course (7–14 days) therapy in children, concerns about occult pyelonephritis and renal scarring have prompted standard recommendations of 7 to 14 days of antibiotics for UTIs in children.

Objective

To determine whether long-course antibiotic therapy is more effective than short-course therapy for the treatment of UTIs in children, and to explore potential sources of heterogeneity in the results of existing studies.

Methods

We searched online bibliographic databases (Medline and Cochrane Clinical Trials Registry) for RCTs comparing short- and long-course therapy for the treatment of UTI in children, and examined the references of all retrieved articles. Candidate studies for meta-analysis were restricted to RCTs comparing short-course (≤ 3 days) and long-course (7–14 days) outpatient therapy for acute UTI in children age 0 to 18 years. We excluded studies that were restricted to children with recurrent UTI or included children with asymptomatic bacteriuria. Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was evaluated using a 9-item scoring system developed by the investigators. Data on the primary outcomes-treatment failure and reinfection rate-were extracted when available and reanalyzed based on intention to treat whenever possible. To determine whether anatomic level of infection (upper vs lower urinary tract) influenced the results, the meta-analysis was repeated on the subgroup of studies that attempted to restrict their participants to children with lower UTI. To determine whether there was a dose-response effect for the duration of short-course therapy, we performed separate subgroup analyses of studies of single-dose or single-day therapy and studies of 3-day therapy. To explore other potential sources of study result heterogeneity, such as study quality and patient age, we developed a random-effects regression model that included these variables as covariates.

Results

The pooled estimate for the relative risk (RR) of treatment failure with short-course antibiotic therapy was 1.94 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19–3.15) and for the RR of reinfection was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.39–1.47). When we excluded the 3 studies that did not attempt to restrict their participants to patients with lower UTI, the pooled RR of treatment failure was 1.74 (95% CI: 1.05–2.88) and of reinfection was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.32–1.52). For the subgroup of studies comparing single-dose or 1-day therapy to long-course therapy, the pooled RR of treatment failure was 2.73 (95% CI: 1.38–5.40) and of reinfection was 0.37 (95% CI: 0.12–1.18). For the subgroup of studies comparing 3-day therapy to long-course therapy, the pooled RR of treatment failure was 1.36 (95% CI: 0.68–2.72) and of reinfection was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.46–2.13). In the meta-regression, neither study quality nor mean participant age was significantly associated with the odds ratio of treatment failure or reinfection, in either the complete set of studies or the subset of studies restricted to patients with lower UTI.

Conclusions

In pooled analyses of published studies comparing long- and short-course antibiotic treatment of UTI in children, long-course therapy was associated with fewer treatment failures without a concomitant increase in reinfections, even when studies including patients with evidence of pyelonephritis were excluded from the analysis. Until there are more accurate methods for distinguishing upper from lower UTI in children, no additional comparative trials are warranted and clinicians should continue to treat children with UTI for 7 to 14 days.

Severity of illness — initial prioritization of empiric antibiotic therapy states: For patients with suspected complicated UTI (including pyelonephritis), we suggest that the selection of empiric antibiotic therapy be initially guided by the severity of illness, specifically by whether the patient is in sepsis or not (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Sepsis is defined per the Sepsis-3 Task Force as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection; patients can be identified by SOFA score increase of 2 points or more, reflecting an in-hospital mortality greater than 10%, or presumptively identified with screening tools such as qSOFA or SIRS.

### Fluoroquinolone-resistant and extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli infections in patients with pyelonephritis, United States (1) [^1116fYwf]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

For 2013–2014, we found that prevalence of E. coli fluoroquinolone resistance was > 10% for patients with uncomplicated pyelonephritis at 2 of 10 sites and > 20% for patients with complicated infections at 4 of 10 sentinel sites surveyed in the United States. E. coli fluoroquinolone resistance was particularly prevalent in groups with antimicrobial drug resistance risk. These rates exceed thresholds for the 2010 IDSA treatment guidelines, which recommend consideration of an additional antimicrobial drug of a different class and other agents. Data from a similar study we conducted during 2000–2004 indicate that, among all healthcare-seeking ED patients with acute pyelonephritis, the prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli increased from 3.9% during 2000–2004 to 11.7% during 2013–2014. During 2000–2004, we found no infections caused by ESBL-producing bacteria. As in other parts of the world, ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are emerging among patients with community-acquired UTI in the United States. For patients with uncomplicated and complicated pyelonephritis caused by E. coli, we found that 2.6% and 12.2%, respectively, had infection caused by an ESBL-producing organism; rates were even higher for patients with risk factors. The globally disseminated, multidrug-resistant clone ST131, which produces CTX-M-15 β-lactamase, accounted for 85.2% of these infections. Of ESBL-infected patients, about one third lacked traditional antimicrobial resistance risk factors (i.e. antimicrobial drug or healthcare-setting exposure or international travel), suggesting that these isolates are now endemic in some US communities. Among ESBL-infected patients, about three quarters were initially treated with an antimicrobial drug lacking in vitro activity, including the sickest patients who required hospitalization. We did not collect outcome data, but lack of in vitro activity of the antimicrobial drug used for treatment has been associated with relatively poor response rates among patients with pyelonephritis.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute pyelonephritis: 2022 update [^113GGCdL]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute pyelonephritis (APN) is a severe urinary tract infection (UTI) that has the potential to cause sepsis, shock, and death. In the majority of patients, uncomplicated APN is diagnosed clinically and is responsive to treatment with appropriate antibiotics. In patients who are high risk or when treatment is delayed, microabscesses may coalesce to form an acute renal abscess. High-risk patients include those with a prior history of pyelonephritis, lack of response to therapy for lower UTI or for APN, diabetes, anatomic or congenital abnormalities of the urinary system, infections by treatment-resistant organisms, nosocomial infection, urolithiasis, renal obstruction, prior renal surgery, advanced age, pregnancy, renal transplant recipients, and immunosuppressed or immunocompromised patients. Pregnant patients and patients with renal transplants on immunosuppression are at an elevated risk of severe complications. Imaging studies are often requested to aid with the diagnosis, identify precipitating factors, and differentiate lower UTI from renal parenchymal involvement, particularly in high-risk individuals. Imaging is usually not appropriate for the first-time presentation of suspected APN in an uncomplicated patient. The primary imaging modalities used in high-risk patients with suspected APN are CT, MRI, and ultrasound, although CT was usually not appropriate for initial imaging in a pregnant patient with no other complications. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances in which peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^117Smpys]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) antibiotic duration — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course of antimicrobials, using either 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), rather than a longer course (10–14 days). An effective antimicrobial agent achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy. Most studies supporting this recommendation excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, abscesses in the urinary tract, chronic kidney disease, bacterial prostatitis, complete urinary obstruction, or undergoing urologic surgical procedures. Some patients in these subpopulations may be at higher risk for complications or treatment failure and may need an individualized duration of therapy. Men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of Enterobacterales infections, ESBL-producing, IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend to do not change or extend antibiotic therapy if clinical improvement occurs with cefepime initiated as empiric therapy for uncomplicated cystitis caused by an organism later identified as an extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales. Avoid using cefepime for the treatment of pyelonephritis, complicated UTIs, and infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales, even if susceptibility to cefepime is demonstrated.

### Antibiotic resistance in children with E. coli urinary tract infection [^114akPFB]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

The World Health Organization's 2014 global action plan on antimicrobial resistance outlines a strategy to deal with the effects of these multiple individual actions. The plan asks nations to adopt "whole of society" approaches to prevention (through public health and infection control measures), to enhance and better disseminate knowledge on antimicrobial resistance, and to develop an economic case for new investments in drugs, diagnostic tools, and vaccines.

Bryce and colleagues' systematic review joins a host of recent studies, reports, and calls to action on this issue. Each adds evidence to justify change in how we protect a precious global resource. While I have no doubt that clinical practice guidelines will quickly be able to accommodate the findings, I am less confident that there is the will and commitment to deal with what the WHO has called "the post-antibiotic era".

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^113TcUvx]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

National guidelines recommend treating children with pyelonephritis for 7 to 14 days of antibiotic therapy, yet data are lacking to suggest a more precise treatment duration.

Objective

To compare the clinical outcomes of children receiving a short-course vs a prolonged-course of antibiotic treatment for pyelonephritis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective observational study using inverse probability of treatment weighted propensity score analysis of data from 5 hospitals in Maryland between July 1, 2016, and October 1, 2018. Participants were children aged 6 months to 18 years with a urine culture growing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, or Proteus mirabilis with laboratory and clinical criteria for pyelonephritis.

Exposures

Treatment of pyelonephritis with a short-course (6 to 9 days) vs a prolonged-course (10 or more days) of antibiotics.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Composite outcome of treatment failure within 30 days of completing antibiotic therapy: (a) unanticipated emergency department or outpatient visits related to urinary tract infection symptoms, (b) hospital readmission related to UTI symptoms, (c) prolongation of the planned, initial antibiotic treatment course, or (d) death. A subsequent urinary tract infection caused by a drug-resistant bacteria within 30 days was a secondary outcome.

Results

Of 791 children who met study eligibility criteria (mean [SD] age 9.2 [6.3] years; 672 [85.0%]) were girls, 297 patients (37.5%) were prescribed a short-course and 494 patients (62.5%) were prescribed a prolonged-course of antibiotics. The median duration of short-course therapy was 8 days (interquartile range, 7–8 days), and the median duration of prolonged-course therapy was 11 days (interquartile range, 11–12 days). Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups in the inverse probability of treatment weighted cohort. There were 79 children (10.1%) who experienced treatment failure. The odds of treatment failure were similar for patients prescribed a short-course vs a prolonged-course of antibiotics (11.2% vs 9.4%; odds ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.75–1.98). There was no significant difference in the odds of a drug-resistant uropathogen for patients with a subsequent urinary tract infection within 30 days when prescribed a short-courses vs prolonged-course of antibiotics (40% vs 64%; odds ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.09–1.43).

Conclusions and Relevance

The study findings suggest that short-course antibiotic therapy may be as effective as prolonged-courses for children with pyelonephritis, and may mitigate the risk of future drug-resistant urinary tract infections. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.

### Uropathogen and host responses in pyelonephritis [^116QdTvW]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections seen in clinical practice. The ascent of UTI-causing pathogens to the kidneys results in pyelonephritis, which can trigger kidney injury, scarring and ultimately impair kidney function. Despite sizable efforts to understand how infections develop or are cleared in the bladder, our appreciation of the mechanisms by which infections develop, progress or are eradicated in the kidney is limited. The identification of virulence factors that are produced by uropathogenic Escherichia coli to promote pyelonephritis have begun to fill this knowledge gap, as have insights into the mechanisms by which kidney tubular epithelial cells oppose uropathogenic E. coli infection to prevent or eradicate UTIs. Emerging data also illustrate how specific cellular immune responses eradicate infection whereas other immune cell populations promote kidney injury. Insights into the mechanisms by which uropathogenic E. coli circumvent host immune defences or antibiotic therapy to cause pyelonephritis is paramount to the development of new prevention and treatment strategies to mitigate pyelonephritis and its associated complications.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^114Tjjso]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Non-β-lactam therapy for AmpC-E urinary and nonurinary infections — preferred and alternative agents. Preferred treatment options for uncomplicated cystitis caused by AmpC-E are nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX); ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or an aminoglycoside (as a single dose) are alternative options for AmpC-E uncomplicated cystitis. For pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) caused by AmpC-E, TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred, with aminoglycosides as alternative options when resistance or toxicities preclude the use of TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones. For AmpC-E infections outside of the urinary tract, transitioning from cefepime to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated.

### A seven-day course of TMP-SMX may Be as effective as a seven-day course of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of pyelonephritis [^112dV6U2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines recommend either 14 days of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or 7 days of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of pyelonephritis. Antibiotic courses of 7 days of TMP-SMX vs 7 days of ciprofloxacin for pyelonephritis have not been previously compared. We evaluated the odds of a subsequent, symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) for women with Escherichia coli pyelonephritis receiving a 7-day course of TMP-SMX vs a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin.

Methods

Women ages 16 years and older with E. coli pyelonephritis presenting to 5 health care facilities in the greater Maryland area between 2010 and 2016 receiving either TMP-SMX or ciprofloxacin were included. Patients were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: (a) pregnancy, (b) dialysis dependency, (c) E. coli not susceptible to the treatment prescribed, (d) polymicrobial urine culture, or (e) > 48 hours of antibiotic therapy other than TMP-SMX or ciprofloxacin.

Results

Of 272 women meeting eligibility criteria, 81 (30%) and 191 (70%) received 7 days of TMP-SMX and 7 days of ciprofloxacin, respectively. In an adjusted model, the likelihood of a recurrent UTI within 30 days for the TMP-SMX and ciprofloxacin groups was similar (adjusted odds ratio 2.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–7.42).

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that 7 days of TMP-SMX therapy may result in similar clinical outcomes compared with 7 days of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of pyelonephritis. Considering the frequency of pyelonephritis and risks of antibiotic resistance and associated toxicities, decreasing the duration of antibiotic therapy for pyelonephritis may impact a large number of women.

### Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (proquin) [^1142eqNf]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Proquin XR is indicated only for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (acute cystitis) caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms listed below. Proquin XR is not interchangeable with other ciprofloxacin extended-release or immediate release oral formulations. See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION for specific recommendations.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (acute cystitis) caused by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.

THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF PROQUIN XR IN TREATING PYELONEPHRITIS, COMPLICATED URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS, AND INFECTIONS OTHER THAN UNCOMPLICATED URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN DEMONSTRATED. Alternative therapy should be considered for patients who remain symptomatic or develop fever and back pain while on treatment with Proquin XR.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Proquin XR and other antibacterial drugs, Proquin XR should only be used to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and sensitivity information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Acute pyelonephritis in adults: rapid evidence review [^111SjmRZ]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute pyelonephritis is a bacterial infection of the kidney and renal pelvis and should be suspected in patients with flank pain and laboratory evidence of urinary tract infection. Urine culture with antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be performed in all patients and used to direct therapy. Imaging, blood cultures, and measurement of serum inflammatory markers should not be performed in uncomplicated cases. Outpatient management is appropriate in patients who have uncomplicated disease and can tolerate oral therapy. Extended emergency department or observation unit stays are an appropriate option for patients who initially warrant intravenous therapy. Fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are effective oral antibiotics in most cases, but increasing resistance makes empiric use problematic. When local resistance to a chosen oral antibiotic likely exceeds 10%, one dose of a long-acting broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotic should also be given while awaiting susceptibility data. Patients admitted to the hospital should receive parenteral antibiotic therapy, and those with sepsis or risk of infection with a multidrug-resistant organism should receive antibiotics with activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms. Most patients respond to appropriate management within 48 to 72 hours, and those who do not should be evaluated with imaging and repeat cultures while alternative diagnoses are considered. In cases of concurrent urinary tract obstruction, referral for urgent decompression should be pursued. Pregnant patients with pyelonephritis are at significantly elevated risk of severe complications and should be admitted and treated initially with parenteral therapy.

### Antibiotics for acute pyelonephritis in children [^112WBDMH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common bacterial infections in infants. The most severe form of UTI is acute pyelonephritis, which results in significant acute morbidity and may cause permanent kidney damage. There remains uncertainty regarding the optimum antibiotic regimen, route of administration and duration of treatment. This is an update of a review that was first published in 2003 and updated in 2005 and 2007.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of antibiotics used to treat children with acute pyelonephritis. The aspects of therapy considered were 1) different antibiotics, 2) different dosing regimens of the same antibiotic, 3) different duration of treatment, and 4) different routes of administration.

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing different antibiotic agents, routes, frequencies or durations of therapy in children aged 0 to 18 years with proven UTI and acute pyelonephritis were selected.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model and the results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This updated review included 27 studies (4452 children). This update included evidence from three new studies, and following re-evaluation, a previously excluded study was included because it now met our inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was assessed as low for sequence generation (12 studies), allocation concealment (six studies), blinding of outcome assessors (17 studies), incomplete outcome reporting (19 studies) and selective outcome reporting (13 studies). No study was blinded for participants or investigators. The 27 included studies evaluated 12 different comparisons. No significant differences were found in duration of fever (2 studies, 808 children: MD 2.05 hours, 95% CI -0.84 to 4.94), persistent UTI at 72 hours after commencing therapy (2 studies, 542 children: RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.07 to 17.41) or persistent kidney damage at six to 12 months (4 studies, 943 children: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.12) between oral antibiotic therapy (10 to 14 days) and intravenous (IV) therapy (3 days) followed by oral therapy (10 days). Similarly, no significant differences in persistent bacteriuria at the end of treatment (4 studies, 305 children: RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.55) or persistent kidney damage (4 studies, 726 children: RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.29) were found between IV therapy (three to four days) followed by oral therapy and IV therapy (seven to 14 days). No significant differences in efficacy were found between daily and thrice daily administration of aminoglycosides (1 study, 179 children, persistent clinical symptoms at three days: RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.37 to 10.53). Adverse events were mild and uncommon and rarely resulted in discontinuation of treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated review increases the body of evidence that oral antibiotics alone are as effective as a short course (three to four days) of IV antibiotics followed by oral therapy for a total treatment duration of 10 to 14 days for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis in children. When IV antibiotics are given, a short course (two to four days) of IV therapy followed by oral therapy is as effective as a longer course (seven to 10 days) of IV therapy. If IV therapy with aminoglycosides is chosen, single daily dosing is safe and effective. Insufficient data are available to extrapolate these findings to children aged less than one month of age or to children with dilating vesicoureteric reflux (grades III-V). Further studies are required to determine the optimal total duration of antibiotic therapy required for acute pyelonephritis.

### Pyelonephritis (acute) in non-pregnant women [^115dApDE]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pyelonephritis is usually caused by ascent of bacteria, most often Escherichia coli, from the bladder, and is more likely in people with structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities. The prognosis is good if pyelonephritis is treated appropriately, but complications include renal abscess, renal impairment, and septic shock.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of: oral antibiotic treatments for acute pyelonephritis in women with uncomplicated infection; antibiotic treatments in women admitted to hospital with complicated infection; inpatient versus outpatient management in women with uncomplicated infection; analgesia in uncomplicated acute pyelonephritis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to February 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 5 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics, inpatient management, intravenous antibiotics, non-opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral antibiotics, outpatient management, urinary analgesics.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnancy [^111cqEBQ]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are very common during pregnancy. Escherichia coli is the most common pathogen isolated from pregnant women. Ampicillin should not be used because of its high resistance to Escherichia coli. Pyelonephritis can cause morbidity and can be life-threatening to both mother and fetus. Second and third-generation cephalosporins are recommended for treatment, administered initially intravenously during hospitalization. Cultures and the study of virulence factors of uropathogenic Escherichia coli are recommended for the adequate management of pyelonephritis. The lower genital tract infection associated with pyelonephritis is responsible for the failure of antibiotic treatment. Asymptomatic bacteriuria can evolve into cystitis or pyelonephritis. All pregnant women should be routinely screened for bacteriuria using urine culture, and should be treated with nitrofurantoin, sulfixosazole or first-generation cephalosporins. Recurrent urinary infection should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics. Pregnant women who develop urinary tract infections with group B streptococcal infection should be treated with prophylactic antibiotics during labour to prevent neonatal sepsis. Preterm delivery is frequent. Evidence suggests that infection plays a role in the pathogenesis of preterm labour. Experimental models in pregnant mice support the theory that Escherichia coli propagated by the transplacental route, involving bacterial adhesins, induces preterm delivery, but this has not been demonstrated in humans. Ascending lower genital tract infections are the most probable cause of preterm delivery, but this remains to be proved.

### Sulopenem for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections including pyelonephritis: a phase 3, randomized trial [^111Uescw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of infections caused by extended–spectrum β–lactamase (ESBL)–producing Enterobacterales has been increasing worldwide in both hospital- and community-acquired settings. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's analysis of data reported in 2011–2014 to the National Healthcare Safety Network revealed that the proportion of Escherichia coli resistant to extended–spectrum cephalosporins that caused hospital–acquired infections was 13.4% nationally, with rates as high as 24% in some states. That analysis also demonstrated that more than one-third of E. coli isolates in 2014 were resistant to fluoroquinolones. In 2017, ESBL-producing Enterobacterales infections occurred in 197 400 hospitalized patients in the United States, causing 9100 deaths; the estimated attributable healthcare costs for those infections that year was $1.2 billion. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae are both important causes of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) and pyelonephritis. A 2019 report by the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network noted that in 2018, more than half of E. coli isolates were resistant to at least 1 of the antimicrobial groups, including the aminopenicillins (57.4%), fluoroquinolones (25.3%), third–generation cephalosporins (15.1%), and aminoglycosides (11.1%). More than 30% of K. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (31.7%) and fluoroquinolones (31.6%). Coresistance rates among E. coli that are resistant to either fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) have exceeded 45%.

### Fluoroquinolone-resistant and extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli infections in patients with pyelonephritis, United States (1) [^114UPXv9]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

IDSA treatment guidelines for acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis recommend that, if the fluoroquinolone-resistance rate is > 10%, then in addition to a fluoroquinolone, an agent of another class (i.e. ceftriaxone or gentamicin) should be administered. Our findings indicate that fluoroquinolone resistance rates for E. coli are approaching or exceed this threshold for patients with uncomplicated pyelonephritis in many parts of the United States. For uncomplicated cystitis, the guidelines recommend alternative agents if the resistance rate is > 20%, which is the current situation for fluoroquinolones in many settings for patients with complicated pyelonephritis. Unfortunately, we found that only one half to two thirds of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone or gentamicin. Rates of fluoroquinolone-resistant and ESBL-producing E. coli infections correlate to geographic location. Prior exposure to antimicrobial drugs or a healthcare setting, travel outside the United States, and a history of an antimicrobial drug–resistant infection substantially increases the chance that a person will have a current fluoroquinolone-resistant or ESBL-producing E. coli infection. Therefore, in settings with high fluoroquinolone resistance rates, in settings where ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae infections have emerged, or among persons with antimicrobial drug resistance risk factors (especially patients with or at risk for severe sepsis), healthcare providers should consider empirical treatment with a carbapenem or another agent found to be consistently active on the basis of the local antibiogram. In this study, ≈50% of patients with pyelonephritis were managed as outpatients. Currently, no oral antimicrobial drugs with consistent in vitro activity are available for empirical treatment of pyelonephritis caused by ESBL-producing E. coli uropathogens. Our findings, including the variability in the prevalence of resistance by site, show that increased local efforts to enhance surveillance for antimicrobial drug resistance are necessary to best inform treatment decisions. Furthermore, availability of new antimicrobial drugs must be expedited.

ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) — cefepime: The panel suggests avoiding cefepime for the treatment of pyelonephritis or cUTI and for infections outside of the urinary tract caused by ESBL-E, even if cefepime tests susceptible; however, if cefepime was started empirically for uncomplicated cystitis due to an organism later identified as ESBL-E and the patient improves, no change or extension of therapy is necessary. Rationale includes that ESBLs commonly hydrolyze cefepime, cefepime MIC testing may be inaccurate and/or poorly reproducible with commercial AST methods, clinical trials comparing cefepime with a carbapenem for ESBL-E bloodstream infections have not been conducted, and for these reasons the panel suggests avoiding cefepime for invasive ESBL-E infections.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaAcute pyelonephritis [^115fxkfK]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Pyelonephritis refers to infection involving the renal parenchyma and renal pelvis. In most patients, uncomplicated pyelonephritis is diagnosed clinically and responds quickly to appropriate antibiotic treatment. If treatment is delayed, the patient is immunocompromised, or for other reasons, microabscesses that form during the acute phase of pyelonephritis may coalesce, forming a renal abscess. Patients with underlying diabetes are more vulnerable to complications, including emphysematous pyelonephritis in addition to abscess formation. Additionally, diabetics may not have the typical flank tenderness that helps to differentiate pyelonephritis from a lower urinary tract infection. Additional high-risk populations may include those with anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract, vesicoureteral reflux, obstruction, pregnancy, nosocomial infection, or infection by treatment-resistant pathogens. Treatment goals include symptom relief, elimination of infection to avoid renal damage, and identification of predisposing factors to avoid future recurrences. The primary imaging modalities used in patients with pyelonephritis are CT, MRI, and ultrasound. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

A Panel of International Experts was convened by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) to update the 1999 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection Guidelines by the IDSA. Co-sponsoring organizations include the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Urological Association, Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases-Canada, and the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine. The focus of this work is treatment of women with acute uncomplicated cystitis and pyelonephritis, diagnoses limited in these guidelines to premenopausal, non-pregnant women with no known urological abnormalities or co-morbidities. The issues of in vitro resistance prevalence and the ecological adverse effects of antimicrobial therapy (collateral damage) were considered as important factors in making optimal treatment choices and thus are reflected in the rankings of recommendations.

Complicated Urinary Tract Infection and Pyelonephritis

Ciprofloxacin is indicated for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis due to Escherichia coli. Although effective in clinical trials, ciprofloxacin is not a drug of first choice in the pediatric population due to an increased incidence of adverse events compared to the controls, including events related to joints and/or surrounding tissues. The rates of these events in pediatric patients with complicated urinary tract infection and pyelonephritis within six weeks of follow-up were 9.3% (31/335) versus 6% (21/349) for control agents. The rates of these events occurring at any time up to the one year follow-up were 13.7% (46/335) and 9.5% (33/349), respectively. The rate of all adverse events regardless of drug relationship at six weeks was 41% (138/335) in the ciprofloxacin arm compared to 31% (109/349) in the control arm (see ADVERSE REACTIONS and CLINICAL STUDIES).

Recommendation strength and interpretation using GRADE — All recommendations follow GRADE and are either strong or weak. Recommendations are strong when there is moderate- or high-quality evidence that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences for a course of action, and they may also be strong when there is high-quality evidence of harm and benefits are uncertain (ie, low or very low quality). Table 2 provides the suggested interpretation of strong and weak recommendations for patients, clinicians, and healthcare policy makers: for strong recommendations, all or almost all individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, all or almost all individuals should receive the intervention, and the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations with adherence usable as a quality criterion or performance indicator; for weak (conditional) recommendations, most individuals would probably want the suggested course of action but many would not, clinicians should recognize that fully informed individuals might reasonably choose different courses of action and a shared decision-making process is typically useful to align with values and preferences, and policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis [^116D2UjH]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are the most common bacterial infections in women. Most urinary tract infections are acute uncomplicated cystitis. Identifiers of acute uncomplicated cystitis are frequency and dysuria in an immunocompetent woman of childbearing age who has no comorbidities or urologic abnormalities. Physical examination is typically normal or positive for suprapubic tenderness. A urinalysis, but not urine culture, is recommended in making the diagnosis. Guidelines recommend three options for first-line treatment of acute uncomplicated cystitis: fosfomycin, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (in regions where the prevalence of Escherichia coli resistance does not exceed 20 percent). Beta-lactam antibiotics, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefaclor, cefdinir, and cefpodoxime are not recommended for initial treatment because of concerns about resistance. Urine cultures are recommended in women with suspected pyelonephritis, women with symptoms that do not resolve or that recur within two to four weeks after completing treatment, and women who present with atypical symptoms.
