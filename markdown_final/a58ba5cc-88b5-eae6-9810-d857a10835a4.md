## Question

Anticoagulants option for liver chirosis with variais

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about anticoagulation options for liver cirrhosis with varices. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why anticoagulation is being considered. Then, I should verify the hemostatic paradox in cirrhosis and how it changes risk assessment. Next, I will review the strength of evidence for anticoagulation in portal vein thrombosis and whether it increases bleeding. After that, I need to check variceal bleeding prophylaxis strategies and whether anticoagulation should be delayed. Then, I will examine anticoagulant choices by Child-Pugh class, including DOACs, VKAs, and LMWH, and confirm dosing and monitoring nuances. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm and highlight special scenarios like active bleeding, transplant candidacy, and thrombocytopenia, making sure each assertion is supported by guidelines or meta-analyses.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. In cirrhosis, anticoagulation is most often considered for portal vein thrombosis, which occurs in roughly 10–20% of patients and is associated with worse outcomes, and for atrial fibrillation, where stroke risk is elevated despite coagulopathy on paper, so I need to ensure I'm framing recommendations around these indications rather than anticoagulation in isolation [^3c9a4613] [^a8f1612f].

> Wait, let me verify the hemostatic paradox before jumping to bleeding risk. Cirrhosis produces both pro- and antihemostatic defects, yielding a rebalanced but fragile system; importantly, thrombocytopenia and INR prolongation do not reliably predict bleeding, and patients with cirrhosis still experience clinically meaningful thrombosis, including PVT and stroke, which means I should not withhold indicated anticoagulation solely based on abnormal coagulation labs [^947b4c25] [^a8f1612f].

> Next, I should review the evidence base for anticoagulation in PVT. Multiple meta-analyses show anticoagulation roughly doubles recanalization rates and reduces progression of thrombosis without increasing overall bleeding, and some analyses even suggest fewer variceal bleeds with anticoagulation, likely via improved portal flow and reduced portal pressure; this is the crux of why guidelines now support treating PVT when present [^298d8a2c] [^fc2a7fad] [^bfc8c098].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about timing. I initially thought anticoagulation should be delayed until varices are eradicated, but I should double-check that. Contemporary guidance advises not to delay anticoagulation for PVT; instead, initiate anticoagulation promptly and address variceal prophylaxis in parallel, because delays reduce recanalization rates and endoscopic band ligation can be performed safely without stopping anticoagulation in most cases [^0bcb41e0] [^9300d4c3] [^be86d390].

> I will now examine variceal bleeding prophylaxis. For patients with medium/large varices or high-risk features, nonselective beta-blockers are first-line, with endoscopic variceal ligation as an alternative or adjunct when beta-blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated; importantly, anticoagulation itself has not been shown to increase variceal bleeding when standard prophylaxis is in place, so I should ensure prophylaxis is optimized rather than withholding anticoagulation [^71a0a3eb] [^61858931] [^1ed837f5].

> Let me think about anticoagulant selection by liver function. For Child-Pugh A, DOACs are reasonable and may offer higher recanalization rates than VKAs, with the advantage of fixed dosing and no INR monitoring; for Child-Pugh B, DOACs can be considered with caution and close monitoring; for Child-Pugh C, DOACs are generally avoided and LMWH or VKA may be preferred with specialist input, given limited safety data and higher bleeding risk in advanced disease [^7584a2b0] [^716f61e0] [^2b093e14].

> I should confirm practical choices and dosing. LMWH is often used initially for acute PVT or when rapid onset is needed, with transition to an oral agent; VKAs are acceptable but INR monitoring is unreliable in cirrhosis, so if used, a lower INR target around 1.8–2.2 may be reasonable in high bleeding risk settings; DOACs such as apixaban or rivaroxaban are increasingly used in compensated cirrhosis, with attention to renal function and drug–drug interactions, and with awareness that reversal agents exist for life-threatening bleeding though access varies [^716f61e0] [^48ff94ca] [^4d31e644].

> But wait, what if platelets are very low or there is active bleeding. I need to ensure individualized risk–benefit assessment; thrombocytopenia alone is not an absolute contraindication, but platelets below about 50,000 increase bleeding risk and may warrant closer surveillance or adjunctive measures; in active variceal hemorrhage, stabilize first with vasoactive therapy, antibiotics, and endoscopic hemostasis, then consider anticoagulation once hemostasis is secure and prophylaxis is optimized [^716f61e0] [^e17e7416].

> Next, I should review duration and monitoring. For acute PVT, treat for at least 6 months and continue until recanalization or transplant; for chronic PVT or persistent risk factors, indefinite anticoagulation is reasonable, especially in transplant candidates; repeat cross-sectional imaging every 3 months to assess recanalization is prudent, and if there is no response by 6 months, consider switching agent class or pursuing TIPS in selected patients [^a612f904] [^5c11bfa0] [^016dc2e9].

> Let me synthesize a stepwise approach. First, confirm the indication for anticoagulation, typically PVT or AF. Second, stage cirrhosis and assess renal function to guide agent selection. Third, screen for varices and initiate beta-blockers and/or band ligation without delaying anticoagulation. Fourth, start anticoagulation promptly, favoring DOACs in Child-Pugh A/B and LMWH or VKA in Child-Pugh C or when DOACs are contraindicated. Fifth, monitor for bleeding and reassess at 3-month intervals with imaging until recanalization or transplant [^0bcb41e0] [^7584a2b0] [^a612f904].

> Finally, I should confirm special scenarios. In transplant candidates, maintain anticoagulation until transplantation given high recurrence risk. In patients with extensive mesenteric extension or symptomatic ischemia, urgent anticoagulation is indicated. And in those with recurrent thrombosis despite therapy, evaluate for thrombophilia and consider switching anticoagulant class or pursuing interventional options such as TIPS in expert centers [^1ccc0021] [^67c78967] [^716f61e0].

In cirrhosis with varices, **anticoagulation is indicated for portal vein thrombosis** [^657f08f2] and other thrombotic events, but **variceal bleeding risk must be mitigated first** with nonselective beta-blockers and/or endoscopic band ligation [^71a0a3eb] [^1ed837f5]. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are **preferred in Child-Pugh A/B** [^7584a2b0] due to higher recanalization and convenience [^b988a9b2], whereas low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or warfarin are alternatives for Child-Pugh C or when DOACs are contraindicated [^716f61e0]. Anticoagulation should not be delayed once variceal prophylaxis is in place, as it improves recanalization and does not increase variceal bleeding when combined with prophylaxis [^0bcb41e0] [^fc2a7fad].

---

## Indications for anticoagulation in cirrhosis with varices

Anticoagulation is indicated in cirrhosis with varices for the following scenarios:

- **Portal vein thrombosis (PVT)**: Acute or chronic PVT, especially in transplant candidates or those with symptomatic thrombosis [^657f08f2] [^166d12a6].

- **Other venous thromboembolism (VTE)**: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) [^2b093e14].

- **Atrial fibrillation (AF)**: Stroke prevention in patients with AF and cirrhosis [^a8f1612f].

---

## Risks and benefits of anticoagulation

### Benefits

Benefits include **recanalization of portal vein thrombosis**, with anticoagulation significantly increasing recanalization rates compared to no treatment (65.2% vs 25.2%) [^fc2a7fad] [^298d8a2c]. Anticoagulation also reduces progression of thrombosis and may lower variceal bleeding risk by decreasing portal pressure [^298d8a2c] [^2be2718c].

---

### Risks

The primary risk is **variceal bleeding**, which can be life-threatening; however, with appropriate prophylaxis, this risk is manageable [^71a0a3eb] [^1ed837f5]. Non-variceal bleeding may also occur but is generally less severe [^8c3d8e42].

---

## Anticoagulant options and recommendations

| **Anticoagulant** | **Recommendation** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) | Preferred in Child-Pugh A/B | - Higher recanalization rates [^7584a2b0] [^b988a9b2] <br/> - Convenient dosing <br/> - No INR monitoring [^657f08f2] |
| Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) | Alternative, especially in Child-Pugh C or renal impairment | - Safe and effective [^716f61e0] [^d873a85f] <br/> - Requires subcutaneous injection [^d873a85f] |
| Warfarin | Alternative when DOACs are contraindicated | - Effective but requires INR monitoring [^716f61e0] <br/> - INR unreliable in cirrhosis [^947b4c25] |

---

## Management of variceal bleeding risk

Before initiating anticoagulation, **variceal bleeding risk must be addressed**:

- **Nonselective beta-blockers (NSBB)**: First-line for primary prophylaxis in patients with medium/large varices [^1ed837f5] [^71a0a3eb].

- **Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL)**: Alternative or adjunctive therapy, especially if NSBB are contraindicated or not tolerated [^1ed837f5] [^71a0a3eb].

- **Timing**: Anticoagulation should not be delayed once variceal prophylaxis is in place, as early initiation improves recanalization [^0bcb41e0] [^9300d4c3].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring is essential to ensure safety and efficacy:

- **Imaging**: Cross-sectional imaging every 3 months to assess recanalization and thrombus progression [^a612f904].

- **Endoscopy**: Surveillance endoscopy every 6–12 months to monitor varices and perform banding as needed [^ff5ba70e].

- **Laboratory tests**: Periodic assessment of liver function, renal function, and platelet count [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Child-Pugh C cirrhosis**: DOACs are generally contraindicated; use LMWH or warfarin with caution and close monitoring [^7584a2b0] [^716f61e0].

- **Renal impairment**: Adjust dosing for LMWH and DOACs as indicated [^716f61e0].

- **Active bleeding**: Temporarily discontinue anticoagulation and manage bleeding aggressively [^e17e7416].

---

Anticoagulation in cirrhosis with varices is indicated for PVT and other thrombotic events, but **variceal bleeding risk must be mitigated first** with NSBB and/or EVL. DOACs are preferred in Child-Pugh A/B, with LMWH or warfarin as alternatives in Child-Pugh C or when DOACs are contraindicated. Regular monitoring and individualized decision-making are essential to balance efficacy and safety [^657f08f2] [^7584a2b0].

Purpose Of Review

This article aims to review the latest literature on prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation and the safety profile of anticoagulants in patients with cirrhosis.

Recent Findings

The understanding of hematological hemostasis is cirrhotic patients has changed drastically in recent years. Although in the past, cirrhotic patients were often considered to be 'auto-anticoagulated' and at higher risk of bleeding, recent studies have demonstrated that there may be a rebalance in procoagulation and anticoagulation factors in patients with cirrhosis. This, and clinical experience, suggest that cirrhotic patients are at risk of development of venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and ischemic strokes and as such, the best management approaches in these patients remains controversial. The bulk of the data suggest that patients with cirrhosis who are at risk for thrombotic or embolic complications should be anticoagulated. However, it is imperative that they be closely monitored.

Summary

The medical literature on anticoagulation in patients with liver cirrhosis is conflicting and limited to small sample observational studies. However, most studies suggest that in patients with early stages of liver cirrhosis and no history of varices, anticoagulation appears to be well tolerated.

Materials and methods

Data sources and search strategy

We performed a comprehensive search for published studies indexed in PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to August 2019. We also performed a manual search for additional relevant studies using references of the included articles. The following were the main search terms: (“portal vein thrombosis” or “portal venous thrombosis”) and (“liver cirrhosis” or “hepatic cirrhosis”) and (“anticoagulation” or “anticoagulant”).describes the full search term used in PubMed. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement guidelines to select the final studies. Two investigators (SG and AB) independently performed the search and shortlisted the studies for final review. Discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer (KA). We assessed the quality of the included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

We included all available randomized controlled trials and cohort studies. Both full texts and abstracts were considered for the purpose of the manuscript. We excluded studies that included non-cirrhotic patients or malignant PVT. We also excluded single-arm studies, case reports, editorials, review articles, letters, guidelines and animal studies. No language limitation was applied.

Data extraction

The following data were extracted from the studies: study characteristics (author, publication year, study type, study design, and study population), type of anticoagulant used, number of patients in the anticoagulation group and control group, number of patients in whom PV recanalization was achieved (either partial or complete recanalization), and number of patients who developed bleeding (either variceal bleeding or any bleeding).

Outcomes assessed

The primary outcome assessed in our meta-analysis was the efficacy of anticoagulation in achieving PV recanalization. Our secondary outcomes were the occurrence of variceal bleeding and any bleeding events.

### Treatment response and bleeding events associated with anticoagulant therapy of portal vein thrombosis in cirrhotic patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^8c3d8e42]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

The pooled rate of bleeding with anticoagulation was 7.8%: 7.2% with LMWH, 9.3% with VKA, and 7.9% with DOAC. Our analysis demonstrated comparable rates of life-threatening bleeding events with LMWH, VKA, and DOAC. The majority of reported bleeding events, especially variceal, were located in the gastrointestinal tract. Patients with high-grade varices were typically banded before anticoagulation therapy and treatment was typically delayed by 15 days. Variceal bleed with any anticoagulation, especially a DOAC, can be potentially life-threatening. The pooled rate of bleeding in the control group was 15.4%.

Although, the United States Food and Drug Administration has approved novel antidotes for DOAC, they are not widely available for use, especially in resource-limited settings, because of cost issues. LMWH and/or VKA may be a safer option in patients with severe varices, given the readily available antidotes. In the studies analyzed, no bleeding-related deaths were reported. Based on our meta-regression analysis, Child-Pugh classification for the severity of cirrhosis did not seem to influence the measured outcomes. Currently, DOAC are not recommended for use in Child-Pugh C cirrhosis.

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^7ddaf726]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Coagulation in cirrhosis—portal vein thrombosis (PVT) anticoagulation strategy, monitoring, and variceal prophylaxis are outlined as follows: In acute PVT with uncertain bleeding risk, heparin infusion may be used in hospital then transitioned to low‑molecular‑weight heparin or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) for compensated cirrhosis, and Warfarin should be avoided when possible. Anticoagulation may reduce PVT volume as early as 2 weeks on therapy; in a systematic review/meta-analysis, treatment ranged from 3 to 12 months with outcomes of 71% achieved at least partial recanalization and 53% had complete recanalization after approximately 6 months of treatment. Consequently, repeat imaging at 6 months is appropriate and if clot resolution is incomplete after therapeutic anticoagulation of at least 6 months’ duration, treatment options include prolonging therapy, switching anticoagulant class, or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting. Patients with PVT should be assessed for varices and managed with nonselective β-blockers and endoscopic variceal ligation; studies reported significantly lower variceal bleeding with anticoagulation (odds ratio, 0.23), and primary prophylaxis while on therapeutic anticoagulation seems ideally with non-selective β-blockade.

### Portal vein thrombosis in cirrhosis: diagnosis, natural history, and therapeutic challenges [^94fba4f4]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Hepatologists face dilemmas in clinical practice concerning the management of cirrhotic patients with PVT. To treat or not to treat with anticoagulant agents, what is the least hazardous treatment option in PVT, or the optimal dose, and for how long should it be administered, taking into consideration the bleeding risk in patients with clinically significant portal hypertension? All these questions become more critical in patients awaiting transplantation. Definitive answers concerning the impact of PVT and its prognostic effect on cirrhosis outcome are still needed.

Conclusion

Despite a lack of agreement on whether AC is an appropriate treatment for PVT in cirrhosis, anticoagulation could be considered in patients with LC and PVT who: (1) are candidates for LT, (2) are waiting for invasive procedures (3) have a PVT extended to SMV, (4) develop acute symptoms of hepatic decompensation (regardless if partial or complete PVT) and (5) have thrombophilia (Figure 1).

Figure 1. 
Evaluation and management of patients with incident PVT.

PVT, portal vein thrombosis.

However, effort should be made to identify and remove modifiable risk factors for bleeding before the initiation of anticoagulation, such as the presence of esophageal or gastric varices.

In addition, to these specific situations, a still challenging scenario is represented by patients presenting with partial, asymptomatic PVT, considering that a significant proportion of patients with partial PVT shows a spontaneous resolution even in absence of anticoagulation.Thus, nearly 40% of patients with LC may have a ‘transient PVT’ with a spontaneous resolution without anticoagulant treatment; however, two studies reported a prevalence of recurrent PVT after spontaneous recanalization ranging from 21.3% to 45%.Studies investigating risk factors for recurrent PVT are therefore needed.

In the absence of guidelines regarding this specific setting, a diagnostic-therapeutic algorithm is proposed (Figure 1). Otherwise, as trials which investigated the impact of low or full doses of anticoagulants are still lacking, it could be arguable a short-term follow up to assess if PVT progresses or less; in case of PVT progression the use of anticoagulation could be considered.

In conclusion, the use of anticoagulants (mostly LMWHs) for the treatment of PVT in patients with LC seems to be well tolerated and effective but larger prospective studies are needed to further identify patient candidates for anticoagulation.

### Anticoagulation therapy in patients with liver cirrhosis is associated with an increased risk of variceal hemorrhage [^1a6d38d2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The belief that cirrhotic patients are "auto-anticoagulated" often results in anticoagulation therapy being withheld in these patients. We aimed to understand patterns of use of anticoagulation and to determine the risk of bleeding complications in cirrhotic patients.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed 320 cirrhotic patients treated with anticoagulation therapy from July 15, 2014 to January 30, 2018. We performed bivariate and multivariate analyses to identify risk factors for clinically relevant bleeding. We conducted a separate analysis using propensity score matching to compare bleeding rates of a noncirrhotic cohort group on anticoagulation to anticoagulated patients with cirrhosis.

Results

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (47%) was the most common cause of cirrhosis, and 49% were classified as Child-Pugh class B, a mean model for end-stage liver disease score of 14 and Charlson comorbidity index of 7. Anticoagulation was initiated for atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter in 56% of patients; warfarin was used in 57% of patients and concomitant use of antiplatelet therapy in 25%. Bleeding occurred in 18%, with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (53%) being the most common source. In the propensity-matched cohort, bleeding rates were higher in cirrhotics than in control patients who were matched for baseline characteristics. In multivariate analysis of the cirrhotic patients, the presence of esophageal varices was associated with higher odds of clinically relevant bleeding.

Conclusion

Anticoagulated cirrhotic patients who have esophageal varices are at an increased risk of bleeding. We recommend that patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices who require anticoagulation have their varices managed carefully prior to initiation of anticoagulation.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) without cirrhosis—traditional anticoagulants: In a 2010 prospective trial of 95 consecutive patients, anticoagulation achieved complete recanalization in 38% and thrombosis progressed in 6%, with 9 patients developing bleeding on therapy; given portal hypertension risk, current recommendations suggest endoscopic evaluation to assess and risk‑stratify gastroesophageal varices when initiating anticoagulation, and registry analyses indicate higher morbidity and mortality from thrombotic events in noncirrhotic PVT while overall bleeding risk from anticoagulation is low.

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^2b093e14]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD Practice Guidance—venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment in cirrhosis: Patients with cirrhosis demonstrate increased risk of VTE, with rates of pVT estimated at 8% per year in those awaiting LT. Improved outcomes have been reported in patients with cirrhosis with VTE anticoagulated at 1 year, and a systematic review showed a significantly higher proportion of anticoagulant treated versus untreated patients experienced PVT recanalization (71% vs. 42%; p < 0.0001) with no difference in any type of bleeding but a lower risk of variceal bleeding (p = 0.04). Despite decreased anti-thrombin III levels, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is favored. Direct-acting anticoagulants (DOACs) have been successfully used in compensated cirrhosis and are superior to coumadin for treatment of PVT; however, DOACs are contraindicated in patients with Child–Turcotte–Pugh Class C cirrhosis and therefore should be avoided in critically ill patients with cirrhosis.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in cirrhosis—variceal screening and timing of anticoagulation: Best Practice Advice 8 states, “Patients with cirrhosis and PVT warrant endoscopic variceal screening if they are not already on nonselective beta-blocker therapy for bleeding prophylaxis. Avoid delays in the initiation of anticoagulation for PVT, as this decreases the odds of portal vein recanalization.” Observational data show that initiation of anticoagulation within 6 months correlated with recanalization (relative risk, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.2–9.4; P = .004), and initiation within 2 weeks was associated with improved recanalization vs beyond 2 weeks. Meta-analyses including more than 800 patients suggest anticoagulation does not increase the risk of portal hypertensive bleeding, and a retrospective series reported a post-ligation bleeding rate of 9% on anticoagulation, comparable to rates without anticoagulation.

### British society of gastroenterology best practice guidance: outpatient management of cirrhosis-part 3: special circumstances [^716f61e0]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation has been found to be safe and effective. The risk of bleeding is highest in patients with platelet count <50, so anticoagulation in these patients should be considered on a case-by-case basis.In patients with GOV, beta blockers or variceal band ligation should be initiated prior to starting anticoagulation.

Treatment is initiated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), dosed by weight. Caution is required in renal impairment and dose adjustments may be required. LMWH or warfarin with a target INR of 2–3 can be used for maintenance, although INR is difficult to interpret in patients with cirrhosis. While data are limited for direct oral anticoagulants, evidence suggests they are safe in Child-Pugh A cirrhosis, and they have the advantage of being much easier to use. Due to the risk of accumulation, they should be used with caution in Child-Pugh B cirrhosis, and they are currently not recommended in patients with Child-Pugh C disease outside clinical trials.

Anticoagulation should be given for at least 6 months, and until the clot has resolved, or until transplant. Long-term anticoagulation can be considered in patients where risk of recurrence outweighs bleeding risk, including patients with underlying thrombophilic conditions, recurrent thromboses, and those with extension into the SMV.

In the case of progressive PVT despite anticoagulation, concordance and therapeutic drug monitoring should optimised in the first instance. A change in dose/therapeutic range (eg, aiming for higher INR) or alternative anticoagulants can be considered with specialist input from haematology. Interventional radiology/TIPSSand surgery can also be considered, particularly in transplant candidates or in patients with acute symptomatic PVT or ischaemia.

### Portal hypertensive bleeding in cirrhosis: risk stratification, diagnosis, and management: 2016 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^bd79751d]. Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to prevention of variceal hemorrhage, primary prevention, AASLD 2017 guidelines recommend to initiate nonselective β-blockers for the prevention of first variceal hemorrhage in patients with small varices at high risk of bleeding (red wale sign or red spot).

### Direct oral anticoagulants (rivaroxaban and apixaban) in... [^d873a85f]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

The most studied and used anticoagulants for patients with liver cirrhosis so far have been low molecular weight heparins and warfarin. LMWH are safe and effective in cirrhotic patients, reduce the risk of portal vein thrombosis and liver decompensation and improve liver function and Child-Pugh score as well as overall survival. On the other side, VKA treatment is challenging in patients with liver disease as warfarin has high plasma protein binding and is predominantly eliminated by the liver through a cytochrome P450-dependent metabolism, and INR at baseline is often elevated. Thus, the dose of warfarin and the target International Normalized Ratio are not well defined in this population. Both of them, LMWH and VKA, have some important drawbacks. On one hand, the LMWH require a daily subcutaneous injection. On the other hand, the orally ingested VKA need monitoring of the INR value.

The measurement of the INR value in patients with liver cirrhosis is inadequate to guide anticoagulation as the INR value is altered in association with liver cirrhosis. Because of the enumerated reasons above, it might be desirable to use direct oral anticoagulants in patients with liver cirrhosis. DOAC do not need routine INR monitoring and can be taken orally at a fixed dose and hence do not need injection. Furthermore, DOAC have a quicker onset of action than Warfarin and show a lower risk of bleeding. As it stands now, studies say it is reasonable to consider DOAC as an alternative in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis. According to them, DOAC appear to be as safe and efficacious as traditional anticoagulants in patients with compensated cirrhosis, provided that liver function is within Child-Pugh stages A or B.

However, randomized trials are necessary to investigate the safety and efficacy of DOAC in more detail, especially to establish future guidelines of their use in cirrhosis. The concerns about the use of DOAC in cirrhotic patients arise due to multiple reasons. One important point is that patients with liver cirrhosis show haemostatic alterations, which affect pro- and anticoagulant state. Affected from the haemostatic alterations are primary haemostasis, coagulation and fibrinolysis.

### Efficacy and safety of anticoagulation in non-malignant portal vein thrombosis in patients with liver cirrhosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b887496f]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Liver cirrhosis is a clinical condition traditionally associated with bleeding risk (i.e. coagulopathy). This is due to multiple mechanisms, including prolonged bleeding time, increased prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, decreased liver synthesis of clotting factors, thrombocytopenia, and hypofibrinolytic status. In addition, liver cirrhosis is frequently complicated by esophageal varices, which further increases the risk of bleeding. However, patients with liver cirrhosis are also at a high risk for venous thrombosis, especially portal vein (PV) thrombosis (PVT). Decreased levels of anticoagulant factors (protein C, protein S, and plasminogen), endothelial activation, disruption of the endothelial glycocalyx, and the generation of procoagulant microparticles all contribute to a prothrombotic status in cirrhotic patients. Ultimately, the hemostatic balance in cirrhotic patients is fragile and may easily tend towards either a hypo- or a hypercoagulable status.

PVT is a frequent complication of liver cirrhosis, especially at the advanced stages. Non-malignant PVT develops in 0.6-26% of patients with liver cirrhosis, depending on the severity of the cirrhosis, and the occurrence increases with cirrhosis progression. Decreased PV velocity is determined to be the most important factor for development of PVT in patients with liver cirrhosis. Anticoagulation has shown a proven benefit in the treatment of PVT in non-cirrhotic patients. However, the role of anticoagulation in treating PVT in the setting of liver cirrhosis remains unclear because of the presumably greater risk of bleeding in cirrhotic patients.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all published studies investigating the outcomes of anticoagulation in non-malignant PVT in cirrhotic patients compared with the outcomes of those who did not receive anticoagulation. The outcomes assessed were the efficacy of anticoagulation in achieving PV recanalization and the occurrence of variceal and any bleeding events.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to prevention of variceal hemorrhage, primary prevention, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to initiate nonselective β-blockers or perform endoscopic band ligation in patients with medium-large varices. Consider choosing treatment based on local resources and expertise, patient preference, contraindications, and adverse events.
Consider preferring nonselective β-blockers because, in addition to lowering portal pressure, they also exert other potentially beneficial effects.

### A major research gap: the use of anticoagulants in cirrhosis [^0dfdbc07]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Historically, anticoagulants were contraindicated in patients with cirrhosis owing to concerns about bleeding risks. However, recent studies have shown that patients with cirrhosis are not naturally anticoagulated and are at increased risk of prothrombotic events, such as portal venous thrombosis. In this article, we review preclinical and clinical data on the effects of anticoagulants in cirrhosis, including their potential benefits in reducing liver fibrosis, portal hypertension, and improving survival. Despite promising preclinical evidence, clinical translation has proven challenging. Nevertheless, we discuss the use of anticoagulation in specific clinical scenarios, such as patients with atrial fibrillation and portal vein thrombosis, and highlight the need for further research, including randomised-controlled trials, to determine the optimal role of anticoagulants in the management of patients with cirrhosis.

### Variations in practice among cirrhotic patients with portal vein thrombosis and esophageal varices: a north American survey study [^9476edaf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There exists variation regarding the approach to anticoagulation and variceal hemorrhage (VH) prophylaxis among patients with cirrhosis and portal vein thrombosis (PVT).

Methods

A survey was distributed to gastroenterology and hepatology providers to assess the approach to anticoagulation and VH prophylaxis among patients with PVT in cirrhotic patients.

Results

Providers were more likely to start anticoagulation if the patient was listed for liver transplantation, was symptomatic, or had superior mesenteric vein thrombosis. For prevention of first VH, many providers opt for combination therapy with both nonselective beta blockers and variceal ligation.

Discussion

Although providers agree on the clinical scenarios that merit initiation of anticoagulation, practice variation was identified in the means of preventing first VH.

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^3e45ba34]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Description

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. The intent is to evaluate the current data on mechanism of altered coagulation in patients with cirrhosis, provide guidance on the use of currently available testing of the coagulation cascade, and help practitioners use anticoagulation and pro-coagulants appropriately in patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

This review is framed around the best practice points, which were derived from the most impactful publications in the area of coagulation in cirrhosis and agreed to by all authors. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Global tests of clot formation, such as rotational thromboelastometry, thromboelastography, sonorheometry, and thrombin generation, may eventually have a role in the evaluation of clotting in patients with cirrhosis, but currently lack validated target levels. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: In general, clinicians should not routinely correct thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy before low-risk therapeutic paracentesis, thoracentesis, and routine upper endoscopy for variceal ligation in patients with hepatic synthetic dysfunction-induced coagulation abnormalities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Blood products should be used sparingly because they increase portal pressure and carry a risk of transfusion-associated circulatory overload, transfusion-related acute lung injury, infection transmission, alloimmunization, and/or transfusion reactions. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: The following transfusion thresholds for management of active bleeding or high-risk procedures may optimize clot formation in advanced liver disease: hematocrit ≥25%, platelet count >50,000, and fibrinogen >120 mg/dL. Commonly utilized thresholds for international normalized ratio correction are not supported by evidence. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Thrombopoietin agonists are a good alternative to platelet transfusion, but require time (about 10 days) to elevate platelet levels. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: The large volume of fresh frozen plasma required to reach an arbitrary international normalized ratio target, limitations of the usual target, minimal effect on thrombin generation, and adverse effects on portal pressure limit the utility of this agent significantly. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: The 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate contains both pro- and anticoagulant factors that offer an attractive low-volume therapeutic to rebalance a disturbed hemostatic system. However, dosage is, in part, based on international normalized ratio, which is problematic in cirrhosis, and published experience in liver disease is limited. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Anti-fibrinolytic therapy may be considered in patients with persistent bleeding from mucosal oozing or puncture wound bleeding consistent with impaired clot integrity. Both ε-aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid inhibit clot dissolution. Neither is believed to generate a hypercoagulable state, although both may exacerbate pre-existing thrombi. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Desmopressin releases von Willebrand factor as its primary hemostatic mechanism. As this factor is usually elevated in cirrhosis, the agent lacks a sound evidence-based foundation, but may be useful in patients with concomitant renal failure. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Systemic heparin infusion is recommended for symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and portal and mesenteric vein thrombosis, but there are unresolved issues regarding monitoring with both the anti-Xa assay and the partial thromboplastin time due to cirrhosis-related antithrombin deficiency (heparin cofactor). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Treatment of incidental portal and mesenteric vein thrombosis depends on estimated impact on transplantation surgical complexity vs risks of bleeding and falls. Therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin, vitamin K antagonists, and direct-acting anticoagulants improve portal vein repermeation vs observation alone. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Direct-acting anticoagulants, such as the factor Xa and thrombin inhibitors, are relatively safe and effective in stable cirrhotic patients, but are in need of further study in patients with more advanced liver disease.

### Anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation and liver cirrhosis [^a8f1612f]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation and liver cirrhosis

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been the main antithrombotic therapy in AF, and the international normalized ratio (INR) is used to monitor their therapeutic range. During the past few years, direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have emerged as the optimal evidence-based treatment for non-valvular AF. However, patients with liver cirrhosis were characteristically excluded from the pivotal trials of these drugs because of the assumed impaired hemostasis in this population.

Anticoagulation in patients with AF and liver cirrhosis constitutes a significant challenge. Liver cirrhosis is characterized by several fundamental changes in pro- and anti-hemostatic pathways—some favor bleeding and others favor clotting, leading to a re-balanced hemostatic equilibrium. Moreover, thrombocytopenia due to splenic sequestration, decreased thrombopoietin levels, platelet dysfunction, impaired drug metabolism, defective protein synthesis for protein-bound drugs, and the presence of gastroesophageal varices further complicate this fragile hemostatic state. Although routine diagnostic tests of hemostasis, such as INR prolongation, suggest a hypocoagulable state, patients with liver disease also tend to develop thrombotic events [-]. In a large retrospective cohort study based on Taiwan’s nationwide health insurance database, Lai et al demonstrated that chronic liver diseases, including hepatoma, cirrhosis and viral hepatitis, are not only associated with a greater bleeding risk, as previously thought, but are also predictors for ischemic cerebrovascular events, stroke and stroke equivalents. Thus, AF and liver disease patients have an increased risk of ischemic cerebrovascular events.

Data concerning the initiation of antithrombotic treatment in this population are limited, and there is still no evidence-based management. Therefore, this review article aims to examine evidence for the safety and efficacy of antithrombotic drugs in patients with AF and liver cirrhosis and to propose potential therapeutic strategies.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) versus vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for PVT in cirrhosis—efficacy and Child–Turcotte–Pugh (CTP)–based use: A meta-analysis of 11 studies in patients with cirrhosis confirmed higher PVT recanalization in the DOAC group (87% vs 44%; relative risk, 1.67, 95% CI, 1.02–2.74), with no difference in variceal bleeding or death between groups. DOACs can be used safely in patients with CTP class A and with caution in CTP class B cirrhosis or creatinine clearance <30 mL/min; but are not advised in CTP class C. DOACs (mainly rivaroxaban) are associated with a small risk of hepatotoxicity and can be counteracted by reversal agents, albeit with thrombosis risk.

### How to manage splanchnic vein thrombosis in patients with liver disease [^54dc7cea]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Liver cirrhosis and splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) are strictly correlated. Portal vein thrombosis, the most common location of SVT, is frequently diagnosed in liver cirrhosis (pooled incidence 4.6 per 100 patient-years), and liver cirrhosis is a common risk factor for SVT (reported in 24%-28% of SVT patients). In cirrhosis-associated SVT, anticoagulant treatment reduces mortality rates, thrombosis extension, and major bleeding, and increases the rates of recanalization, compared to no treatment. Achieving vessel recanalization improves the prognosis of cirrhotic patients by reducing liver-related complications (such as variceal bleeding, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy). Anticoagulation should be therefore routinely prescribed to cirrhotic patients with acute SVT unless contraindicated by active bleeding associated with hemodynamic impairment or by excessively high bleeding risk. Of note, early treatment is associated with higher probability of achieving vessel recanalization. The standard treatment consists of low-molecular-weight heparin, followed by oral anticoagulants (eg, vitamin K antagonists or direct oral anticoagulants), if not contraindicated by severe liver dysfunction. Cirrhotic patients with SVT should be treated long-term (especially if candidate for liver transplantation) since liver cirrhosis is a persistent risk factor for recurrent thrombosis. In this review, we discuss the management of SVT in patients with liver cirrhosis, with a focus on the anticoagulant treatment in terms of indications, timing, drugs, duration, and particular scenarios, such as gastroesophageal varices and thrombocytopenia.

### Challenging anticoagulation cases: acute extensive portal vein thrombosis in a patient without cirrhosis-evidence-based management of a rare clinical entity [^7017bb5e]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute non-cirrhotic and non-malignant portal vein thrombosis (aPVT) is a rare and heterogenous condition. Current guidelines recommend early initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation to prevent extension of thrombosis, and favor recanalization. Although not formally defined, a poor outcome in the acute setting would include thrombosis extension with progression to intestinal infarction. Patients are also at risk of negative long-term outcomes related to complications of portal hypertension, such as variceal bleeding, ascites, and portal cholangiopathy. Identifying patients at risk of these events despite early initiation of anticoagulation remains challenging. Trials comparing treatment strategies in those failing standard therapy with meaningful radiological and clinical endpoints, whether in the short or long term, are desperately needed. The objective of this review will be to discuss a real-life clinical case and propose a treatment approach for aPVT based on the available evidence. We will mainly focus on management strategies including anticoagulation, prognostic factors, and options beyond anticoagulation, such as thrombolysis, thrombectomy, and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts. This review will not cover tumor portal vein thrombosis or thrombosis associated with cirrhosis.

### Anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation and liver cirrhosis [^4d31e644]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Safety

Direct-acting reversal agents exist for both factor Xa inhibitors (andexanet alfa) and factor IIa inhibitors (idarucizumab) for life-threatening bleeding. Although DOAC-induced hepatotoxicity is unusual, recent data raised some concerns about the risk of rivaroxaban-induced liver injury. These findings further led the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to review a post-market report, which demonstrated a disproportionate risk for drug-induced liver injury in DOAC patients receiving rivaroxaban, compared to dabigatran and apixaban. Although data from large prospective studies are lacking, in a recent meta-analysis including patients with AF and liver cirrhosis, DOACs reduced the risks of major bleeding (relative risk [RR] 0.53, 95%CI 0.37-0.76), gastrointestinal bleeding (RR 0.57, 95%CI 0.38-0.84), and intracranial hemorrhage (RR 0.55, 95%CI 0.31-0.97) compared to warfarin. Moreover, preliminary data from 80 patients with liver cirrhosis (52% had esophageal varices) receiving DOACs revealed that 12% of these patients experienced a major bleeding event, but no variceal bleeding occurred. In addition, those with major bleeding had an average MELD score of 22, compared to an average of 14 in patients without major bleeding.

Summary

Although data remain limited to retrospective observational database analysis, DOACs seem a promising approach in these patients, at least in compensated cirrhosis, as they indicate lower all-cause mortality than no anticoagulants, without significant major bleeding risk.

AGA clinical practice guideline on coagulation disorders in cirrhosis—background and conceptual framework states that cirrhosis is accompanied by alterations in platelet count (PLT) and prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) used to estimate clotting, but it has become clear that neither thrombocytopenia nor elevated PT/INR predicts bleeding outcomes in most patients and that the severity of coagulopathy by these parameters is not predictive of bleeding complications, including variceal hemorrhage. The text also describes that patients are at risk for thrombosis (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, splanchnic vein thrombosis, or stroke), notes clinician trepidation treating with conventional anticoagulants such as vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), and cautions that PT/INR-based strategies to estimate bleeding risk and monitor VKA endpoints may not be relevant in cirrhosis; more integrative approaches using measurements of fibrin clot formation and lysis have been tested.

### Efficacy and safety of anticoagulation in non-malignant portal vein thrombosis in patients with liver cirrhosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^fc2a7fad]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of anticoagulation in treating non-malignant portal vein (PV) thrombosis (PVT) in patients with liver cirrhosis remains unclear. In our meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation for the treatment of non-malignant PVT in these patients.

Methods

We conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the effects of anticoagulation on non-malignant PVT in patients with liver cirrhosis. We assessed the rates of PV recanalization, variceal bleeding, and any bleeding.

Results

We included 9 observational studies which involved 474 patients. The rate of PV recanalization was significantly higher in patients who received anticoagulation compared to those who did not: 65.2% vs. 25.2%; relative risk (RR) 2.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.80-2.96; P<0.00001. Variceal bleeding was significantly lower in patients who received anticoagulation: 0.1% vs. 18.5%; RR 0.15, 95%CI 0.04-0.55; P=0.004. Any bleeding was similar between patients who received anticoagulation and those who did not: 10.3% vs. 22.7%; RR 0.43, 95%CI 0.09-1.99; P=0.28.

Conclusions

Anticoagulation use increased the rate of PV recanalization in cirrhotic patients with non-malignant PVT. Anticoagulation decreased the rate of variceal bleeding and did not increase the rate of any bleeding.

### ACG clinical guideline: disorders of the hepatic and mesenteric circulation [^df38002d]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Chronic portal vein thrombosis without cirrhosis—primary variceal bleeding prophylaxis during anticoagulation and indications for anticoagulation are addressed: Retrospective studies have demonstrated a lower risk of variceal bleeding in patients with chronic PVT who receive anticoagulation and are maintained on beta-blockers, but data are scanty comparing band ligation vs beta-blockers. Based on randomized data in cirrhosis, beta-blockers are considered first choice for primary prevention of variceal bleeding and band ligation considered if patients have any contraindication to beta-blockers or do not tolerate these drugs. Accordingly, we recommend nonselective beta-blockers or repeated endoscopic variceal band ligation in patients with high-risk varices and portal and/or mesenteric vein thrombosis requiring anticoagulation, and endoscopic variceal band ligation may be interrupted in the periprocedural period (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). For chronic PVT, we suggest anticoagulation if there is evidence of inherited or acquired thrombophilia, progression of thrombus into the mesenteric veins, or current or previous evidence of bowel ischemia (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence).

### Portal vein thrombosis in liver cirrhosis: incidence, management, and outcome [^b97b2106]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Liver cirrhosis represents the end stage of chronic diseases of the liver and is associated with life-threatening complications. The natural course of cirrhosis is largely affected by various pathologies, such as variceal bleeding, ascites, and infection. The major predictors of survival of patients with liver cirrhosis are Child-Pugh score; model for end-stage liver disease score; and various biochemical parameters, such as serum bilirubin, albumin, prothrombin time or international normalized ratio, creatinine, as well as encephalopathy and ascites. Recent evidence suggests the association between portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and survival of patients with liver cirrhosis, although the data are inconclusive.

Based on the increase in the use of technically-advanced noninvasive liver imaging modalities, PVT has been increasingly identified in patients with cirrhosis, with the estimated current prevalence of PVT in patients with cirrhosis of 0.6 to 26%.

The value of anticoagulation in the treatment of PVT in patients with cirrhosis remains controversial. Cirrhosis is associated with bleeding diathesis based on the following factors: prolonged bleeding time, thrombocytopenia associated with hypersplenism, increased prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, reduced synthesis of coagulation factors, and secondary hyperfibrinolysis. More importantly, nearly half of patients with cirrhosis are diagnosed with gastroesophageal varices that can result in life-threatening bleeding events. Taken together, these detrimental conditions greatly limit the use of anticoagulants for patients with cirrhosis. However, recent evidence indicates that both pro- and anticoagulation factors are concomitantly reduced in patients with cirrhosis, thereby maintaining a balance in the coagulation system. Unfortunately, bleeding risk cannot be accurately assessed in patients with chronic liver disease by globally used coagulation tests. In addition, the occurrence of bleeding in patients with cirrhosis is not primarily dependent on hemostatic abnormalities, but on the severity of portal pressure, endothelial dysfunction, and bacterial infection. Accordingly, the use of anticoagulants for patients with cirrhosis and PVT may be theoretically justified. However, convincing clinicians to prescribe anticoagulants to cirrhotic patients, especially those with decompensated cirrhosis, remains difficult.

ACG clinical guideline—portal or mesenteric vein thrombosis without cirrhosis states “we suggest anticoagulation for patients with chronic PVT” when there is (i) inherited or acquired thrombophilia, (ii) progression into mesenteric veins, or (iii) current or previous bowel ischemia (conditional recommendation). For duration, “we suggest at least 6 months of anticoagulation” when reversible, and “indefinite anticoagulation is recommended” with thrombophilia (conditional recommendation). For variceal prophylaxis during required anticoagulation, “we recommend nonselective beta‑blockers” for high‑risk varices; endoscopic variceal ligation may be used if beta‑blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated, noting anticoagulation may need periprocedural interruption (strong recommendation). As initial agent, “we suggest either unfractionated heparin or LMWH,” weighing pros and cons (conditional recommendation). For maintenance, “we suggest either LMWH or warfarin”; experience with DOACs is limited, absorption may be reduced with intestinal edema, and laboratory checks can rule out substantial drug effect (conditional recommendation).

### Analysis of factors related to recanalization of portal vein thrombosis in liver cirrhosis: a retrospective cohort study [^04bd7c99]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation is not only a common treatment but also an essential treatment option for patients with PVT and is often required in patients with non-cirrhotic portal vein thrombosis. However, in patients with cirrhosis, there is controversy surrounding the need for anticoagulation. It was rarely implemented previously because clinicians and patients were concerned about complications such as gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The decision of anticoagulation in the patient with cirrhosis requires consideration of the risk of hemorrhage due to portal hypertension, the severity of cirrhosis, and the potential for benefit of thrombus recanalization. However, our study concluded that anticoagulation does not increase the rate of gastrointestinal bleeding, suggesting that anticoagulation is safe for patients with cirrhotic portal vein thrombosis. It could be explained by the fact that anticoagulation therapy allows recanalization of portal vein thrombus thereby reducing portal pressure, as well as the severity of esophagogastric varices, thereby reducing the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding.The ACG Clinical Guidelines stated that anticoagulation was not associated with an increased risk of variceal bleeding in patients with hepatic cirrhosis PVT. A recent randomized controlled trial by Gao et al. concluded that initiation of anticoagulation with nadroparin calcium within 48 h after EVL is safe and effective in patients with portal vein thrombosis combined with AVB, which provides guidance on the timing of initiation of anticoagulation for PVT combined with AVB.

### Portal vein thrombosis in cirrhosis: diagnosis, natural history, and therapeutic challenges [^d94dd2bd]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The effect of cirrhosis on antithrombin levels and the platelet count, in addition to the presence of renal failure or bacterial infections, should always be taken into consideration, as they may provoke an added risk for bleeding complications. According to the recent guidance published by the Anticoagulation Forum, cirrhotic patients with PVT should undergo endoscopic screening of esophageal varices and, if indicated, banding treatment should precede the LMWH treatment (either prophylactic doses or half therapeutic doses depending on the platelet count).

Recommendations for anticoagulation treatment based on the Baveno VI Consensus Workshop highlight the need for individualization of treatment. LT candidates should be on anticoagulation until transplantation to prevent re-thrombosis. If they remain untreated, an ultrasound follow up every 3 months or CT imaging every 6 months should be performed. In case of thrombosis extension, immediate use of anticoagulation is recommended. Comorbidities predisposing to prothrombotic conditions or extended PVT are among the factors that physicians should take into account, even in non-LT candidates for anticoagulation as a therapeutic option. On the other hand, according to the guidelines of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, acute PVT should be treated for at least 3 months with LMWH and switched to oral anticoagulant agents after patient stabilization. In fact, randomized controlled trials of anticoagulation thera­py for the prevention of recurrent thrombosis are lacking in cirrhotic PVT.

Several small clinical studies have assessed the impact of anticoagulation on recanalization rate and bleeding complications (Table 2). Senzolo et al have demonstrated in 56 cirrhotic patients with PVT that anticoagulation is associated with better recanalization rates and fewer portal hypertension complications. A retrospective study by Delgado et al demonstrated a 60% rate of partial or complete recanalization among 55 selected cirrhotic patients with PVT treated early with LMWH or VKA, findings in accordance with a previous study of 251 cirrhotics, candidates for LT, performed by Francoz et al. Data from a recent multicenter study including 76 cirrhotic patients with PVT, 51 of them on anticoagulation (LMWH or warfarin), confirms the low risk of life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding events. In this study survival was inferior for treated patients (median 15 months) albeit not statistically significantly (P=0.311), and PV patency was achieved in 28.5% of treated patients (P=NS).

Patients with chronic liver disease often have abnormalities in coagulation and a prolonged international normalization ratio; however, they are not protected against stroke and systemic thromboembolism associated with AF.On average, patients with hepatic impairment who receive warfarin have a lower proportion of time spent within the therapeutic range and are at increased risk for bleeding events compared with those without liver disease.A recent study based on the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database showed that those with cirrhosis treated with warfarin had a lower risk of ischemic stroke [hazard ratio (HR) 0.76, 95% CI 0.58–0.99] and no increased risk of intracranial bleeding compared with nonwarfarin users.A limited number of studies have evaluated the safety of DOACs in patients with hepatic impairment.In a retrospective cohort study of patients with chronic liver disease and AF, rates of all-cause bleeding were similar between the groups treated with DOACs and warfarin.However, in a prospective, multicenter cohort study, warfarin, but not DOACs, was associated with an increased risk for major bleeding among those with liver fibrosis; though the sample size was small.In patients with moderate hepatic impairment, as defined by the Child–Pugh category, DOACs should be used with caution and use should be limited to dabigatran and apixaban because these agents show similar bioavailability compared with controls, and no dose adjustments are needed.DOACs should be avoided in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction, defined as Child–Pugh C cirrhosis, because of bleeding concerns.

Prior studies evaluating the management of esophageal varices in patients who are receiving anticoagulation for AF are limited. The American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy considers esophageal band ligation as a high-bleeding-risk procedure.The risks of stopping anticoagulation, with or without bridging therapy, in the setting of high-bleeding-risk procedures needs to be considered for the individual patient; there is no universal agreement across various practice guidelines. Additional studies are needed to determine the utility of alternative treatment approaches, such as the use of nonselective beta blockage, and the optimal use and timing of anticoagulation in patients with cirrhosis and varices.

### Effects of anticoagulants in patients with cirrhosis and portal vein thrombosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^298d8a2c]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Liver cirrhosis is complicated by bleeding from portal hypertension but also by portal vein thrombosis (PVT). PVT occurs in approximately 20% to 50% of patients with cirrhosis, and is a warning sign for poor outcome. It is a challenge to treat patients with cirrhosis using anticoagulants, because of the perception that the coexistent coagulopathy could promote bleeding. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effects of anticoagulant therapy in patients with cirrhosis and PVT.

Methods

We searched the PubMed, ISI Web of Science, SCOPUS, and Cochrane databases through February 14, 2017, for studies that assessed the effect of anticoagulant therapy vs no treatment in patients with cirrhosis and PVT. We performed a meta-analysis to estimate the effect of anticoagulant treatment vs no therapy on recanalization and progression of PVT in patients with cirrhosis. We also assessed variceal and nonvariceal bleeding.

Results

We analyzed data from 8 studies, comprising 353 patients, that assessed the effects of anticoagulant therapy (low-weight heparin or warfarin vs no therapy) in patients with cirrhosis and PVT; these studies reported rates of complete and partial recanalization. A significantly higher proportion of patients treated with anticoagulants underwent PVT recanalization than patients who did not receive anticoagulants (71% vs 42%, respectively; P < .0001). From 6 studies (comprising 217 patients), 53% of patients treated with anticoagulants vs 33% of patients who did not receive anticoagulants had complete PVT recanalization (P = .002). From 6 studies (comprising 225 patients), PVT progressed in 9% of patients treated with anticoagulants vs 33% of patients who did not receive these drugs (P < .0001). Six studies (257 patients) reported rates of any bleeding; there was no difference in the proportions of patients with major or minor bleeding between groups that did vs did not receive anticoagulants (11% for both groups). Four studies (comprising 158 patients) reported rates of spontaneous variceal bleeding, which occurred in a significantly lower proportion of patients who received anticoagulants vs those who did not (P = .04).

Conclusions

Based on a systematic review and meta-analysis, patients with cirrhosis and PVT who receive anticoagulant therapy have increased recanalization and reduced progression of thrombosis, compared with patients who do not receive anticoagulants, with no excess of major and minor bleedings and less incidence of variceal bleeding.

Liver transplantation

This is probably appropriate only for patients who bleed while awaiting liver transplantation, although studies comparing VBL or TIPSS placement with urgent liver transplantation in this situation need to be done. Liver transplantation is an exceedingly rare option for the vast majority of patients, both because it is not commonly available and because of shortages and delays in organ procurement. No controlled trials of liver transplantation in uncontrolled/active bleeding are available.

Recommendations for the control of variceal bleeding in cirrhosis are given below and in figure 3.

Recommendations: control of active variceal haemorrhage in cirrhosis (figure 3) 
Suggestions for resuscitation and initial management Units offering an emergency acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding service should have expertise in VBL, balloon tamponade and management of gastric variceal bleeding (level 5, grade D). Transfuse patients with massive bleeding with blood, platelets and clotting factors in line with local protocols for managing massive bleeding (level 5, grade D). Base decisions on blood transfusion on the full clinical picture, recognising that overtransfusion may be as damaging as undertransfusion. A restrictive transfusion policy aiming for a haemoglobin of 70–80 g/L is suggested in haemodynamically stable patients (level 1b, grade B). Do not offer platelet transfusion to patients who are not actively bleeding and are haemodynamically stable (level 5, grade D). Offer platelet transfusion to patients who are actively bleeding and have a platelet count of <50×10 9 /L (level 5, grade D). Offer fresh frozen plasma to patients who have either: a fibrinogen level of <1 g/L (level 5, grade D), or a prothrombin time (international normalised ratio) or activated partial thromboplastin time >1.5 times normal (level 5, grade D). Offer prothrombin complex concentrate to patients who are taking warfarin and actively bleeding (level 5, grade D). Treat patients who are taking warfarin and whose upper gastrointestinal bleeding has stopped in line with local warfarin protocols (level 5, grade D). There is insufficient evidence for the use of recombinant factor VIIa in acute variceal haemorrhage (level 1b, grade B).
Suggestions for timing of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy: Offer endoscopy to unstable patients with severe acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding immediately after resuscitation (level 5, grade A). Offer endoscopy within 24 h of admission to all other patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (level 2b, grade A). Units seeing more than 330 cases a year should offer daily endoscopy lists. Units seeing fewer than 330 cases a year should arrange their service according to local circumstances (level 5, grade D).
Control of bleeding: Antibiotics are recommended for all patients with suspected or confirmed variceal bleeding (level 1a, grade A). In all patients, vasoconstrictors such as terlipressin or somatostatin are recommended and should be started as soon variceal bleeding is suspected and continued until haemostasis is achieved or for up to 5 days. Octreotide (unlicensed) is suggested if terlipressin or somatostatin are unavailable (level 1a, grade A). Variceal band ligation is recommended as the preferred endoscopic method (level 1a, grade A). After satisfactory haemostasis with the methods above, and depending on local resources, early covered TIPSS (<72 h after index variceal bleed) can be considered in selected patients with Child's B cirrhosis and active bleeding or Child's C cirrhosis with Child's score <14 (level 1b, grade B). Proton pump inhibitors are not recommended unless otherwise required for peptic ulcer disease (level 1b, grade B).
Failure to control active bleeding: If bleeding is difficult to control, a Sengstaken–Blakemore tube should be inserted until further endoscopic treatment, TIPSS or surgery is performed depending on local resources and expertise (level 1b, grade B). Specialist help should be sought at this time and transfer to a specialist centre should be considered. Units that do not offer a TIPSS service should identify a specialist centre which offers a 24 h emergency TIPSS service and have appropriate arrangements for safe transfer of patients in place (level 2a, grade B).
Areas requiring further study: The efficacy of restrictive blood transfusion in variceal haemorrhage. The role of blood products in variceal haemorrhage. The utility of early TIPSS (<72 h) in acute variceal haemorrhage. The role of removable oesophageal stents in acute variceal haemorrhage. The role of haemostatic powders in acute variceal haemorrhage. The role of proton pump inhibitors in variceal haemorrhage.
Quality indicators: Antibiotic administration in acute variceal bleeding within 1 day either before or after the procedure (level 1a, grade A). Numerator; patients with an acute variceal bleed who have received antibiotics within 1 day either before or after the procedure. Denominator; patients with an acute variceal bleed. Endoscopy performed within 24 h of presentation of an acute variceal bleed (level 2b, grade A). Numerator; patients with an acute variceal bleed who have received endoscopy within 24 h of presentation. Denominator; patients with an acute variceal bleed.

### Anticoagulation in cirrhosis: evidence for the treatment of portal vein thrombosis and applications for prophylactic therapy [^3e71e128]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The clinical utility of anticoagulation for patients with cirrhosis and asymptomatic portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is widely debated. Complex hemostatic derangements in cirrhosis that increase risk of both bleeding and thrombosis, as well as a lack of randomized controlled data, limit conclusive assessments regarding optimal management of anticoagulation in this setting. In this review, we summarize the relevant literature pertaining to PVT in cirrhosis, including the effect of untreated PVT on the natural progression of liver disease and the overall impact of anticoagulation on clot burden and other relevant clinical outcomes. Apart from patients who are symptomatic or listed for liver transplantation, data supporting anticoagulation for the treatment of PVT is limited and without clear consensus guidelines. In patients with cirrhosis without PVT, emerging evidence for the role of prophylactic anticoagulation to mitigate the progression of fibrosis suggests an optimal risk-benefit tradeoff with decreased rates of liver decompensation and mortality, without a heightened risk of bleeding. In summation, as our understanding of the role of both prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation in cirrhosis continues to evolve, ongoing risk stratification of patients with asymptomatic PVT demands further attention.

### Efficacy and safety of anticoagulation in non-malignant portal vein thrombosis in patients with liver cirrhosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2be2718c]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study was a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies that assessed the effect of anticoagulation in patients with non-malignant PVT and liver cirrhosis, while excluding studies that included PVTs related to malignancy. We demonstrated that patients who received anticoagulation had a significantly higher rate of PV recanalization compared with those who did not receive anticoagulation (65.2% vs. 25.2%, respectively). Interestingly, our study showed that anticoagulation is associated with a lower incidence of variceal bleeding and any other bleeding events. This is consistent with a previous meta-analysis performed by Loffredo et al, which demonstrated that anticoagulant use is associated with a lower risk of variceal bleeding. This finding can be explained by a decrease in portal and intrahepatic vascular resistance that ultimately prevents variceal rupture and bleeding. However, we recommend endoscopic screening for varices and initiation of primary or secondary prophylactic measures of variceal bleeding before starting anticoagulation treatment in those patients.

PVT is a common sequela of liver cirrhosis and its occurrence increases with cirrhosis progression. A recent study reported that patients with advanced liver cirrhosis have an annual PVT incidence of about 10-15%. Reduced PV velocity is considered the main contributor to the development of PVT in cirrhotic patients.

Anticoagulation provides a proven benefit in the treatment of PVT in non-cirrhotic patients. However, the role of anticoagulation in treating PVT in the setting of liver cirrhosis remains unclear, because the data supporting starting anticoagulation are based mainly on retrospective small cohort studies and there is a lack of randomized controlled trials. Although some studies have reported that spontaneous recanalization of PV can occur in up to 40% of cases, several studies have reported that the use of anticoagulation in cirrhotic patients achieves significant recanalization compared to those who did not receive anticoagulation. A study by Francoz et al showed that no patients achieved recanalization in the group without anticoagulation, while 42% achieved recanalization in the anticoagulation group. Therefore, based on our study findings, we recommend that cirrhotic patients with non-malignant PVT should be treated with anticoagulation to avoid thrombus extension into the mesenteric veins, which can lead to complications including intestinal infarction.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of portal vein thrombosis in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^3c9a4613]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update—epidemiology and natural history: portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in cirrhosis has a 5-year incidence rate of 11%, with prospective imaging studies reporting spontaneous recanalization in 40% of patients and recurrent thrombosis after withdrawal of anticoagulation in up to 38%; PVT is associated with poorer clinical outcomes, but it remains unclear whether PVT is the cause or the effect of worsening portal hypertension. A large prospective cohort study failed to identify PVT as an independent risk factor for cirrhosis progression outside of a transplantation setting, and randomized trials reported reductions with prophylactic anticoagulation, including low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) over 96 weeks and rivaroxaban in Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class B7 cirrhosis, while meta-analyses associate anticoagulation with reductions in variceal bleeding and mortality; collateralization alone cannot be relied on to identify chronicity because cavernous changes have been noted as early as 1–3 weeks after acute PVT.

AASLD Practice Guidance—Guidance statements on systemic therapy specify that systemic therapy should be offered to patients with preserved liver function (Child–Turcotte–Pugh A or well-selected Child–Turcotte–Pugh B cirrhosis), ECOG PS 0–1, who have BCLC Stage C HCC, or BCLC Stage B HCC not amenable to or progressing after locoregional therapy (Level 1, Strong Recommendation). Patients with advanced HCC who have Child–Turcotte–Pugh A cirrhosis should be offered atezolizumab plus bevacizumab or durvalumab plus tremelimumab as preferred first-line therapy options (Level 2, Strong Recommendation). Patients considered for atezolizumab plus bevacizumab should undergo an EGD to assess for high-risk stigmata of variceal or other GI bleeding (Level 5, Strong Recommendation). The optimal treatment of large varices prior to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab initiation is unknown, although AASLD recommends at least one session of banding, and carvedilol may be considered as an alternative management of varices prior to atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (Level 5, Weak Recommendation).

### Study details | NCT02744092 | Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) versus LMWH + /-warfarin for VTE in cancer (...) [^5ee00df8]. ClinicalTrials (2016). Low credibility.

Cancer is a risk factor with nearly 200, 000 VTEs in cancer patients each year. The purpose of VTE treatment is to prevent the initial clot from spreading and to prevent new clots from forming. This is accomplished by thinning the blood, or anticoagulation. Without anticoagulation, VTEs recur and are often fatal. The overarching objective of the study is to determine the effectiveness of LMWH/ warfarin vs. DOAC anticoagulation for preventing recurrent VTE in cancer patients. The investigators will conduct a trial of 811 cancer patients followed for 6 months. The intervention strategy is DOAC therapy with edoxaban, apixaban, rivaroxaban, or dabigatran. The comparator is LMWH alone or with warfarin. Within each arm, patients can choose the agent they prefer based on side effects, drug interactions, and practical issues such as co-pays.

The trial compares these two strategies in terms of treatment: 1) benefits based on VTE recurrence; 2) harms based on bleeding rates; 3) burdens based on patients' reports of their experiences; and 4) mortality rates. The investigators hypothesize that the benefits, harms and burdens of DOAC treatment will be non-inferior to, or better than, usual care with LMWH/ warfarin among cancer patients. The information gained will empower cancer patients and physicians to make more informed choices about anticoagulation strategies to manage VTE. Diagnosis of VTE <= 30 days prior to study enrollment for which potential benefits of anticoagulation therapy to prevent recurrence of VTE are felt by the treating physician to exceed the potential harms.
- Any anticoagulation drug/strategy may be used to treat the index VTE; protocol treatment will begin <= 30days after the index VTE diagnosis date
- Treating physician intends to put participant on anticoagulation therapy for at least three months.
- Age >= 18 years
- Platelet count is >= 50, 000/mm^3.
- Ongoing therapy with a P-gp inhibitor as these drugs interact with the factor Xa inhibitors
- Therapy with any azole antifungals at the time of enrollment.

### Efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonist for portal vein thrombosis in cirrhosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b988a9b2]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Aim

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is associated with a higher risk of liver-related complications. Recent guidelines recommend direct-acting anticoagulants (DOAC) in patients with cirrhosis and non-tumoral PVT. However, data on the efficacy and safety of DOAC in these patients remain limited. We aim to investigate the efficacy and safety of DOAC compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKA) to treat non-tumoral PVT in patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

We performed a systematic search of six electronic databases using MeSH term and free text. We selected all studies comparing the use of DOACs with vitamin K antagonist to treat PVT in cirrhosis. The primary outcome was PVT recanalization. Secondary outcomes were and PVT progression, major bleeding, variceal bleeding and death.

Results

From 944 citations, we included 552 subjects from a total of 11 studies (10 observational and 1 randomized trial) that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. We found that DOAC were associated with a higher pooled rate of PVT recanalization (RR = 1.67, 95%CI: 1.02, 2.74, I 2 = 79%) and lower pooled risk of PVT progression (RR = 0.14, 95%CI: 0.03-0.57, I 2 = 0%). The pooled risk of major bleeding (RR = 0.29, 95%CI: 0.08-1.01, I 2 = 0%), variceal bleeding (RR = 1.29, 95%CI: 0.64-2.59, I 2 = 0%) and death (RR = 0.31, 95%CI: 0.01-9.578, I 2 = 80%) was similar between DOAC and VKA.

Conclusion

For the treatment of PVT in patients with cirrhosis, the bleeding risk was comparable between DOAC and VKA. However, DOAC were associated with a higher pooled rate of PVT recanalization. Dedicated randomized studies are needed to confirm these findings.

### Portal vein thrombosis [^82c455a2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis is a condition not infrequently encountered by clinicians. It results from a combination of local and systemic prothrombotic risk factors. The presentation of acute thrombosis varies widely from an asymptomatic state to presence of life-threatening intestinal ischemia and infarction. In the chronic stage, patients typically present with variceal bleeding or other complications of portal hypertension. Abdominal ultrasound color Doppler imaging has a 98% negative predictive value, and is considered the imaging modality of choice in diagnosing portal vein thrombosis. Controlled clinical trials to assist with clinical decision-making are lacking in both acute and chronic portal vein thrombosis. Oral anticoagulant therapy is initiated if the risks of bleeding are low, but long-term anticoagulation is generally not recommended in patients with concomitant hepatic cirrhosis. The roles of invasive therapeutic approaches such as thrombolysis and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt continue to evolve. This review conflates dissenting views into a rational approach of managing patients with portal vein thrombosis for the general internist.

Discussion

The results of this study showed that anticoagulation with DS is safe and effective treatment, significantly reducing the risk of progression of PVT and liver decompensation. In our study, the response rate (CR + PR) was higher than 75% in all the groups of patients tested in this study. These results are to a large extent similar to those reported by Naeshiro et al. who reported response rate of 77% (CR 15%, PR 62%) after 2-week treatment with DS. Interestingly, the treatment was not associated with severe adverse events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocytopenia, or worsening of liver dysfunction (Fig. 4).

Although no side effects were encountered, PVT relapse occurred in about third of the patients, though a second course of DS treatment was efficacious in 54% of the patients. In this regard, the second course of DS treatment was followed by warfarin for maintenance therapy. It is important to keep the international normalized ratio (INR) at less than 2 during warfarin use. The prognosis of patients with unresolved PVT remains poor, including death from hepatic failure.

The treatment goals in PVT include the reversal or prevention of progression of thrombosis in the portal venous system and prevention/treatment of complications. Management decisions must be tailored to the individual patient and should be based on the experience of the attending specialist, since there are only a few randomized controlled trials and no standardized treatment protocols are currently available. The current guidelines of the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease recommend that all patients with acute PVT be anticoagulated for at least 3 months, starting with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), followed by an oral anticoagulant. Long-term anticoagulation is recommended for patients with permanent risk factors or with distal extension of the thrombus into the mesenteric veins. In the setting of chronic PVT, patients should be screened for varices and receive appropriate prophylaxis, with long-term anticoagulation therapy being one consideration for patients with risk factors for thrombosis. At present, no standard recommendations exist for patients with cirrhosis.

### Varices and variceal hemorrhage in cirrhosis: a new view of an old problem [^2d22da34]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

The management of portal hypertension in cirrhosis has evolved over time, leading to improvements in the care and survival of patients with varices and variceal hemorrhage, particularly in patients who achieve a significant reduction in portal pressure. In addition to better treatment strategies and improved therapeutic options, the issue of risk stratification has become essential to identify different patient subpopulations that require a different treatment. We now recognize that the management of varices and variceal hemorrhage must be taken in the context of other complications of cirrhosis (ascites, encephalopathy, jaundice) and that the goals of therapy should be based on the presence of such complications. Evolving knowledge of the predominant pathophysiological mechanisms at each of the stages of cirrhosis also has evolved and will continue to lead to improvements in therapy. This review focuses on the management of varices and variceal hemorrhage with respect to refinements in the risk stratification of patients with cirrhosis.

### Primary prevention of variceal bleeding in people with oesophageal varices due to liver cirrhosis: a network meta-analysis [^ecd88229]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 40% to 95% of people with cirrhosis have oesophageal varices. About 15% to 20% of oesophageal varices bleed in about one to three years. There are several different treatments to prevent bleeding, including: beta-blockers, endoscopic sclerotherapy, and variceal band ligation. However, there is uncertainty surrounding their individual and relative benefits and harms.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of different treatments for prevention of first variceal bleeding from oesophageal varices in adults with liver cirrhosis through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the different treatments for prevention of first variceal bleeding from oesophageal varices according to their safety and efficacy.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers to December 2019 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices with no history of bleeding.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices with no history of bleeding. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previous bleeding from oesophageal varices and those who had previously undergone liver transplantation or previously received prophylactic treatment for oesophageal varices.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed a network meta-analysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR), and rate ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an available-case analysis, according to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. We performed the direct comparisons from randomised clinical trials using the same codes and the same technical details.

Main Results

We included 66 randomised clinical trials (6653 participants) in the review. Sixty trials (6212 participants) provided data for one or more comparisons in the review. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies and those at high risk of bleeding from oesophageal varices. The follow-up in the trials that reported outcomes ranged from 6 months to 60 months. All but one of the trials were at high risk of bias. The interventions compared included beta-blockers, no active intervention, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation, beta-blockers plus nitrates, nitrates, beta-blockers plus sclerotherapy, and portocaval shunt. Overall, 21.2% of participants who received non-selective beta-blockers ('beta-blockers') - the reference treatment (chosen because this was the most common treatment compared in the trials) - died during 8-month to 60-month follow-up. Based on low-certainty evidence, beta-blockers, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, and beta-blockers plus nitrates all had lower mortality versus no active intervention (beta-blockers: HR 0.49, 95% CrI 0.36 to 0.67; direct comparison HR: 0.59, 95% CrI 0.42 to 0.83; 10 trials, 1200 participants; variceal band ligation: HR 0.51, 95% CrI 0.35 to 0.74; direct comparison HR 0.49, 95% CrI 0.12 to 2.14; 3 trials, 355 participants; sclerotherapy: HR 0.66, 95% CrI 0.51 to 0.85; direct comparison HR 0.61, 95% CrI 0.41 to 0.90; 18 trials, 1666 participants; beta-blockers plus nitrates: HR 0.41, 95% CrI 0.20 to 0.85; no direct comparison). No trials reported health-related quality of life. Based on low-certainty evidence, variceal band ligation had a higher number of serious adverse events (number of events) than beta-blockers (rate ratio 10.49, 95% CrI 2.83 to 60.64; 1 trial, 168 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, beta-blockers plus nitrates had a higher number of 'any adverse events (number of participants)' than beta-blockers alone (OR 3.41, 95% CrI 1.11 to 11.28; 1 trial, 57 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, adverse events (number of events) were higher in sclerotherapy than in beta-blockers (rate ratio 2.49, 95% CrI 1.53 to 4.22; direct comparison rate ratio 2.47, 95% CrI 1.27 to 5.06; 2 trials, 90 participants), and in beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation than in beta-blockers (direct comparison rate ratio 1.72, 95% CrI 1.08 to 2.76; 1 trial, 140 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, any variceal bleed was lower in beta-blockers plus variceal band ligation than in beta-blockers (direct comparison HR 0.21, 95% CrI 0.04 to 0.71; 1 trial, 173 participants). Based on low-certainty evidence, any variceal bleed was higher in nitrates than beta-blockers (direct comparison HR 6.40, 95% CrI 1.58 to 47.42; 1 trial, 52 participants). The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in the remaining comparisons.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on low-certainty evidence, beta-blockers, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, and beta-blockers plus nitrates may decrease mortality compared to no intervention in people with high-risk oesophageal varices in people with cirrhosis and no previous history of bleeding. Based on low-certainty evidence, variceal band ligation may result in a higher number of serious adverse events than beta-blockers. The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of beta-blockers versus variceal band ligation on variceal bleeding. The evidence also indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in most of the remaining comparisons.

Group 3: No anticoagulant Participants will take the assigned treatment for 6 months. Researchers will monitor whether participants develop blood clots, experience serious bleeding events, or die from any cause during the study period. While patients with a KRS ≥ 2 are eligible for VTE prophylaxis under current clinical guidelines, there remains a major gap between these recommendations and clinical practice. Implementation of prophylaxis is low due to concerns about bleeding, uncertainty regarding net clinical benefit, and challenges with medication adherence-particularly with twice-daily dosing regimens. Apixaban, a direct oral anticoagulant, is FDA-approved and supported by NCCN and ASH guidelines for VTE prevention in high-risk ambulatory cancer patients. The AVERT trial demonstrated that apixaban 2. 5 mg twice daily significantly reduced VTE events in cancer patients with a KRS ≥ 2 but increased the risk of major bleeding.

However, this dosing strategy remains underutilized. The possibility of once-daily dosing with apixaban, which could improve adherence and acceptance among patients and physicians, has not been adequately studied in this population. This single-center, phase III, open-label, pragmatic randomized clinical trial will evaluate two dosing strategies of apixaban for VTE prevention in cancer outpatients with a KRS of 2. A total of 996 participants will be randomized 1: 1: 1 to receive: Arm 1: Apixaban
2. 5 mg twice daily. Arm 2: Apixaban 5 mg once daily Arm 3: No anticoagulant prophylaxis The primary objective is to compare the incidence of VTE across these arms over a 6-month treatment period. Secondary objectives include comparisons of all-cause mortality and rates of clinically significant bleeding events. Exclusion Criteria:
- Active bleeding or high risk of bleeding
- Known contraindication to apixaban
- Current therapeutic-dose anticoagulation for VTE or atrial fibrillation
- Platelet count < 50, 000/µL
- Creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min
- Life expectancy < 3 months
- Pregnant or breastfeeding
- Inability to comply with study procedures.

### Anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation and liver cirrhosis [^48ff94ca]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

A retrospective cohort study of 9056 patients with liver cirrhosis comorbid with AF and a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score ≥2 compared the efficacy of antiplatelet medication (30.6%), warfarin (8.3%) and no anticoagulation therapy (61.1%). The group of patients with AF and cirrhosis, who did not receive antithrombotic treatment, had a significantly higher stroke incidence than those without liver cirrhosis. Moreover, individuals in the warfarin group had statistically significantly lower rates of ischemic stroke, whereas those in the antiplatelet or no-anticoagulation group demonstrated similar rates. Regarding ICH, no difference was observed among study groups. The researchers underlined that the use of warfarin has shown clinical benefits. However, the small sample size of this group and the fewer comorbidities associated with the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score should be considered when interpreting the results.

In a retrospective analysis of patients with cirrhosis and AF, VKAs reduced the risk for ischemic stroke compared with no therapy (1.8% vs. 4.7% per year, P=0.01). However, patients with more advanced cirrhosis (CP B and C) had a significantly greater risk for major bleeding (14.5% vs. 4.9% per year, P<0.001). Moreover, all-cause mortality was lower with warfarin versus no anticoagulants in a recent retrospective analysis of a United States national database that included patients with cirrhosis who experienced the development of AF (Table 2).

Table 2 
VKAs vs. no anticoagulation: characteristics of included studies

Safety

The therapeutic effect of VKAs is traditionally monitored using the INR. The proposed target INR values for AF and well-compensated cirrhosis patients are 2.0-3.0. However, a narrower therapeutic range is recommended in patients with abnormal baseline INR values and esophageal varices or other signs of portal hypertension (1.8-2.20). On the other hand, it should be underlined that INR is not considered a reliable parameter for monitoring coagulation balance in patients with cirrhosis. In contrast, platelet count, fibrinogen, and activated partial thromboplastin time are considered to have better predictive value for bleeding risk in cirrhotic patients. In addition to warfarin discontinuation and complex concentrate administration, vitamin K infusion is appropriate for warfarin-treated patients with life-threatening bleeding.

Portal or mesenteric vein thrombosis in cirrhosis—We suggest anticoagulation in patients with chronic PVT only if there is (i) evidence of inherited thrombophilia, (ii) progression of thrombus, or (iii) history of bowel ischemia due to thrombus extension into the mesenteric veins, and anticoagulation may also be considered in patients awaiting LT. In acute portal or mesenteric vein thrombosis, we suggest 6 months of anticoagulation, with continuation beyond this period in patients with portal or mesenteric vein thrombosis who are on the waiting list for liver transplant. For variceal bleeding prophylaxis in cirrhotic patients with high-risk varices and portal and/or mesenteric vein thrombosis requiring anticoagulation, we recommend nonselective beta-blockers; endoscopic variceal ligation may be performed if there is a contraindication to or intolerance to beta-blockers, and anticoagulation may need to be interrupted in the periprocedural period. For the initial anticoagulant, we suggest either unfractionated heparin or LMWH, preferring unfractionated heparin in the presence of renal insufficiency and LMWH in the presence of thrombocytopenia.

### Portal vein thrombosis in cirrhosis: diagnosis, natural history, and therapeutic challenges [^9e7283db]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a frequent complication in cirrhosis and its prevalence increases with disease severity. Several factors are involved in the development and progression of PVT. The challenge for the management of PVT is the precise evaluation of the bleeding risk as opposed to life-threatening extension of thrombosis. Nevertheless, the impact on the progression and outcome of liver disease is unclear. A critical evaluation of the available data discloses that treating PVT in cirrhotics is safe and effective. However, there are open issues, such as which anticoagulant could represent a safer therapeutic option, and when and for how long this treatment should be administered to cirrhotic patients with PVT.

### Management of the major complications of cirrhosis: beyond guidelines [^173b72fe]. Journal of Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Along with a growing understanding of the pathophysiology of cirrhosis and its complications, new therapies and management strategies have emerged in recent years. Many of these advances have helped inform the current EASL clinical practice guidelines 1 on the management of some of the key complications of cirrhosis, such as ascites, variceal bleeding and infection. However, there are still some aspects of management where the evidence base is less clear, and/or where opinions amongst practitioners remain divided. Some of these more controversial areas are explored in this section, wherein we present evidence culminating in a suggested management approach based on expert opinion and extending beyond the current guidelines.

Discussion

The present work provides prospective data on the management and clinical outcomes of SVT in a large study population with long-term follow-up. The risk of recurrent VTE, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality was lower during anticoagulant treatment after adjustment for potentially relevant patient characteristics and across high-risk patient subgroups. The incidence rates of all outcomes increased after anticoagulant treatment discontinuation and were high in patients who did not receive any anticoagulation.

In agreement with previous observations, the present data confirm that a nonnegligible proportion of patients with SVT remained untreated (15%), and an additional 16% received treatment for <3 months. Although the risk of recurrent VTE in patients with SVT is relevant, concerns for bleeding complications remain major drivers of the decision whether to use anticoagulation.Several studies suggested that anticoagulant therapy may actually lower bleeding risk in these patients, presumably by promoting vein recanalization with decreased intravascular pressure in the splanchnic circulation and gastrointestinal varices.A recent study-level meta-analysis seemed to support this concept, showing increased rates of vein recanalization, lower rates of thrombosis progression, and reduced risk of bleeding complications in anticoagulated patients with SVT.Our results strengthen and extend these earlier observations, confirming the lower risks of recurrent VTE and major bleeding with anticoagulant treatment after adjustment for relevant confounders. We also explored the effectiveness and safety of anticoagulant therapy in high-risk subgroups such as those with liver cirrhosis, solid cancers, or myeloproliferative neoplasms.Our findings seem reassuring and suggest a lower risk of recurrent VTE, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality during anticoagulant therapy compared with off-treatment periods. These results support the recommendations of recent guidelines to promptly start anticoagulation for acute SVT irrespective of underlying risk factors in the absence of major contraindications.Sixty-one percent of recurrent VTEs occurred outside the splanchnic venous circulation, most often in patients with persistent risk factors. The latter have a chronic procoagulant state and, as for usual-site VTE, may warrant long-term anticoagulation. Interestingly, even though none of the recurrent VTEs resulted in death, the case-fatality rate of major bleeding was approximately 6%, largely accounted for by the number of fatal bleeding episodes (80% of total) occurring among untreated patients. In this latter group, the case-fatality rate was as high as 17%, which seems to support the physician decision not to provide anticoagulant therapy. Further studies are needed to identify patient subgroups with a very high risk of life-threatening bleeding in whom an individualized approach would be advisable. It is worth noting that we could not evaluate the safety of anticoagulation in patients with prior major bleeding, hematological malignancy, or severe thrombocytopenia as a result of the low number of patients with these risk factors.

### Treatment response and bleeding events associated with anticoagulant therapy of portal vein thrombosis in cirrhotic patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^bfc8c098]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Well-defined guidelines for the treatment of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in patients with cirrhosis are lacking, given the paucity of robust data. Among the available treatment options the best choice is unknown.

Methods

We conducted a comprehensive search of multiple electronic databases and conference proceedings (through December 2019) to identify studies that reported on the use of anticoagulants in the treatment of PVT in patients with cirrhosis. Our goals were to evaluate the pooled odds ratio (OR) and pooled rate of treatment responders and bleeding events.

Results

A total of 17 studies were included: 648 patients were treated with anticoagulation and 96 were controls. Pooled OR for treatment responders was 5.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.5-10.2, P = 0.001) and pooled OR for bleeding was 0.4 (95%CI 0.1-1.5, P = 0.2) for anticoagulation treatment versus control. Pooled rate of treatment responders with anticoagulation was 66.7% (95%CI 58.3-74.1) compared to 26% (95%CI 14.2-42.7) for the control group. Pooled rate of bleeding seemed comparable (7.8%, 95%CI 4.5-13.3, and 15.4%, 95%CI 4.3-42.7). On subgroup analysis, pooled rates of treatment responders and bleeding events seemed similar between low molecular weight heparin, vitamin K antagonists, and direct oral anticoagulants.

Conclusions

Our study demonstrated that anticoagulation is effective and safe in the treatment of PVT in patients with cirrhosis. Owing to the comparable outcomes, direct oral anticoagulants may be considered as first-line treatment, depending on patient preferences.

### The management of portal hypertension: rational basis, available treatments and future options [^70aaee47]. Journal of Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Variceal bleeding is the last step in a chain of events initiated by an increase in portal pressure, followed by the development and progressive dilation of varices until these finally rupture and bleed. This sequence of events might be prevented - and reversed - by achieving a sufficient decrease in portal pressure. A different approach is the use of local endoscopic treatments at the varices. This article reviews the rationale for the management of patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, the current recommendations for the prevention and treatment of variceal bleeding, and outlines the unsolved issues and the perspectives for the future opened by new research developments.

Table 2 
Studies on efficacy and safety of VKA or LMWH in cirrhotics with PVT

The main threat for patients on anticoagulation is bleeding. Recent studies support the view that cirrhosis itself is the major cause of bleeding, rather than anticoagulation, which has been associated with a lower risk of both major bleeding and vascular events. Cui et al demonstrated that the non-variceal bleeding risk was higher in patients receiving a once-daily high dose of LMWH (1.5 mg/kg), corroborating the use of a standard twice-daily dose. However, the lack of a reliable test to quantify and adjust the dose of LMWH prevents optimization of therapeutic strategies. Measurement of thrombin generation might be an option, but further investigation is required on this topic. Although Delgado et al pointed out that VKA-treated patients had higher rates of bleeding events compared to a LMWH study group, anticoagulation for PVT in cirrhotics does not generally change the outcome of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and has been proven relatively safe, according to more recent studies. It should be noted, however, that spontaneous resolution of PVT in cirrhosis has been stressed in the literature. In these cases, PVT was associated with a self-limiting underlying pathology or minimal thrombus extension. Given the complexity of cirrhosis, it is not always easy to predict the outcome of untreated PVT.

Introduction

Liver cirrhosis is the end stage of chronic liver disease, independent of aetiology, and is characterised by accumulation of fibrotic tissue and conversion of the normal liver parenchyma into abnormal regenerative nodules.Complications include portal hypertension with gastro-oesophageal varices, ascites, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy, bacteraemia and hypersplenism.The most life-threatening complication of liver cirrhosis is acute variceal bleeding (AVB), which is associated with increased mortality that, despite recent progress in management, is still around 20% at 6 weeks.Combined treatment with vasoactive drugs, prophylactic antibiotics and endoscopic techniques is the recommended standard of care for patients with AVB.However, not all patients with AVB have the same risk of unfavourable outcome. The most consistently reported risk indicators of death were Child-Pugh classification, model for end-stage liver disease score and increased hepatic venous pressure gradient.Severe bleeding (fresh blood in the stomach with high-risk stigmata on varices or active bleeding at endoscopy) is also associated with higher mortalityand demands early endoscopy (within 12 hours of patient presentation).Nevertheless, data from bleeding registries show that a significant proportion of patients with AVB have a delay of greater than 24 hours before undergoing upper endoscopy, mainly due to the lack of experienced endoscopists.

TC-325 (Hemospray, Cook Medical, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA) is a haemostatic powder which, when put in contact with moisture (eg, blood or tissue) in the GI tract, becomes cohesive and adhesive forming a mechanical barrier that adheres to and covers the bleeding site, achieving very rapid haemostasis.After approximately 24 hours, the adherent layer subsequently sloughs off into the lumen from the mucosal wall and is eliminated from the GI tract.Using a delivery system dedicated to endoscopic applications, it has been shown to be effective in peptic ulcer bleeding,including high-risk patientson anticoagulant or antithrombotic therapy,those with tumour-related bleedingand patients with lower GI bleeding.In two pilot studiesand two case reports,Hemospray was reported to be useful in emergency management of AVB as an added treatment modality to the medical management that serves as a bridge towards more definitive endotherapy, with no major adverse events or device-related mortalities. As such, this therapy offers an interesting option for transient haemostasis that does not require specific expertise in therapeutic endoscopy.

### AGA clinical practice update: coagulation in cirrhosis [^b90ac27c]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Coagulation in cirrhosis—overall anticoagulation indications emphasize limited trials but defined scenarios for use. Although prospective, randomized, controlled, and blinded trials are generally lacking, consideration of both prophylactic dose anticoagulation for peripheral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in hospitalized liver disease patients and full-dose anticoagulation in cirrhotic patients with acute portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and DVT is indicated. Prophylactic therapy for preventing PVT is also a consideration in stable cirrhosis patients and may offer a means of blunting disease progression, but this requires extensive validation. With newly diagnosed PVT, the decision to intervene with directed therapy rests on the extent of the thrombosis, presence or absence of attributable symptoms, and risk of bleeding and falls. No firm guidance exists but the clearest “evidence-based” indication to treat is among liver transplantation candidates due to the adverse effects of PVT on technical aspects of the transplantation.
