## Question

Hypothermia management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for step-by-step guidance on hypothermia management, preserving natural self-verification and any initial missteps with corrections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and classification of hypothermia. Then, I should verify prehospital priorities and safety. Next, I will examine field assessment and staging. After that, I need to outline prehospital treatment by severity, including passive and active rewarming, fluids, and special situations like cardiac arrest. Then, I should review transport considerations and hospital-based management, including extracorporeal rewarming and medication adjustments. Finally, I will consider special populations, monitoring and complications, and synthesize a practical algorithm with key principles and evidence strength.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and classification, because everything downstream depends on getting this right. Accidental hypothermia is defined as an unintentional core temperature below 35°C, and severity is typically staged as mild 32–35°C, moderate 28–32°C, severe less than 28°C, and profound less than 24°C, with the caveat that trauma patients may be categorized slightly differently in some protocols, so I should double-check local algorithms before anchoring on a single schema [^116j5qBS] [^116zFTKy] [^115fDWTB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment before securing the scene and the rescuers. I need to ensure rescuer safety first, because environmental hazards and unstable patients can endanger the team; only after scene safety should we proceed with assessment and treatment, and I should remember that in hypothermic cardiac arrest, the adage is "no one is dead until warm and dead", so resuscitation should continue until the patient is rewarmed before declaring death [^111AfddW] [^111kJKvr] [^117Po1bh].

> Next, I should review field assessment and staging, and I need to check that I'm not over-relying on a thermometer in austere settings. A practical approach is to triage by consciousness, movement, and shivering, recognizing that a shivering patient with preserved function is likely cold-stressed rather than truly hypothermic, whereas impaired mentation or absence of shivering suggests true hypothermia; if in doubt, assume hypothermia and treat accordingly, and I should confirm core temperature when feasible using esophageal, rectal, or tympanic probes depending on resources and airway status [^116Jp2eZ] [^116mWuyr] [^112oBPoL] [^116Cda4P].

> I will now examine prehospital treatment priorities, and I need to ensure I'm sequencing them correctly. The immediate goals are to prevent further heat loss, avoid precipitating cardiovascular collapse, and initiate safe rewarming; that means removing from the cold environment, insulating from ground and wind, creating a vapor barrier, and handling the patient gently while keeping them horizontal to mitigate afterdrop and arrhythmias, especially ventricular fibrillation risk during rough handling or limb movement [^114EcVFq] [^112PJzg1] [^113irCK3] [^116vdc1a].

> For passive rewarming, let me think about what is appropriate in the field. Passive insulation with dry clothing, vapor barrier, and head and neck coverage is foundational; for alert, shivering patients with mild hypothermia, observation with calories and gradual activity after a monitored period is reasonable, but I should confirm that we avoid premature standing or exercise because that can worsen afterdrop and hypotension; if the patient can stand without difficulty after observation, low-intensity exercise can be titrated with close monitoring [^114EcVFq] [^113uoy6d] [^113Nv31P] [^112C2j4Z].

> Now, active rewarming — wait, let me verify the targets and methods. Heat should be applied to the upper trunk, anterior chest, axillae, and groin, using large chemical or electric heat packs or forced-air devices if available; I should avoid small chemical packs for core rewarming and avoid direct skin contact to prevent burns, and I need to check skin every 20–30 minutes when using active heat sources; body-to-body rewarming can improve comfort but does not speed rewarming and should not delay evacuation, and heated humidified oxygen can be adjunctive but not as sole therapy [^11766uci] [^114ptiwC] [^116mvxk2] [^112k85f7] [^116LVFpr].

> I should confirm fluid strategy because this is easy to get wrong. All intravenous fluids should be warmed to 40–42°C and delivered in boluses rather than continuous infusions to limit volume overload; I need to titrate to adequate perfusion while acknowledging that specific systolic blood pressure targets are not well defined in hypothermia, and I should be cautious not to over-resuscitate [^1173oido] [^116FQkDg].

> But wait, what if the patient is in cardiac arrest or profoundly hypothermic. I should initiate high-quality CPR without delay, consider delayed or intermittent compressions only if continuous CPR is unsafe, and avoid hyperventilation; if advanced airway is present, ventilate at about half the normothermic rate in the absence of ETCO2 guidance to reduce VF risk; I should transport to a center capable of extracorporeal life support when feasible and continue active rewarming during transport, and I must not give up prematurely because successful resuscitation has occurred even at very low core temperatures [^114WQjmC] [^112XKaLt] [^114hBsy6] [^116cHVpp].

> I need to check medication and vasopressor guidance in hypothermia, and here is where I must reconcile conflicting sources. The Wilderness Medical Society advises withholding vasoactive drugs until core temperature is at least 30°C and extending dosing intervals twofold for 30–35°C to avoid toxic accumulation, whereas some national prehospital guidance has historically aligned with standard ACLS dosing; given the pharmacokinetic changes in hypothermia, I should favor the hypothermia-specific approach and document the rationale, returning to standard intervals once the patient reaches approximately 35°C as rewarming proceeds [^114SNTuf] [^1129MBu7] [^113AdHUJ].

> Next, I should review transport considerations, and I need to ensure the ambulance environment supports rewarming. Patient compartments should be heated to at least 24°C when possible, and I should notify the receiving hospital early about the severity of hypothermia and the need for extracorporeal capabilities so that appropriate resources can be mobilized without delay [^113ndLMw] [^111p8UHD].

> Upon hospital arrival, I should confirm core temperature and immediately escalate rewarming based on severity. For severe hypothermia, extracorporeal rewarming with ECMO or cardiopulmonary bypass offers the fastest and most controlled method and should be prioritized when available; for moderate cases, active external methods and cavity lavage can be considered; and for all patients, continuous monitoring of temperature, hemodynamics, and rhythm is essential, with the awareness that atrial arrhythmias during rewarming are common and usually require no treatment if the patient is hemodynamically stable [^116Tkj1u] [^115y22KA].

> I should double-check medication adjustments as the patient rewarms. Continue to avoid vasoactive agents below 30°C, extend intervals twofold at 30–35°C, and transition to standard dosing as temperature normalizes, documenting the rationale and reassessing for drug accumulation or rebound hypertension during rewarming [^114SNTuf] [^113AdHUJ].

> Special populations require tailored thinking, so let me consider trauma first. Hypothermia is a core component of the lethal triad with acidosis and coagulopathy, and active rewarming should begin immediately alongside hemorrhage control; target normothermia between 36 and 37°C to optimize coagulation, and maintain aggressive warming throughout imaging, operating room time, and ICU care to prevent recurrent cooling [^112oJdjY] [^1163CqSW] [^1126Xp1m].

> For drowning, I should confirm that concomitant hypothermia is common and that rewarming should proceed in parallel with airway and ventilation management; water is thermally neutral near 33°C, so most drowning patients are colder than the water and at risk for afterdrop, reinforcing the need for gentle handling and active rewarming strategies [^117HZBCE] [^116MQ8ob].

> For post–cardiac arrest care outside of the hypothermia context, I need to ensure I'm aligned with contemporary guidance. Modern resuscitation science emphasizes targeted temperature management to prevent fever rather than mandatory cooling to 33°C; maintain temperature below 37.5°C and treat fever aggressively, recognizing that earlier enthusiasm for prehospital cooling has not translated into consistent benefit and may carry risks in some protocols [^113se2DP] [^113RTyav] [^113r3fAF].

> I should review monitoring and complications now, and I need to ensure laboratory and electrolyte surveillance is adequate. Maintain serum potassium between 3.0 and 3.5 mmol/L during cooling and early rewarming to mitigate rebound hyperkalemia and arrhythmias, correct arterial blood gases to the patient's actual temperature, and watch for infections, which occur more frequently with prolonged hypothermia and require vigilance for sepsis during and after rewarming [^115x4VVH] [^111FfHGP].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm, and I should confirm it aligns with the evidence. In the field, ensure rescuer safety, remove from the cold, insulate and vapor-barrier, assess severity by function and shivering, apply active heat to the upper trunk for moderate to severe cases, use warmed fluids in boluses, avoid premature exercise, and transport to a center with extracorporeal capability when indicated; in the hospital, measure core temperature, escalate to extracorporeal rewarming for severe cases, adjust medications per temperature, and continue active rewarming until a stable core above 35–36°C is achieved, with close monitoring for afterdrop and arrhythmias [^111AfddW] [^114EcVFq] [^1173oido] [^114hBsy6].

> Key principles I should not forget include the primacy of preventing further heat loss, the dangers of afterdrop with premature exertion or limb movement, the need for gentle horizontal handling, the mantra that no one is dead until warm and dead, and the graded escalation from passive to active to extracorporeal rewarming based on severity and resources; these principles are consistently supported across high-quality guidelines and reviews and should anchor bedside decisions in real time [^112PJzg1] [^116vdc1a] [^117Po1bh].

Hypothermia management centers on **rapid core temperature measurement** and **graded rewarming** matched to severity, with **gentle handling** to avoid arrhythmias and afterdrop [^116Cda4P] [^116vdc1a]. Passive rewarming suffices for mild cases, while active methods (forced air, warm IV fluids, heated humidified oxygen) are used for moderate to severe hypothermia [^114J7KXM] [^1173oido] [^116LVFpr]. ECMO or cardiopulmonary bypass is indicated for unstable patients or core temperature < 28°C [^notfound]. Monitor for arrhythmias, coagulopathy, and electrolyte shifts; avoid vasopressors until ≥ 30°C, and extend medication intervals 2× at 30–35°C [^114SNTuf]. In trauma, prevent and aggressively treat hypothermia as part of the lethal triad [^112oJdjY]. For post–cardiac arrest, use targeted temperature management at 32–36°C for 24 hours, then controlled rewarming [^113RTyav].

## Classification of hypothermia

| **Severity** | **Core temperature** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild | 32–35°C (89.6–95°F) | Shivering, tachycardia, hypertension, altered mental status |
| Moderate | 28–32°C (82.4–89.6°F) | - Cessation of shivering <br/> - Bradycardia <br/> - Hypotension <br/> - Reduced consciousness |
| Severe | < 28°C (82.4°F) | - Unconsciousness <br/> - Severe bradycardia <br/> - Risk of ventricular fibrillation <br/> - Cardiac arrest |

---

## Initial assessment and monitoring

- **Core temperature measurement**: Use esophageal, rectal, or bladder probes; tympanic is less reliable [^116Cda4P].
- **Vital signs**: Monitor ECG, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate continuously [^notfound].
- **Laboratory tests**: Arterial blood gases (corrected to patient temperature), electrolytes, glucose, coagulation profile, and lactate [^115x4VVH].

---

## General principles of management

- **Prevent further heat loss**: Remove wet clothing, insulate with dry materials, and protect from wind and cold [^114EcVFq].
- **Gentle handling**: Avoid rough movements to prevent arrhythmias and afterdrop [^116vdc1a].
- **Gradual rewarming**: Aim for 1–2°C per hour to minimize afterdrop and complications [^116vdc1a].

---

## Rewarming strategies

### Passive rewarming

Passive rewarming is appropriate for **mild hypothermia** (32–35°C) and involves insulation with dry clothing and blankets, a vapor barrier, and passive external insulation [^114DBJbP].

---

### Active external rewarming

Active external rewarming is indicated for **moderate hypothermia** (28–32°C) and as adjuncts in severe cases, using forced-air warming devices, warm water immersion (40–42°C) of the trunk, and chemical heat packs on the trunk (avoid direct skin contact) [^114ptiwC] [^115NvM62].

---

### Active internal rewarming

Active internal rewarming is indicated for **severe hypothermia** (< 28°C), unstable patients, or failure of external methods and includes warmed IV fluids (40–42°C), heated humidified oxygen, gastric or peritoneal lavage, and extracorporeal life support (ECLS, ECMO, cardiopulmonary bypass) [^1173oido] [^116LVFpr] [^114hBsy6].

---

## Management of complications

- **Arrhythmias**: Atrial arrhythmias common during rewarming; treat only if unstable [^115y22KA].
- **Coagulopathy**: Correct hypothermia to restore coagulation; transfuse as indicated [^112oJdjY].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Monitor and correct potassium, magnesium, and calcium during rewarming [^115x4VVH].
- **Infection risk**: Hypothermia impairs immunity; monitor for infection and use antibiotics as indicated [^111FfHGP].

---

## Special considerations

### Trauma patients

In trauma patients, **hypothermia prevention** entails early aggressive warming during all phases of care, and **damage control resuscitation** addresses the lethal triad (hypothermia, acidosis, coagulopathy) with active rewarming and correction of coagulopathy [^1126Xp1m] [^115fDWTB] [^116K5Z8X].

---

### Post-cardiac arrest patients

In post–cardiac arrest care, **targeted temperature management (TTM)** at 32–36°C for 24 hours is followed by controlled rewarming at 0.25–0.5°C per hour [^113RTyav].

---

## Medication considerations

Medication considerations include **vasopressors**, which should be avoided until core temperature is ≥ 30°C; if needed, extend dosing intervals twofold at 30–35°C [^114SNTuf]. Sedation and analgesia should be used to control shivering and discomfort during rewarming [^notfound].

---

## Criteria for termination of resuscitation

Termination of resuscitation should be considered only after the patient has been **rewarmed to > 32°C** and shows no response, with decisions individualized based on patient factors and clinical judgment [^notfound].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **Measure core temperature accurately**: Use esophageal, rectal, or bladder probes [^116Cda4P].
- **Prevent further heat loss**: Insulate, remove wet clothing, and protect from wind [^114EcVFq].
- **Rewarm gradually**: Aim for 1–2°C per hour [^116vdc1a].
- **Use active rewarming for moderate to severe hypothermia**: Forced air, warm IV fluids, heated humidified oxygen, and ECMO as indicated [^1173oido] [^114hBsy6].
- **Monitor for complications**: Arrhythmias, coagulopathy, electrolyte disturbances, and infection [^115x4VVH].
- **Adjust medications**: Avoid vasopressors until ≥ 30°C; extend intervals at 30–35°C [^114SNTuf].
- **Continue resuscitation until rewarmed**: Do not terminate until > 32°C [^116cHVpp].

Effective hypothermia management requires **accurate core temperature measurement**, **gradual rewarming**, and vigilant monitoring for complications, with treatment tailored to severity and patient context.

### The evaluation and management of accidental hypothermia [^1166maRR]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

Accidental hypothermia is defined as an unintentional decrease in core body temperature to below 35 degrees C. Hypothermia causes hundreds of deaths in the United States annually. Victims of accidental hypothermia present year-round and in all climates with a potentially confusing array of signs and symptoms, but increasing severity of hypothermia produces a predictable pattern of systemic organ dysfunction and associated clinical manifestations. The management of hypothermic patients differs in several important respects from that of euthermic patients, so advance knowledge about hypothermia is prerequisite to optimal management. The paucity of randomized clinical trials with hypothermic patients precludes creation of evidence-based treatment guidelines, but a clinically sound management strategy, tailored to individual patient characteristics and institutional expertise and resources, can nonetheless be gleaned from the literature. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and treatment of accidental hypothermia. Initial evaluation and stabilization, selection of a rewarming strategy, and criteria for withholding or withdrawing support are discussed.

### Temperature management after cardiac arrest: an advisory statement by the advanced life support task force of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation and the American Heart Association emergency cardiovascular care committee and the council on cardiopulmonary, critical care, perioperative and resuscitation [^113RTyav]. Resuscitation (2016). Low credibility.

For more than a decade, mild induced hypothermia (32 °C-34 °C) has been standard of care for patients remaining comatose after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with an initial shockable rhythm, and this has been extrapolated to survivors of cardiac arrest with initially nonshockable rhythms and to patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest. Two randomized trials published in 2002 reported a survival and neurological benefit with mild induced hypothermia. One recent randomized trial reported similar outcomes in patients treated with targeted temperature management at either 33 °C or 36 °C. In response to these new data, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation Advanced Life Support Task Force performed a systematic review to evaluate 3 key questions: (1) Should mild induced hypothermia (or some form of targeted temperature management) be used in comatose post-cardiac arrest patients? (2) If used, what is the ideal timing of the intervention? (3) If used, what is the ideal duration of the intervention? The task force used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology to assess and summarize the evidence and to provide a consensus on science statement and treatment recommendations. The task force recommends targeted temperature management for adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with an initial shockable rhythm at a constant temperature between 32 °C and 36 °C for at least 24 hours. Similar suggestions are made for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with a nonshockable rhythm and in-hospital cardiac arrest. The task force recommends against prehospital cooling with rapid infusion of large volumes of cold intravenous fluid. Additional and specific recommendations are provided in the document.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the out-of-hospital evaluation and treatment of accidental hypothermia: 2019 update [^113wL1pb]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Accidental hypothermia — patients with comorbidities including trauma or asphyxia should be transferred to a facility able to manage the condition, as comorbidities can alter the clinical presentation and potentially delay recognition; asphyxiated patients may appear stable but are at risk for delayed complications and likely require a higher level of care. Recommendations specify that a patient with injuries meeting trauma criteria should be transported to a trauma center (Evidence grade: 1B), and the asphyxiated patient should be transported to a hospital for observation (Evidence grade: 1B).

### Cardiac arrest and therapeutic hypothermia [^114eZ63q]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Therapeutic hypothermia for patients who remain comatose following resuscitation from a cardiac arrest improves both survival and neurologic outcomes. Although this therapy has been incorporated into the guidelines for routine post-resuscitation care and has been in clinical use for over a decade, significant questions and controversies remain. In this review, we discuss these questions in the context of the current evidence and provide a practical framework to help guide clinicians.

### The implementation of targeted temperature management: an evidence-based guideline from the Neurocritical Care Society [^112yGQbM]. Neurocritical Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Targeted temperature management definitions — key temperature ranges and timing — are specified as follows: Controlled normothermia (NT) is between 36.0 and 37.4 °C; fever is core body temperature greater than 37.5 °C, with alternate definitions > 38.3 °C or > 38.5 °C; mild hypothermia is 32–34 °C, moderate hypothermia 28–32 °C, and deep/severe hypothermia less than 28 °C. Overshoot is defined as a temperature drop > 0.5 °C below target temperature or temperature 32 °C or lower. Prophylactic hypothermia is TH started within 2.5 h of neurologic injury and before evidence of secondary injury. Duration categories include longer duration hypothermia (greater than 24 h in the cardiac arrest population; greater than 48 h in other populations) and shorter duration hypothermia (less than 24 h in the cardiac arrest population; < 24–48 h in other populations). Conventional cooling methods include cold (4 °C) crystalloid IV fluids, cold sponge baths, bags of ice applied directly to axillae/groin, fans, water- or air-circulating blankets, and iced saline or water NG lavage/bladder instillations.

### The implementation of targeted temperature management: an evidence-based guideline from the Neurocritical Care Society [^114VRsao]. Neurocritical Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Targeted temperature management (TTM) implementation — scope, methods, and intended use are summarized as follows: TTM "encompasses therapeutic hypothermia, controlled normothermia, and treatment of fever", and clinicians using TTM "must select appropriate cooling techniques, provide a reasonable rate of cooling, manage shivering, and ensure adequate patient monitoring among other challenges". The Neurocritical Care Society formed a writing Committee "in 2015" that "generated a set of 16 clinical questions relevant to TTM using the PICO format" and conducted a literature search "with no back date through November 2016 with additional references up to March 2017". The Committee "utilized GRADE methodology to adjudicate the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low" and developed recommendations only after considering "the quality of evidence, relative risks and benefits, patient values and preferences, and resource allocation". The guideline "is intended for neurocritical care clinicians who have chosen to use TTM in patient care; it is not meant to provide guidance regarding the clinical indications for TTM itself", and while some areas support strong recommendations, "many of the recommendations are conditional, and must be contextualized to individual patient and system needs".

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^116kwcWU]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypothermia/Cold exposure — patient care goals include maintaining hemodynamic stability, preventing further heat loss, rewarming the patient in a safe manner, appropriate management of hypothermia induced cardiac arrest, and preventing loss of limbs.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the out-of-hospital evaluation and treatment of accidental hypothermia: 2019 update [^111W4NSo]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for accidental hypothermia, more specifically with respect to out-of-hospital management (patients with severe trauma), WMS 2019 guidelines recommend to initiate early and aggressive active rewarming during all phases of out-of-hospital care to prevent hypothermia in severely injured patients.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for accidental hypothermia, more specifically with respect to out-of-hospital management (passive rewarming), WMS 2019 guidelines recommend to consider allowing alert patients to stand after a period of observation. Advise starting low intensity exercise and increase gradually as tolerated in patients standing without difficulty, and obtain close monitoring. Stop exercising if condition worsens and initiate treatment accordingly.

### Management of pitfalls for the successful clinical use of hypothermia treatment [^1178WGLm]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2009). Low credibility.

Therapeutic hypothermia is a promising method for controlling intracranial pressure (ICP) in severely brain-injured patients. However, clinical data regarding the effect of brain hypothermia on overall outcome of these patients is limited. This may be because there are specific pitfalls associated with the clinical management of induced hypothermia in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). These pitfalls may be avoided by preventing specific risk factors when cooling is induced and with rewarming. However, these risk factors have not been well systematically discussed in the literature. In this paper, three categories of clinical issues regarding the management of brain hypothermia are discussed: (1) stress-induced secondary brain injury mechanisms; (2) technical aspects of intensive care unit (ICU) cooling management; and (3) rewarming rates and methods. For patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of less than 8, management of stress-induced insulin-resistant hyperglycemia, and unstable systemic circulation due to impaired cardiac contractility are especially important. For example, in our experience, posttraumatic hyperglycemia, exacerbated by cooling, may be ameliorated by the administration of a ketone body with mannitol. Prevention of selective free radical damage to neurons is also an important target for successful brain hypothermia treatment. Taken together, it is clear that several orchestrated steps should be initiated to enhance the protective effects of hypothermia therapy and prevent these possible pitfalls.

### A recommended early goal-directed management guideline for the prevention of hypothermia-related transfusion, morbidity, and mortality in severely injured trauma patients [^1126Xp1m]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

At this point, most trauma patients will then be transferred to the computed tomography room for diagnostic imaging, directly to the operating room, or to an observation unit — usually the ICU or the emergency room. There is considerable variation in the availability of different warming techniques, and therefore our algorithm should be customized to each patient's injuries and hospital resources. Level 1 and Level 2 warming strategies should continue throughout the transfer process based on their feasibility and the availability of equipment. The techniques should be used in combination with each other if necessary and we support the option of changing to more invasive treatment levels if hypothermia is inadequately controlled.

After the patient has been transferred to an observation unit, warming protocols should continue based on the unit's own protocols. If a unit does not have a warming protocol we suggest continuing with the same strategies as already outlined. Rewarming to a minimum core temperature of 36 °C is advisable prior to transfer unless the patient is stable and some semblance of temperature homeostasis is achieved. This will guarantee adequate warming before transferring the patient to another unit where rewarming in trauma may not be a priority. However, rewarming should cease after 37 °C because temperatures in this range are also associated with poor outcome and increased mortality.

Regarding medical management for accidental hypothermia, more specifically with respect to vasopressors, WMS 2019 guidelines recommend to do not administer vasoactive drugs until the patient has been rewarmed to 30 °C.
Extend dosing intervals twice as long as usual while keeping the usual doses in patients with a core temperature of 30–35 °C, to minimize the potential toxic accumulation of medication.

### Translational barriers and opportunities for emergency preservation and resuscitation in severe injuries [^113vNoRB]. The British Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Hypothermia is commonly used for organ and tissue preservation in multiple clinical settings, but its role in the management of injured patients remains controversial. There is no doubt that temperature modulation is a powerful tool, and hypothermia has been shown to protect cells during ischaemia and reperfusion, decrease organ damage and improve survival. Yet hypothermia is a double-edged sword: unless carefully managed, its induction can be associated with a number of complications.

Methods

A literature review was performed to include important papers that address the impact of hypothermia on key biological processes, and explore the potential therapeutic role of hypothermia in trauma/haemorrhage models.

Results

No clinical studies have been conducted to test the therapeutic benefits of hypothermia in injured patients. However, numerous well designed animal studies support this concept. Despite excellent preclinical data, there are several potential barriers to translating hypothermia into clinical practice.

Conclusion

Therapeutic hypothermia is a promising life-saving strategy. Appropriate patient selection requires a thorough understanding of how temperature modulation affects various biological mechanisms.

### Perspective: the top 11 priorities to improve trauma outcomes, from system to patient level [^111nF2LV]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

At the level of an individual patient, protocols for investigating and treating patients after severe physical trauma are beguilingly straightforward: stop major haemorrhage, open the airway while protecting the cervical spine, ensure adequate breathing, maintain an adequate circulation, assess disability and act to reduce further neurological damage, and expose the patient to identify all injuries while paying attention to environmental temperature so as not to worsen hypothermia. These concepts have now been taught to thousands of clinicians worldwide in Advanced Trauma Life Support courses and their derivatives. Such priorities arose in an era when it was sufficient for medical practice to "make sense", without the need for comparative evidence generated from randomised controlled trials. Perhaps this is appropriate when logic and benefit are so clear. However, clinical innovations in modern trauma care — such as retrograde endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta, or various prehospital transfusion interventions — are expensive and seek progressively smaller incremental improvements in outcome. Accordingly, many believe these require evaluation in randomised controlled trials with cost-effectiveness analyses. However, trauma presents challenges to conventional clinical trial design: patient heterogeneity, the need to randomise within a short time window, inability to obtain patient (and often substitute decision-maker) consent, the typically brief period of the experimental intervention, and outcomes affected by multiple factors other than the intervention all work together to make it difficult to observe the effect of any experimental treatment. With notable exceptions, most clinical trials in trauma have not shown a benefit of what appeared promising interventions. Despite this, population mortality and case fatality rate from accidental injury are falling dramatically in many trauma systems worldwide. If individual clinical interventions are not responsible — what is? This paper explores the answer to this question, seeking evidence for what might be considered the top 11 priorities for trauma systems worldwide.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prevention of drowning: 2019 update [^117HZBCE]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Initial resuscitation — hypothermia management notes that water is thermally neutral at approximately 33°C (91°F), and because most patients drown in cooler water, concomitant hypothermia is common.

### A recommended early goal-directed management guideline for the prevention of hypothermia-related transfusion, morbidity, and mortality in severely injured trauma patients [^116K5Z8X]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Hypothermia is present in up to two-thirds of patients with severe injury, although it is often disregarded during the initial resuscitation. Studies have revealed that hypothermia is associated with mortality in a large percentage of trauma cases when the patient's temperature is below 32 °C. Risk factors include the severity of injury, wet clothing, low transport unit temperature, use of anesthesia, and prolonged surgery. Fortunately, associated coagulation disorders have been shown to completely resolve with aggressive warming. Selected passive and active warming techniques can be applied in damage control resuscitation. While treatment guidelines exist for acidosis and bleeding, there is no evidence-based approach to managing hypothermia in trauma patients. We synthesized a goal-directed algorithm for warming the severely injured patient that can be directly incorporated into current Advanced Trauma Life Support guidelines. This involves the early use of warming blankets and removal of wet clothing in the prehospital phase followed by aggressive rewarming on arrival at the hospital if the patient's injuries require damage control therapy. Future research in hypothermia management should concentrate on applying this treatment algorithm and should evaluate its influence on patient outcomes. This treatment strategy may help to reduce blood loss and improve morbidity and mortality in this population of patients.

### The implementation of targeted temperature management: an evidence-based guideline from the Neurocritical Care Society [^112FXvMw]. Neurocritical Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Guideline methods and recommendation framework — Using the GRADE framework, the Committee generated a set of 16 clinical questions and undertook a comprehensive literature search of the PubMed, CINAHL, PLUS, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Joanna Briggs Institute Evidence-Based Practice databases with no back date through November 2016, also including bibliographies and personal files with references up to March 2017. The Committee did not consider articles in languages other than English, non-human studies, or unpublished presentations, and at least two Committee members reviewed abstracts with full-text review to select final references. Evidence quality was adjudicated as high, moderate, low, or very low; recommendations were generated only after considering the quality of evidence, relative risks and benefits, patient values and preferences, and resource allocation, and recommendations were classified as strong ("we recommend") or conditional ("we suggest"), with "good practice statements" provided where there was insufficient evidence to support recommendations.

### What is the right temperature to cool post-cardiac arrest patients? [^11439jnU]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Commentary

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a devastating and traumatic event for the patient and their family. Even if the patient survives the initial event the ischemia and the reperfusion injury lead to tissue destruction and loss of neuronal function.

One of the major breakthroughs in managing post-cardiac arrest patients is the implementation of hypothermia, which has shown promising results in improving neurological function and survival. The earliest recorded application of therapeutic cooling in medicine dates back about 5000 years; its use became widespread after publication of two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in 2002, which demonstrated safety and efficacy of mild (32 °C to 34 °C) cooling after cardiac arrest (CA). These initial trials were followed by numerous nonrandomized studies showing improved outcomes when therapeutic hypothermia was introduced. Based on the two RCTs and subsequent supporting evidence, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation and American Heart Association guidelines recommend the use of cooling to 32 to 34 °C after witnessed CA when the initial rhythm was pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF). This was supported by a Cochrane analysis.

However, the evidence underpinning use of hypothermia in CA patients was subsequently criticized. The largest RCT had excluded more than 90% of screened patients and had not applied temperature management in controls, where the average temperature was 37.8 °C; the other RCT did successfully maintain normothermia in controls, but here randomization had been by day of the month instead of per patient, and differences in this (much smaller) study barely achieved statistical significance. Harmful effects of fever are well recognized; based on the two RCTs, it could not be ruled out that strict fever management alone could be sufficient to prevent temperature-induced neurological damage.

This led to the initiation of a much larger multicenter RCT to compare two targeted temperature regimens (mild hypothermia of 33 °C versus near normal body temperature of 36 °C) in 939 unconscious survivors of OHCA of presumed cardiac cause after sustained return of spontaneous circulation. The intervention period of 36 hours commenced at the time of randomization and the goal was to achieve the assigned core temperature as rapidly as possible using different cooling methods and to maintain this temperature for 24 hours, followed by rewarming at a rate of 0.5 °C per hour to 37 °C and maintaining this in both groups for another 72 hours. Recommendation for continuation or withdrawal of therapy was done in a blinded fashion at 72 hours based on clinical parameters and by sensory-evoked potentials and/or electroencephalogram as indicated.

A potential treatment algorithm

A potential strategy for early goal-directed therapy of hypothermia amongst trauma patients is detailed in Fig. 1. No randomized outcome data are available to provide a systematic review. Instead, we have described all available evidence and provided expert opinion to create a pragmatic treatment strategy that can be implemented in most major trauma centers. We intend to evaluate the efficacy of this protocol in an upcoming prospective trial based in Toronto, ON, Canada. This treatment protocol is divided into three sequential stages of resuscitation: prehospital, hospital, and observation phases.

Warming strategies have been grouped into graded "Levels" based on their evidence of successful application in trauma and ease of implementation. Level 1 includes both passive and active external strategies for mild hypothermia and can be easily applied. Level 2 includes heating pads, radiant heaters, warming blankets, and humidified gases. These techniques should be considered if a patient has a temperature between 32 and 36 °C. Level 3 rewarming is reserved for patients with severe hypothermia (< 32 °C) whose condition is precarious enough to warrant invasive strategies including cavity lavage or extracorporeal circuits.

### A recommended early goal-directed management guideline for the prevention of hypothermia-related transfusion, morbidity, and mortality in severely injured trauma patients [^116YTjdU]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Hypothermia is considered an independent risk factor for mortality. This is related to its initial impairment of cardiovascular function, coagulation, and lactic acidosis followed by respiratory compromise. Risk factors in trauma include prolonged cavity exposure, cold fluids, environmental temperature, prehospital intubation, and severity of injury. Rewarming therapy should begin in the prehospital phase with passive and active warming strategies. This includes heating blankets, warm intravenous fluids, forced-air warmers, humidified gases, and CAVR. While these therapeutic modalities are usually readily available, consistent rewarming of trauma patients is still not effectively performed. We believe a systematic algorithmic approach to managing hypothermia in major trauma will encourage thorough rewarming of each patient and prevent its associated morbidity and mortality.

### ACSM expert consensus statement: injury prevention and exercise performance during cold-weather exercise [^1136RmWK]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2021). High credibility.

Cold-weather hypothermia field management and evacuation guidance note that "Tdeep is < 30°C (86°F) in young and healthy casualties; in the elderly and multimorbid the risk increases at Tdeep < 32°C (89.6°F)". For mildly hypothermic patients in a field environment, warm clothing and drinks with sugar should be given with supervision and active rewarming encouraged; in mild hypothermia cases that recover fully and risk factors are mitigated, there is no need to evacuate. For moderate and severe hypothermia and the critically ill, patients need to be handled very gently (as mechanical impact can trigger cardiac arrest), kept insulated, passively rewarmed slowly (0.75 to 1.0°C·h−1) and evacuated.

### Changes in practice of controlled hypothermia after cardiac arrest in the past 20 years: a critical care perspective [^113se2DP]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

For 20years, induced hypothermia and targeted temperature management have been recommended to mitigate brain injury and increase survival after cardiac arrest. On the basis of animal research and small clinical trials, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation strongly advocated hypothermia at 32–34°C for 12–24hours for comatose patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or nonperfusing ventricular tachycardia. The intervention was implemented worldwide. In the past decade, hypothermia and targeted temperature management have been investigated in larger clinical randomized trials focusing on target temperature depth, target temperature duration, prehospital versus in-hospital initiation, nonshockable rhythms, and in-hospital cardiac arrest. Systematic reviews suggest little or no effect of delivering the intervention on the basis of the summary of evidence, and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation today recommends only to treat fever and keep body temperature below 37.5°C (weak recommendation, low-certainty evidence). Here we describe the evolution of temperature management for patients with cardiac arrest during the past 20years and how the accrued evidence has influenced not only the recommendations but also the guideline process. We also discuss possible paths forward in this field, bringing up both whether fever management is at all beneficial for patients with cardiac arrest and which knowledge gaps future clinical trials in temperature management should address.

### A recommended early goal-directed management guideline for the prevention of hypothermia-related transfusion, morbidity, and mortality in severely injured trauma patients [^112xaxNt]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

During the prehospital phase, first responders should be primarily focused on managing life-threatening injuries. In general, the patient's core body temperature should be the guiding principle for the treatment modality. However, we recognize the difficulty in taking a measurement at this point and recommend all patients be immediately warmed using Level 1 techniques until arrival at the hospital. This includes the removal of wet clothing, warm blankets/forced-air warmer, and limiting cold fluid infusions. Furthermore, more invasive strategies, including extracorporeal circuits, require extensive training to operate and may not be available at the receiving hospital. In any case, emergency medical services should notify the receiving hospital to anticipate and plan for active warming strategies when indicated because Level 2 and Level 3 strategies involve significant set-up time.

In the trauma bay or hospital phase, a temperature should be recorded and rewarming resumed during the exposure stage of the primary survey. If the core temperature is above 36 °C, the patient should be covered with two warm blankets with regular temperature monitoring every 15 min as per Level 1 recommendations. If the temperature drops below 36 °C, the trauma team leader should initiate a warming strategy based on the patient's recorded temperature. This includes adding Level 2 strategies with regular temperature monitoring every 5 min.

The literature search used the MEDLINE database with keywords including hypothermia, accidental hypothermia, wilderness hypothermia, shivering, rewarming, core temperature, and resuscitation, and the panel considered only peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials, observational studies, case series, and case reports, focusing on articles published between 2013 and March 2019. The panel assessed the level of evidence supporting each diagnostic and therapeutic modality, and conclusions from review articles were not used to formulate recommendations, though review articles were cited for background when necessary. Questions considered by the panel included domains labeled FIELD ASSESSMENT, PREHOSPITAL TREATMENT, and TRANSPORT/TRIAGE.

Hypothermia/Cold Exposure — moderate or severe hypothermia management specifies to perform ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation), pulse checks for patients suffering hypothermia should be performed for 60 seconds, and obtain core temperature when possible; core temperatures can be measured by esophageal probe if available with a secured airway and trained clinician, rectal temperatures may also be used with caution to avoid worsening hypothermia by undressing the patient (e.g., in a warm environment such as a heated ambulance), and if neither is available an epitympanic field thermometer with an isolating ear cap may be used but is generally less accurate; care must be taken not to hyperventilate the patient as hypocarbia may reduce the threshold for ventricular fibrillation in the cold patient; prevent further heat loss by removing the patient from the environment, removing wet clothes and drying skin, insulating from the ground, sheltering from wind and wet conditions, insulating with dry clothing or a hypothermia wrap/blanket, and cover the patient with a vapor barrier and, if available, move the patient to a warm environment; initiate field‑rewarming methods such as placement of large heat packs or heat blankets (chemical or electric if feasible) to the anterior chest or wrapped around the patient's thorax if large enough, and chemical or electrical heat sources should never be applied directly to the skin; attempt to keep the patient in the horizontal position, especially limiting motion of the extremities, apply cardiac monitor or AED if available, and establish IV and provide warmed isotonic crystalloid bolus, repeating as necessary.

Wilderness Medical Society accidental hypothermia — definition, settings, and guideline scope are summarized as follows: Accidental hypothermia is defined as an unintentional drop in core temperature to 35°C or lower, can occur during any season and in most climates with cold and wet environments posing the greatest risk, and is associated with urban homelessness particularly with the use of alcohol and other intoxicating substances; it can also occur during resuscitation in emergency settings (iatrogenic hypothermia) and is notably associated with trauma, while therapeutic hypothermia is beyond the scope of this review. The guidelines present the main diagnostic and therapeutic modalities and provide recommendations for the management of hypothermic patients, with recommendations graded based on the quality of supporting evidence and a balance between benefits and risks/burdens according to the criteria published by the American College of Chest Physicians.

Hypothermia/Cold exposure — patient safety considerations during rewarming: Given the additive effects of additional cold stress, the patient should be removed from the cold environment as soon as operationally feasible. In patients suffering from moderate to severe hypothermia, it is critical to not allow these patients to stand or exercise as this may cause circulatory collapse. Devices that self-generate heat that are being utilized during the rewarming process should be wrapped in a barrier to avoid direct contact with the skin and to prevent burns, and available evidence suggests that heat packs with peak temperatures above 45°C (113°F) are most likely to cause burns; in patients who are unresponsive, or unable to recognize a developing injury, check the area regularly to ensure no tissue damage occurs.

### The implementation of targeted temperature management: an evidence-based guideline from the Neurocritical Care Society [^11313aEb]. Neurocritical Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Targeted temperature management (TTM) — duration versus goal-directed therapy — was evaluated across out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), and neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). In OHCA, both OHCA studies showed improved neurologic outcomes, and in severe TBI, TTM for five days as opposed to two days resulted in significantly improved functional outcomes. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) of neonates with HIE randomized to 72 or 120 h of TTM at either 33.5 or 32.0 °C was stopped owing to safety concerns with longer or deeper hypothermia. We suggest at least 24 h of cooling in OHCA patients (Conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). We suggest longer duration TTM for severe TBI patients should ICP control be the goal (Conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). We advise against longer (> 72 h) or deeper (< 32.0 °C) hypothermia in neonates with HIE (Conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Hypothermia and localized cold injuries are largely preventable with proper preparation for activities in cold environments. Proficient field management is crucial to the final outcome in terms of function and viability because proper care is vital to preventing exacerbation of the initial exposure and injury. Rapid rewarming is optimal when further cold exposure can be avoided reliably. Repetitive freeze-thaw cycles are associated with increased morbidity and tissue loss caused by progressive microvascular injury and thrombosis. The subsequent care is largely supportive and consists of wound care and physical and hydrotherapy to promote optimal functional recovery.

### Targeted temperature management for cardiac arrest [^111rM3aa]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Therapeutic hypothermia, or targeted temperature management (TTM), is a strategy of reducing the core body temperature of survivors of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) to minimize neurological damage caused by severe hypoxia. Initial clinical trials examining this technique demonstrated significant improvement in neurological function among survivors of out-of-hospital SCA with an initial shockable rhythm. Since then, TTM has become an integral part of the care provided to comatose survivors of SCA. However, multiple questions persist regarding the target cooling temperature, duration of cooling, and utility of TTM in patient populations such as survivors of out-of-hospital SCA with non-shockable rhythms or in-hospital SCA. This review article summarizes the current evidence regarding optimal application of TTM and compares the recommendations for TTM in current guidelines.

### The implementation of targeted temperature management: an evidence-based guideline from the Neurocritical Care Society [^113wMHSr]. Neurocritical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Targeted temperature management (TTM) is often used in neurocritical care to minimize secondary neurologic injury and improve outcomes. TTM encompasses therapeutic hypothermia, controlled normothermia, and treatment of fever. TTM is best supported by evidence from neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, although it has also been explored in ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, and intracranial hemorrhage patients. Critical care clinicians using TTM must select appropriate cooling techniques, provide a reasonable rate of cooling, manage shivering, and ensure adequate patient monitoring among other challenges.

Methods

The Neurocritical Care Society recruited experts in neurocritical care, nursing, and pharmacotherapy to form a writing Committee in 2015. The group generated a set of 16 clinical questions relevant to TTM using the PICO format. With the assistance of a research librarian, the Committee undertook a comprehensive literature search with no back date through November 2016 with additional references up to March 2017.

Results

The Committee utilized GRADE methodology to adjudicate the quality of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low based on their confidence that the estimate of effect approximated the true effect. They generated recommendations regarding the implementation of TTM based on this systematic review only after considering the quality of evidence, relative risks and benefits, patient values and preferences, and resource allocation.

Conclusion

This guideline is intended for neurocritical care clinicians who have chosen to use TTM in patient care; it is not meant to provide guidance regarding the clinical indications for TTM itself. While there are areas of TTM practice where clear evidence guides strong recommendations, many of the recommendations are conditional, and must be contextualized to individual patient and system needs.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hypothermia [^114J7KXM]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Although hypothermia is most common in patients who are exposed to a cold environment, it can develop secondary to toxin exposure, metabolic derangements, infections, and dysfunction of the central nervous and endocrine systems. The clinical presentation of hypothermia includes a spectrum of symptoms and is grouped into the following three categories: mild, moderate, and severe. Management depends on the degree of hypothermia present. Treatment modalities range from noninvasive, passive external warming techniques (e.g., removal of cold, wet clothing; movement to a warm environment) to active external rewarming (e.g., insulation with warm blankets) to active core rewarming (e.g., warmed intravenous fluid infusions, heated humidified oxygen, body cavity lavage, and extracorporeal blood warming). Mild to moderate hypothermia is treated easily with supportive care in most clinical settings and has good patient outcomes. The treatment of severe hypothermia is more complex, and outcomes depend heavily on clinical resources. Prevention and recognition of atypical presentations are essential to reducing the rates of morbidity and mortality associated with this condition.

### Should we treat pyrexia? And how do we do it? [^113KqmGJ]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

The concept of pyrexia as a protective physiological response to aid in host defence has been challenged with the awareness of the severe metabolic stress induced by pyrexia. The host response to pyrexia varies, however, according to the disease profile and severity and, as such, the management of pyrexia should differ; for example, temperature control is safe and effective in septic shock but remains controversial in sepsis. From the reported findings discussed in this review, treating pyrexia appears to be beneficial in septic shock, out of hospital cardiac arrest and acute brain injury. Multiple therapeutic options are available for managing pyrexia, with precise targeted temperature management now possible. Notably, the use of pharmacotherapy versus surface cooling has not been shown to be advantageous. The importance of avoiding hypothermia in any treatment strategy is not to be understated. Whilst a great deal of progress has been made regarding optimal temperature management in recent years, further studies will be needed to determine which patients would benefit the most from control of pyrexia and by which means this should be implemented. This narrative review is part of a series on the pathophysiology and management of pyrexia.

### Methods of cooling: practical aspects of therapeutic temperature management [^113C8oif]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review traditional and newer means of inducing, maintaining, and withdrawing therapeutic hypothermia and normothermia. To suggest treatment algorithms for temperature modulation and review neuromonitoring options.

Design

A review of current literature describing methods of performing therapeutic temperature management and neuromonitoring during the cooling, maintenance, and decooling periods. Algorithms for performing therapeutic temperature management are suggested.

Results

Temperature management can be safely and effectively performed using traditional or newer modalities. Although traditional means of cooling are feasible and efficacious, modern devices utilizing feedback loops to maintain steady body temperature and prevent overcooling have advantages in ease of application, patient safety, maintenance of target temperature, and control of decooling. Neuromonitoring options should be adapted to an individual patient and situation.

Conclusions

Intensivists should be familiar with techniques to induce, maintain, and withdraw therapeutic temperature management, and select the most appropriate method for a given patient and situation.

Out-of-hospital treatment — rescuer safety and initial priorities: Rescuer safety is the first priority during rescue, and the scene may be unsafe to enter or allow only brief entry; unless there are obvious fatal injuries, rescuers might need to move the patient to a safe place before deciding to resuscitate. The decision to rescue or resuscitate a patient can only be made after the scene is secure and safe for the rescuers to enter and make an evaluation (Evidence grade: 1A). After rescuer safety has been assured, the priorities for out-of-hospital treatment of a hypothermic patient who is not in cardiac arrest are to avoid causing cardiovascular collapse during rescue, prevent further decrease in core temperature (afterdrop), and rewarm the patient in a safe manner, and if a hypothermic patient is in cardiac arrest, rescuers should, if indicated, initiate resuscitation.

NASEMSO hypothermia/cold exposure — cardiac arrest care specifies that normal medication intervals may be adopted when the patient reaches 35°C (95°F). Upon ROSC, treat per Adult Post-ROSC Care Guideline. Patients with severe hypothermia and arrest may benefit from resuscitation even after prolonged downtime, and survival with intact neurologic function has been observed even after prolonged resuscitation; patients should not be considered deceased until rewarming has been attempted. If a hypothermic patient clearly suffered cardiac arrest and subsequently became hypothermic afterward with prolonged down time between arrest and rescue, there is no rationale for initiating resuscitation and warming the patient.

### Damage control surgery and intensive care [^111YbEMT]. Injury (2004). Low credibility.

The introduction and establishment of the 'damage control surgery' concept has led to increasing numbers of severely injured and unstable patients being presented to Intensive Care Units (ICU) for ongoing resuscitation. These patients present many challenges for the Intensive Care team and emphasise the need for a multidisciplinary approach to optimise trauma patient management. Multiple issues need to be addressed simultaneously while the overall aim is to rapidly achieve a physiological environment that will allow the best possible recovery. The 'lethal triad' of hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulopathy due to initial hypovolaemia require aggressive correction. From the outset ICU management must also attempt to minimise the complications of these injuries and the resuscitative process. This review will address some of the key issues relating to the care of these patients in the ICU.

Delay exercise to protect against afterdrop — Allowing the patient to shiver and rewarm, while insulated and before exercise, should help minimize afterdrop, and this time period should last 30 min but will depend upon the situation. Standing upright increases blood flow to and from the legs, worsening afterdrop and potentially decreasing blood pressure, and exercise initiated immediately after rescue may cause a greater afterdrop in core temperature than if the patient remains at rest. A shivering patient who may be hypothermic should be kept as warm as possible, given calorie replacement, and observed before exercising; after this period of observation, the alert patient may be allowed to stand. If the patient can stand without difficulty, exercise intensity should start low and increase gradually as tolerated; the patient should be closely monitored; if the condition worsens, the patient should stop exercising and be treated accordingly (Evidence grade: 1C).

### A recommended early goal-directed management guideline for the prevention of hypothermia-related transfusion, morbidity, and mortality in severely injured trauma patients [^117YJa7p]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Major or severe trauma is the primary cause of death in up to 10% of all deaths worldwide. It is defined as having an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 15 or greater. Inadvertent injuries are the sixth leading cause of death and the fifth leading cause of severe disability internationally. Hypothermia has been shown to exacerbate morbidity and mortality in severely injured trauma patients. Dr Benjamin Rush, the surgeon-general of military hospitals, first described this phenomenon during the American Revolutionary War. Within that time period, he eventually prohibited wet clothing for injured soldiers in order to avoid more serious complications. Cold-related injuries were further described in World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War as causing significant morbidity and mortality and effectively altering the outcome of several strategic encounters. The lessons learned from these conflicts led to a change in over 30 clinical practice guidelines in combat conflicts, including the Iraq War. This protocol incorporated damage control resuscitation with performance improvement initiatives and led to a decrease in the rate of hypothermia from 7% to 1%.

### Hypothermia for acute brain injury – mechanisms and practical aspects [^111zjFyQ]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypothermia is widely accepted as the gold-standard method by which the body can protect the brain. Therapeutic cooling — or targeted temperature management (TTM) — is increasingly being used to prevent secondary brain injury in patients admitted to the emergency department and intensive care unit. Rapid cooling to 33 °C for 24 h is considered the standard of care for minimizing neurological injury after cardiac arrest, mild-to-moderate hypothermia (33–35 °C) can be used as an effective component of multimodal therapy for patients with elevated intracranial pressure, and advanced cooling technology can control fever in patients who have experienced trauma, haemorrhagic stroke, or other forms of severe brain injury. However, the practical application of therapeutic hypothermia is not trivial, and the treatment carries risks. Development of clinical management protocols that focus on detection and control of shivering and minimize the risk of other potential complications of TTM will be essential to maximize the benefits of this emerging therapeutic modality. This Review provides an overview of the potential neuroprotective mechanisms of hypothermia, practical considerations for the application of TTM, and disease-specific evidence for the use of this therapy in patients with acute brain injuries.

### Accidental hypothermia [^114CCPXp]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

Accidental hypothermia has produced many cases of intact survival even after prolonged cardiac arrest, but it is also often fatal.

### The prehospital management of hypothermia-an up-to-date overview [^114DBJbP]. Injury (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Accidental hypothermia concerns a body core temperature of less than 35°C without a primary defect in the thermoregulatory system. It is a serious threat to prehospital patients and especially injured patients, since it can induce a vicious cycle of the synergistic effects of hypothermia, acidosis and coagulopathy; referred to as the trauma triad of death. To prevent or manage deterioration of a cold patient, treatment of hypothermia should ideally begin prehospital. Little effort has been made to integrate existent literature about prehospital temperature management. The aim of this study is to provide an up-to-date systematic overview of the currently available treatment modalities and their effectiveness for prehospital hypothermia management.

Data Sources

Databases PubMed, EMbase and MEDLINE were searched using the terms: "hypothermia", "accidental hypothermia", "Emergency Medical Services" and "prehospital". Articles with publications dates up to October 2017 were included and selected by the authors based on relevance.

Results

The literature search produced 903 articles, out of which 51 focused on passive insulation and/or active heating. The most effective insulation systems combined insulation with a vapor barrier. Active external rewarming interventions include chemical, electrical and charcoal-burning heat packs; chemical or electrical heated blankets; and forced air warming. Mildly hypothermic patients, with significant endogenous heat production from shivering, will likely be able to rewarm themselves with only insulation and a vapor barrier, although active warming will still provide comfort and an energy-saving benefit. For colder, non-shivering patients, the addition of active warming is indicated as a non-shivering patient will not rewarm spontaneously. All intravenous fluids must be reliably warmed before infusion.

Conclusion

Although it is now accepted that prehospital warming is safe and advantageous, especially for a non-shivering hypothermic patient, this review reveals that no insulation/heating combinations stand significantly above all the others. However, modern designs of hypothermia wraps have shown promise and battery-powered inline fluid warmers are practical devices to warm intravenous fluids prior to infusion. Future research in this field is necessary to assess the effectiveness expressed in patient outcomes.

Regarding specific circumstances for cardiac arrest, more specifically with respect to patients with accidental hypothermia, WMS 2019 guidelines recommend to perform immediate, high-quality CPR in patients with hypothermia and cardiac arrest. Perform delayed or intermittent CPR if immediate and continuous CPR is impossible or unsafe. Do not delay compressions for > 10 minutes, a conservative interval based on the uncontrolled nature of the out-of-hospital hypothermic cardiac arrest. Perform compressions for a minimum of 5 minutes with interruptions between periods of compressions < 5 minutes, if continuous CPR is not possible.

### Hypothermia: pathophysiology and the propensity for infection [^111FfHGP]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypothermia in combination with infection presents a complex challenge in clinical and battlefield medicine. Multifaceted physiological and immunological consequences of hypothermia drastically change the risk, progression, and treatment of a concomitant infection. Managing hypothermia and infection in extreme cold settings is particularly relevant in an era with increased risk of military operations in Polar climates. Here, we discuss the elevated instance of infection during accidental and therapeutic hypothermia and speculate how a compromised immune system may contribute. We focus on skin and soft tissue infections and sepsis, which are among the serious infectious complications of hypothermia and battlefield injuries. We also present the challenges associated with treating infections under hypothermic conditions. Finally, we advocate for a renewed focus on identifying causal relationships between hypothermia and infection risk and assessing established infection treatment regiments in hypothermic patients to enhance trauma management and survival outcomes in hypothermia-related injuries.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^112oJdjY]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Since coagulopathy following traumatic injury increases mortality, it is recommended to target "normothermia", with a core temperature between 36 and 37 °C in order to create optimal preconditions for coagulation. Hypothermia, a core body temperature < 35 °C, is associated with acidosis, hypotension and coagulopathy in severely affected patients. The effects of hypothermia include altered platelet function, impaired coagulation factor function (a 1 °C drop in temperature is associated with a 10% drop in function), enzyme inhibition and fibrinolysis. Body temperatures below 34 °C compromise blood coagulation, but this has only been observed when coagulation tests (PT and APTT) are performed at the low temperatures present in patients with hypothermia, but not when assessed at 37 °C, as is routine practice for such laboratory tests.

The profound clinical effects of hypothermia ultimately lead to higher morbidity and mortality, and hypothermic patients require more blood products. In a retrospective study of 604 trauma patients who required massive transfusion, a logistic regression analysis demonstrated that a temperature lower than 34 °C was associated with a greater independent risk of mortality of more than 80% after controlling for differences in shock, coagulopathy, injury severity and transfusion requirements [OR 1.87; 95% CI 1.18–3.0; p = 0.007]. A recent study performed a secondary analysis using 10 years of data from the Pennsylvania Trauma Outcome Study (PTOS). It analysed 11,033 patients with severe TBI and demonstrated that spontaneous hypothermia at hospital admission was associated with a significant increase in the risk of mortality. Steps to prevent hypothermia and the risk of hypothermia-induced coagulopathy include removing wet clothing, covering the patient to avoid additional heat loss, increasing the ambient temperature, forced air warming, warm fluid therapy, and, in extreme cases, extracorporeal re-warming devices. Recently, the use of a hypothermia prevention and management kit has been advocated. This kit is a low-cost, lightweight, low-volume commercial product that sustains 10 h of continuous dry heat with an oxygen-activated, self-heating liner and provides thermal insulation due to the multi-layer composite construction of the outer shell. The kit was designed to prevent hypothermia during tactical casualty evacuation; however, application in the civilian sector for the active re-warming of trauma patients is conceivable. In comparison to other methods and devices, the hypothermia prevention and management kit achieved and maintained significantly higher temperatures than all other methods and controls at 120 min.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the out-of-hospital evaluation and treatment of accidental hypothermia: 2019 update [^112k85f7]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Accidental hypothermia — body-to-body rewarming: Body-to-body rewarming of a shivering patient with a warm person in a sleeping bag blunts the increase in shivering thermogenesis, resulting in rewarming rates no greater than shivering alone. Body-to-body rewarming may make the cold patient more comfortable due to decreased shivering, but at the cost of delaying evacuation. Recommendation. Body-to-body rewarming can be used in mild hypothermia to increase patient thermal comfort if enough personnel are available and it does not delay evacuation to definitive care (Evidence grade: 1B).

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^1129MBu7]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Hypothermia/Cold exposure — airway and medication use in severe hypothermia with cardiac arrest: Manage the airway per standard care in cardiac arrest victims. In the absence of advanced airways, ventilate the patient at the same rate as a normothermic patient. If the patient has an advanced airway, ventilate at half the rate recommended for a normothermic patient to prevent hyperventilation, and if EtCO2 is available, ventilate to maintain normal EtCO2 levels. There is little evidence to guide use of medications in severe hypothermia with cardiac arrest; 2010 AHA updates to advanced cardiac life support recommend use of vasopressors according to standard ACLS protocols while the 2014 Alaska guidelines and the Wilderness Medical Society's accidental hypothermia guideline advises medications should be withheld until the patient's core temperature is greater than 30°C (86°F). Above 30°C (86°F), intervals between medication provision should be doubled.

Field rewarming — The rewarming methods described in this section achieve the safe rewarming rate of 1 to 2°C h−1 and minimize the risk of afterdrop. Afterdrop can lead to hemodynamic instability and VF, and the risk of afterdrop is reduced by limiting limb movement and by keeping the patient horizontal.

Acute ischemic stroke — temperature management: Sources of hyperthermia (temperature > 38°C) should be identified and treated, and antipyretic medications should be administered to lower temperature in hyperthermic patients with stroke. Peak temperature in the first 24 hours < 37°C and > 39°C was associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death compared with normothermia in 9366 patients with AIS. The benefit of induced hypothermia for treating patients with ischemic stroke is not well established, and hypothermia should be offered only in the context of ongoing clinical trials; most studies suggest induction of hypothermia is associated with an increase in the risk of infection, including pneumonia.

### A recommended early goal-directed management guideline for the prevention of hypothermia-related transfusion, morbidity, and mortality in severely injured trauma patients [^115fDWTB]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, the adoption of civilian hypothermia prevention has been slower, necessitating the use of military data to augment our understanding. In 1987, Luna et al. evaluated 94 trauma patients at a regional trauma center and discovered that hypothermia occurred in two-thirds of the cohort. Core temperature has been subsequently found to be inversely related to mortality regardless of the incidence of shock, resuscitation fluid, or ISS. Gentilello et al. confirmed that hypothermia was associated with serious morbidity and mortality in trauma (7% vs. 43% mortality) in a randomized trial. More importantly, however, reducing the period of hypothermia increased the probability of successful resuscitation.

Heat loss typically occurs at a rate of 60–75 kcal/h by four different methods: radiation, conduction, evaporation, and convection, as detailed in Table 1. Amongst trauma patients, heat loss is increased to 400 kcal/h and even mild hypothermia can result in significant morbidity. A separate classification system has therefore been defined for this patient population (Table 2): mild hypothermia (34–36 °C), moderate hypothermia (32–34 °C), and severe hypothermia (< 32 °C), where normothermia is 37 ± 0.5 °C. The efficacy of these temperature guidelines has not been formally investigated, but they have been adopted universally because of the negative physiological impact of hypothermia below 32 °C. Danzl et al. aptly described this effect in their multicenter survey where severe hypothermia was associated with 84.9% of casualties.

Damage control resuscitation focuses on the treatment of acidosis, coagulopathy, and hypothermia, also known as the "lethal triad", in lieu of early definitive management. While treatment guidelines already exist for acidosis and bleeding, there is no evidence-based systematic approach for managing hypothermia in trauma patients. This review will attempt to consolidate the evidence surrounding hypothermia management in trauma patients and propose a goal-directed treatment algorithm to prevent further morbidity and mortality.

### Door-to-targeted temperature management initiation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a new quality metric in postresuscitation care? [^113r3fAF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The timing of hypothermia initiation after ROSC has been extensively evaluated. Although animal data suggested an incremental benefit with cooling initiated as early as within 15 minutes from ROSC, human observation studies have reported mixed results. 12 Although some reports suggested that TTM administration in this setting was time sensitive, others failed to identify such an association. 13, 14, 15, 16 The excitement about faster TTM initiation after ROSC was tempered by the negative results of 7 randomized studies comparing prehospital cooling, either during arrest or shortly after, against standard hospital initiation of TTM. 17 The interpretation of these trials was hampered by important design flaws, including small sample sizes, lack of blinding of outcomes assessment, absence of mandated rewarming protocols, and a significant proportion of patients who did not receive the intended treatment. In addition, concerns exist that the prehospital induction with large volumes of ice‐cold solution, as the designated test intervention, might have adverse consequences that confounded the results. 17, 18 Consequently, whether earlier initiation with TTM provides incremental benefit in cardiac arrest survivors remains debatable.

### Overview… [^1163RQMj]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Hypothermia is a dangerous condition that can happen when a person is exposed to extremely cold temperatures.
- Stay safe this winter by learning more about hypothermia, including who is most at risk, signs and symptoms, and what to do if someone develops hypothermia. Overview What is hypothermia.
- Hypothermia can happen when a person is exposed to very cold temperature for a long period of time. When exposed to cold temperatures, your body begins to lose heat faster than it's produced. Lengthy exposures will eventually use up your body's stored energy, which leads to lower body temperature.
- Body temperature that is too low affects the brain, making the victim unable to think clearly or move well. This makes hypothermia especially dangerous, because a person may not know that it's happening and won't be able to do anything about it. Don't wait — take action Hypothermia is a medical emergency.

If you notice any of the above signs, take the person's temperature. If it is below 95° F, get medical attention immediately. If you are not able to get medical help right away, try to warm the person up.
- Get the person into a warm room or shelter.
- Remove any wet clothing the person is wearing.
- Warm the center of the person's body — chest, neck, head, and groin — using an electric blanket, if available. You can also use skin-to-skin contact under loose, dry layers of blankets, clothing, towels, or sheets.
- Warm drinks can help increase body temperature, but do not give alcoholic drinks. Do not try to give beverages to an unconscious person.
- After body temperature has increased, keep the person dry and wrap their body, including their head and neck, in a warm blanket.
- Get the person proper medical attention as soon as possible. Severe hypothermia A person with severe hypothermia may be unconscious and may not seem to have a pulse or to be breathing.
- In this case, handle the person gently, and get emergency assistance immediately.
- Perform CPR, even if the person appears dead. CPR should continue until the person responds or medical aid becomes available. Keep warming the person while performing CPR. In some cases, hypothermia victims who appear to be dead can be successfully resuscitated.
