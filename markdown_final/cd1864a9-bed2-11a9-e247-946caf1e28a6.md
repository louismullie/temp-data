## Question

How should you counsel parents of a stable 30-week preterm infant who ask whether immediate skin-to-skin contact will improve their child's cognitive development?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to counsel parents of a stable 30-week preterm infant about whether immediate skin-to-skin contact will improve their child's cognitive development. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality direct evidence for immediate skin-to-skin contact and cognitive outcomes. Then, I should verify the magnitude and clinical relevance of any observed effects. Next, I will consider indirect and conflicting evidence, including dose, timing, and mechanism. After that, I need to weigh benefits versus risks and align with guidelines. Finally, I will translate this into practical, balanced counseling that sets expectations and highlights actionable steps parents can take to support development.

> Let me first confirm the most direct evidence. The pivotal randomized clinical trial in very preterm infants (28–31 weeks) tested 2 hours of immediate mother–infant skin-to-skin contact in the delivery room versus standard incubator care and found no significant difference in cognitive outcomes at 2–3 years using the Bayley-III, with a mean difference of 0.21 points and a 95% CI crossing zero, indicating no benefit on the primary endpoint [^e27dd69b] [^3ec145dd] [^6f326d09].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical relevance of that effect size. A 0.21-point difference on a normed scale with mean 100 and SD 15 is not clinically meaningful, and the proportion at risk of developmental delay was similar between groups, reinforcing that immediate SSC did not improve cognitive outcomes in this population and setting [^e27dd69b] [^3ec145dd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should review conflicting evidence. Observational cohort data from EPIPAGE-2 suggested that SSC during the first week of life was associated with a modest increase in full-scale IQ at 5.5 years, but this was not a randomized comparison and is vulnerable to confounding despite propensity weighting, so causality cannot be inferred from that association [^c869e673] [^e239d674] [^96391a5d].

> I need to check mechanistic and dose-related signals. Neuroimaging work links greater amounts of NICU skin-to-skin care with white matter microstructure differences, and higher SSC frequency correlates with improved vagal tone and shorter ventilation/oxygen days, suggesting biologic plausibility. However, these are observational and do not establish that a single 2-hour immediate session changes long-term cognition, so I should be cautious about overinterpreting them for counseling [^8adaf8e1] [^0c262fae] [^144a2e0d].

> Next, I should review safety and feasibility in this gestational window. Randomized trials in very preterm infants show immediate SSC is safe and feasible with appropriate monitoring, with no excess hypothermia or adverse events in the first hours, and physiologic parameters remain stable, which supports offering SSC when clinically appropriate without undue risk [^8102f5c8] [^6694769f] [^b65718e6].

> Let me consider other proven benefits that parents value. Immediate SSC increases breastfeeding at discharge and duration, and is associated with improved parent–infant interaction quality and reduced parental stress, which are meaningful family-centered outcomes even if they do not directly translate into improved 2–3 year cognitive scores in RCTs [^e27dd69b] [^d443d902] [^6d9ac570] [^3d3d1b69].

> I should confirm alignment with guidelines. Contemporary guidance emphasizes early SSC for preterm infants for physiologic stability, thermoregulation, and breastfeeding support, while acknowledging that evidence for long-term cognitive gains from a single immediate session is limited. This supports offering SSC for its established benefits without overstating cognitive outcomes [^487cb408] [^bbd17675] [^b9af443a].

> But wait, what if parents ask about dose and timing. I need to explain that most positive neurodevelopmental signals come from repeated, sometimes prolonged SSC during the NICU stay rather than a single 2-hour delivery-room session, and that ongoing, family-integrated developmental care and breastfeeding support are the more consistent pathways to improved outcomes, so parents should prioritize sustained SSC as the infant stabilizes and throughout hospitalization when possible [^5491138a] [^90116fcc] [^cb8d839f].

> Let me synthesize a balanced, honest message. Based on the best available randomized evidence, immediate skin-to-skin contact for 2 hours in the delivery room does not improve cognitive development at 2–3 years compared with standard care, so parents should not expect a direct cognitive boost from that single early session. However, immediate SSC is safe, supports breastfeeding, and may enhance parent–infant bonding and stress regulation, and ongoing SSC during the NICU stay may contribute to developmental resilience, so families should engage in SSC for these proven benefits while also pursuing comprehensive developmental support and follow-up [^e27dd69b] [^8102f5c8] [^5491138a] [^90116fcc].

> I should double-check practical next steps. Parents can advocate for early SSC once the infant is stable, aim for frequent SSC sessions during hospitalization as tolerated, and prioritize breastfeeding and family-integrated developmental care. They should also schedule standardized developmental follow-up and consider early intervention referrals if concerns arise, recognizing that cumulative, family-centered experiences likely matter more than a single immediate session for long-term cognition [^1c137a21] [^cb8d839f] [^90116fcc].

Immediate skin-to-skin contact (SSC) in the delivery room does not **improve cognitive outcomes** at 2–3 years in stable 30-week preterm infants, according to a high-quality RCT [^e27dd69b]. However, SSC is **safe and feasible**, and it increases breastfeeding at discharge and up to 12 months, which may indirectly support development [^e27dd69b] [^d443d902]. Parents should be counseled that SSC is encouraged for bonding and breastfeeding, but it should not be expected to enhance long-term cognition in this context [^e27dd69b] [^29f20755].

---

## Evidence on cognitive outcomes

The most direct evidence comes from a randomized clinical trial (RCT) in very preterm infants (28–31 weeks), including stable 30-week infants, which found **no significant difference** in cognitive development at 2–3 years between those who received immediate SSC and those who received standard care [^e27dd69b]. The mean BSID-III cognitive composite scores were 99.6 (SSC) vs 99.4 (standard care), with a mean difference of 0.21 (95% CI, −5.26 to 5.68; P = 0.94) [^3ec145dd]. Similarly, there was no difference in the proportion at risk of developmental delay (51% vs 49%; OR 1.10 [95% CI, 0.47–2.56]; P = 0.83) [^e27dd69b].

---

## Safety and feasibility

Immediate SSC is **safe and feasible** in stable very preterm infants, including those born at 30 weeks, with no significant differences in hypothermia, hyperthermia, or need for mechanical ventilation during the first 2 hours [^8102f5c8]. Continuous monitoring and appropriate staffing are essential to ensure safety during SSC [^36af13b2].

---

## Indirect benefits

While immediate SSC does not directly improve cognitive outcomes, it offers **indirect benefits** that may support development:

- **Breastfeeding**: Significantly higher breastfeeding rates at discharge (84% vs 67%; P = 0.04) and sustained breastfeeding up to 12 months in the SSC group [^e27dd69b] [^d443d902].

- **Parent-infant bonding**: Improved maternal-infant interaction quality at 4 months, which may indirectly support development [^6d9ac570].

- **Parental mental health**: Reduced parental depression and anxiety symptoms, contributing to a supportive environment for infant development [^3d3d1b69].

---

## Comparison with other interventions

Compared with other early interventions, such as parent-guided developmental programs, immediate SSC alone does not show **cognitive benefits** [^e27dd69b]. Parent-guided interventions have demonstrated improvements in cognitive outcomes, highlighting the importance of comprehensive, sustained developmental support beyond SSC alone [^cb8d839f].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of SSC for **bonding, breastfeeding, and parental well-being**, but they do not claim direct cognitive benefits for immediate SSC in stable very preterm infants. SSC is recommended as part of family-centered care, with attention to safety and individualized implementation [^487cb408] [^1c137a21].

---

## Counseling parents

When counseling parents of a stable 30-week preterm infant, clinicians should provide **balanced, evidence-based information**:

- **Direct cognitive benefits**: Immediate SSC does not improve cognitive outcomes at 2–3 years compared with standard care [^e27dd69b].

- **Indirect benefits**: SSC increases breastfeeding rates, improves parent-infant bonding, and reduces parental stress, which may indirectly support development [^e27dd69b] [^6d9ac570] [^3d3d1b69].

- **Safety**: Immediate SSC is safe and feasible in stable infants with appropriate monitoring [^8102f5c8].

- **Comprehensive care**: Emphasize the importance of ongoing developmental support, including breastfeeding, parent education, and early intervention services [^cb8d839f].

---

Immediate SSC in the delivery room does not **improve cognitive outcomes** at 2–3 years in stable 30-week preterm infants, but it is safe and supports breastfeeding and bonding. Parents should be encouraged to practice SSC for these benefits while also engaging in comprehensive developmental support.

Importance

Preterm neonates are at risk for neurodevelopmental impairments, and there is a need to identify protective factors that can modify the harmful effects of preterm birth on the immature brain.

Objective

To evaluate whether immediate skin-to-skin contact (SSC) for preterm neonates improves early childhood neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This open-label randomized clinical trial was conducted in 3 Norwegian neonatal units between February 2014 and October 2020. Participants were preterm neonates born at 28 weeks 0 days' to 31 weeks 6 days' gestation with birth weight greater than 1000 g and no major congenital malformations or need for intubation or oxygen supplementation of more than 40%. Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted from July 2023 to July 2024.

Intervention

Neonates were randomized 1:1 to immediate SSC between mother and neonate in the delivery room for 2 hours or to standard care with direct transport to the neonatal unit in an incubator.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was cognitive development at 2 to 3 years of age, measured by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (BSID-III). Secondary outcomes were language and motor neurodevelopment measured by the BSID-III, parental questionnaires at 3 and 12 months and 2 to 3 years, and breastfeeding practices up to 12 months.

Results

Of 108 included neonates (68 [63%] male; mean [SD] gestational age, 30 weeks 3 days [1 week 1 day]), 51 received SSC and 57 received standard care. Eighty-six (80%) had follow-up at 2 to 3 years, and 81 (75%) completed the BSID-III and were analyzed for the primary outcome. The mean difference in BSID-III cognitive composite scores was 0.21 (95% CI, -5.26 to 5.68; P = 0.94). There was no difference between the groups in the proportion at risk of developmental delay at 2 to 3 years: 21 of 41 (51%) and 22 of 45 (49%) in the SSC and standard care groups, respectively (odds ratio, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.47–2.56]; P = 0.83). More neonates in the SSC group were breastfed at hospital discharge (42 of 50 [84%] vs 36 of 54 [67%]; P = 0.04).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, 2 hours of mother-neonate SSC in the delivery room did not enhance neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 to 3 years of age. However, the SSC group demonstrated improved breastfeeding practices up to 12 months compared with standard care, suggesting that the feasible and low-cost SSC intervention should be encouraged in clinical practice.

Introduction

Long-term health issues are still a major problem for many individuals born preterm. Compared with full-term neonates, very preterm neonates (28–31 weeks' gestation) are at increased risk of long-term impairments such as cerebral palsy; motor, cognitive, and language delay; behavioral problems; psychiatric disorders; and visual and hearing impairments. The mean IQ score in very preterm infants is approximately 1 SD lower than in infants born full-term. Numerous early intervention programs have been developed to compensate for the negative consequences of preterm birth. One intervention is kangaroo mother care (KMC), in which skin-to-skin contact (SSC) is the primary component.SSC between a caretaker and a preterm newborn in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is associated with reduced neonatal morbidities and parental stress and with improved parental mental health.

The first hours after birth are considered an early sensitive period that is important for mother-neonate interaction and secure attachment. This has led to an increased focus on a nonseparation approach and immediate SSC following delivery between preterm neonates and their mothers or caregivers. The World Health Organization recently amended its recommendations for the care of preterm infants to advise immediate SSC "as soon as possible after birth". This recommendation is based on a randomized clinical trial (RCT) including more than 3000 low-birth-weight infants in low-resource settings and reporting reduced mortality in infants receiving SSC from birth. Studies from low- and high-resource settings have shown improved thermoregulation and cardiorespiratory stability in preterm neonates receiving immediate SSC. Studies have also reported less maternal depression; reduced feelings of fear, guilt, and frustration; and a higher breastfeeding rate with immediate SSC between mother and newborn. The nonseparation approach and immediate SSC following delivery is a paradigm shift in neonatal medicine. Yet, few hospitals facilitate immediate SSC, and no studies to our knowledge have reported an association between delivery room SSC and early childhood outcomes.

We conducted an RCT comparing 2 hours of delivery room SSC between very preterm neonates and their mothers vs standard care. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether immediate SSC improves cognitive outcomes at 2 to 3 years. Safety and feasibility have been reported elsewhere.

Results

Study Participants

A total of 108 neonates (mean [SD] gestational age, 30 weeks 3 days [1 week 1 day]; 40 females [37%] and 68 males [63%]) of 101 mothers were included in the study and randomly assigned to either immediate SSC (n = 51) or standard care (n = 57). Twenty-two neonates (20%) were lost to follow-up; hence, 86 (80%) had any or some follow-up at 2 to 3 years of age (BSID-III, ASQ, ASQ-SE, or any 2 or 3 of these assessments) (Figure and eFigure in Supplement 2). Eighty-six children (80%) met for BSID-III assessment at 2 to 3 years, but assessments for 5 of those children (6%) could not be evaluated due to no BSID-III or the child's inability to test. Therefore, 81 children (75%) were analyzed for the primary outcome (39 [76%] in the SSC group and 42 [74%] in the standard care group). Maternal and neonatal characteristics at birth are summarized according to the intervention group in Table 1 for all participants and in eTable 1 in Supplement 2 for participants with the primary outcome.

### Immediate skin-to-skin contact in very preterm neonates and early childhood neurodevelopment: a randomized clinical trial [^5eb5434f]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Improved bonding and maternal-infant relationship have been demonstrated at 4 and 6 months of age, respectively, in preterm neonates exposed to immediate SSC after delivery. Studies also report that a longer duration of KMC in the NICU improves infant growth, breastfeeding, and neurobehavioral performance. No early childhood or long-term follow-up is available from these studies. However, results are difficult to compare for all outcomes, as there are various definitions of early or immediate KMC and SSC (from immediately after delivery to several days after birth) as well as differences in gestational age groups included and how data on duration of KMC and SSC are retrieved.,

Our results are similar to those of a recent RCT on music therapy intervention in the NICU for preterm neonates (the LongSTEP trial), reporting no difference between groups in BSID-III composite score at 2 years. It has been difficult to demonstrate improved long-term benefits after both music therapy and SSC despite short-term improvements in physiological stability and reduced maternal stress and anxiety shown in smaller studies. Very preterm infants in high-income settings have high survival rates, and almost 80% do not have motor or cognitive delays. In our study, the mean BSID-III composite scores at 2 to 3 years were within what is considered the normal range. However, both groups had a lower mean composite score on all BSID-III domains compared with 633 healthy full-term infants who served as a control group in the Swedish EXPRESS. Few infants included in our study had severe complications of prematurity, and there were no differences in complication rates between the groups. Our results suggest that in this high-resource context where most infants experience normal neurodevelopment, single interventions like SSC may not influence hard end points like survival and BSID-III scores at 2 to 3 years.

### Immediate skin-to-skin contact in very preterm neonates and early childhood neurodevelopment: a randomized clinical trial [^6f326d09]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

The study Early SSC for Preterm Neonates was published by Laila Kristoffersen and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Preterm birth and Preterm infant. In the Early SSC for Preterm Neonates study, the trial question was: what is the effect of immediate skin-to-skin contact with mother on cognitive development in preterm neonates? In the Early SSC for Preterm Neonates study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the Early SSC for Preterm Neonates study, the population was: 108 patients (40 female, 68 male). The inclusion criteria were neonates born at gestational age of 28 weeks 0 days to 31 weeks 6 days with birth weight > 1,000 g. The key exclusion criteria were need for > 40% oxygen to maintain oxygen saturation > 90% at 20 minutes of life; need for intubation and mechanical ventilation in the delivery room; major congenital malformations; maternal general anesthesia. In the Early SSC for Preterm Neonates study, the interventions were: n = 51 skin-to-skin contact (immediate skin-to-skin contact between mother and infant in the deliver room for 2 hours) n = 57 usual care (transport to the neonatal unit in an incubator immediately after birth). In the Early SSC for Preterm Neonates study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in cognitive development at 2–3 years of age, measured by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition mean score (99.6 points vs. 99.4 points; MD 0.21, 95% CI -5.26 to 5.68). In the Early SSC for Preterm Neonates study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the rate of risk of development delay at 2–3 years (51% vs. 49%; OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.56) No significant difference in Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition-motor neurodevelopment mean score at 2–3 years of age (95.7 points vs. 97.4 points; MD -1.71, 95% CI -7.3 to 3.87) Significant increase in breastfeeding at hospital discharge (84% vs. 67%; AD 17%, 95% CI 0.75 to 33.25). In the Early SSC for Preterm Neonates study, the conclusion was: in neonates born at gestational age of 28 weeks 0 days to 31 weeks 6 days with birth weight > 1,000 g, skin-to-skin contact was not superior to usual care with respect to cognitive development at 2–3 years of age, measured by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition mean score.

### Association between skin-to-skin contact and cognition and behaviour at 5 years in children born at 24–31 weeks' gestation: a secondary analysis of a national population-based prospective cohort study [^3345b4f7]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Skin-to-skin contact (SSC) immediately after birth is a proven, life-saving intervention, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where it significantly reduces neonatal mortality among preterm children. Endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and supported by extensive research, SSC has been shown to promote physiological stability, enhance breastfeeding outcomes, and strengthen parent-infant bonding. In high-income countries, SSC is considered both safe and feasible for extremely preterm (24–27 weeks) and very preterm (28–31 weeks) children. Nevertheless, despite these well-documented benefits, the implementation of SSC continues to vary widely between and within countries. In 2022, a Swedish Neonatal Quality Register study indicate that the existing evidence for SSC is poorly translated into clinical practice for extremely and very preterm children. The long-term neurodevelopmental effects of SSC, particularly beyond infancy, remain largely unknown.

After the neonatal stay, short term neurodevelopmental impacts of SSC alone, independently of other infant and family centered care interventions, are controversial with no effect on development at 12 months. However, the first hours after birth are considered a sensitive early period during which biobehavioural interactions between parents and infants activate specific neuroendocrine systems that influence gene expression, brain development, and the formation of parent-infant attachment. Limiting the toxic stress associated with maternal-neonate separation, and promoting optimal sensory environment for preterm-born neonates, SSC seems neuroprotective in the long term. Prolonged and continuous SSC at least 18 h/day in the Kangaroo Mother Care program positively influenced the premature brain networks and synaptic efficacy up to adolescence, and was associated with neurodevelopmental benefits until adulthood. Late but repeated daily SSC has also been shown to improve child physiologic organization and cognitive control at 10 years of age in children born very and moderately preterm. Early and frequent SSC in extremely preterm children was associated with early cognitive and communication performance at 12 months. However, all these studies were based on small groups of children, or children born from 1993 to 1998, with attrition bias, and long-term effects of SSC on neurodevelopmental outcome for extremely and very preterm children have never been evaluated in recent large cohort studies.

Conclusions

In this RCT, 2 hours of mother-neonate SSC in the delivery room did not improve neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 to 3 years of age. Significantly more neonates in the SSC group were breastfed at discharge and up to 1 year of age compared with those in the standard care group. Although immediate SSC did not translate into improved neurodevelopment, a nonseparation approach might still have an impact on breastfeeding outcomes. Instead of doing more studies on immediate SSC, resources should be focused on implementing this important, feasible, and low-cost intervention.

### Immediate skin-to-skin contact in very preterm neonates and early childhood neurodevelopment: a randomized clinical trial [^d443d902]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

The present study showed that more neonates in the SSC group were breastfed at discharge, and the duration of exclusive breastfeeding was longer than among neonates receiving standard care. These findings are in accordance with another study on immediate SSC for preterm neonates reporting a higher, although nonsignificant, incidence of exclusive breastfeeding at discharge in the SSC group. A recent study reported that close contact between the mother and neonate within 30 minutes after birth and regular SSC between mother and child during the NICU stay were associated with successful breastfeeding in moderate- to late-preterm infants. This finding was supported by a meta-analysis including 1900 preterm and low-birth-weight infants that demonstrated that KMC was associated with reduced breastfeeding initiation time compared with conventional care. Although we did not find an association of immediate SSC with neurodevelopment, a recent Swedish study reported that not receiving breast milk at discharge from the NICU was 1 of the 5 most important features of cognitive delay in very preterm infants. The associations between SSC, breastfeeding, nutritional status, socioeconomic and societal conditions, and cognitive outcomes in preterm infants are impossible to explore in small studies like ours and may be difficult to assess even in larger studies. We do not believe that the lack of association between immediate SSC and neurodevelopmental outcomes should be used as an argument against the positive changes that have occurred in neonatal care over the past decades. On the contrary, focus on family-integrated care, closeness between parents and infant, and empowering of parents in their caretaking role must be considered essential to optimize and promote a nurturing environment for preterm infants and their parents.

### Association between skin-to-skin contact and cognition and behaviour at 5 years in children born at 24–31 weeks' gestation: a secondary analysis of a national population-based prospective cohort study [^f6d063d4]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Improving outcomes for children born extremely and very preterm remains a challenge, as no improvement in cognitive outcomes has been observed in recent years. Early SSC, recognized and promoted as a safe intervention to improve short-term outcomes among this high-risk population, offers an opportunity to reduce the FISQ gap compared to term peers. Although progress has been made since the 2011 data, SSC remains poorly translated into clinical practice for extremely and very preterm children, highlighting ongoing disparities and indicating that there is still room for improvement during this early, sensitive postnatal period. Moreover, as SSC represents a low-cost and easily accessible intervention, it is essential to continue efforts to standardize and promote its use across all care settings for such vulnerable populations. Future studies are needed to evaluate the dose–response relationships and timing effects of SSC, including among both mothers and fathers of extremely and very preterm-born children.

In this nationwide population-based cohort study of children born at less than 32 weeks, SSC during the first week of life was associated with an increased likelihood of higher FSIQ at 5 ½ years. Variability of practices across units deserves attention. Further evaluation of the dose–response relationships and timing effects is needed.

Discussion

In the French nationwide population-based cohort study EPIPAGE-2 of preterm children born at less than 32 weeks, exposure to SSC the first week of life varied widely across neonatal units and was associated with an increased likelihood of a higher FSIQ at 5 ½ years among survivors. Behavioural difficulties, assessed with the SDQ scores, were not different between groups exposed and non-exposed to SSC.

Our results from a recent large cohort of extremely and very preterm children support cumulative evidence for the long-term effect of SSC intervention at birth, and the strategy of "zero separation" among these vulnerable children. These findings are consistent with the better long-term developmental outcome reported in preterm children, mostly very preterm. They are also in accordance with a study of 97 extremely preterm children exposed to more frequent SSC with mothers and fathers, who were more likely to have higher scores on the cognitive and communication scales of the Bayley-III at 12-months. Improvements in cognitive and behaviour outcome in infancy might persist into early adulthood with significant impact on daily life. This potential effect might be strengthened in case of immediate SSC as improvement in the quality of mother children interaction has been suggested with this strategy in very preterm children. Indeed, the twenty year follow-up of preterm children exposed to early SSC demonstrated that long-lasting social and behavioural protective effects increased considerably from infancy to adulthood.

Statistical analysis

In the overall cohort, to ensure representativeness, percentages were weighted to consider the differences in the recruitment times for the children born at 24–26 weeks and those born at 27–31 weeks and associations between the exposure and outcomes were adjusted for gestational age. To control for the non-random assignment of children in exposure groups and adjust for confounding, we conducted a propensity score analysis with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPWT) approach. The propensity score was defined as the children's probability of being exposed to SSC, based on maternal, pregnancy-related, neonatal and unit characteristics, estimated with a logistic regression model. The following variables were included in the model, maternal and pregnancy characteristics: maternal age (< 25, 25–35, or > 35 years), primiparity (yes, no), mother country of birth (France, foreign-born), maternal education (less than high school, high school, 1–2 years of graduate studies, ≥ 3 years of graduate studies), parents' socio-economic status (based on parental occupation, classified into five categories), living in couple relationship (yes, no), cause of preterm birth categorized in five classes: (preterm labour, preterm premature rupture of membranes, hypertensive disorders, isolated foetal growth restriction, and other causes including triplet or quadruplet births and undefined), antenatal corticosteroids administration (yes, no), tocolysis use (yes, no), mode of delivery (vaginal, caesarean), maternal anaesthesia (general anaesthesia: yes, no) and multiple pregnancy (yes, no); neonatal characteristics at birth: gestational age (in completed weeks), sex, small-for-gestational age (defined as a birth weight < 10th centile for gestational age and sex based on French intrauterine growth curves), Apgar score < 7 at 5 min, surfactant administration (yes, no), hemodynamic treatment during the first 72 h of life (yes, no), initiation of lactation the first week of life (yes, no); unit characteristics: neonatal unit volume of activity (number of preterm infants born < 32 weeks admitted in 2011, categorized in four groups) and implementation of a developmental care program (Newborn Individualised Developmental Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP)) (yes, no). Average treatment effect (ATE) weights were used to estimate the treatment effects in the whole population. Balance statistics were graphically assessed by convergence of the balance measures after iterations of the model and by standardised difference. A standardised difference of 10% or more is generally considered meaningful. The reported measures of association are odds ratio (OR) and risk difference for categorical variables and mean difference for continuous variables with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Generalised estimating equation (GEE) regression analysis with an exchangeable correlation structure and robust standard error was used to account for the non-independence of outcomes within neonatal units. Missing baseline and outcomes variables were handled by multiple imputations by chained equations with the R package 'mice' using variables that were included in the propensity score and outcomes. A large number of predictors was included to ensure the "missing at random" assumption during imputation and for the reliability of the imputed results. Missing data for baseline characteristics ranged from 0% to 9.0%, exceeding 5.0% only for data on living in a couple relationship and maternal educational. Missing data for 5 ½ years FSIQ and behavioural scores were 38% and 40% respectively. We generated fifty independent imputed datasets with thirty iterations each. Estimates were pooled according to Rubin's rule. Propensity score analysis was performed for each imputed dataset to estimate the exposition effect. Subgroup analyses were performed by gestational age group 24–27 and 28–31 weeks, with interaction p-values to test whether the effect differs significantly between subgroups.

### Association between skin-to-skin contact and cognition and behaviour at 5 years in children born at 24–31 weeks' gestation: a secondary analysis of a national population-based prospective cohort study [^96391a5d]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

This study has several strengths. These strengths include the population-based cohort design and the prospective enrolment of all children born preterm in France (2011) using a standardised questionnaire and developmental assessments referenced to contemporary term-born children, examined with the same protocol. Finally, this study produced unique large-scale national data for a topic where randomized trial would now be unethical in view of the many proven benefits of SSC and the desire of most parents.

This study also has limitations, primarily potential uncontrolled confounding. To minimize indication bias inherent in this type of study, we included multiple recognized individual (including clinical illness severity) and unit characteristics in the IPWT approach, ensuring a well-balanced distribution between groups. Consistent cognitive outcomes across sensitivity analyses further reduce the risk of misattributing the observed association to SSC. Statistical significance for sensitivity and subgroup analyses should be interpreted as exploratory, as no multiple testing adjustments were made. A limitation is the loss to follow-up. To address this attrition bias, we used multiple imputations, which produced results consistent with the complete cases analysis. Sensitivity analyses, particularly instrumental variable approaches, suggest some uncertainty regarding the precision and robustness of this association. A potential weakness of using NICU-level SSC preference as an instrument is that it may not be specific to SSC exposure and could reflect other differences in care practices and resources. Although the instrumental variable analysis yielded a point estimate similar to that of the primary analysis using IPTW propensity scores, the wide confidence intervals suggest a lack of performance and risk of residual confounding. Furthermore, SSC the first week of life was less practiced among the smaller subgroup of preterm children born at 24–27 weeks, which might limit statistical power and explain the absence of association between SSC and cognitive and behaviour outcome in this subgroup. We also have no information on the date of the first SSC among the group not exposed in the first week of life, nor on the duration of SSC after the first of week of life in both groups (exposed and non-exposed). This may have weakened the observed association and limits our ability to fully explore the overall role of SSC on neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, this limitation should be interpreted in light of the fact that this is the first study to investigate the association between SSC and neurodevelopmental outcomes in a recent cohort of extremely and very preterm children. A limitation of this study is that data on race and ethnicity were not collected, which may affect the generalizability of the findings. Finally, given the observational nature of the study, we cannot draw conclusions about causal relationship between SCC and cognitive development at 5 ½ years.

The Etude éPIdémiologique sur les Petits Ages GEstationnels 2 (EPIPAGE-2), a national population-based prospective cohort study, with data collected in the neonatal period on SSC and follow-up at 5 ½ years, provides a unique opportunity to study the long-term effects of SSC on neurodevelopmental outcomes among children born extremely and very preterm. The aim of the study was to evaluate associations between SSC started during the first week of life, cognition and behaviour at 5 1/2 years among children born between 24 and 31 completed gestational weeks included in the EPIPAGE-2 follow-up study.

### Immediate skin-to-skin contact in very preterm neonates and early childhood neurodevelopment: a randomized clinical trial [^19a7b05c]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this RCT comparing delivery room SSC with standard care in an incubator for very preterm neonates, we found no significant or clinically relevant differences between groups in neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 to 3 years of age. There were also no differences in neurodevelopmental outcomes between groups at 3 and 12 months. However, significantly more neonates in the SSC group were breastfed at discharge compared with those in the standard care group. This difference persisted up to 1 year of age.

To our knowledge, this is the first RCT reporting early childhood outcomes after delivery room SSC for very preterm neonates. An RCT in Columbia reported long-term outcomes of continuous KMC initiated after a median of 4 days after birth vs traditional care. It found no difference between groups at 6 and 12 months, but in a subset of the study population assessed at 20 years of age, there was a dose-dependent positive association between the duration of KMC and the volume of certain brain structures measured with magnetic resonance imaging. The clinical significance of such a finding is not clear.

### Skin-to-skin contact at birth for very preterm infants and mother-infant interaction quality at 4 months: a secondary analysis of the IPISTOSS randomized clinical trial [^1d6d77ed]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Skin-to-skin contact (SSC) is an evidence-based method of care that involves placing the naked infant on the parent's bare chest. The SSC method is routinely practiced intermittently for preterm infants in the neonatal unit. Because of its multiple benefits, SSC between newborn infants and mothers provided in the immediate period after birth is considered the standard of care. For infants born preterm, the timing of SSC initiation can vary greatly. In a Swedish population-based register study, only a minority of infants born before gestational week 32 received SSC within their first day of life. Recent guidelines from the World Health Organization recommend immediate postnatal initiation of SSC for preterm or low-birth-weight infants, due to the increase in survival rates. Data on long-term developmental effects of immediate SSC for very preterm infants, such as the quality of the parent-infant relationship, are limited.

Good-quality early parent-infant interactions have protective effects on infant social-emotional, cognitive, and behavioral development, and are critical for preterm infants with inherent vulnerabilities related to immaturity. Mother-infant interaction has been described as an act of reciprocity, in which both participants modify their behaviors depending on feedback provided by the other. It is often more difficult for parents to interpret and respond to the behavioral cues of preterm infants because these cues are weaker. Moreover, becoming a parent to a preterm infant can be stressful and has been linked to compromised psychological well-being in parentsand reduced maternal sensitivity, which may affect interaction quality. Differences in dyadic interaction behaviors between mothers and preterm infants, compared with mother and full-term infant dyads, are most evident during the first 6 months of life. Early interventions that foster close parent-infant contact are therefore warranted.

### Skin-to-skin contact in the delivery room for very preterm infants: a randomised clinical trial [^b65718e6]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Skin-to-skin contact (SSC) or Kangaroo Mother Care between mothers and preterm infants is strongly recommended by the WHO, and has been shown to have positive effects on neonatal as well as maternal outcomes. The most recent Cochrane reviewsupports SSC as an effective and safe alternative to standard care (SC), especially in resource-limited settings. A recent randomised controlled trial (RCT) of more than 3000 infants with a birth weight between 1.0 and 1.8 kg from Ghana, India, Malawi, Nigeria and Tanzania reported a reduction of mortality of 25% when SSC between the mother and infant was initiated shortly after delivery. However, research from high-income settings is scarce.

The availability of human and technical resources and drugs contributes to low mortality among preterm infants in high-income countries. It is unlikely that SSC after delivery in these settings influences mortality or major prematurity-related complications. However, parent–infant bonding, cardiorespiratory stability and breastfeedingmay all improve with early SSC regardless of resources.

Current delivery room practice for very preterm infants (gestational age (GA) 28 0–31 6 weeks) is to stabilise and place the infant in an incubator before transfer to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). After caesarean section (C-section), the mother and infant can be in separate departments for many hours. In one recent qualitative study, mothers who had their infants skin-to-skin described how they were immediately comforted by the infant's vitality, while mothers who were separated from their infant described feelings of fear, guilt, and frustration. A study comparing 60 min delivery room SSC with 5 min of visual contact between mothers and infants born at GA 25–32 weeks, found an improved mother–child interaction at 6 months corrected age and less maternal depression in the SSC group.

There has been a shift towards family oriented neonatal intensive care, and the family is now considered a central part of the NICU team. Whether this translates into improved long-term outcomes has not been established, but another intervention to enhance parental coping in the NICU has shown a significant increase in IQ points at five years of age.

There is a need to identify barriers to early SSC for very preterm infants in high-resource settings as well as any harm or benefit. This study presents outcomes on feasibility, safety, and the effects on physiological parameters in very preterm infants randomised to early SSC in the delivery/operating room or SC in an incubator.

### Skin-to-skin contact at birth for very preterm infants and mother-infant interaction quality at 4 months: a secondary analysis of the IPISTOSS randomized clinical trial [^6d9ac570]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Good-quality parent-infant interactions have protective effects on infant socio-emotional and behavioral development. These interactions are especially critical for very preterm infants at risk of vulnerabilities related to immaturity. Skin-to-skin contact (SSC) has been found to improve mother-preterm infant interaction behaviors, but few studies exist regarding its benefits when initiated immediately after birth.

Objective

To determine the effect of immediate SSC at birth for very preterm infants on mother-infant interaction quality at 4 months of corrected age.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This secondary analysis used data from the Immediate Parent-Infant Skin-to-Skin Study (IPISTOSS), a randomized clinical trial conducted between April 1, 2018, and June 30, 2021, at 3 neonatal units in Sweden and Norway. Participants included very preterm infants (28–33 gestational weeks of age) and their parents. Four-month follow-up was concluded in December 2021. Data analyses were performed on March 16 and September 18, 2023.

Intervention

Infants were allocated to standard incubator care or SSC with either parent initiated at birth and continued throughout the first 6 hours after birth.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was mother-infant interaction quality as measured with the Parent-Child Early Relational Assessment (PCERA), based on video recordings of a 5-minute free-play situation with mother-infant dyads at 4 months of corrected age. A multilevel regression analysis was performed.

Results

This analysis included 71 infants (31 twins [44%]) and 56 mothers. Infants had a mean (SD) gestational age of 31weeks 3 (1.3) days, and more than half were male (42 [59%]); mothers had a mean (SD) age of 32 (4.9) years. There were 37 infants allocated to standard care and 34 to SSC with either parent after birth. During the first 6 hours after birth, fathers provided more SSC than mothers, with a median (IQR) of 3.25 (2.25–4.5) and 0.75 (0–2.5) hours, respectively. A statistically significant difference in 1 of 5 PCERA subscales (subscale 3: infant positive affect, communicative and social skills) was observed, with higher-quality mother-infant interaction in the SSC group at 4 months (Cohen d = 0.67 [95% CI, 0.17 to 1.17]; P = 0.01). This effect remained significant when adjusting for primiparity, child sex, and observation setting.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study of the effect of immediate parent-infant SSC after very preterm birth, SSC was beneficial for the mother-infant relationship. These findings suggest that immediate SSC should be supported in the clinical setting.

### Immediate skin-to-skin contact in very preterm neonates and early childhood neurodevelopment: a randomized clinical trial [^9ba7ddcd]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Two parent-completed questionnaires, the Ages & Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) and the ASQ–Social-Emotional (ASQ-SE), were completed at the following time points: 3 months (only ASQ-SE), 12 months, and 2 to 3 years of age. The ASQ is a questionnaire evaluating the child's development in 5 domains: communication, problem solving, fine motor, gross motor, and personal-social. A Norwegian version of this screening tool has been validated as an appropriate assessment for evaluating children's development. The scores are summed to give scores for each subscale and a total sum score. In this study, risk of developmental delay was defined as a score below the cutoff in the Norwegian ASQ manual. There are different age-dependent cutoff scores for all domains. The child's socioemotional and behavioral difficulties and competencies were assessed using the ASQ-SEThe domains assessed are self-regulation, compliance, communication, adaptive functioning, autonomy, affect, and interaction with people. Scores are summed to give a total sum score. This screening instrument is valid in identifying social and emotional difficulties in children. Risk of developmental delay was defined as a score above the age-dependent cutoff score in the Norwegian ASQ-SE manual.

At 12 months and 2 to 3 years of age, neurodevelopmental outcomes were assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (BSID-III). The BSID-III comprises 3 developmental domains: cognitive, language, and motor. Each domain has a normed score (composite score) with a mean score of 100 and an SD of 15. Higher scores indicate development consistent with normative data. We defined risk of developmental delay as a composite score below 90 in any domain. This is the clinical cutoff used in the Swedish neonatal guidelines based on assessments of healthy controls born early-, full-, or late-term in the Extremely Preterm Infants in Sweden Study (EXPRESS). Two licensed practitioners blinded to the intervention conducted the assessments. After 2 years of enrollment, the 12-month BSID-III assessment was replaced with the ASQ and ASQ-SE. This was due to limited staff resources to conduct the testing and to reduce the burden of physical follow-up assessments on the families. The last follow-up was planned at 2 years of age, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some participants had their follow-up postponed up to age 3 years.

The effects observed in our study may be relevant at population level, particularly among the population of extremely and very preterm children who remain at high risk of severe/moderate neurodevelopmental disabilities. Given the wide variation in the implementation of evidence-based practices, all strategies that can improve outcomes in this vulnerable population, particularly those included in infant and family centered developmental care programs, should be encouraged and promoted in neonatal units. However, evidence-based practices remain underutilized, and their widespread implementation is still far from being achieved. For example, only 58% of very preterm infants admitted for neonatal care in 19 European regions received all four key evidence-based practices for which they were eligible. These infants had increased survival without severe morbidity, suggesting that more comprehensive provision of evidence-based practices could yield substantial gains. Variations in patterns of care across neonatal units are likely due to hospital organizations and clinical styles of practices. In 2011, there were no French national clinical guidelines for extremely preterm children. Pierrat et al. found that the variation in SSC across French units was partly attributable to organizational factors, such as NIDCAP implementation, rather than to maternal or neonatal characteristics. Nevertheless, multifaceted interventions are required to ensure the effective implementation of SSC, even in countries with numerous facilitating factors, such as Sweden. While parents request implementation of early and continuous SSC, hospital staff attitudes and environment were described by the parents as both supportive and barriers for their application of SCC. Involving families in NICU quality improvement may optimize implementation of SSC at population level and long-term outcome of these vulnerable children.

Methods

Study population

Recruitment took place in all neonatal units in 25 French regions (21 of the 22 metropolitan regions and all overseas regions) from Mar 28, 2011, to Dec 31, 2011, during an eight-month period for children born at 24–26 weeks, and a six-month period for those born at 27–31 weeks. Eligible children were those born at 24–31 weeks, hospitalized in the same neonatal unit the first week of life, alive at 7 days after birth, without severe cerebral malformation or decision to limit or withhold care during the first week of life, and with information available regarding SSC during the first week of life. Triplets and quadruplets were excluded. Children were followed up from Sep 1, 2016, to Dec 31, 2017.

Skin-to-skin contact (SSC)

Preterm-born children were divided into 2 groups, exposed and non-exposed, based on whether SSC was performed during the first week of life or not. Information about SSC during the first week of life was recorded at day 7 (yes/no), and if yes, the date of the first SSC was reported. Duration of SSC and the date of SSC if it was performed after the first week of life were not recorded in both groups. All data were prospectively collected during neonatal hospitalization.

Summary

Background

Long-term effects of Skin-to-Skin Contact (SSC) on neurodevelopmental outcome for preterm children are still debated. We aimed to evaluate associations between SSC, cognition and behavior at 5 years among children born at 24–31 weeks of gestation.

Methods

In this secondary analysis of the French Etude Epidémiologique sur les Petits Ages Gestationnels (EPIPAGE-2), a nationwide prospective population-based cohort study conducted in all neonatal units across 25 French regions from Mar 28, 2011, to Dec 31, 2011, we examined preterm-born children divided into two groups based on exposure to skin-to-skin contact (SSC) during the first week of life. Outcomes at 5 years included full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ; Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, 4th edition) and behavioural difficulties (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, SDQ), using a contemporaneous group of term-born children from the ELFE cohort as a reference. The ELFE cohort enrolled participants during four inclusion periods in 2011: Apr 01–04, 2011; Jun 27–Jul 04, 2011; Sep 27–Oct 04, 2011; and Nov 28–Dec 05, 2011. Included children were born at 24–31 weeks of gestation, remained in the same neonatal unit during the first week of life, were alive at 7 days, had no severe cerebral malformations or decisions to limit/withhold care, and had data on SSC exposure. Results are given after multiple imputation using propensity score methods with inverse probability of treatment weighting approach.

Findings

Of 3669 live-born preterm children, 2726 children were eligible and 2666 included with SSC information during the first week of life available; 2561 survived to 5 years (1328 boys (51.8%). Among survivors, 1581 received SSC during the first week of whom 987 had full follow-up assessment; 980 were not exposed of whom 558 had full follow-up assessment. SSC exposure increased with gestational age (21.7% at 24 weeks to 78.0% at 31 weeks), with variability across neonatal units (range 5%–100%). Compared with non-exposed children, exposed children had higher FSIQ scores (mean difference +2.3, 95% CI [+0.3 to 4.3], p = 0.024) and were more likely to score ≥ −1 standard deviation (odds ratio 1.33, 95% CI [1.04–1.70], p = 0.023). There was no significant difference in SDQ scores between groups (mean difference −0.3, 95% CI [−1.1 to 0.5], p = 0.42 and score ≥ 90th percentile odds ratio 0.92 [0.64; 1.33], p = 0.66).

Interpretation

While the duration of SSC the first week of life and SSC beyond the first week were not accounted for, our findings suggest that SSC during the first week of life may be associated with an increased likelihood of higher FSIQ at 5 years. These results point to a potential neuroprotective role of SSC during this early sensitive postnatal period and highlight important areas for improvement. Variability in SCC implementation across units deserves attention and further research is needed to explore dose–response relationships and timing effects.

### Effectiveness of skin-to-skin contact versus care-as-usual in mothers and their full-term infants: study protocol for a parallel-group randomized controlled trial [^bef563ee]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Twenty-to-forty percent of women experience postpartum depressive symptoms, which can affect both the mother and infant. In preterm infants, daily skin-to-skin contact (SSC) between the mother and her infant has been shown to decrease maternal postpartum depressive symptoms. In full-term infants, only two studies investigated SSC effects on maternal depressive symptoms and found similar results. Research in preterm infants also showed that SSC improves other mental and physical health outcomes of the mother and the infant, and improves the quality of mother-infant relationship. This randomized controlled trial will investigate the effects of a SSC intervention on maternal postpartum depressive symptoms and additional outcomes in mothers and their full-term infants. Moreover, two potential underlying mechanisms for the relation between SSC and the maternal and infant outcomes will be examined, namely maternal oxytocin concentrations and infant intestinal microbiota.

Methods/Design

Design: A parallel-group randomized controlled trial.

Participants

116 mothers and their full-term infants.

Intervention

Mothers in the SSC condition will be requested to provide daily at least one continuous hour of SSC to their infant. The intervention starts immediately after birth and lasts for 5 weeks. Mothers in the control condition will not be requested to provide SSC. Maternal and infant outcomes will be measured at 2 weeks, 5 weeks, 12 weeks and 1 year after birth.

Primary Outcome

maternal postpartum depressive symptoms. Secondary maternal outcomes: mental health (anxiety, stress, traumatic stress following child birth, sleep quality), physical health (physical recovery from the delivery, health, breastfeeding, physiological stress), mother-infant relationship (mother-infant bond, quality of maternal caregiving behavior). Secondary infant outcomes: behavior (fussing and crying, sleep quality), physical health (growth and health, physiological stress), general development (regulation capacities, social-emotional capacities, language, cognitive and motor capacities). Secondary underlying mechanisms: maternal oxytocin concentrations, infant intestinal microbiota.

Discussion

As a simple and cost-effective intervention, SSC may benefit both the mother and her full-term infant in the short-and long-term. Additionally, if SSC is shown to be effective in low-risk mother-infant dyads, then thought could be given to developing programs in high-risk samples and using SSC in a preventive manner.

### The effect of skin-to-skin contact (kangaroo care) shortly after birth on the neurobehavioral responses of the term newborn: a randomized, controlled trial [^23b07c5e]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The method of skin-to-skin contact (kangaroo care [KC]) has shown physiologic, cognitive, and emotional gains for preterm infants; however, KC has not been studied adequately in term newborns.

Aims

To evaluate the effect of KC, used shortly after delivery, on the neurobehavioral responses of the healthy newborn.

Study Design

A randomized, controlled trial using a table of random numbers. After consent, the mothers were assigned to 1 of 2 groups: KC shortly after delivery or a no-treatment standard care (control group).

Subjects

Included were 47 healthy mother-infant pairs. KC began at 15 to 20 minutes after delivery and lasted for 1 hour. Control infants and KC infants were brought to the nursery 15 to 20 and 75 to 80 minutes after birth, respectively.

Results

During a 1-hour-long observation, starting at 4 hours postnatally, the KC infants slept longer, were mostly in a quiet sleep state, exhibited more flexor movements and postures, and showed less extensor movements.

Conclusions

KC seems to influence state organization and motor system modulation of the newborn infant shortly after delivery. The significance of our findings for supportive transition from the womb to the extrauterine environment is discussed. Medical and nursing staff may be well advised to provide this kind of care shortly after birth.

### Skin-to-skin contact in the delivery room for very preterm infants: a randomised clinical trial [^6694769f]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was a neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years corrected age which was evaluated using Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (Bayley-III)and will be published when completed. This paper describes the secondary outcomes from birth until discharge from the NICU including feasibility, safety, and physiological parameters during the first 24 hours. The main safety outcomes were the incidence of hypothermia (temperature < 36°C) and the need for mechanical ventilation during the first 2 hours after randomisation. Other adverse events leading to a prolonged hospital stay were registered irrespective of the casual relationship with the study participation. The physiological parameters assessed were heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation. Physiological parameters were monitored continuously but collected at 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min, and then hourly.

Patient and public involvement

Parents or the public were not directly involved in the design, conduct or plans for the dissemination of our research.

Sample size

Based on the primary outcome, a sample size of 136 infants was calculated as described elsewhere. Based on the number of very preterm births at the three Norwegian hospitals, the estimated sample size was expected to be achieved by the end of 2018. After 6.5 years, inclusion was stopped in October 2020 after the enrolment of 108 infants.

Statistical analysis

The data were analysed with the intention to treat. Demographic factors and clinical characteristics were summarised with counts (percentages) for categorical variables and means (SD) or medians (IQR) for continuous variables. The differences between the SSC and SC groups for continuous variables were analysed using two-sample t-tests or Mann-Whitney U-tests, and categorical variables using the Pearson χ² test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The statistical analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS V.28 (IBM).

### Early skin-to-skin contact for mothers and their healthy newborn infants [^fe65e9e7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Mother-infant separation postbirth is common in Western culture. Early skin-to-skin contact (SSC) begins ideally at birth and involves placing the naked baby, covered across the back with a warm blanket, prone on the mother's bare chest. According to mammalian neuroscience, the intimate contact inherent in this place (habitat) evokes neurobehaviors ensuring fulfillment of basic biological needs. This time may represent a psychophysiologically 'sensitive period' for programming future behavior.

To assess the effects of early SSC on breastfeeding, behavior, and physiological adaptation in healthy mother-newborn dyads.

Search Strategy

Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's and Neonatal Group's Trials Registers (August 2006), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1976 to 2006).

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized clinical trials comparing early SSC with usual hospital care.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information.

Main Results

Thirty studies involving 1925 participants (mother-infant dyads), were included. Data from more than two trials were available for only 8-of-64 outcome measures. We found statistically significant and positive effects of early SSC on breastfeeding at one to four months postbirth (10 trials; 552 participants) (odds ratio (OR) 1.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 3.07), and breastfeeding duration (seven trials; 324 participants) (weighted mean difference (WMD) 42.55, 95% CI -1.69 to 86.79). Trends were found for improved summary scores for maternal affectionate love/touch during observed breastfeeding (four trials; 314 participants) (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.52, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.98) and maternal attachment behavior (six trials; 396 participants) (SMD 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.72) with early SSC. SSC infants cried for a shorter length of time (one trial; 44 participants) (WMD -8.01, 95% CI -8.98 to -7.04). Late preterm infants had better cardio-respiratory stability with early SSC (one trial; 35 participants) (WMD 2.88, 95% CI 0.53 to 5.23). No adverse effects were found.

Authors' Conclusions

Limitations included methodological quality, variations in intervention implementation, and outcome variability. The intervention may benefit breastfeeding outcomes, early mother-infant attachment, infant crying and cardio-respiratory stability, and has no apparent short or long-term negative effects. Further investigation is recommended. To facilitate meta-analysis, future research should be done using outcome measures consistent with those in the studies included here. Published reports should clearly indicate if the intervention was SSC and include means, standard deviations, exact probability values, and data to measure intervention dose.

### Skin-to-skin contact in the delivery room for very preterm infants: a randomised clinical trial [^8102f5c8]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Objective

Evaluating safety, feasibility and effects on physiological parameters of skin-to-skin contact (SSC) from birth between mothers and very preterm infants in a high-income setting.

Design

Open-label randomised controlled trial.

Setting

Three Norwegian neonatal units.

Patients

Preterm infants at gestational age (GA) 28 0 6 weeks and birth weight > 1000g delivered vaginally or by caesarean section (C-section).

Intervention

Two hours of early SSC between the mother and the infant compared to standard care (SC) where the infant is separated from the mother and transferred to the neonatal unit in an incubator.

Results

108 infants (63% male, 57% C-section, mean (SD) GA 30.3 weeks (1.3) and birth weight 1437g (260)) were included. Median (IQR) age at randomisation was 23min (17–30). During the first 2hours after randomisation, 4% (2 of 51) and 7% (4 of 57) were hypothermic (< 36.0°C) in the SSC and SC group, respectively (p = 0.68, OR 0.5, 95%CI 0.1 to 3.1). Significantly fewer infants in the SSC group had hyperthermia (> 37.5°C) (26% (13 of 57) vs 47% (27 of 51), respectively, p = 0.02, OR 0.4, 95%CI 0.2 to 0.9). No infant needed mechanical ventilation within the first 2 hours. Median (IQR) duration of SSC was 120 (80–120) min in the intervention group. There was no difference in heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation between groups during the first 24 hours.

Conclusion

This study from a high-income setting confirmed that SSC from birth for very preterm infants was safe and feasible. Physiological parameters were not affected by the intervention. The long-term effects on neurodevelopment, maternal-infant bonding and maternal mental health will be collected.

Trial Registration Number

NCT02024854.

### Early skin-to-skin contact for mothers and their healthy newborn infants [^21880b87]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Mother-infant separation postbirth is common in Western culture. Early skin-to-skin contact (SSC) begins ideally at birth and involves placing the naked baby, head covered with a dry cap and a warm blanket across the back, prone on the mother's bare chest. According to mammalian neuroscience, the intimate contact inherent in this place (habitat) evokes neurobehaviors ensuring fulfillment of basic biological needs. This time may represent a psychophysiologically 'sensitive period' for programming future physiology and behavior.

Objectives

To assess the effects of early SSC on breastfeeding, physiological adaptation, and behavior in healthy mother-newborn dyads.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 November 2011), made personal contact with trialists, and consulted the bibliography on kangaroo mother care (KMC) maintained by Dr. Susan Ludington.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing early SSC with usual hospital care.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information.

Main Results

Thirty-four randomized controlled trials were included involving 2177 participants (mother-infant dyads). Data from more than two trials were available for only eight outcome measures. For primary outcomes, we found a statistically significant positive effect of early SSC on breastfeeding at one to four months postbirth (13 trials; 702 participants) (risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06 to 1.53, and SSC increased breastfeeding duration (seven trials; 324 participants) (mean difference (MD) 42.55 days, 95% CI -1.69 to 86.79) but the results did not quite reach statistical significance (P = 0.06). Late preterm infants had better cardio-respiratory stability with early SSC (one trial; 31 participants) (MD 2.88, 95% CI 0.53 to 5.23). Blood glucose 75 to 90 minutes following the birth was significantly higher in SSC infants (two trials, 94 infants) (MD 10.56 mg/dL, 95% CI 8.40 to 12.72). The overall methodological quality of trials was mixed, and there was high heterogeneity for some outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Limitations included methodological quality, variations in intervention implementation, and outcomes. The intervention appears to benefit breastfeeding outcomes, and cardio-respiratory stability and decrease infant crying, and has no apparent short- or long-term negative effects. Further investigation is recommended. To facilitate meta-analysis, future research should be done using outcome measures consistent with those in the studies included here. Published reports should clearly indicate if the intervention was SSC with time of initiation and duration and include means, standard deviations and exact probability values.

### Skin-to-skin care for term and preterm infants in the neonatal ICU [^5491138a]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Skin-to-skin care (SSC) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) — evidence of benefits: The most substantial evidence of benefit from SSC is for breastfeeding; individual randomized controlled trials and a systematic review have shown that intermittent SSC is associated with longer and more exclusive breastfeeding and higher volumes of expressed milk. A systematic review reported that short periods of SSC (up to 1 hour at all visits) increased the duration of any breastfeeding, including 1 month after discharge (relative risk: 4.76 [95% confidence interval: 1.19–19.10]) and for more than 6 weeks (relative risk: 1.95 [95% confidence interval: 1.03–3.70]) among clinically stable infants in industrialized nations. Neurobehavioral studies indicate that preterm infants who receive SSC have more mature sleep organization, are more alert and observant, and spend less time crying; cohort studies also report better autonomic regulation, maternal–infant interactions, and higher Bayley Scales of Infant Development–Second Edition scores at 6 or 12 months of age, with 117 followed up to 10 years showing attenuated stress response, improved autonomic functioning, better-organized sleep, and better cognitive control. For procedural pain, a Cochrane review concluded SSC seemed to be effective for a single painful procedure such as a heel lance, with behavioral indicators tending to favor SSC whereas physiologic indicators were generally not affected; small studies reported reduced cortisol concentrations and decreased autonomic indicators of pain in preterm infants during SSC.

Limitations of the review processes

We are aware that the review process may be affected by bias, and we attempted to minimize this risk in several ways. Our search for eligible trials was comprehensive (Supplementary material 1). At least two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, carried out data extraction, and assessed the risk of bias. However, some aspects of the review process involve subjective judgments: assessing the risk of bias in included studies, for example, is not an exact science, and a different review team could have reached different conclusions. We justified our decisions in the risk of bias tables. We also recorded details about the participants and interventions in individual studies, and we would encourage readers to interpret results in light of the information set out in Supplementary material 2. Two review authors were involved in included trials. These trials were assessed for inclusion and methodological quality by different review authors.

We conducted our searches of electronic databases from 17 December 2015 to 22 March 2024, more than one year before the publication of this update. However, we searched two trial registers in July 2025 and found only two ongoing trials (NCT06514352 and NCT06011096). We also conducted an informal search of MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL from 22 March 2024 to 30 June 2025 and found only one potentially eligible trial, which we listed as awaiting classification (Xu 2024). It is unlikely that the inclusion of Xu 2024 would affect the conclusions of our review, and the two ongoing studies have no published results.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

Our findings are generally consistent with those of previous systematic reviews on this topic.

In their recent systematic review and meta‐analysis of 13 quasi‐randomized studies and RCTs with 1369 participants, Lord and colleagues evaluated the effect of SSC compared with standard contact on exclusive breastfeeding from hospital discharge to three months postbirth and obtained results similar to those in our review (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.57; I² = 52%). They also found similar results for blood glucose concentration in a meta‐analysis of six RCTs including 428 term, preterm, and low birthweight infants (MD 0.49 mmol/L [8.82 mg/dL], 95% CI 0.30 to 0.67 mmol/L; I² = 0%).

### Skin-to-skin contact at birth for very preterm infants and symptoms of depression and anxiety in parents during the first year – A secondary outcome of a randomized clinical trial [^3d3d1b69]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Mental health issues are common in parents to preterm infants. In the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), skin-to-skin contact (SSC) as an avenue for parent-infant closeness may improve parental mental health. Few studies exist regarding its benefits when initiated immediately postbirth. The aim was to determine the effect of SSC for very preterm infants at birth on parents' mental health, by assessing symptoms of depression and anxiety within the first year.

Methods

The Immediate Parent-Infant Skin-to-Skin Study was a randomized clinical trial conducted 2018–2021 at three NICUs in Sweden and Norway. Very preterm infants (28–33 weeks of gestation) were allocated to standard incubator care or SSC with either parent, initiated at birth and continued throughout the first 6 h. Symptoms of depression and anxiety in parents were assessed with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory.

Results

The study included 91 infants (36 twins [40%]) and 73 mothers and 73 fathers. Infants had a mean gestational age of 31 + 1 weeks and birthweight of 1534 g. Immediate SSC was found to significantly reduce depression symptoms in mothers and anxiety symptoms in fathers at one week after birth and depression and anxiety symptoms in fathers at term-equivalent age of infant.

Limitations

Limitations include a small sample size and limited background data on prenatal depression and anxiety.

Conclusions

Immediate parent-infant SSC following a very preterm birth may provide a protective effect on parents' mental health and should be supported in the clinical setting, alongside necessary nursing, and medical care.

### Immediate or early skin-to-skin contact for mothers and their healthy newborn infants [^d6907af3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Research supports the beneficial effects of immediate maternal-infant skin-to-skin contact (SSC) after all modes of birth on breastfeeding/lactation and neonatal physiology, but little is known about how it might influence maternal physiology, including postpartum blood loss and placental separation time. Despite the findings from the 2016 Cochrane review of skin-to-skin contact, and although the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) recommend immediate, continuous, uninterrupted SSC after birth, newborn infants are still separated from their mothers during this period in many settings. SSC is less common in low-income and lower-middle-income countries (World Bank classification), which suggests country income level could impact breastfeeding exclusivity. This update integrates the evidence found since 2015 into the review.

Objectives

To assess the effects of immediate skin-to-skin contact (< 10 minutes postbirth) or early skin-to-skin contact (10 minutes-24 hours postbirth) compared with existing hospital practices (standard contact) on the establishment and maintenance of breastfeeding and on maternal and infant physiology among healthy newborn infants and their mothers.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL up to 22 March 2024 and two trial registers up to 3 July 2025, along with reference checking and contact with experts.

Eligibility Criteria

Randomized controlled trials that compared immediate or early SSC with other hospital care after a vaginal or cesarean birth. Participants were mothers and their healthy full-term or late preterm newborns (≥ 34 weeks' gestation). Infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit were excluded.

Outcomes

Our critical outcomes included exclusive breastfeeding, infant axillary temperature, infant blood glucose levels, infant SCRIP score (cardiorespiratory stability), placental separation time/duration of the third stage of labor, and maternal blood loss.

Risk Of Bias

We used Cochrane's original risk of bias 1 tool (RoB 1). We assessed the risk of performance and detection bias separately for subjective and objective outcomes.

Synthesis Methods

We conducted random-effects meta-analysis where there was substantial heterogeneity and fixed-effect meta-analysis for infant blood glucose and SCRIP score. We calculated the summary risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using the Mantel-Haenszel method for dichotomous outcomes. We calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI using inverse variance for continuous outcomes, except infant SCRIP score, where we used the standardized mean difference (SMD). We used the GRADE approach to summarize the certainty of evidence.

Included Studies

We added 26 new trials (3775 mother-infant pairs) to this update for a total of 69 trials (7290 mother-infant pairs). Most studies (43/69) compared immediate SSC with standard hospital care. Ten studies included late preterm infants, and 15 included children born by cesarean delivery. Thirty-two trials were conducted in high-income countries, 25 in upper-middle-income countries, and 12 in lower-middle-income countries. Fifty-six studies contributed data to the meta-analyses. No included trial met all the criteria for high-quality methodology and reporting. Many analyses had statistical heterogeneity due to considerable differences between SSC and control group conditions.

Synthesis Of Results

Breastfeeding/lactation SSC compared with standard contact probably increases rates of exclusive breastfeeding at hospital discharge to one month postbirth (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.56; I² = 62%; 12 studies; 1556 mother-infant pairs; moderate-certainty evidence) and at six weeks to six months postbirth (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.74; I² = 87%; 11 studies; 1135 mother-infant pairs; moderate-certainty evidence), though both analyses had substantial heterogeneity. Infant physiological stability SSC compared with standard contact probably increases infant axillary temperature, but the MD of 0.28 °C is not clinically meaningful (MD 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.41; I² = 95%; 11 studies; 1349 infants; moderate-certainty evidence). SSC probably increases blood glucose levels measured in mg/dL (MD 10.49, 95% CI 8.39 to 12.59; I² = 0%; 3 studies; 114 infants; moderate-certainty evidence). Infants who have SSC may also have higher SCRIP scores overall, indicating more optimal cardiorespiratory stabilization. However, the trials reporting this outcome had small sample sizes, and the clinical significance was unclear because trialists reported averages of multiple time points (SMD 1.24, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.72; I² = 0%; 2 studies; 81 infants; low-certainty evidence). Maternal physiology SSC may result in little to no difference in placental separation time/duration of the third stage of labor in minutes (MD -2.26, 95% CI -5.04 to 0.52; I² = 88%; 4 studies; 450 mothers; low-certainty evidence) and maternal postpartum blood loss in mL (MD -145.92, 95% CI -416.96 to 125.11; I² = 97%; 2 studies; 143 mothers; very low-certainty evidence), although these results should be interpreted with caution due to high heterogeneity and the small number of studies.

Authors' Conclusions

This review supports immediate SSC after birth, regardless of mode of birth, for mothers and their healthy full-term and late preterm infants in middle-income and high-income countries. No included studies were conducted in low-income countries. SSC probably promotes exclusive breastfeeding and improves infant thermoregulation and blood glucose levels. In addition, SSC may increase infant stabilization measured by the SCRIP score. The evidence about maternal physiological outcomes was inconclusive. Future research should prioritize methodological rigor. This includes providing clear descriptions of interventions and standard contact, carefully selecting relevant outcomes, and using reliable and objective measurement tools. Understudied areas include: the impact of medications and anesthetics, in terms of dose-response and other variables during SSC; biological and psychosocial mechanisms; additional physiological effects of SSC; and longer-term impacts. Instances of harm should be recorded. As WHO/UNICEF recommends immediate, uninterrupted SSC as the standard of care, randomizing to separation of mother and newborn may no longer be justifiable.

### Immediate or early skin-to-skin contact for mothers and their healthy newborn infants [^bbb8dfc7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

The Baby‐Friendly Hospital Initiative, launched by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), recommends that maternal‐infant skin‐to‐skin contact (SSC) begin soon after birth and continue, uninterrupted, until after the first breastfeeding. These recommendations are contrary to the 20th‐century industrialization of childbirth, in which mother and infant were routinely separated. However, there is wide variation in the practice of SSC, with low‐income countries reporting the lowest prevalence. Randomized and quasi‐randomized trials have demonstrated a positive effect of SSC on infant transition to extrauterine life, the breastfeeding trajectory, maternal‐infant attachment, and mothers' psychological and physiologic adjustment after birth.

### Skin-to-skin contact for the prevention of neonatal hypoglycaemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b9d6abf4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neonatal hypoglycaemia affects up to 5–15% of infants, and is associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. Therefore, prevention of neonatal hypoglycaemia is crucial to improve health outcomes for at-risk infants, including those born preterm, small for gestational age, large for gestational age or to mothers with diabetes.

Skin-to-skin contact involves the naked infant being placed prone on the bare chest of the mother soon after birth. The UNICEF Baby Friendly Initiative Guidelines suggest the duration of skin-to-skin contact should be a minimum of one hour or until the first feed is complete. Sometimes, the infant is placed in skin-to-skin contact with the father or another caregiver. The practice is also a component of Kangaroo Care and is now recognised to have many benefits for both caregivers and infants, including promoting physiological stability in infants, promoting early and exclusive breastfeeding and parent-infant bonding. Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) specifically refers to extended skin-to-skin contact (at least 8 h per day) for preterm and low birthweight infants (< 2.5 kg), in combination with exclusive breastfeeding support. In these infants, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend immediate initiation of KMC after birth. Uptake of KMC in low-resource settings has helped improve health outcomes, especially when incubators are unavailable.

There are several mechanisms through which skin-to-skin contact may potentially reduce the incidence of neonatal hypoglycaemia, including reducing the infant's energy expenditure by promoting thermoregulation, increasing quiet sleep time and reducing crying. Skin-to-skin contact also promotes early breastfeeding initiation which provides crucial nutrition to the infant.

Although skin-to-skin contact is recommended for inclusion in neonatal hypoglycaemia prevention guidelines by the UNICEF Baby Friendly Initiative, there is limited data about the efficacy of skin-to-skin contact for preventing neonatal hypoglycaemia. We undertook a systematic review to examine whether skin-to-skin contact is effective in preventing neonatal hypoglycaemia compared to standard care or other treatments, with the aim of informing future guideline development and clinical decision-making.

### Early skin-to-skin contact for mothers and their healthy newborn infants [^7af64cb1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Mother-infant separation post birth is common. In standard hospital care, newborn infants are held wrapped or dressed in their mother's arms, placed in open cribs or under radiant warmers. Skin-to-skin contact (SSC) begins ideally at birth and should last continually until the end of the first breastfeeding. SSC involves placing the dried, naked baby prone on the mother's bare chest, often covered with a warm blanket. According to mammalian neuroscience, the intimate contact inherent in this place (habitat) evokes neuro-behaviors ensuring fulfillment of basic biological needs. This time frame immediately post birth may represent a 'sensitive period' for programming future physiology and behavior.

Objectives

To assess the effects of immediate or early SSC for healthy newborn infants compared to standard contact on establishment and maintenance of breastfeeding and infant physiology.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (17 December 2015), made personal contact with trialists, consulted the bibliography on kangaroo mother care (KMC) maintained by Dr Susan Ludington, and reviewed reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials that compared immediate or early SSC with usual hospital care.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 46 trials with 3850 women and their infants; 38 trials with 3472 women and infants contributed data to our analyses. Trials took place in 21 countries, and most recruited small samples (just 12 trials randomized more than 100 women). Eight trials included women who had SSC after cesarean birth. All infants recruited to trials were healthy, and the majority were full term. Six trials studied late preterm infants (greater than 35 weeks' gestation). No included trial met all criteria for good quality with respect to methodology and reporting; no trial was successfully blinded, and all analyses were imprecise due to small sample size. Many analyses had statistical heterogeneity due to considerable differences between SSC and standard care control groups. Results for womenSSC women were more likely than women with standard contact to be breastfeeding at one to four months post birth, though there was some uncertainty in this estimate due to risks of bias in included trials (average risk ratio (RR) 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.43; participants = 887; studies = 14; I² = 41%; GRADE: moderate quality). SSC women also breast fed their infants longer, though data were limited (mean difference (MD) 64 days, 95% CI 37.96 to 89.50; participants = 264; studies = six; GRADE:low quality); this result was from a sensitivity analysis excluding one trial contributing all of the heterogeneity in the primary analysis. SSC women were probably more likely to exclusively breast feed from hospital discharge to one month post birth and from six weeks to six months post birth, though both analyses had substantial heterogeneity (from discharge average RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.49; participants = 711; studies = six; I² = 44%; GRADE: moderate quality; from six weeks average RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.90; participants = 640; studies = seven; I² = 62%; GRADE: moderate quality). Women in the SCC group had higher mean scores for breastfeeding effectiveness, with moderate heterogeneity (IBFAT (Infant Breastfeeding Assessment Tool) score MD 2.28, 95% CI 1.41 to 3.15; participants = 384; studies = four; I² = 41%). SSC infants were more likely to breast feed successfully during their first feed, with high heterogeneity (average RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.67; participants = 575; studies = five; I² = 85%). Results for infantsSSC infants had higher SCRIP (stability of the cardio-respiratory system) scores overall, suggesting better stabilization on three physiological parameters. However, there were few infants, and the clinical significance of the test was unclear because trialists reported averages of multiple time points (standardized mean difference (SMD) 1.24, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.72; participants = 81; studies = two; GRADE low quality). SSC infants had higher blood glucose levels (MD 10.49, 95% CI 8.39 to 12.59; participants = 144; studies = three; GRADE: low quality), but similar temperature to infants in standard care (MD 0.30 degree Celcius (°C) 95% CI 0.13 °C to 0.47 °C; participants = 558; studies = six; I² = 88%; GRADE: low quality). Women and infants after cesarean birthWomen practicing SSC after cesarean birth were probably more likely to breast feed one to four months post birth and to breast feed successfully (IBFAT score), but analyses were based on just two trials and few women. Evidence was insufficient to determine whether SSC could improve breastfeeding at other times after cesarean. Single trials contributed to infant respiratory rate, maternal pain and maternal state anxiety with no power to detect group differences. SubgroupsWe found no differences for any outcome when we compared times of initiation (immediate less than 10 minutes post birth versus early 10 minutes or more post birth) or lengths of contact time (60 minutes or less contact versus more than 60 minutes contact).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence supports the use of SSC to promote breastfeeding. Studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to confirm physiological benefit for infants during transition to extra-uterine life and to establish possible dose-response effects and optimal initiation time. Methodological quality of trials remains problematic, and small trials reporting different outcomes with different scales and limited data limit our confidence in the benefits of SSC for infants. Our review included only healthy infants, which limits the range of physiological parameters observed and makes their interpretation difficult.

### Obstetric and neonatal conditions and associations with early skin-to-skin contact-a cross-sectional study [^c3c534c3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

One out of ten infants in Denmark require specialized treatment and care. This often involves separating the mother and infant and admitting the infant to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and the mother in need of care to the obstetric department, respectively. Separation can potentially challenge the establishment of early physical and emotional closeness, continuous skin-to-skin contact (SSC), and breastfeeding in the first days following birth. Numerous studies highlight the positive effects of SSC on infants, including reduced mortality rates, lower infection risks, stable heart rate, and effective thermal regulation. For mothers, SSC encourages breastfeeding and reduces stress through minimal separation. Research argues that SSC supports parenting by strengthening bonding and providing long-term social and behavioral benefits. The co-parent holds an equal role to the mother in family formation, playing a crucial part in the process. SSC for co-parents has been shown to improve the parenting process and strengthen bonding. SSC for preterm or low-birth-weight infants is known as Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC). It is defined as early, continuous, and prolonged SSC combined with exclusive breastfeeding. It should be initiated as soon as possible after birth — ideally immediately or following initial stabilization — and can be provided by the mother or another caregiver. KMC is recommended as routine care for all preterm and low-birth-weight infants and should be practiced for 8–24 h per day (as many hours as possible).

### Community initiated kangaroo mother care and early child development in low birth weight infants in India-a randomized controlled trial [^4fab717a]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 8402 stable low birthweight (LBW) infants, majority being late preterm or term small for gestational age, community-initiated KMC (ciKMC) showed a significant improvement in survival. However, the effect of ciKMC on neurodevelopment is unclear. This is important to elucidate as children born with low birth weight are at high risk of neurodevelopmental deficits. In the first 552 stable LBW infants enrolled in the above trial, we evaluated the effect of ciKMC on neurodevelopmental outcomes during infancy.

Method

This RCT was conducted among 552 stable LBW infants, majorly late preterm or term small for gestational age infants without any problems at birth and weighing 1500-2250g at birth. The intervention comprised of promotion of skin-to-skin contact and exclusive breastfeeding by trained intervention delivery team through home visits. The intervention group mother-infant-dyads were supported to practice ciKMC till day 28 after birth or until the baby wriggled-out. All infants in the intervention and control groups received Home Based Post Natal Care (HBPNC) visits by government health workers. Cognitive, language, motor and socio-emotional outcomes were assessed at infant-ages 6- and 12-months using Bayley Scale of Infant Development (BSID-III). Other outcomes measured were infant temperament, maternal depression, maternal sense of competence, mother-infant bonding and home-environment. We performed post-hoc equivalence testing using two one-sided tests of equivalence (TOST) to provide evidence that ciKMC does not do harm in terms of neurodevelopment.

Results

In the intervention arm, the median (IQR) time to initiate ciKMC was 48 (48 to 72) hours after birth. The mean (SD) duration of skin-to-skin-contact was 27.9 (3.9) days with a mean (SD) of 8.7 (3.5) hours per day. We did not find significant effect of ciKMC on any of the child developmental outcomes during infancy. The TOST analysis demonstrated that composite scores for cognitive, language and motor domains at 12months among the study arms were statistically equivalent.

Conclusion

Our study was unable to capture any effect of ciKMC on neurodevelopment during infancy in this sample of stable late preterm or term small for gestational age infants. Long term follow-up may provide meaningful insights.

Trial Registration

The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov NCT02631343 dated February 17, 2016; Retrospectively registered.

### Immediate or early skin-to-skin contact for mothers and their healthy newborn infants [^6e78455c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

We followed the Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) when conducting the review. For reporting, we consulted the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and we adhered to the PRISMA statement.

Changes from the previous review update

For this update, we added three comparisons and nine outcomes and removed 11 outcomes that were listed in the 2016 review update. Supplementary material 8 provides specific details about the changes made and their rationale.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated active encouragement of immediate or early SSC between mothers and their healthy newborn infants versus usual hospital care. Cluster‐RCTs were eligible, but cross‐over trials and quasi‐randomized trials were ineligible. Quasi‐randomized trials are those where participants are assigned to groups through a process that is not strictly random, such as their date of birth, medical record number, or the day of the week.

Trials reported in abstract form were only eligible for inclusion if there was sufficient information to assess the trial and include data. We listed abstract reports with insufficient information in Supplementary material 5 for one update cycle, considering that a full publication may clarify eligibility.

The potential effects of early SSC on father‐infant attachment are beyond the scope of this review. Maternal feelings about SSC and satisfaction with the birth experience are important and relevant, but evaluation of these outcomes requires more qualitative methods.

Types of participants

We included mothers and their healthy full‐term or late preterm newborn infants (from 34 completed weeks' gestation) who had immediate or early SSC or standard contact. Infants eligible for our targeted trials weighed more than 2500 g, although some healthy late preterm infants weighed less and were not excluded. We excluded infants weighing 1500 g or less because we expected they would have been born before 34 weeks' gestation. We excluded any infant admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU); eligible infants were healthy enough to stay with their mothers in the postpartum unit.

We included women randomized to SSC after a primary or repeat elective cesarean birth.

We included trials with a subset of infants who did not meet our eligibility criteria if individual participant data were available such that we could exclude these ineligible infants from our analyses.

### Early intervention program for very low birth weight preterm infants and their parents: a study protocol [^d6c918a2]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Interventions: Written informed consent was signed by the parents of all preterm infants that filled inclusion criteria in the study protocol. When they complete 48 h of life they are sequentially randomized. The intervention is planned to start on the 7th day of life according the randomization in two arms:

Conventional group (CG): Standard care, according to the routine care of the NICU: skin-to skin care by mother, kangaroo care, and breast feeding policy. After discharge they are referral for a traditional follow up clinic taking care of the demands according to their necessity; with motor, and cognition evaluations and interventions according to their needs.

Intervention group (IG): Skin-to skin care by mother, kangaroo care, breastfeeding policy plus massage therapy are made by the mothers until hospital discharge. After discharge, they receive standard follow up care plus orientation for a continuous global simulation at home. Early intervention will be according to developmental milestones, anticipating in one month evolutionary step acquisition of motor and / or cognitive expected for corrected age. Besides that, we have a total of 10 home visits promoting guidance and supervision sessions. After each appointment, there is one home visit. A number of ten orientations appointments and ten home visits must be completed for each subject included in the IG. A complete description for each group is detailed below:

Conventional group: Our NICU has worked with Kangaroo mother care (KMC) as the practice of skin-to-skin contact since 1990 for all very low birth weight infants that parents consent to participate and their infants have clinical conditions. We have guidelines including staff knowledge and adequate training with available information to assist and support in developing best-practice guidelines and protocols for implementation this practice. During KMC, the infant, clad in a diaper and cap, is held in an upright prone position against the bare chest of the parent (most often the mother) and covered with clothing and/or a blanket. The duration of skin-to-skin contact is usually one hour per session, with cardiorespiratory and temperature monitoring of the infant during all this time. Although most often provided for stable preterm infants who do not require assisted ventilation, we have offered to preterm infants as young as 26 weeks' gestational age and birth weight 600 g or more who require respiratory support. We have promoted exclusive breastfeeding. Infants have been discharged home regardless of weight as soon as their mother understood how to care for and feed her infant.

### Skin-to-skin holding in relation to white matter microstructure in infants born preterm [^144a2e0d]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

The direction of the association between skin-to-skin care and white matter metrics and limited associations with FA offer further insight into the biologic mechanisms underlying the observed associations. During development, MD negatively and FA positively correlate with age. These changes may reflect reductions in water content from increases in tissue density, including those from myelination. Here, the positive association between MD and skin-to-skin care and negative association between FA and skin-to-skin care suggests that tissue properties, separate from those that contribute developmental changes in MD and FA, are correlated with skin-to-skin contact. We speculate that skin-to-skin contact could limit neuroinflammatory responses related to comorbidities of preterm birth (e.g. BPD, hypothalamic-pituitary-axis immaturity) or extrinsic stressors (e.g. pain, lack of parental contact/nutritive care). Reductions in inflammatory responses induced by reactive species (e.g. microglia) could alter tissue properties that may increase MD and reduce FAand/or slow cellular aging, a proposed mechanism through which environmental stress may affect brain development. This interpretation aligns with previous research linking elevated inflammatory cytokines and placental pathology to white matter alterations and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants. More research, particularly studies that integrate inflammatory biomarkers, advanced MRI protocols, and histologic validation, is needed to clarify the specific biological pathways that shape diffusion metrics in the immature neonatal brain and their sensitivity to early caregiving environments.

### Effectiveness of interventions on early neurodevelopment of preterm infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^313e1aca]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Rationale

Over the last decades, the increasing survival rates of preterm infants admitted in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit [NICU] have emphasized the importance of considering their neurodevelopmental outcomes. Preterm infants are more likely to have significant short- and long-term neurodevelopmental impairments, since their brains go through a critical period of development and maturation between 24 and 40 weeks of gestation occurring mainly during their NICU hospitalization. Significant neurodevelopmental disabilities associated with neurosensory, motor, behavioral and cognitive outcomes may then arise shortly after preterm infants' birth and last beyond school age and adolescence given that neurocognitive impairments in infants born preterm are still reported in adulthood.

Many factors in the NICU environment may be congruent or incongruent with the preterm infants' developing brain and consequently influence their neurodevelopmental outcomes. Environmental stimulation (i.e. light, noise), social interactions with parents and caregiving experience are among influential environmental NICU factors. Interventions targeting these elements during NICU hospitalization should therefore foster preterm infants' early neurodevelopment.

Different interventions initiated during NICU hospitalization targeting some of these influential NICU factors with the objective of improving preterm infants' neurodevelopment have been examined in previous systematic reviews. These interventions consist of developmental care a wide-ranging group of interventions to minimize preterm infants' NICU environmental stress, including Neonatal Individualized Developmental Care Assessment Program [NIDCAP], which is an individualized approach based on observing preterm infants' behaviors to guide caregiving activities provided by professionals and infants' family, noise reduction management, in addition to interventions with parental involvement (i.e. NIDCAP, kangaroo care and developmental care) and skin-to-skin contact. The effectiveness of these interventions has been evaluated on the long-term neurodevelopment of preterm infants at 12 months or 24 months of age, providing important evidence. Yet, measuring the effects of interventions implemented during hospitalization only at one year of age and older raises concerns about confounding factors that may have occurred between NICU discharge and the timing of the assessments and that could have influenced the infants' long-term neurodevelopment along with interventions.

Outcomes

The two main outcome measures at 5 ½ years were the level of intelligence and behavioural difficulties, using a contemporaneous group of term-born children from the ELFE cohort studyas a reference. The ELFE cohort enrolled participants during four inclusion periods in 2011: Apr 01–04, 2011; Jun 27–Jul 04, 2011; Sep 27–Oct 04, 2011; and Nov 28–Dec 05, 2011.

Cognitive domain — we used the French version of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, fourth edition, which measures cognitive ability in five domains (verbal comprehension, visuospatial indices, fluid reasoning, working memory, processing speed), resulting in a composite full-scale-intelligence-quotient (FSIQ) reflecting the overall level of intelligence. Results are reported as mean and standard deviations (SD), and score ≥ −1 SD, using cut-off points according to the mean and standard deviations of the reference sample mentioned above.

Behaviour — we used the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a self-administered parental questionnaire designed to screen for symptoms of hyperactivity/inattention, emotional, conduct, and peer problems. A total score is calculated by summing the scores of each domain, with higher scores indicating more difficulties. Children with a total score greater than or equal to the 90th centile of a reference sampleare usually considered as having a substantially raised probability of formally diagnosed mental health problems.

### Skin-to-skin holding in relation to white matter microstructure in infants born preterm [^ff528fb5]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Preterm birth is a leading cause of neurodevelopmental disability worldwide. Approximately 50%–67% of infants born very preterm (< 32 weeks gestational age [GA]) experience neurodevelopmental impairments. Volumetric and diffusion MRI studies link neurodevelopmental outcomes in children born very preterm to alterations neonatal white matter. White matter alterations are presumed to reflect disturbances in white matter maturation from hypoxia, ischemia, or inflammation induced by health complications associated with preterm birth. However, alterations in neonatal white matter may also reflect development differences relating to caregiving experiences in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) environment. Determining the impact of NICU caregiving experiences on neonatal white matter development has important implications for understanding how to modify neonatal care practices to support brain development and mitigate unfavorable long-term developmental outcomes.

Skin-to-skin care, also known as kangaroo care or kangaroo mother care (when provided by the mother), is a caregiving experience in which an infant, wearing only a diaper, is held to a caregiver's bare chest. Skin-to-skin care is associated with multiple health benefits (e.g. improved cardiorespiratory stability, sleep, growth, and reduced infections, pain, and stress) and positive caregiving behaviors (e.g. increased bonding and breastfeeding), all likely to be important for brain development. Recent evidence suggests that in-hospital skin-to-skin care significantly contributes to cognitive outcomes, even after accounting for well-known predictors of long-term outcomes, including family socioeconomic status (SES), infant health, and GA at birth. However, evidence explicitly linking skin-to-skin care to neonatal structural brain development remains limited. Such data are likely to provide important insights into the neurobiological and/or neurophysiologic processes that may be affected by skin-to-skin care experiences and that may, in turn, contribute to long-term outcomes.

### Skin-to-skin holding in relation to white matter microstructure in infants born preterm [^7d0de9af]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Several other limitations should be noted. We did not capture qualitative aspects of skin-to-skin interactions, such as caregiver engagement, positioning, or the emotional context of the experience. These factors may be important for understanding the full impact of skin-to-skin care on brain development. Our study was conducted within a single high-resourced NICU with a well-established system for charting developmental care and standardized developmental care pathways. Although this setting strengthens internal validity, it limits generalizability to NICUs with different clinical infrastructures, cultural practices, or resource constraints. Our single-center sample also reflects the sociodemographic characteristics of the Northern California region, particularly a high proportion of Hispanic/Latino families. Although the sample is ethnically and socioeconomically diverse, it may not be representative of other geographic or clinical samples. Limiting our sample to infants eligible for near-term MRI, may have introduced selection bias by excluding critically ill infants who may have the most risk for caregiving disruption and poor neurodevelopmental trajectories. Finally, although we restricted exposure data to skin-to-skin care administered before the MRI scan, the observational and retrospective nature of the study limits our ability to determine the directionality of observed associations or infer causality.

Amounts of skin-to-skin contact in the NICU were associated with measures of white matter microstructure in children born very preterm. These findings provide preliminary evidence that skin-to-skin contact may be neuroprotective. Future research should identify mechanisms of this effect, which may result from reductions in inflammatory responses or slow cellular aging, based on the direction of association. Future studies should further assess whether these early differences in brain microstructure translate to positive long-term developmental outcomes and whether white matter microstructure may serve as a mediator between skin-to-skin care and neurodevelopmental outcomes.

### Community initiated kangaroo mother care and early child development in low birth weight infants in India-a randomized controlled trial [^e2817c34]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Prior studies have reported beneficial effects of KMC on autonomic and neuro-behavioral maturation and quality of sleep. Moreover, through use of neuro-imaging and neuro-functional tests, KMC has also been shown to positively influence brain networks, synaptic efficacy and increased volume of the left caudate nucleus which is believed to regulate fine motor skills. It is possible that the effect of the intervention on outcomes such as cognition, language, motor development and infant temperament are subtle in infancy. The differences may manifest later in childhood that can be captured adequately using the age appropriate psychometric assessment and neuroimaging tools.

This argument gains impetus from the findings of a study where hospital-initiated KMC given during early infancy in preterm infants did not show any statistically significant differences in development scores at age of one year of age but was associated with reduced school absenteeism, hyperactivity, aggressiveness, externalization, and socio-deviant conduct of young adults after 20 years of enrollment. Considering the evidence that adults aged 20 years born small for gestational age at term had lower performances in subtests assessing attention and executive functions with lower volumes in the associated brain structures, it would be an important step forward to follow this cohort of infants and evaluate the effect of ciKMC in their long-term attentional performance. We, therefore, plan to assess cognitive, higher executive functioning and early academic skills using validated tools with reliable psychometric properties in children from the primary cohort at ages 6–7 years. The primary study on 8402 babies had an overall comparatively earlier initiation time for KMC (30 h vs 48 h) and a higher daily dose (11.5 h vs 8.7 h) compared to our subsample of the first 552 infants. This is probably due to the improvement of intervention delivery in the study over time. In the follow-up study, our plan to select a subsample from the primary cohort that received the intervention (ciKMC) early and for a prolonged period. We conducted a post-hoc analysis to understand dose-response effect (≥ 8 h/day compared to < 8 h/day) of skin-to-skin-contact on neurodevelopmental outcomes and infant temperament scores. We did not find any significant effect; however, we were was not adequately powered for this analysis (Supplementary Table 2). We hope that the findings of the follow-up study would better inform us on the long-term benefits of ciKMC on child development.

Infant physiological stability

Infant axillary temperature at 30 minutes to 2.5 hours postbirth

SSC probably results in a slight increase in infant axillary temperature (measured in ° C) at 30 minutes to 2.5 hours postbirth (MD 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.41; I² = 95%; 11 studies, 1349 infants; moderate‐certainty evidence; Analysis 1.6). However, an MD of 0.28 °C does not represent a clinically meaningful difference. All infants except those in Bystrova 2003 had a temperature between 36 °C and 37.1 °C. Results from this meta‐analysis should be interpreted with caution due to heterogeneity and some studies with very small sample sizes.

Infant blood glucose level at 75 minutes to 180 minutes postbirth

SSC probably increases infant blood glucose (measured in mg/dL) at 75 minutes to 180 minutes postbirth (MD 10.49, 95% CI 8.39 to 12.59; I² = 0%; 3 studies; 144 infants; moderate‐certainty evidence; Analysis 1.7). A difference of 10 mg/dL in blood glucose levels is clinically significant because symptomatic or high‐risk infants may be given supplemental bottles of infant formula, a practice that can interfere with the establishment of successful breastfeeding.

Infant SCRIP score during the first six hours postbirth

SSC may result in a large increase in SCRIP scores during the first six hours postbirth, suggesting better transition to extrauterine life (SMD 1.24, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.72; I² = 0%; 2 studies; 81 infants; low‐certainty evidence; Analysis 1.8). However, this result is based on only two studies, and no new data have been added since the 2016 review.

### Skin-to-skin contact (kangaroo care) accelerates autonomic and neurobehavioural maturation in preterm infants [^3e9807ea]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

The effects of mother-infant skin-to-skin contact (Kangaroo Care; KC) on autonomic functioning, state regulation, and neurobehavioural status was examined in 70 preterm infants, half of whom received KC over 24.31 days (SD 7.24) for a total of 29.76 hours (SD 12.86). Infants were matched for sex (19 males and 16 females in each group); birthweight (KC, 1229.95 g [SD 320.21]; controls, 1232.17 g [SD 322.15]); gestational age (GA) (KC, 30.28 weeks [SD 2.54]; controls, 30.19 weeks [SD 2.65]); medical risk; and family demographics. Vagal tone was calculated from 10 minutes of heart rate before KC and again at 37 weeks' GA. Infant state was observed in 10-second epochs during four consecutive hours before KC and again at 37 weeks' GA. Neurobehavioural status was assessed at 37 weeks' GA with the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS). Infants receiving KC showed a more rapid maturation of vagal tone between 32 and 37 weeks' GA (p = 0.029). More rapid improvement in state organization was observed in KC infants, in terms of longer periods of quiet sleep (p = 0.016) and alert wakefulness (p = 0.013) and shorter periods of active sleep (p = 0.023). Neurodevelopmental profile was more mature for KC infants, particularly habituation (p = 0.032) and orientation (p = 0.007). Results underscore the role of early skin-to-skin contact in the maturation of the autonomic and circadian systems in preterm infants.

### Skin-to-skin contact in the delivery room for very preterm infants: a randomised clinical trial [^ff26ff9d]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2023). High credibility.

Based on our experience, it is feasible to offer SSC to more immature and fragile infants than those included in this study. It can be speculated that more fragile infants with less self-regulatory capacity may benefit even more from early SSC, but this has, to the best of our knowledge, not been studied. The time period for initial SSC in the delivery/operating room is also a question of resources and organisation of birth and neonatal units and may have to be individualised based on the severity of sickness. However, more mature infants who are spontaneously breathing with or without continuous positive airway pressure can probably be safely cared for in SSC for more than 2 hours as shown by Linnér et al.

Facilitating SSC in the delivery and operating room required a redistribution of resources and extended cooperation between more healthcare professionals than usual. A recent paper underlines the importance of close collaboration between departments in order to prevent separation of infants and mothers from birth and throughout the hospital stay. This is also in accordance with the framework by WHO on holding health professionals accountable for facilitating a supportive environment at birth for preterm and low birthweight infants. More than 50% of infants in our study were born by C-section, and it is, therefore, important to include them both in clinical studies and practice.

This study was stopped prematurely after 6 years of recruitment. A majority of parents expressed a strong wish to hold and touch their infant as soon and as much as possible after delivery, and it became increasingly difficult for the staff to withhold early SSC. We find it unlikely that increasing the number of participants would have altered the results of this study, but the study may be underpowered for the primary outcome.

Interventions in the NICU should be evidence based, and any intervention must be proven safe and free from harm. However, questions may be raised about the level of evidence needed to offer interventions that are considered emotionally sound for healthy, full-term-born infants and their parents, as well as for preterm infants in an NICU environment. The experiences during the present study led to the implementation into clinical practice in two of the three participating units immediately after inclusion was stopped.

### Immediate or early skin-to-skin contact for mothers and their healthy newborn infants [^ad8d6b70]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Rationale

Research supports the beneficial effects of immediate maternal‐infant skin‐to‐skin contact (SSC) after all modes of birth on breastfeeding/lactation and neonatal physiology, but little is known about how it might influence maternal physiology, including postpartum blood loss and placental separation time. Despite the findings from the 2016 Cochrane review of skin‐to‐skin contact, and although the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) recommend immediate, continuous, uninterrupted SSC after birth, newborn infants are still separated from their mothers during this period in many settings. SSC is less common in low‐income and lower‐middle‐income countries (World Bank classification), which suggests country income level could impact breastfeeding exclusivity. This update integrates the evidence found since 2015 into the review.

Objectives

To assess the effects of immediate skin‐to‐skin contact (< 10 minutes postbirth) or early skin‐to‐skin contact (10 minutes–24 hours postbirth) compared with existing hospital practices (standard contact) on the establishment and maintenance of breastfeeding and on maternal and infant physiology among healthy newborn infants and their mothers.

Search methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL up to 22 March 2024 and two trial registers up to 3 July 2025, along with reference checking and contact with experts.

Eligibility criteria

Randomized controlled trials that compared immediate or early SSC with other hospital care after a vaginal or cesarean birth. Participants were mothers and their healthy full‐term or late preterm newborns (≥ 34 weeks' gestation). Infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit were excluded.

Outcomes

Our critical outcomes included exclusive breastfeeding, infant axillary temperature, infant blood glucose levels, infant SCRIP score (cardiorespiratory stability), placental separation time/duration of the third stage of labor, and maternal blood loss.

Risk of bias

We used Cochrane's original risk of bias 1 tool (RoB 1). We assessed the risk of performance and detection bias separately for subjective and objective outcomes.

Synthesis methods

We conducted random‐effects meta‐analysis where there was substantial heterogeneity and fixed‐effect meta‐analysis for infant blood glucose and SCRIP score. We calculated the summary risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using the Mantel‐Haenszel method for dichotomous outcomes. We calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI using inverse variance for continuous outcomes, except infant SCRIP score, where we used the standardized mean difference (SMD). We used the GRADE approach to summarize the certainty of evidence.

Included studies

We added 26 new trials (3775 mother‐infant pairs) to this update for a total of 69 trials (7290 mother‐infant pairs). Most studies (43/69) compared immediate SSC with standard hospital care. Ten studies included late preterm infants, and 15 included children born by cesarean delivery. Thirty‐two trials were conducted in high‐income countries, 25 in upper‐middle‐income countries, and 12 in lower‐middle‐income countries. Fifty‐six studies contributed data to the meta‐analyses.

No included trial met all the criteria for high‐quality methodology and reporting. Many analyses had statistical heterogeneity due to considerable differences between SSC and control group conditions.

Synthesis of results

Breastfeeding/lactation

SSC compared with standard contact probably increases rates of exclusive breastfeeding at hospital discharge to one month postbirth (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.56; I² = 62%; 12 studies; 1556 mother‐infant pairs; moderate‐certainty evidence) and at six weeks to six months postbirth (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.74; I² = 87%; 11 studies; 1135 mother‐infant pairs; moderate‐certainty evidence), though both analyses had substantial heterogeneity.

Infant physiological stability

SSC compared with standard contact probably increases infant axillary temperature, but the MD of 0.28 °C is not clinically meaningful (MD 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.41; I² = 95%; 11 studies; 1349 infants; moderate‐certainty evidence). SSC probably increases blood glucose levels measured in mg/dL (MD 10.49, 95% CI 8.39 to 12.59; I² = 0%; 3 studies; 114 infants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Infants who have SSC may also have higher SCRIP scores overall, indicating more optimal cardiorespiratory stabilization. However, the trials reporting this outcome had small sample sizes, and the clinical significance was unclear because trialists reported averages of multiple time points (SMD 1.24, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.72; I² = 0%; 2 studies; 81 infants; low‐certainty evidence).

Maternal physiology

SSC may result in little to no difference in placental separation time/duration of the third stage of labor in minutes (MD ‐2.26, 95% CI ‐5.04 to 0.52; I² = 88%; 4 studies; 450 mothers; low‐certainty evidence) and maternal postpartum blood loss in mL (MD ‐145.92, 95% CI ‐416.96 to 125.11; I² = 97%; 2 studies; 143 mothers; very low‐certainty evidence), although these results should be interpreted with caution due to high heterogeneity and the small number of studies.

Authors' conclusions

This review supports immediate SSC after birth, regardless of mode of birth, for mothers and their healthy full‐term and late preterm infants in middle‐income and high‐income countries. No included studies were conducted in low‐income countries. SSC probably promotes exclusive breastfeeding and improves infant thermoregulation and blood glucose levels. In addition, SSC may increase infant stabilization measured by the SCRIP score. The evidence about maternal physiological outcomes was inconclusive.

Future research should prioritize methodological rigor. This includes providing clear descriptions of interventions and standard contact, carefully selecting relevant outcomes, and using reliable and objective measurement tools. Understudied areas include: the impact of medications and anesthetics, in terms of dose‐response and other variables during SSC; biological and psychosocial mechanisms; additional physiological effects of SSC; and longer‐term impacts. Instances of harm should be recorded. As WHO/UNICEF recommends immediate, uninterrupted SSC as the standard of care, randomizing to separation of mother and newborn may no longer be justifiable.

Recently, the immediate KMC Study, a large multinational randomized controlled trial (RCT) in low- and middle-income countries demonstrated a mortality reduction of 25 percent in the group of immediate skin-to-skin contact and non-separation compared to conventional care in very low birth-weight infants. Several trials in high-resource settings have demonstrated the benefits of keeping mothers and their infants physically and emotionally close even after very preterm or complicated births. A recent RCT in Sweden and Norway reported that immediate skin-to-skin contact for very preterm infants led to more stable infant physiology and positive and meaningful experiences of the parents, including fathers. Another RCT from Norway similarly reported feasibility and safety of immediate or early skin-to-skin contact for very preterm infants as well as positive experiences of the mothers. A RCT in Germany reported less impaired bonding and improved motor and vocal development of the infant, as well as reduced expression in studied stress-related genes in the group receiving immediate skin-to-skin contact, compared to conventional care after a very preterm birth. The feasibility, safety and positive parental experiences of "delivery room cuddle", in which the mother holds her extremely preterm or sick infant for a brief period of time prior to the admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (neonatal unit), have been reported by different study groups in the United Kingdom. Non-separation can be attained, and it is preferred by parents, also during the resuscitation of the infant if the stabilization procedure is performed near the mother in the labor ward/operating room.

This descriptive cohort study documented continuity between family-delivered skin-to-skin care rates for preterm infants in the NICU and amounts of child-directed speech at child age 9 months. Involvement in skin-to-skin care may be an early marker of caregiver-infant engagement and a target for early interventions that support positive caregiver-infant interactions.

### Skin-to-skin contact after birth and the natural course of neurosteroid levels in healthy term newborns [^700bafce]. Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Implementation of skin-to-skin (STS) contact, also known as Kangaroo Care, has been reported to benefit both term and preterm infants in short-term outcomes, such as breastfeeding establishment and blood sugar levels, as well as longer-term outcomes, such as infant growth, breastfeeding duration and mother–infant attachment. In particular, in preterm, very low birth weight infants, STS appears to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes, including accelerated neurophysiological brain maturationand improved emotional and cognitive regulatory capacity in infancy. However, there is a paucity of data on the biological mechanism of STS on neurodevelopmental outcome.

Neuroactive steroids, predominantly 5α-reduced pregnanes, cross the blood–brain barrier and affect brain development and functioning either by directly interacting with neurotransmitter receptors or through genetic mechanisms. Neurosteroid biomarkers exert inhibitory and excitatory effects on neurotransmission to clinically impact stress, pain, cognition, memory and seizures; they can also produce neuroprotective and neurogenic effects. Neurosteroids exert these effects on the brain predominantly through GABA receptors but also via N -methyl — aspartate receptors, sigma-1 receptors, glycine receptors, microtubule assembly and myelin repair.

Recent veterinary observations in birthing mammals have described neuroactive steroids as the cause of a neurological syndrome in newborn horses. In neonatal equine maladjustment syndrome (NEMS), behavioral abnormalities include altered states of consciousness, failure to bond with the mother, failure to nurse, wandering, lack of normal environmental responses and disorientation (see video at).NEMS can be ameliorated using a 'thoracic squeeze technique' (see video at), which is analogous to a 'maternal embrace' in humans.

We hypothesized that STS contact after birth may affect the natural course of neurosteroid levels in human neonates. We studied nine of the neuroactive steroid compounds most commonly reported in the literature to act on the human brain. These included inhibitory neurosteroids (allopregnanolone and pregnanolone), excitatory neurosteroids (pregnenolone-sulfate and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS)), neurosteroids with neuroprotective or neurogenic effects (pregnenolone and progesterone) and neurosteroids with mixed effects (isopregnanolone, epipregnanolone and pregnanolone-sulfate). Our objective was to determine the immediate postnatal time course of neurosteroid levels and study the change in neurosteroid levels in relation to infant gender, mode of delivery and the extent of STS during the first days of life in healthy term babies.

### Recommendations for involving the family in developmental care of the NICU baby [^2b2ddde7]. Journal of Perinatology (2015). Low credibility.

Several studies have revealed a link between infant stress in the NICU and the corresponding changes in brain architecture. Smith et al. demonstrated that when neonates were exposed to increasing numbers of stressors in the NICU, the babies had regional alterations in brain structure and function, as determined by magnetic resonance imaging, as well as abnormalities in motor behavior on neurobehavioral examination. However, when parents of premature babies are shown how to recognize their baby's behavioral, social and physical cues, parents facilitate their baby's developmental and physical progress, further reflected by changes in the brain's structure. Milgrom et al. found that when parents participated in a 10-session training program to help them reduce their preterm babies' stressful experiences, their babies' brains showed improved cerebral white matter micro-structural development, again as determined by magnetic resonance imaging. In another study, preterm babies who received 8 weeks of skin-to-skin contact with their mothers demonstrated accelerated functional brain maturation as assessed by electroencephalogram, when compared with babies who did not receive such contact.

Further work by Milgrom et al. evaluated the impact of an extended intervention using the enhanced Mother–Infant Transaction Program, called PremieStart, on both mothers and their babies born at < 30 weeks gestation. The goals for mothers who participated in this training were to recognize and minimize stress responses in their babies. Mothers who participated were found to be more sensitive to their babies and were appropriately responsive to the identified stress behaviors. Their babies displayed fewer stress behaviors at term equivalent age and showed more advanced communication development at 6 months corrected age. This latter finding gives promise that the intervention may provide an early benefit to cognitive and pre-linguistic development. White-Traut et al. demonstrated that when mothers received information on how to provide their babies with simple, developmentally appropriate multi-sensory stimulation through the 'Hospital to Home Transition — Optimizing Premature Infant's Environment' program, their babies had better weight gain during the hospital stay and were less likely to see a health-care provider for an illness in the 6-weeks post-NICU discharge. Parents also benefited when they were supported to improve interactions with their babies. Melnyk et al. found that parents who participated in the 'Creating Opportunities for Parent Empowerment' program during their NICU stay reported less stress while in the NICU and less depression and anxiety at 2 months' corrected infant age than did mothers who did not receive the intervention. Babies of participating mothers also had a shorter length of stay in the NICU.

### Skin-to-skin holding in relation to white matter microstructure in infants born preterm [^8adaf8e1]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Here, we provide evidence linking in-hospital experiences of skin-to-skin care to measures of neonatal structural brain development in infants born very preterm. We found that the duration per instance and daily exposure rate of skin-to-skin care during NICU hospitalization were associated with measures of white matter microstructure in 2 key frontal and limbic pathways: the cingulum and ATR. Importantly, these associations remained significant after accounting for clinical, developmental, sociodemographic, and scan-related factors previously linked to neonatal white matter development. Additional analyses confirmed that associations were not driven by infants with white matter injury and were not moderated by health acuity or SES, indicating that the effects of skin-to-skin care were similar across infants with varying levels of medical complexity and sociodemographic backgrounds. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that early family-centered caregiving experiences in the NICU may be associated with neonatal brain development in infants born preterm.

Previous evidence linking skin-to-skin care experiences to brain development has either come from studies assessing the safety of skin-to-skin care using indirect physiologic markers of neural functioning (e.g. heart rate variability, oxygen saturation) or randomized trials that have assessed structural and functional brain development in older children and adults who had experienced skin-to-skin care as infants. Our study provides novel evidence that skin-to-skin care may relate to brain development as early as the neonatal period, even before infants are discharged from the hospital. This finding extends previous work by demonstrating that relations between skin-to-skin care and brain development are not only long-term and potentially mediated by enhanced parent-infant bonding but are also more immediate and proximal to the experience itself. Our findings are complementary to previous work that has linked white matter development to adverse painful experiences in the neonatal period, such as medical procedures requiring skin breaks. Taken together, these findings add to growing evidence that white matter development is sensitive to experience in the neonatal period, such as NICU caregiving activities, including those presumed to be neuroprotective or aversive. Further research is needed to determine whether optimizing neuroprotective activities can mitigate the negative effects that medical complications and/or pain-inducing clinical procedures have on neonatal brain development and longer-term outcomes.

### What is stopping us? An implementation science study of kangaroo care in British columbia's neonatal intensive care units [^73f9450b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

KMC provides early and continuous skin-to-skin contact in the kangaroo position between an infant and a parent, ideally for 24 h a day, with exclusive breastfeeding and proper follow-up at home and in the community. Terms such as skin-to-skin care/contact, KMC, and KC are used interchangeably to describe this model. In our setting we chose to use the term Kangaroo Care to signal that others besides a mother can provide an infant this care. KC offers an environment that reduces stress and provides comfort, support, and positive social interaction for both parents and infants. KC has been shown to facilitate an infant's transition to extrauterine life, to promote early parent-infant attachment and bonding, to enhance breastfeeding, to decrease pain responses and risk of infection, to have positive effects on infant sleep patterns, to promote neurodevelopment, and regulate physiology and behaviour in the short- and long-term. KC is recommended as a feasible, natural, cost-effective, and evidence-based intervention that should be a standard of care for all infants, regardless of geographic location or economic status.

In resource-supported settings like Canada, KC is seen as a complement to conventional NICU care in which infants spend most of their time in an incubator and continuous KC is not common. Conventional medical care protocols often result in incubator-based treatments that require maternal separation from preterm infants. KC, if practiced, is most often implemented intermittently, for a limited time period when the infant is considered stable, on average for one to 2 h at a time. Despite the strong evidence for positive infant, maternal, and family outcomes and recommendations for the widespread adoption of KC internationally, the integration of continuous KC into the care of preterm infants remains extremely variable.

Approximately 11% of babies in British Columbia (BC) are born preterm and require care through BC's publicly funded healthcare system, which serves a demographically diverse population of approximately 5.1 million people spread over 944,735 km 2. The BC Ministry of Health and Ministry of Child and Family Development identified supporting studying KC implementation in the province as a priority due its documented positive effects on short and long-term child health outcomes and reduction of maternal stress, anxiety, and depression by supporting parent-infant bonding and providing an environment that enhances cognitive and emotional development. This study aimed to explore the barriers and enablers to the practice of KC to enhance the uptake of KC in the province's NICUs.

Breastfeeding/lactation

Any breastfeeding at one month to four months postbirth

Our meta‐analysis of data from two small trials suggests that women who had SSC were more likely on average to be breastfeeding at one month to four months after cesarean birth (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.44; I² = 0%; 2 studies; 220 mother‐infant pairs; Analysis 2.3).

Duration of any breastfeeding

No studies in this comparison reported duration of any breastfeeding.

Breastfeeding status/level of breastfeeding exclusivity at one month postbirth

### Early intervention program for very low birth weight preterm infants and their parents: a study protocol [^c0efb349]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Preterm infants are high risk for delayed neurodevelopment. The main goal is to develop a program of early intervention for very preterm infants that allows families to apply it continuously at home, and quantify the results of early parental stimulation on improvement of cognition and motor skills.

Methods

Randomized clinical Trial including inborn preterm infants with gestational age less than 32 weeks or birth weight less than 1500 g at 48 h after birth. Eligible for begin the intervention up to 7 days after birth. Study Protocol approved by the Brazilian national Committee of ethics in Research and by the institutional ethics committee. Intervention group (IG): skin-to skin care by mother (kangaroo care) plus tactile-kinesthetic stimulation by mothers from randomization until hospital discharge when they receive a program of early intervention with 10 parents' orientation and a total of 10 home visits independently of the standard evaluation and care that will be performed. Systematic early intervention program will be according to developmental milestones, anticipating in a month evolutionary step acquisition of motor and / or cognitive expected for corrected age. Active comparator with a Conventional Group (CG): standard care according to the routine care of the NICU and their needs in the follow up program. Neurodevelopment outcome with blinded evaluations in both groups between 12 and 18 months by Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development third edition and Alberta Motor Infant scale will be performed. All evaluations will be conducted in the presence of parents or caregivers in a safe room for the child move around during the evaluation.

Discussion

If we can show that a continuous and global early intervention at home performed by low income families is better than the standard care for very preterm infants, this kind of program may be applied elsewhere in the world. We received grants by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, DECIT, Cnpq and Health Ministry. Grand Challenges Brazil: All Children Thriving.

Trial Registration

The study was restrospectively registered in ClinicalTrials.gov. in July 15 2016 (NCT02835612).

### Effectiveness of early intervention programs for parents of preterm infants: a meta-review of systematic reviews [^0d9029fc]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

The most frequently reported interventions in our meta-review included the well-established programs: KC, MITP and IHDP. While KC has been defined with four key components - early, continuous, and prolonged skin-to-skin contact between the new-born and mother; exclusive breastfeeding; early discharge from the health facility; and close follow-up at home, there were variations in their implementation across the SRs. The theoretical foundations of MITP and IHDP have been highlighted by some SRs to demonstrate their positive impact. MITP is rooted in the transactional theory of development arguing that children's developmental outcomes are shaped by the dynamic interplay between the child's behaviour, the caregiver's response, and the contextual factors that may influence both the child's behaviour and the caregiver response. This framework emphasised children's active role in a reciprocal interaction that influences their own development. MITP helps to enable the parents to appreciate their infant's unique characteristics, temperament and developmental potential, gradually sensitizing parents to infant cues, thereby improving the interaction between the parents and the infants. The modified version, M-MITP was designed to support mothers of preterm infants up to 5 years of age based on the premise that mothers' experiences of the preterm infant will transform over time and improve connection between the mother and the infant. The programme also encouraged engagement from both fathers and mothers, which eventually appeared to enhance their commitment to the programme. IHDP is underpinned by the wider bio-psychosocial model of early development which views the child's social and cognitive development as influenced by the extent of parent support, cultural environment, health status and genetics. The programme included both home and facility based approaches designed to enhance the cognitive, behavioural, and health status of the infant, with the parent considered as an essential participant.

### Skin-to-skin care for term and preterm infants in the neonatal ICU [^7fa8d67d]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Kangaroo mother care (KMC) — background evidence defines the original method and summarizes mortality outcomes. In the original version, the infant is placed in continuous skin-to-skin contact in a vertical position between the mother's breasts and beneath her clothes and is exclusively (or nearly exclusively) breastfed. A meta-analysis of 988 infants enrolled in 3 randomized controlled trials of continuous KMC begun in the first postnatal week in low- or middle-income countries found a 51% reduction in mortality among infants with a birth weight < 2000 g (relative risk: 0.49 [95% confidence interval: 0.29–0.82]). A Cochrane meta-analysis of 18 trials of continuous KMC begun before postnatal day 10 in infants with a birth weight < 2500 g also showed significantly reduced mortality and morbidity.

### Breast feeding and intergenerational social mobility: what are the mechanisms? [^d8f8f250]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, only one study has directly assessed the effect of breast feeding on upward social mobility. In that study, only 44% of eligible respondents had data on social class in both childhood and adulthood and on breast feeding in infancy (N≈1400). The authors acknowledged that they were neither able to investigate causal pathways nor to rule out the possibility of residual confounding. Interestingly though, their estimates of the causal effect of breast feeding were very similar to ours. Studies that have estimated effects separately for low birth weight and preterm infants have tended to show that shorter term benefits are greater for these children than healthy full-term children. We speculate that the long-term gains from breast feeding for these more vulnerable children may be greater too.

It is difficult to disentangle the independent role for the nutrient content of breast milk versus the role of skin-to-skin contact. While our results show a stronger mediating pathway through neurological development than through stress response mechanisms, studies of supplementation of formula milk suggest that LCPUFAs alone may not improve cognitive development. However, other bioactive constituents of breast milk may also be important. Skin-to-skin contact has been related to improved mother–child bonding and cognitive functioning. Perhaps the combination of physical contact and the most appropriate nutrients required for growth and brain development is implicated in the better neurocognitive and adult outcomes of breastfed infants. This might suggest that mothers who do not breast feed could aid their child's development by mimicking the close skin-to-skin contact that breastfeeding mothers naturally have with their infant during feeding and selecting brands of formula that contain LCPUFA. The UNICEF Baby Friendly Initiative aims to increase breastfeeding initiation rates throughout the world. The 2010 Infant Feeding Survey showed that in the UK, only a third of mothers who start to breast feed still do so exclusively at 6 weeks implying that extending the initiative to policies that sustain breast feeding is also recommended.

### Kangaroo mother care for preterm or low birth weight infants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b9af443a]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Methods

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Our review included individually-randomised and cluster-randomised trials that compared KMC with conventional care or early initiation (ie, in the first 24 hours after birth) of KMC with late-initiated KMC among low birth weight and preterm infants, irrespective of the duration of KMC, infant stability at enrolment, study setting, and breastfeeding patterns. Trials reported as only abstracts were included if sufficient information on study methods was available to assess the eligibility and the risk of bias. We excluded quasi-randomised and crossover trials, studies evaluating KMC among term infants or those with birthweight > 2500 g, and studies assessing KMC on only physiological parameters, pain scores, maternal mental health, infant colic, or during neonatal transport or as a part of a package of interventions.

Search strategy

We systematically reviewed the relevant publications by searching the electronic databases of MEDLINE (1966 to March 2022) via PubMed ® and OVID, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1 to March 2022), EMBASE (1988 to March 2022), CINAHL (1981 to March 2022), and the databases PsycINFO, AMED, EMCARE, BNI from inception until March 2022. We used the search terms "kangaroo care", "kangaroo mother care", "skin-to-skin care", and "neonates or infants" in the search strategy. The search was initially conducted until March 2021 (for the presentation of review findings to the WHO Guideline Development Group of the guidelines on the care of low birth weight infants); the search was then updated to March 2022. The search strategy, search results, and the definitions used in the review are provided in online supplemental file 1. We also searched the databases of clinical trials and reference lists of retrieved articles for eligible studies.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was mortality during birth hospitalisation or by day 28 of life. Other outcomes were mortality by 6–12 months of age, severe infections, infant growth, neurodevelopment, hypothermia, length of hospital stay, readmission to hospital, and exclusive breastfeeding at discharge and at one and 6 months of age.

Evidence for SSC and rooming-in — physiologic stability and comfort outcomes. "SSC has been researched extensively as a method to provide improved physiologic stability for newborns and potential benefits for mothers". "SSC immediately after birth stabilizes the newborn body temperature and can help prevent hypothermia". It "helps stabilize blood glucose concentrations, decreases crying, and provides cardiorespiratory stability, especially in late preterm newborns", and "has been shown in numerous studies as a method to decrease pain in newborns being held by mothers". In preterm infants, SSC "has been shown to result in improved autonomic and neurobehavioral maturation and gastrointestinal adaptation, more restful sleep patterns, less crying, and better growth".

### The power of early experience: neonatal skin-to-skin care mitigates SES-related disparities in developmental outcomes [^f98b1354]. Infancy (2025). Medium credibility.

Infants from lower-socioeconomic (SES) backgrounds are at increased risk for compromised developmental outcomes compared to infants from higher-SES backgrounds. Features of caregiver-child interactions have been proposed as mechanisms through which SES-related factors are associated with child outcomes. This study assessed whether rates of tactile interactions between neonates and family members (skin-to-skin caregiving) served as a mechanism, that is, statistically mediated, SES-related developmental disparities in infants born preterm (n = 95). Infants from lower-SES backgrounds experienced less skin-to-skin care and scored lower on developmental assessments than infants from higher-SES backgrounds. Infants who experienced more skin-to-skin care had better outcomes than infants who experienced less skin-to-skin care. Critically, the direct association between SES and outcomes was significantly reduced after controlling for skin-to-skin care rates. Thus, SES-related disparities were linked to caregiving experiences as early as the neonatal period. Parallel analyses on non-skin-to-skin tactile care (swaddled holding, touch, and massage) revealed no associations, highlighting the specificity of skin-to-skin caregiving. These findings make substantial contributions to developmental theory and offer concrete and scalable recommendations for intervention.

### Early skin-to-skin contact for mothers and their healthy newborn infants [^d8ec6a26]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Early skin-to-skin contact involves placing the naked baby prone on the mother's bare chest at birth or soon afterwards (< 24 hour). This could represent a 'sensitive period' for priming mothers and infants to develop a synchronous, reciprocal, interaction pattern, provided they are together and in intimate contact. Routine separation shortly after hospital birth is a uniquely Western cultural phenomenon that may be associated with harmful effects including discouragement of successful breastfeeding.

Objectives

To assess the effects of early skin-to-skin contact on breastfeeding, behavior, and physiology in mothers and their healthy newborn infants.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group and Neonatal Group trials registers (December 2002), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2002), MEDLINE (1976 to 2002).

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized clinical trials comparing early skin-to-skin contact with usual hospital care.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We collected adverse effects information from the trials.

Main Results

Seventeen studies, involving 806 participants, were included. We found statistically significant and positive effects of early skin-to-skin contact on breastfeeding at one to three months postbirth (odds ratio (OR) 2.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10 to 4.22), breastfeeding duration (weighted mean difference (WMD) 41.99, 95% CI 13.97 to 70.00), maintenance of infant temperature in the neutral thermal range (OR 12.18, 95% CI 2.04 to 72.91), infant blood glucose (WMD 11.07, 95% CI 3.97 to 18.17), infant crying (OR 21.89, 95% CI 5.19 to 92.30) and summary scores of maternal affectionate love/touch (SMD 0.73, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.11) during an observed breastfeeding within the first few days postbirth. We found no statistically significant benefit of early skin-to-skin contact for other major clinical variables: breastmilk maturation, maternal chest circumference, infant heart rate.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Limitations included the methodological quality of the studies, variations in the implementation of the intervention and outcome variability. Early skin-to-skin contact appears to have some clinical benefit especially regarding breastfeeding outcomes and infant crying and has no apparent short or long-term negative effects. Further investigation is recommended. To facilitate meta-analysis of the data, future research in this area should involve outcome measures consistent with those used in the studies included here. Published reports should also clearly indicate if the intervention was skin-to-skin contact and include means, standard deviations and exact probability values.

### Skin-to-skin care for term and preterm infants in the neonatal ICU [^36af13b2]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Skin-to-skin care (SSC) safety and feasibility in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are summarized as follows: Despite apparent physiologic stability during SSC, it is prudent that infants in the NICU be continuously monitored and that care be taken to verify correct head positioning for airway patency and the stability of the endotracheal tube, arterial and venous access devices, and other life support equipment; any infant who requires careful temperature regulation or a high-humidity environment might have SSC delayed until he or she is more stable; and because SSC has been shown to be feasible and safe in the NICU in infants as young as 26 weeks' gestation, facilities are encouraged to offer this care when possible.

### Skin to skin contact correlated with improved production and consumption of mother's own milk [^f052a430]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background: Human milk diet, preferably mother's own milk (MOM) over donor milk (DM), is recommended for preterm infants. Expression of MOM in proximity to preterm infants, especially during or immediately after skin-to-skin contact (SSC), is associated with greater milk production. However, the correlation between SSC and MOM production during hospital admission in preterm infants has not yet been studied. Our study investigated the relationship between SSC and MOM production and consumption in preterm infants during the first postnatal month of life. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective cohort study. Mothers and their preterm infants born at < 35 weeks by gestational age (GA) and eligible for SSC within the first 5 postnatal days were eligible for the study. Mothers were given a binder to document pumped breast milk volumes and SSC sessions. Pumped breast milk volumes, enteral feeding type and volume, and SSC duration and frequency were collected daily over the first 28 days of life, along with demographic, perinatal, and feeding data from electronic medical records (EMR). Results: Mean birth GA and weight were 30 ± 3 weeks and 1,443 ± 576g, respectively. SSC duration was inversely correlated with GA and weight. The SSC duration was positively correlated with ingested MOM volume after correcting for birth GA. The SSC duration was predictive of increased volumes of pumped MOM. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that SSC duration is associated with improved MOM production and consumption. SSC can be a useful tool to increase MOM exposure and improve long-term health outcomes in preterm infants.

### Parent-guided developmental intervention for infants with very low birth weight… [^cb8d839f]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Question In low- to middle-income countries, does a parent-guided early intervention for very preterm infants or those with very low birth weight improve cognitive outcomes at 18 months of age compared with usual care. Findings In this randomized clinical trial among 100 infants of families residing in an LMIC, the parent-guided developmental intervention initiated in the neonatal intensive care unit and continued in the home improved early cognitive function of very preterm or very low birth weight infants. Objective To evaluate whether parent-guided early intervention improves the neurodevelopmental outcomes of preterm infants in an LMIC. Design, Setting, and Participants.

Conclusions and Relevance In this randomized clinical trial of a parent-guided developmental intervention for early cognitive function of very preterm or very low birth weight infants implemented in an LMIC, the intervention improved very preterm infants' neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months of adjusted age. Parent-guided early intervention can improve neurodevelopmental outcome of very preterm infants born in LMICs. We posited that increasing parents' psychological well-being, the quality of parent-infant interactions, and developmentally supportive activities would enhance infants' regulatory abilities, brain plasticity, and cognitive and social development. In addition, therapists instructed parents in infant massage, passive stretching of extremities, and postural positioning, each of which could enhance the parents' sense of parenting and infants' motor development.

This study differs from previous studies of developmental interventions for high-risk infants due to its implementation in an LMIC. The major finding is that infants randomized to enhanced developmental support scored higher on standardized assessments of early cognitive functioning, the primary outcome, at 18 months. In addition, the intervention was associated with higher cognitive scores at earlier ages and with higher scores for language and motor development at 18 months of age and earlier. These findings suggest that primary caregivers were effective facilitators of their infants' development, and motor interventions are easier for parents to understand and implement. Previous intervention studies have shown benefits of early intervention for children born preterm, especially in cognitive and motor skills, although few have assessed both domains concurrently.

7, 10, 17, 18 Recently, the Explorer Baby early intervention program for preterm infants without brain injury18 reported that infants who received this intervention showed gains in cognitive and language development during the first 6 months similar to gains exhibited by the active control group, which received neurodevelopmental therapy.

### Essential components of an educational program for implementing skin-to-skin contact for preterm infants in intensive care units: an integrative literature review [^ee54d99d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction and background

An estimated 13, 4 million infants were delivered prematurely in 2020, indicating that more than 1 to 10 births are premature. Up to 70% of neonatal deaths occur in preterm or Low Birth Weight (LBW) infants within the first 3 days after birth, but the mortality can be reduced by effective newborn care. Although progress has been made in reducing infant mortality rate globally, more than 45% of the five million under-five mortality rate caters for infants death in the first months of life and approximately one million of these children die within the first 28 days from prematurity and LBW. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a preterm infant is infant born after the first day of the last menstrual period but before the completion of 37 weeks of gestation; that is, they have a small gestational age and LBW.

In South Africa, the neonatal mortality rate in 2017 was reported as 12 per 1000 live births. Moreover, approximately 10% of the preterm infants born in South Africa do not survive and this could be viewed as a serious threat to childhood outcomes. Addressing the global burden of preterm birth is essential for reducing preterm-related neonatal and child mortality and achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 3.2 (which commits to reducing neonatal mortality to 12 or fewer deaths per 1000 livebirths. Therefore, the WHO published new recommendations on the care of preterm infants, such as skin-to-skin contact (SSC), in order to reduce mortality in preterm and low-birth-weight babies.

SSC has been shown to have positive effects on preterm infants in intensive care units. Several studies found that it is associated with a reduction in neonatal mortality rate, improved growth, neurodevelopmental outcomes, and breastfeeding. SSC has been shown to alleviate maternal anxiety, reshape the maternal role, promote active breast pumping, and build maternal confidence in the care of the baby. Therefore, SSC should be considered as a standard of care for preterm infants, as it provides numerous benefits for both infants and mothers.

### Skin-to-skin care for term and preterm infants in the neonatal ICU [^3daa9ddb]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Skin-to-skin care (SSC) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) — risks and safety: Investigators initially postulated that continuous KMC would promote colonization with maternal flora rather than resistant hospital flora, and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials in resource-limited countries have exhibited fewer episodes of sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, and pneumonia. Infections may be spread among mothers, infants, and caregivers, particularly in multiple-bed units, and a recent report described an association between SSC and development of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections among infants in 1 NICU (particularly those with very low birth weights), although the authors did not believe that there was a causal relationship. Parents should be monitored for skin infections and might need cleansing of the skin before infant contact, and some experts consider infants with open lesions (eg, open neural tube defects, abdominal wall defects) to be particularly at risk. Most studies of physiologic stability during SSC have been performed on stable, nonintubated infants; one meta-analysis reported a statistically but not clinically significant increase in body temperature (0.22°C) and a decrease in oxygen saturation (0.60%).

Discussion

Summary of main results

This review summarizes the results of 69 trials (7290 mother‐infant pairs) that met our inclusion criteria. Most studies (43) compared immediate SSC with standard hospital care. Twelve trials were conducted in low‐middle‐income countries, 25 in upper‐middle‐income countries, and 32 in high‐income countries. Ten studies recruited late preterm infants and 15 recruited women who had a cesarean birth. Four trials compared immediate SSC (initiated < 10 minutes postbirth) with early SSC (initiated ≥ 10 minutes postbirth), and two trials compared high‐dose SSC (> 60 minutes) with low‐dose SSC (< 60 minutes). Risk of bias assessments for the included studies can be found in Figure 2, Figure 3, and the Risk of bias in included studies section.

Mothers who have SSC are probably 36% more likely to be exclusively breastfeeding at hospital discharge to one month postbirth (12 trials, 1556 mother‐infant pairs) and 38% more likely to be exclusively breastfeeding at six weeks to six months postbirth (11 trials, 1135 mother‐infant pairs). These findings of improved breastfeeding were similar in lower‐middle‐income countries and upper‐middle‐ to high‐income countries. We consider these results to be clinically significant.

The included studies relating to consumer experience with SSC reflect that SSC is a positive experience for families, and mothers would choose SSC for future births (Carfoot 2004; Mahmood 2011; Nahidi 2011).

We considered the mean infant axillary temperature difference of 0.28 °C favoring the SSC group (11 trials, 1349 infants) was not clinically meaningful, but clinicians can be assured that infants who receive SSC are not at greater risk for hypothermia.

### Comparison of skin-to-skin (kangaroo) and traditional care: parenting outcomes and preterm infant development [^aee63a93]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine whether the kangaroo care (KC) intervention in premature infants affects parent-child interactions and infant development.

Methods

Seventy-three preterm infants who received KC in the neonatal intensive care unit were matched with 73 control infants who received standard incubator care for birth weight, gestational age (GA), medical severity, and demographics. At 37 weeks' GA, mother-infant interaction, maternal depression, and mother perceptions were examined. At 3 months' corrected age, infant temperament, maternal and paternal sensitivity, and the home environment (with the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment [HOME]) were observed. At 6 months' corrected age, cognitive development was measured with the Bayley-II and mother-infant interaction was filmed. Seven clusters of outcomes were examined at 3 time periods: at 37 weeks' GA, mother-infant interaction and maternal perceptions; at 3-month, HOME mothers, HOME fathers, and infant temperament; at 6 months, cognitive development and mother-infant interaction.

Results

After KC, interactions were more positive at 37 weeks' GA: mothers showed more positive affect, touch, and adaptation to infant cues, and infants showed more alertness and less gaze aversion. Mothers reported less depression and perceived infants as less abnormal. At 3 months, mothers and fathers of KC infants were more sensitive and provided a better home environment. At 6 months, KC mothers were more sensitive and infants scored higher on the Bayley Mental Developmental Index (KC: mean: 96.39; controls: mean: 91.81) and the Psychomotor Developmental Index (KC: mean: 85.47; controls: mean: 80.53).

Conclusions

KC had a significant positive impact on the infant's perceptual-cognitive and motor development and on the parenting process. We speculate that KC has both a direct impact on infant development by contributing to neurophysiological organization and an indirect effect by improving parental mood, perceptions, and interactive behavior.

### The experiences of mothers with preterm infants within the first-year post discharge from NICU: social support, attachment and level of depressive symptoms [^e18dbf43]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Mother – preterm infant attachment

Infants born prematurely are a vulnerable population at increased risk of adverse medical, cognitive, developmental and behavioural outcomes. The estimated global premature birth rate for 2014 was 10.6%, equating to an estimate of 14.84 million live premature births. The complexities of premature birth occur at a period in time where mothers and infants are expected to bond and form an attachment. Winnicott described the maternal psychological state of late pregnancy and the early post birth period under the term primary maternal preoccupation. This refers to a period when mothers are preoccupied with their infants. During this time mothers may be observed gazing, stroking, touching, feeding and holding their infants, all of which are critical to forming a secure attachment.

With reference to Bowlby's theory of attachment, preterm infants can be considered a high-risk group for insecure attachment, because of the potential for prolonged separation. Due to increased risk of medical complications, it is often necessary to remove a baby from their mother immediately at birth for observations and interventions. Thus, their first sensory experience of the world can differ significantly from that of a healthy infant born at term, whose physiological and emotional need to be close to their parents can be met through unlimited skin to skin contact for at least an hour following birth. This gently transitions the newborn to the world, with the supporting touch of their parents to comfort, reassure and co-regulate. Infants depend on their caregiver to help them sooth and internalise the belief that emotions can be calmed; this process is referred to as co-regulation. Co-regulation from a caregiver supports the development of secure attachment; a skill that is necessary for coping with emotions across the lifespan. In an attempt to offer care that recognises infants' early social and emotional development, various supports have been introduced to many Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU). These include: kangaroo care; infant massage; family centred care, which can benefit parent-infant bonding and attachment, thus reducing stress for mothers, and promoting improved developmental outcomes for infants. Despite such initiatives, the physical health of infants continues to take precedence over psychosocial domains of health, resulting in preterm infants' outcomes being compromised. These include: increased irritability, difficulties settling into routines, decreased ability to play and poorer developmental outcomes when compared to infants born at term.

### Immediate or early skin-to-skin contact for mothers and their healthy newborn infants [^cc3f5da6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Newborns probably maintain a normal body temperature while in skin‐to‐skin contact, as there was not a clinically meaningful difference between groups, although infant axillary temperatures were slightly higher in the skin‐to‐skin contact group. Cardiorespiratory stabilization may improve in late preterm infants with skin‐to‐skin contact. However, there is a need to educate healthcare professionals and parents about the safe implementation of skin‐to‐skin contact after birth, such as correct positioning of the newborn on the mother's chest and maintaining an open airway.

Clinical outcomes of skin‐to‐skin contact on maternal physiology are included for the first time in this review. More research is needed to clarify the clinical implications. Skin‐to‐skin contact may result in little to no difference in placental separation time/length of the third stage of labor or in postpartum blood loss. The trials reported no adverse effects for mothers, and there may be potential advantages for mothers in relation to decreased episiotomy pain.

Equity‐related implications for practice

The equity assessment of skin‐to‐skin contact and exclusive breastfeeding that we performed for this review showed that skin‐to‐skin contact is equally effective in promoting exclusive breastfeeding in lower‐middle‐income and in upper‐middle‐ to high‐income countries throughout the world. No included studies were conducted in low‐income countries. Although resources are needed for training, the cost of skin‐to‐skin contact is minimal. No technological equipment, access to electricity, or medications are needed. Skin‐to‐skin contact does not change the need for adequate staffing. This implies that the incremental cost is small relative to the net benefits. Stakeholders include infants, parents, hospital staff, the community, the nation, and the world. Skin‐to‐skin contact is feasible to implement in settings worldwide.

### Skin-to-skin care for term and preterm infants in the neonatal ICU [^1c137a21]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Implications for clinical practice — skin-to-skin care (SSC) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) results in improved breastfeeding, milk production, parental satisfaction, and bonding; both parents can be encouraged to provide SSC with appropriate guidelines and protocols for both preterm and term infants in the NICU; and despite apparent physiologic stability during SSC, it is prudent that infants in the NICU have continuous cardiovascular monitoring and that care be taken to monitor correct head positioning for airway patency as well as the stability of the endotracheal tube, arterial and venous access devices, and other life support equipment.

### Seeing beyond the obvious: pragmatic skin care guidance for infants 22–24 weeks gestational age [^ed774f4e]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

During the past decade, infants born as early as 22–24 weeks' gestation have been admitted to neonatal intensive care units in increasing numbers. This has facilitated a need for greater understanding of skin physiology and structure, as well as of influences of the surrounding environment on maturation. This article aims to elaborate the physiology of skin for infants born ≤ 24 weeks' gestation and the effects of common clinical practices to prevent and treat iatrogenic wounds. We summarize the evidence, where available, and describe clinical experience.

### Caregiving can be costly: a qualitative study of barriers and facilitators to conducting kangaroo mother care in a US tertiary hospital neonatal intensive care unit [^28b7307a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Preterm birth is the leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years of age worldwide. In 2016, approximately one out of every 10 infants born in the United States was born premature. Preterm infants, those born before 37 weeks of gestation, have higher risk of morbidity and developmental delays, as well as breathing problems, feeding difficulties, vision problems, and hearing impairment. Further, preterm birth is associated with developmental, cognitive, and behavioral problems in adolescents, and an increased risk of disease in adulthood. Stark disparities in health outcomes of preterm infants persist along racial/ethnic and socioeconomic lines. For example, studies have shown associations between poorer socioeconomic condition and increased risk for preterm birth, as well as increased rates of preterm birth among black women even after accounting for socioeconomic factors.

Kangaroo mother care (KMC), originally proposed as an alternative to conventional incubator care in resource-limited settings, is currently considered one of the most cost-effective interventions to promote the wellbeing of preterm infants. KMC involves three primary components: 1) skin-to-skin contact, 2) frequent and exclusive breast feeding, and 3) early discharge from the hospital. KMC is typically initiated once an infant is stabilized, providing a source of nutrition, stimulation, and support to the infant while it matures. Skin-to-skin contact can stimulate breast milk supply, stabilize the infant's heart rate, and improve the infant's breathing pattern. Further, KMC has been shown to improve thermoregulation and improve the infant's behavioral state among other potential benefits, as well as facilitate a "bonding effect" between mother and child and a "resilience effect" in which women feel more competent as mothers. Research shows that KMC can mitigate the increased risks of morbidity and mortality among preterm infants.

### Increased frequency of skin-to-skin contact is associated with enhanced vagal tone and improved health outcomes in preterm neonates [^0c262fae]. American Journal of Perinatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

An estimation of the individual's ability to cope with environmental adversity, that is, stress resiliency, can be extrapolated by measuring cardiac vagal tone, that is, high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV); indeed, higher HF-HRV is associated with health and developmental advantages for preterm neonates. Previous studies show skin-to-skin contact (SSC) improves stress resiliency; however, linkages between SSC and HF-HRV on outcomes have not been assessed. We aimed to test the hypothesis that increased SSC frequency would enhance HF-HRV, reduce neonatal morbidity, and improve developmental outcomes.

Study Design

Weekly electrocardiograms and clinical data were obtained from 101 preterm neonates. SSC frequency was determined from the electronic medical record.

Results

At postnatal week 1, frequency of SSC and HF-HRV were positively correlated (p = .02); further, multiple stepwise regressions showed higher HF-HRV and SSC predicted reduced days on ventilation and oxygen, and shorter hospital stay (p < 0.001). Higher HF-HRV predicted lower postmenstrual age (PMA) at discharge (p < 0.01).

Conclusion

Higher SSC frequency was associated with increased HF-HRV during the first postnatal week. SSC and HF-HRV uniquely predicted diminished neonatal morbidity throughout hospitalization. Additionally, HF-HRV uniquely predicted earlier PMA at discharge. Augmenting SSC early in life enhances stress resiliency and improves health outcomes.

### Safe sleep and skin-to-skin care in the neonatal period for healthy term newborns [^55dafcd4]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Skin-to-skin care (SSC) — definition, timing, and immediate postpartum practices. SSC is defined as placing infants in direct ventral-to-ventral contact with the mother/caregiver, and "SSC is recommended for all mothers and newborns, regardless of feeding or delivery method, immediately after birth… and to continue for at least 1 hour". Unless a medical reason for separation exists, "SSC may be provided for all newborns", including after cesarean delivery when "the mother is awake and able to respond", with initiation "in the operating room… [or] in the recovery room". In the immediate post-birth period, "routine procedures such as assessments and Apgar scores are conducted while SSC is underway, and procedures that may be painful or require separation should be delayed until after the first hour; if breastfeeding, these procedures should occur after the first breastfeeding is completed". The AAP states that vitamin K and ophthalmic prophylaxis "can be delayed for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours after delivery". This report's scope notes SSC for healthy newborns is distinct from "kangaroo care" (preterm/NICU), and "Late preterm infants (defined as a gestational age of 34–37 weeks) may also benefit from early SSC but are at increased risk of a number of early neonatal morbidities".

### Immediate or early skin-to-skin contact for mothers and their healthy newborn infants [^487cb408]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003 and previously updated in 2007, 2012, and 2016. The purpose of this review is to examine the available evidence on the effects of immediate and early SSC on breastfeeding exclusivity and duration, infant physiology, and maternal outcomes such as pain during episiotomy and laceration repair, blood loss, and the timing of the expulsion of the placenta. Twenty‐six qualifying RCTs on SSC have been published since the 2016 review update. In addition, research has expanded beyond the initial focus on breastfeeding and attachment outcomes to investigate possible neonatal and maternal physiologic effects of SSC. SSC is not resource intensive. This review also asks whether there is a difference in the effect of SSC on breastfeeding exclusivity in high‐ and low‐resource settings.

SSC is increasingly recognized as a clinically significant aspect of care. In the 2018 revision of the WHO/UNICEF Baby‐Friendly Hospital Initiative, Step 4 was updated to reflect the robust ongoing research on SSC. The original (1991) Step 4 was "Help mothers to breastfeed in the first half hour after birth". The 2018 revision changed Step 4 to "Facilitate immediate and uninterrupted skin‐to‐skin contact and support mothers to initiate breastfeeding as soon as possible after birth". In their systematic review and meta‐analysis published in 2017, Smith and colleagues found that starting breastfeeding between two hours and 23 hours postbirth versus within the first hour postbirth was associated with a 33% increase in risk of neonatal mortality. These data demonstrate the importance of initiating immediate SSC to help facilitate the first breastfeeding soon after birth.

A research and practice guideline on SSC published in 2023 used the WHO guideline development process and reached the conclusion that "immediate, continuous, uninterrupted skin‐to‐skin contact should be the standard of care for all mothers and all babies (from 1000 g with experienced staff if assistance is needed), after all modes of birth. Delaying non‐essential routine care in favor of uninterrupted skin‐to‐skin contact after birth has been shown to be safe and allows for the progression of newborns through their instinctive behaviors".

### Inpatient skin-to-skin care predicts 12-month neurodevelopmental outcomes in very preterm infants [^90116fcc]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine the relationship between inpatient skin-to-skin care rates and neurodevelopmental scores measured at 12 months in very preterm (VPT) infants.

Study Design

From a retrospective review of medical records of 181 VPT infants (< 32 weeks gestational age [GA] at birth), we derived skin-to-skin care rate, ie, total minutes of skin-to-skin care each infant received over the number of days of hospital stay. We used scores on the Capute Scales from routine follow-up assessments at 12 months to measure neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Results

Families averaged approximately 17 minutes/day of skin-to-skin care (2 days/week, 70 minutes/session), although there was substantial variability. Variation in skin-to-skin rate was positively associated with outcomes at 12 months corrected age (r = 0.25, P < .001). Skin-to-skin rate significantly predicted 6.2% unique variance in 12-month neurodevelopmental outcomes, after adjusting for GA, socioeconomic status (SES), health acuity, and visitation frequency. A 20-minute increase in skin-to-skin care per day was associated with a 10-point increase (0.67 SDs) in neurodevelopmental outcomes at 12 months. GA and infant health acuity did not moderate these relations.

Conclusion

VPT infants who experienced more skin-to-skin care during hospitalization demonstrated higher scores on 12-month neurodevelopmental assessments. Results provide evidence that skin-to-skin care confers extended benefits to VPT infants through the first year of life. Skin-to-skin care offers promise as a family-centered intervention designed to promote positive developmental outcomes in at-risk infants.

### Sustaining extended kangaroo mother care in stable low birthweight babies in NICU: a quality improvement collaborative of six centres of karnataka [^dc374943]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Problem description

Nearly 15 million preterm neonates are born each year, and more than 1 million of them pass away. As per UNICEF, more than 35% of all neonatal deaths are caused by complications from preterm birth. Many preterm infants who live experience sensory, cognitive and language impairments as a result of their early birth. India is accountable for about 25% of preterm births and 42% of low birthweight (LBW) infants worldwide. Kangaroo mother care (KMC) is a simple, cost-effective and proven intervention for both survival and improved neurobehavioural outcomes of preterms. The important component of KMC involves continuous and prolonged skin-to-skin contact between the caregiver, especially the mother and the baby. Although the effectiveness of KMC has been well documented, there is a huge knowledge-practice gap and poor implementation of the intervention in many units. The common challenges for KMC implementation are low healthcare staff awareness, non-availability of mothers in the initial few days both in postcaesarean delivery and outborn settings, resistance to foster KMC (KMC by a family member), and lack of a structured policy.

Quality improvement (QI) collaboratives help organisations identify and target implementation barriers by training them in QI processes, providing an infrastructure for addressing common barriers (provider concerns, leadership support, logistics, structural challenges), and developing an interorganisational support network from which participating centres can learn from each other's successes and challenges. Most of the challenges for implementation of KMC are similar and possibly the solutions too. Collaborations between organisations is the need of the hour to help scale up KMC to improve preterm quality care.

Setting

A KMC QI collaboration was formed between six centres of Karnataka, India. All these six centres were tertiary care neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) with annual admission load ranging from 250 to 1200. All the centres admitted both inborn and outborn neonates with majority centres catering to the outborn population. The relevant information of the participating centres has been summarised in table 1.

Implementation of principles of care: inpatient — Develop and communicate a written feeding plan of care for the mother–infant dyad at the time of hospital admission that will be easily implemented and modified as needed, and facilitate extended skin-to-skin contact immediately after birth when the mother is alert to improve postpartum stabilization of heart rate, respiratory effort, temperature control, blood glucose, metabolic stability, and early breastfeeding. Determine gestational age by obstetrical estimate and Ballard/modified Dubowitz scoring, and observe the infant closely for 12–24 hours after birth to rule out physiologic instability, with close observation continued during skin-to-skin care, breastfeeding, and rooming-in. Encourage rooming-in 24 hours a day, with frequent extended periods of skin-to-skin contact when the mother is awake, and if the infant is physiologically stable and healthy, allow the infant to remain with the mother while receiving intravenous antibiotics or phototherapy. Allow free access to the breast, encouraging initiation of breastfeeding within 1 hour after birth; if the mother and infant are separated, the mother should begin hand expression of colostrum within the first hour of birth and at > 3 hourly intervals.

### What influences the implementation of kangaroo mother care? An umbrella review [^5c62e55f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

According to reports from the World Health Organization (WHO), with the development of assisted reproductive technology and the improvement of emergency and critical care technology, the incidence of premature birth is rising, and premature birth has become a global problem. Nearly fifteen million preterm infants are born each year, and more than one million of them unfortunately die each year. According to statistics, complications of preterm birth directly account for more than 35% of all neonatal deaths, while the proportion of deaths indirectly caused by preterm birth is even higher because preterm birth increases the risk of infant death from infection. Many surviving preterm infants encounter plenty of problems due to premature birth, such as sensory impairment and cognitive and language impairment. In addition, the birth of preterm infants may cause a substantial emotional crisis and economic cost to the family, as well as have an impact on public sector services such as education and other social support systems. For mothers, preterm birth may also cause a range of perinatal diseases. Therefore, effective evidence-based interventions that can be implemented at scale are urgently needed to reduce the incidence of preterm birth complications and neonatal mortality.

Kangaroo mother care (KMC) is one such evidence-based life-saving intervention for preterm infants. In KMC, the mother (or father) puts her (his) naked preterm infant on her (his) chest in the same way as kangaroo parenting so that the preterm infant is capable of having early, continuous and long-term skin-to-skin contact with his or her mother (father); in addition, measures such as exclusive breastfeeding or breastfeeding, early discharge, and follow-up after discharge are taken for the preterm infants. Compared with the conventional nursing mode, KMC is not only able to maintain the body temperature of preterm infants but also significantly reduces the risk of death in low-birth-weight infants by 36% while significantly reducing the risk of sepsis, hypoglycaemia, and hypothermia. Numerous studies have shown that KMC is a safe, effective, and multifaceted intervention with many short-term and long-term positive effects for preterm infants, such as stabilizing the neonatal physiological state, enhancing immunity, increasing exclusive breastfeeding rates, and promoting mother-infant bonding.

### Community initiated kangaroo mother care and early child development in low birth weight infants in India-a randomized controlled trial [^54c9f1a4]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The present study found no statistically significant effect of ciKMC on cognitive, language, motor, socio-emotional development as assessed by BSID-III and temperament during infancy in this selected sample of stable late preterm or term small for gestational age infants. Long-term follow-up of the infants may provide critical insights on the effect of the intervention on cognitive capabilities. Despite not being able to show a significant effect of ciKMC on child development during infancy, it is still an important public health intervention for LBW infants in terms of improving neonatal and infant survival.

### Skin-to-skin care for term and preterm infants in the neonatal ICU [^e2129e1e]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Skin-to-skin care for term and preterm infants in the neonatal ICU — abstract highlights that intermittent skin-to-skin care (SSC) is being used for infants needing neonatal intensive care, including those requiring ventilator support or who are extremely premature, with reported benefits and safety considerations. SSC significantly improves milk production by the mother and is associated with a longer duration of breastfeeding, and increased parent satisfaction, better sleep organization, a longer duration of quiet sleep, and decreased pain perception during procedures have been reported in association with SSC. Despite apparent physiologic stability during SSC, it is prudent that infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) have continuous cardiovascular monitoring and that care be taken to verify correct head positioning for airway patency and the stability of the endotracheal tube, arterial and venous access devices, and other life support equipment.

### ABM clinical protocol # 23: nonpharmacological management of procedure-related pain in the breastfeeding infant, revised 2016 [^a9e5a61e]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Preterm newborn analgesia — study scope and core options are as follows: Recommendations are based on infants with an average gestational age of 30 weeks or greater and are not necessarily generalizable to < 27 weeks; one study in infants born at < 31 weeks raised concerns with prolonged sucrose exposure. Skin-to-skin contact provides effective pain reduction (IB). In very-low-birth-weight neonates (27–31 weeks gestation) undergoing venipuncture, 24% sucrose or water significantly reduced pain versus no intervention (IB). The recommended sucrose dosage is 0.1–0.4 mL of 24% sucrose solution, and some data support three doses (0.1 mL, 2 minutes apart given 2 minutes and immediately before heel lance and 2 minutes after lance) rather than a single dose (IB). Breastfeeding and human milk analgesia is less well established; a single study showed comparable effects to sucrose in infants aged 32–37 weeks, and if a mother wishes to breastfeed or provide human milk instead of other interventions, this should not be discouraged (IB). Scent of human milk may be considered with procedures and in conjunction with other techniques (IB), and skin-to-skin contact plus sucrose has not been formally evaluated but may provide pain reduction for preterm or low-birth-weight neonates (IV).
