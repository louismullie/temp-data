## Question

What are the most common tumors of the cervical esophagus?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which tumors are most common in the cervical esophagus, focusing on identifying the predominant malignant and benign types. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the anatomic segment and its mucosal histology. Then, I should verify the dominant malignant histology and quantify its prevalence. Next, I will review less common malignant histologies in this location. After that, I should examine which benign tumors preferentially arise in the cervical esophagus versus those that are common overall but not specifically cervical-predominant. Finally, I will integrate epidemiologic context and risk factors to construct a clear hierarchy of "most common" tumors for this site.

> Let me first confirm the anatomic context and mucosal lining, because that will drive histology. The cervical esophagus spans from the cricopharyngeus (upper esophageal sphincter) to the thoracic inlet and is lined by squamous epithelium, which predisposes this segment to squamous histologies; wait, I initially thought of it as the "upper third" of the esophagus, but hold on, that overstates its length and I should correct that to the short proximal segment above the thoracic inlet while keeping the key point that it is squamous-lined and thus biologically distinct from the distal, Barrett-prone esophagus.

> Now, I need to verify which malignant histology dominates in the cervical esophagus and by how much. Population-based data focused on cervical esophageal carcinoma identify squamous cell carcinoma as the overwhelming majority, approximately 92%, which fits the expectation given the squamous mucosa of the proximal esophagus; let me double-check that figure, yes, the SEER analysis of 362 cervical esophageal cancers shows 92% SCC, and broader reviews emphasize proximal squamous mucosal changes predisposing to SCC, reinforcing this distribution [^115LnaBa] [^114CcqpF] [^115LnaBa].

> Next, I should review the secondary malignant histologies and their plausibility in this location. Adenocarcinoma is distinctly uncommon in the cervical esophagus, on the order of the residual 8% in the SEER cohort, which is biologically consistent with the rarity of Barrett's metaplasia proximally; wait, let me verify the mechanistic link, yes, distal intestinal metaplasia predisposes to adenocarcinoma, whereas the proximal squamous mucosa predisposes to SCC, so adenocarcinoma in the cervical segment is possible but uncommon, often related to ectopic gastric mucosa such as an inlet patch rather than classic Barrett's metaplasia; in contrast, neuroendocrine tumors and sarcomas at this site are extremely rare and largely documented as case reports, underscoring their exceptional status rather than being common tumors here [^115LnaBa] [^114CcqpF] [^116hzWk8] [^111kZjRC].

> I will now examine the epidemiologic footprint and risk factors to ensure the malignant ranking aligns with real-world patterns in this location. Cervical esophageal cancers are themselves a minority subset, accounting for roughly 2% to 10% of all esophageal carcinomas, and when they do occur, they are typically SCCs associated with tobacco and alcohol exposure, matching the risk profile of squamous carcinogenesis in the upper aerodigestive tract; hold on, let me confirm those proportions and risks, yes, a systematic review of cervical esophageal cancer reports that range and highlights tobacco and alcohol as major risk factors, in line with global data on ESCC burden and proximal squamous mucosal susceptibility [^114goYAc] [^114WJm5r] [^114CcqpF].

> Next, I should review benign tumors with a predilection for the cervical esophagus, and I need to be careful not to conflate "most common benign in the esophagus overall" with "most common benign in the cervical segment". Fibrovascular polyps, although rare overall, have a marked predilection for the upper third and most commonly arise at the cricopharyngeus level in the cervical esophagus, which makes them the benign entity most characteristically encountered in this specific location; let me verify that anatomic predilection, yes, imaging-pathology descriptions repeatedly note their origin near the cricopharyngeus in the cervical segment [^116SimAB].

> Hold on, I should also confirm the broader benign tumor landscape to avoid overgeneralization. Leiomyomas are the most common benign esophageal tumors overall, but they are not specifically cervical-predominant; they can occur in the upper esophagus, including the cervical segment, and there are reports of successful endoscopic full-thickness resection of large cervical leiomyomas, yet their overall distribution does not show the same cervical predilection as fibrovascular polyps; I need to emphasize that nuance so we do not misstate "most common" by location versus organ-wide [^116xvDcG] [^115HtFyK].

> But wait, what about other rare benign entities like cysts, granular cell tumors, papillomas, and schwannomas; do any of these challenge fibrovascular polyps for cervical predominance? Let me reconsider the relative frequencies and anatomic tendencies: these lesions are described across the esophagus and in small series or case reports at the cervical inlet, but there is no consistent signal that they surpass fibrovascular polyps as the most characteristic benign cervical lesion, so they remain rare and heterogeneous rather than the most common for this segment [^116xvDcG] [^116SimAB] [^114LGyFp].

> Pulling this together, I should construct a clear hierarchy and sanity-check it against the pathophysiology and epidemiology before concluding. For malignant tumors in the cervical esophagus, squamous cell carcinoma is by far the most common, on the order of about 90% or more, followed distantly by adenocarcinoma, with neuroendocrine tumors, sarcomas, and melanoma being exceptional rarities; for benign tumors, fibrovascular polyps are the most characteristic and commonly encountered specifically in the cervical esophagus due to their cricopharyngeal origin, whereas leiomyomas, although the most common benign tumors of the esophagus overall, do not exhibit a specific cervical predominance and are encountered less frequently than fibrovascular polyps at this site; I should double-check the logic chain, and it aligns with the proximal squamous biology, the SEER distribution, and the imaging-pathologic localization of fibrovascular polyps [^114CcqpF] [^115LnaBa] [^116SimAB] [^116xvDcG] [^115LnaBa].

> Finally, let me state the answer succinctly while preserving the caveats. The most common tumors of the cervical esophagus are malignant squamous cell carcinomas, comprising the vast majority of cancers at this site, with adenocarcinoma uncommon and other malignant histologies such as neuroendocrine tumors and sarcomas being exceptionally rare; among benign lesions, fibrovascular polyps have the strongest and most specific predilection for the cervical esophagus, whereas leiomyomas remain the most common benign esophageal tumors overall without a cervical predominance; I should note explicitly that benign tumors are far less common than malignancies in this region, so clinical suspicion for SCC should remain high when evaluating a cervical esophageal mass [^115LnaBa] [^114CcqpF] [^114goYAc] [^116SimAB] [^116xvDcG].

The most common tumor of the cervical esophagus is **squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)** [^116FGCB4], accounting for about 90% of malignancies in this region [^115LnaBa]. Adenocarcinoma is **rare** [^114CcqpF], and benign tumors such as leiomyoma [^116xvDcG], fibrovascular polyp [^116SimAB], and granular cell tumor are uncommon in this region [^114LGyFp]. SCC is strongly linked to tobacco and alcohol use [^114CcqpF], and patients often present with dysphagia, odynophagia, and weight loss [^114goYAc]. Management typically involves **definitive chemoradiation** [^114goYAc], with surgery reserved for salvage in select cases [^116JrUur].

## Malignant tumors

### Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)

- **Prevalence**: SCC is the predominant malignant tumor of the cervical esophagus, comprising approximately 90% of cases [^115LnaBa] [^116JrUur].

- **Risk factors**: Tobacco and alcohol use are major risk factors [^114CcqpF]; HPV may play a role in a subset of cases.

- **Clinical presentation**: Progressive dysphagia [^114CcqpF], odynophagia, weight loss, and cervical lymphadenopathy are common [^114goYAc].

- **Prognosis**: Generally poor, with a 5-year overall survival rate around 15–20% [^114CcqpF] [^116Gmd4u].

---

### Adenocarcinoma

Adenocarcinoma is **rare** in the cervical esophagus [^116FGCB4] and is more commonly found in the distal esophagus [^114CcqpF]. Primary risk factors include GERD and Barrett's esophagus [^113TE3kc]. The clinical presentation is similar to SCC, with dysphagia and weight loss.

---

### Other rare malignant tumors

- **Neuroendocrine tumors**: Extremely rare and aggressive, with poor prognosis [^116hzWk8].

- **Lymphoma**: Rare, typically associated with systemic lymphoproliferative disorders.

- **Sarcomas**: Rare, including leiomyosarcoma and extraosseous Ewing sarcoma [^111kZjRC].

---

## Benign tumors

Benign tumors of the cervical esophagus are **uncommon**, accounting for less than 1% of esophageal tumors [^116xvDcG] [^115HtFyK].

---

### Leiomyoma

Leiomyoma is the **most common benign tumor** of the esophagus, but it is rare in the cervical region [^116xvDcG] [^115HtFyK]. It is often asymptomatic; larger tumors may cause dysphagia or obstruction.

---

### Fibrovascular polyp

Fibrovascular polyp is a **rare benign tumor** that typically arises near the cricopharyngeus muscle [^116SimAB]. It presents with dysphagia, a sensation of a mass, or respiratory symptoms due to airway obstruction [^116SimAB].

---

### Granular cell tumor

Granular cell tumor is a **rare benign tumor** that occasionally occurs in the cervical esophagus [^114LGyFp] [^116xvDcG]. It is usually asymptomatic; larger tumors may cause dysphagia.

---

## Diagnostic methods

Accurate diagnosis and staging of cervical esophageal tumors require a **multidisciplinary approach** that includes:

- **Endoscopy with biopsy**: Essential for histopathological diagnosis [^1162Mu23].

- **Imaging**: CT, MRI, and PET/CT are critical for staging and treatment planning [^117DM9Xo].

- **Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)**: Useful for assessing tumor depth and regional lymph node involvement [^114ayo26].

---

## Treatment strategies

Treatment depends on tumor type, stage, and patient factors. For malignant tumors, **definitive chemoradiation is standard for SCC** [^114goYAc], with surgery reserved for salvage in select cases. For benign tumors, surgical or endoscopic resection is indicated for symptomatic or large tumors [^116xvDcG].

---

Squamous cell carcinoma is the **most common tumor** of the cervical esophagus [^115LnaBa]; adenocarcinoma and benign tumors such as leiomyoma, fibrovascular polyp, and granular cell tumor are less frequent [^116xvDcG].

### Cervical esophageal cancer: a population-based study [^115LnaBa]. Head & Neck (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to present our analysis of outcomes, prognostic factors, and treatment for cervical esophageal carcinoma using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.

- **Methods**: A query of the SEER database from 1998 to 2008 was performed for patients with nonmetastatic adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the cervical esophagus. Disease-specific survival (DSS) rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and predictive factors were analyzed by Cox proportional hazards regression.

- **Results**: We identified 362 patients; 92% of the patients had SCC, 16% received no definitive therapy, 5% received surgery, 71% received radiation therapy (RT), and 8% received both. Chemotherapy data were not available. Median DSS was 49 months for adenocarcinoma and 15 months for SCC. On multivariate analysis, histology (p = .02), RT (p < .001), and surgery plus RT (p < .001) were associated with DSS.

- **Conclusion**: Survival in patients with cervical esophageal carcinoma remains poor. Further studies should define the use of RT, surgery, and chemotherapy.

### Oesophageal cancer [^114CcqpF]. Lancet (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on esophageal cancer:

- **Definition**: Esophageal cancer refers to malignant disease arising from the esophageal epithelium, and principally comprises SCC and adenocarcinoma.

- **Pathophysiology**: Exposure to various carcinogens, genetic susceptibility, and repeated insults to the esophageal mucosa increase the risk of malignant transformation of esophageal epithelial cells, with the subsequent development of esophageal cancer.

- **Epidemiology**: The overall annual incidence of esophageal cancer in the US is 4.7 cases per 100,000 person-years.

- **Disease course**: Predominant changes in the squamous mucosa of the proximal esophagus predispose to esophageal SCC, while intestinal metaplasia of the mucosa of the distal esophagus predisposes to esophageal adenocarcinoma.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The overall 5-year survival rate of patients with esophageal cancer is estimated at 15–20%.

### Cervical esophageal cancer: A gap in cancer knowledge [^114goYAc]. Annals of Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this systematic review is to provide an overview of the diagnosis, treatment options, and treatment-related complications of cervical esophageal carcinoma (CEC) and subsequently to offer recommendations to improve the quality of care.

- **Design**: Studies were identified in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. A total of 107 publications fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included.

- **Results**: CEC is uncommon, accounting for 2%-10% of all esophageal carcinomas. These tumors are often locally advanced at presentation and have a poor prognosis, with a 5-year overall survival rate of 30%. Tobacco and alcohol consumption seem to be the major risk factors for developing CEC. Surgery is usually not possible due to the very close relationship to other organs such as the larynx, trachea, and thyroid gland. Therefore, the standard of care is definitive chemoradiation (dCRT) with curative intent. Treatment regimens used to treat CEC are adapted from established regimens in lower esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. However, dCRT may be accompanied by severe side effects and complications. Several diagnostic and predictive markers have been studied, but currently, there is no biomarker other than clinical stage to guide patient management. Suggestions to improve patient outcomes include determining the exact radiation dose needed for adequate locoregional control and combining radiotherapy with an optimal systemic therapy backbone.

CEC remains uncharted territory for many practicing physicians and patients.

### Isolated cervical esophageal reconstruction for rare esophageal tumors [^114LGyFp]. Head & Neck (2006). Low credibility.

Isolated defects in the cervical esophagus in patients who have not undergone total laryngectomy are uncommon. We report two cases of rare esophageal tumors requiring reconstruction of the cervical esophagus after tumor resection.

- **Methods and results**: The patients were a 51-year-old woman with an esophageal granular cell tumor and a 54-year-old woman with an esophageal schwannoma. Both defects were reconstructed with a radial forearm flap. A small subclinical leak developed in one patient and healed spontaneously within two weeks. At one year and two years of follow-up, both patients were consuming a normal diet and had normal voices.

- **Conclusions**: A thin and well-vascularized flap such as the radial forearm flap is essential for reconstructing an isolated cervical esophageal defect to maximize functional outcome.

### Multiple management modalities in esophageal cancer: Epidemiology, presentation and progression, work-up, and surgical approaches [^114ayo26]. The Oncologist (2004). Low credibility.

Annually, approximately 13,200 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with esophageal cancer, and 12,500 die of this malignancy. Of new cases, 9,900 occur in men and 3,300 occur in women. In part I of this two-part series, we explore the epidemiology, presentation and progression, work-up, and surgical approaches for esophageal cancer.

In the 1960s, squamous cell cancers made up greater than 90% of all esophageal tumors. The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinomas has risen considerably over the past two decades, such that they are now more prevalent than squamous cell cancer in the Western Hemisphere. Despite advances in therapeutic modalities for this disease, half the patients are incurable at presentation, and overall survival after diagnosis is grim.

Evolving knowledge regarding the etiology of esophageal carcinoma may lead to better preventive methods and treatment options for early-stage superficial cancers of the esophagus. The use of endoscopic ultrasound and the developing role of positron emission tomography have led to better diagnostic accuracy in this disease. For years, the standard of care for esophageal cancer has been surgery, and there are several variants of the surgical approach. We will discuss combined modality approaches in part II of this series.

### Head and neck cancer [^114wxvsJ]. Lancet (2021). Low credibility.

Head and neck cancer is the seventh most common type of cancer worldwide and comprises a diverse group of tumors affecting the upper aerodigestive tract. Although many different histologies exist, the most common is squamous cell carcinoma. Predominant risk factors include tobacco use, alcohol abuse, and oncogenic viruses, namely human papillomavirus and Epstein-Barr virus. Head and neck malignancies remain challenging to treat and require a multidisciplinary approach. Surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic therapy are key components in the treatment of locally advanced disease. Although many treatment principles overlap, treatment is generally site-specific and histology-specific. This seminar outlines the understanding of head and neck cancer, focusing on treatment principles, and discusses future directions to improve outcomes for patients with these malignancies.

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the esophagus are extremely rare and aggressive, presenting a poor prognosis. Most esophageal cancers are located in the middle and lower sections, making cervical esophageal NETs even less common. Herein, we present 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT findings in a 37-year-old woman diagnosed with a cervical esophageal NET.

### Neoplastic pathology at the crossroads between neck imaging and cardiothoracic imaging [^116SimAB]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

The cervical and thoracic portions of the esophagus are the most common sources of enteric neoplasm in the thoracic inlet. Symptoms, when present, are often related to narrowing or obstruction of the esophagus, including dysphagia, cough, and chest pain. Some of the more commonly encountered thoracic inlet neoplasms of the enteric system include fibrovascular polyp, leiomyoma, and esophageal cancer.

- **Fibrovascular polyp**: Fibrovascular polyp of the esophagus is a rare and benign mesenchymal tumor. The lesions are composed of fibrous, vascular, and adipose tissue covered by normal squamous epithelium. This lesion can be subdivided histologically by the types of tissue, comprising hamartoma, lipoma, and fibrolipoma. The majority grow in the upper third of the esophagus, most commonly arising at the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle in the cervical esophagus. These intraluminal lesions grow gradually, often becoming large, and can elongate over a period of years, being dragged inferiorly by esophageal peristalsis. Patients may be asymptomatic or present with dysphagia or respiratory symptoms. The imaging study of choice is a fluoroscopic barium esophagram, which typically reveals a smooth, expansile, sausage-shaped mass in the upper to middle third of the esophagus. CT imaging will be dependent on the composition of the polyp, ranging from fat density if it contains a large amount of adipose tissue to heterogeneous attenuation in cases of abundant fibrovascular tissue. It is important to note, however, that CT imaging can be limited if the esoph…

### The Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American Society for Radiation Oncology updated clinical practice guidelines on multimodality therapy for locally advanced cancer of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction [^115UMRAY]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Outcomes for patients with esophageal cancer have improved over the last decade with the implementation of multimodality therapy. There are currently no comprehensive guidelines addressing multidisciplinary management of esophageal cancer that have incorporated the input of surgeons, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists. To address the need for multidisciplinary input in the management of esophageal cancer and to meet best practices for clinical practice guidelines, the guidelines were created as a collaboration between The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS), American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).

Physician representatives chose eight key clinical questions pertinent to the care of patients with locally advanced, resectable thoracic esophageal cancer (excluding cervical location). A comprehensive literature review was performed, identifying 227 articles that met the inclusion criteria covering the use of induction chemotherapy, chemotherapy vs. chemoradiotherapy before surgery, optimal radiation dose, the value of esophagectomy, timing of esophagectomy, the approach and extent of lymphadenectomy, the use of minimally invasive esophagectomy, and the value of adjuvant therapy after resection. The relevant data were reviewed and voted on by the panel, with 80% of the authors, achieving 75% agreement on class and level of evidence. These data were then compiled into the guidelines document.

### Esophageal cancer: Challenges, concerns, and recommendations for management amidst the COVID-19 pandemic [^111iiZSn]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

An acute respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has gripped the world in a pandemic, challenging global culture, economy, and healthcare infrastructure. The outbreak of COVID-19 initially developed in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in early December 2019. Molecular techniques and unbiased DNA sequencing led to the discovery of SARS-CoV-2, indicating a novel betacoronavirus belonging to the Sarbecovirus subgenus of the Coronaviridae family.

According to the most recently reported data by international authorities on June 1, 2020, COVID-19 has been confirmed in more than 6 million cases globally, spreading at a rapid rate, with little indication of slowing despite best efforts to mitigate transmission. This seventh member of the family of coronaviruses has presently resulted in the deaths of more than 370,000 patients worldwide. The prodromal symptoms are non-specific and mainly include fever, dry cough, and malaise, while the advanced clinical syndrome is characterized by severe pneumonia. Its clinicopathologic characteristics mimic the other well-known coronavirus strains, such as SARS-CoV originating from China, and MERS-CoV from Saudi Arabia, both related to fatal illnesses.

Beyond evidence-based supportive care, which is the cornerstone in the management of severe respiratory viral infections, no coronavirus antiviral medications or vaccines of proven efficacy have been established for treatment. COVID-19 continues to raise considerable challenges worldwide, and it has been pronounced a public health emergency.

### Association of multiple Lugol-voiding lesions with synchronous and metachronous esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in patients with head and neck cancer [^114dJr27]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

Patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck have a high prevalence of second primary esophageal squamous cell carcinomas. This study assessed the risk of developing these carcinomas based on the multiplicity of Lugol-voiding lesions observed by chromoendoscopy and patient characteristics.

- **Methods**: Three hundred eighty-nine patients with newly diagnosed squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were divided into four groups: no Lugol-voiding lesions; several (10) small Lugol-voiding lesions; and many irregularly shaped, multiform Lugol-voiding lesions. The relative risk for the development of synchronous second primary esophageal squamous cell carcinomas was investigated using univariate and multivariate analysis. Metachronous second primary esophageal squamous cell carcinomas were also studied among 227 patients followed for more than one year after the initial examination.

- **Results**: Fifty-four (14%) of the 389 patients were found to have synchronous second primary esophageal squamous cell carcinomas. In particular, 55% of the patients with many irregular-shaped multiform Lugol-voiding lesions had synchronous second primary carcinomas. Univariate analysis showed that the presence of many irregular-shaped multiform Lugol-voiding lesions, drinking habit, male gender, and smoking were significant risk factors for the development of synchronous second primary esophageal squamous cell carcinomas.

### Life expectancy in survivors of esophageal cancer compared with the background population [^114265Vu]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

There was a pronounced drop in relative survival in participants with a history of squamous cell carcinoma, decreasing from 94.5% (95% CI 91.2–97.8%) in year 6 to 70.8% (95% CI 64.0–77.6%) in year 10. Participants with a history of adenocarcinoma indicated only a slightly decreased relative survival during follow-up, with a reduction from 96.9% (95% CI 94.8–99.0%) in year 6 to 91.5% (95% CI 86.6–96.3%) in year 10.

- **Tumor histology**: Survival (percentage and 95% confidence intervals) between 6 and 10 years after surgery for esophageal cancer, stratified by tumor histology.

The relative survival of esophageal cancer survivors was worse in patients with higher Charlson comorbidity scores.

- **Comorbidity**: Survival (percentage and 95% confidence intervals) between 6 and 10 years after surgery for esophageal cancer, stratified by Charlson comorbidity index.

The relative survival remained inferior to the corresponding background population after the exclusion of patients with smoking- and alcohol-related diagnoses. There were minor improvements in relative survival among patients with a history of adenocarcinoma and a moderate improvement in those with a history of squamous cell carcinoma.

- **Exclusion of patients with smoking- and alcohol-related diagnoses**: Survival (percentage and 95% confidence intervals) between 6 and 10 years after surgery for esophageal cancer, excluding patients with diagnoses related to heavy smoking, tobacco, and alcohol abuse.

### Inlet patch: Prevalence, histologic type, and association with esophagitis, Barrett esophagus, and antritis [^111ZzUSR]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Inlet patch is a congenital anomaly of the cervical esophagus, consisting of gastric mucosa. Case reports have documented the histologic type and its associated complications.

The objective of this study is to report the prevalence and histologic types of inlet patch, as well as its association with Barrett esophagus and Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis. We reviewed 1821 consecutive pathology reports from endoscopies of the upper gastrointestinal tract conducted between 1995 and 2002. We identified 20 patients with inlet patch. The patients' ages ranged from 16 to 75 years (mean age, 55 years). We examined biopsies from these patients' cervical esophagus, distal esophagus, and antrum, which had been stained with hematoxylin-eosin and the Steiner stain. Biopsies of the cervical esophagus composed of nonoxyntic gastric mucosa were also stained for gastrin-producing cells.

In our patient population, inlet patch occurred in 1.1% of all patients in whom an inlet patch had been searched for endoscopically and a biopsy performed. In the inlet patch, oxyntic mucosa was the most common histologic type (11/20), followed by cardiac mucosa (5/20). Four specimens of the inlet patch contained only foveolar epithelium and were therefore considered too superficial to be classified. Twelve out of twenty biopsies of the inlet patch were inflamed, and one of them was associated with H. pylori. Pancreatic acinar tissue was noted in two patients; no intestinal metaplasia was found. In the distal esophagus, four patients with inlet patch had distal esophagitis, four had Barrett esophagus, and five had oxyntic muco…

### Esophageal cancer located at the neck and upper thorax treated with concurrent chemoradiation: a single-institution experience [^115Tv9DG]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

To characterize the treatment and outcome of patients with cervical and upper thoracic esophageal cancer, the authors retrospectively reviewed the 11-year experience from The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.

- **Methods**: Thirty-five patients with M0 cervical or upper thoracic esophageal cancer and treated with concomitant chemoradiotherapy were analyzed. The median radiation dose was 50.4 Gy (range, 24.5–64.8 Gy) delivered with 1.8 Gy daily fractions over 5.5 weeks. Chemotherapy was 5-fluorouracil-based. Response after treatment was evaluated on the basis of radiography, biopsy, or both. The survival rates were calculated by means of the Kaplan-Meier method.

- **Results**: The median follow-up for the surviving patients was 39 months. The actuarial 5-year overall survival (OS), cause-specific survival, disease-free survival, local relapse-free survival, and distant metastasis-free survival rates were 18.6%, 27.6%, 22.4%, 47.7%, and 57.0%, respectively. Patients who received a radiation dose of greater than or equal to 50 Gy had a higher complete response rate than those who received less than 50 Gy (79.2% versus 27.3%; p = 0.003). On multivariate analysis, radiation dose was the only protective factor associated with the rates of OS (p = 0.006), cause-specific survival (p = 0.003), and local relapse-free survival (p = 0.001); tumor stage was the only factor associated with the rate of disease-free survival (p = 0.007).

- **Conclusion**: Concomitant chemoradiotherapy is an effective treatment modality for patients with cervical and upper thoracic esophageal cancer.

### Insights into cancer awareness and health practices in rural Kenya: A cross-sectional study of esophageal, breast, prostate, cervical, and colorectal cancers [^1137ALdt]. JCO Global Oncology (2025). Low credibility.

In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), there has been an epidemiologic transition from infectious diseases to noncommunicable diseases, including a projected doubling in the incidence of cancer. Understanding the underlying factors driving this surge is crucial for designing effective strategies to mitigate the cancer burden. This study focuses on assessing knowledge, attitudes, screening practices, and health behaviors related to five of the most prevalent cancers in SSA: prostate, breast, cervical, esophageal, and colorectal — among a predominantly rural coastal population in Kenya.

We used a cross-sectional study design targeting 1,500 adult respondents randomly selected from an existing community health and demographic surveillance system. Face-to-face interviewer-administered questionnaires were used to collect data.

One thousand four hundred fifty-two adults participated in the final survey. Breast cancer awareness was highest (69.1%), while awareness of colorectal cancer was lowest (34.6%). Given a list of possible risk factors and symptoms, most respondents (> 50%) could only recognize one to two per cancer type. Perceptions of survival from colorectal cancer were particularly pessimistic, with less than 70% recognizing early detection as a means to improve survival outcomes. In terms of cancer-associated risk factors, more men engaged in tobacco and alcohol use (20.5% and 22.4%, respectively). Additionally, fewer than 10% of eligible participants had ever undergone cancer screening.

### The Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American Society for Radiation Oncology updated clinical practice guidelines on multimodality therapy for locally advanced cancer of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction [^1169kgxA]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Outcomes for patients with esophageal cancer have improved over the last decade with the implementation of multimodality therapy. Currently, no comprehensive guidelines address the multidisciplinary management of esophageal cancer that incorporates the input of surgeons, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists. To address the need for multidisciplinary input in the management of esophageal cancer and to meet best practices for clinical practice guidelines, the guidelines were created as a collaboration between The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS), the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).

Physician representatives chose eight key clinical questions pertinent to the care of patients with locally advanced, resectable thoracic esophageal cancer (excluding cervical location). A comprehensive literature review was performed, identifying 227 articles that met the inclusion criteria. The topics covered were:

- **Use of induction chemotherapy**: Investigating the effectiveness of induction chemotherapy as part of the treatment.
- **Chemotherapy vs. chemoradiotherapy before surgery**: Evaluating the benefits of chemotherapy compared to chemoradiotherapy before surgical intervention.
- **Optimal radiation dose**: Determining the most effective radiation dose for treatment.
- **Value of esophagectomy and timing**: Assessing the necessity and timing of esophagectomy.
- **Approach and extent of lymphadenectomy**: Discussing the best method and extent of lymphadenectomy.
- **Use of minimally invasive esophagectomy**: Exploring the role of minimally invasive techniques in esophagectomy.
- **Value of adjuvant therapy after resection**: Examining the benefits of adjuvant therapy following surgical resection.

The relevant data were reviewed and voted on by the panel, with 80% of the authors achieving 75% agreement on class and level of evidence. These data were then compiled into the guidelines document.

### Profiling early head and neck cancer [^114t6XWe]. Nature Reviews Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide, and, disappointingly, survival rates are not improving. Moreover, HNSCC has a severe impact on the quality of life of patients and survivors. The significant morbidity subsequent to treatment often mandates long-term multidisciplinary care, which places significant financial pressures on the treating institution. Therefore, prevention and early diagnosis of high-risk pre-malignant lesions are high priorities for reducing deaths due to head and neck cancer. Recent advances have begun to elucidate the different aetiologies of HNSCCs in relation to previous pre-malignancies and to identify which pre-malignant lesions are likely to progress to malignancy.

### Outcomes of cervical lymph node recurrence in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after esophagectomy with 2-field lymph node dissection [^11739inA]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical characteristics, prognosis, and risk factors of patients in whom cervical lymph node cancer recurred after esophageal cancer surgery with 2-field lymph node dissection.

Between 2000 and 2010, 471 consecutive patients who had undergone esophagectomy with 2-field lymph node dissection for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were enrolled in this study.

Recurrence was seen in 96 patients.

- **Isolated cervical lymph node recurrence (group A)**: Developed in 21 patients.

- **Locoregional recurrence only and without cervical lymph node recurrence (group B)**: Occurred in 29 patients.

- **Distant recurrence with or without locoregional recurrence (group C)**: Appeared in 46 patients. The median times to recurrence after surgery in groups A, B, and C were 20, 16, and 12 months, respectively (P = 0.634). The 2- and 5-year rates of isolated cervical lymph node recurrence were 4.1% and 5.6%, respectively. The median survival times from diagnosis of recurrence were 13, 7, and 5 months in groups A, B, and C, respectively. The difference in survival between groups A and C was statistically significant (P = 0.030). Upper thoracic esophageal cancer and positive relaryngeal node at the time of initial surgery were independent risk factors for cervical recurrence-free survival as determined by univariate and multivariate analysis.

This study shows that 2-field lymph node dissection can be performed with an acceptable rate of cervical lymph node recurrence. Patients with isolated cervical lymph node recurrence demonstrated longer survival.

### Transhiatal esophagectomy for distal and cardia cancers: Implications of a positive gastric margin [^111s3HY4]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

A common operation for cancer of the esophagus and cardia consists of transhiatal esophagectomy, proximal gastrectomy, and a cervical esophagogastric anastomosis. The oncologic adequacy of dividing the stomach 4 to 6 cm distal to the palpable tumor is not well documented, and when a positive gastric margin is present on the final pathologic analysis, the appropriate management is not established. This study was undertaken to determine the incidence of a positive gastric margin in these patients and the impact of adjuvant treatment.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review was performed of 1,044 patients undergoing transhiatal esophagectomy for adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus or cardia. Twenty (1.9%) had a positive gastric margin on the final pathologic evaluation and met inclusion criteria for this study.

- **Results**: Nine patients (45%) received adjuvant therapy, consisting of radiation in 3, chemotherapy in 4, or both in 2. Their average postoperative survival was 477 days, compared with 455 days in those not receiving adjuvant therapy (p = 0.898). Local tumor recurrence developed in 1 patient (11%) in the treatment group and in 3 (27%) in the no treatment group (p = 0.386).

- **Conclusions**: A transhiatal esophagectomy and proximal gastrectomy for carcinoma of the distal esophagus and cardia, dividing the stomach 4 to 6 cm from the palpable tumor, provides a negative gastric margin in 98% of patients. In the few patients who have a positive gastric margin, 80% die with distant metastases, which would not be influenced by more extensive gastric resection. About 20% experience local recurrence.

### Squamous neoplasia in the esophagus [^1162Mu23]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Squamous lesions of the esophagus encompass a spectrum of disorders ranging from reactive changes and benign papilloma to squamous dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma, which may pose diagnostic challenges, especially in superficial biopsies.

- **Objective**: To provide a review on the typical features of squamous neoplasia in the esophagus, with an emphasis on the key diagnostic features as well as differentiating from mimicking lesions.

- **Data sources**: Data sources include published peer-reviewed literature and personal experiences of the authors.

- **Conclusions**: Accurate diagnosis of squamous neoplasia requires adherence to established diagnostic criteria, attention to subtle histologic features, and correlation with clinical and imaging findings. In difficult cases, multiple biopsies may be necessary to reach a definitive diagnosis.

### Section I: Epidemiological review [^1115MBv3]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has increased tremendously in the United States and other Western countries over the past 30 years, while the incidence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma has remained unchanged; the rate of increase in incidence is higher than for any other cancer. The reasons for this are multifactorial. Despite this, esophageal cancer remains a relatively uncommon malignancy. Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the most important risk factor for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma and is believed to be the precursor lesion for most patients. The risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma from known BE is estimated to be 0.5% per patient year. Persistent high-grade dysplasia in BE is a sensitive indicator for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. However, only a minority of patients with BE are ever diagnosed and, therefore, surveillance endoscopy in Barrett's patients has failed to affect the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma. The relationship of Helicobacter pylori to esophageal adenocarcinoma is complex, but nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may confer protection against the development of this cancer. Fortunately, improved survival is being seen with both squamous cell esophageal carcinoma and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Additional study is required to better determine the risk factors for the development of esophageal cancer, and epidemiologic understanding will prove important in developing methods of detection and therapeutic intervention for this disease.

### Esophageal cancer: Challenges, concerns, and recommendations for management amidst the COVID-19 pandemic [^113FyqAN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Since December 2019, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide, raising great concern, particularly among immunosuppressed cancer patients. The pandemic remains extremely dynamic, necessitating proactive management decisions from oncologists and oncologic surgeons to mitigate the risk of both SARS-CoV-2 infection and cancer metastasis. Esophageal cancer, in particular, is one of the deadliest types of malignancy worldwide, reflecting both aggressive biology and a lack of adequate treatment. Several challenges and concerns regarding the management of esophageal cancer have been raised in light of the ongoing viral pandemic. The primary aim of this review is to summarize salient evidence for recommendations and optimal treatment strategies for patients with esophageal cancer amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Targeted therapies for esophageal cancer [^1134SCM9]. The Oncologist (2005). Low credibility.

Esophageal cancer is a highly aggressive neoplasm. In 2005, 14,520 Americans will be diagnosed with esophageal cancer, and more than 90% will die of their disease. On a global basis, cancer of the esophagus is the sixth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In fact, gastric and esophageal cancers together accounted for nearly 1.3 million new cases and 980,000 deaths worldwide in 2000 — more than lung, breast, or colorectal cancer.

Although esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cases have steadily declined, the incidence of gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma has increased 4%-10% per year among U.S. men since 1976, more rapidly than for any other cancer type, and parallels rises in population trends in obesity and reflux disease. With advances in surgical techniques and treatment, the prognosis of esophageal cancer has slowly improved over the past three decades. However, the 5-year overall survival rate (14%) remains poor, even in comparison with the dismal survival rates (4%) from the 1970s.

The underlying reasons for this disappointingly low survival rate are multifold:

- **Ineffective screening tools and guidelines**: Cancer detection often occurs at an advanced stage, with over 50% of patients presenting with unresectable disease or distant metastasis.

- **High risk for recurrence after esophagectomy or definitive chemoradiotherapy**: Unreliable noninvasive tools to measure complete response to chemoradiotherapy exist.

- **Limited survival achieved with palliative chemotherapy alone**: This is particularly true for patients with metastatic or unresectable disease.

Clearly, additional strategies are needed to address these challenges.

### Large cell neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma: A report of two cases and review of the literature [^114P1VpK]. Gynecologic Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

Large cell neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma is a rare malignancy. These tumors mimic the aggressive behavior of small cell neuroendocrine tumors. Metastasis and recurrence of the disease are common. Due to the low incidence of these tumors, optimal therapy has not been delineated.

- **Cases**: Two patients presented with large cell neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma, stage IB1 and IIA, at our institution from 1997 to 1999. We describe the clinical course for these two patients and review the relevant literature for the management of large cell cervical carcinoma.

- **Conclusion**: Unlike squamous cell carcinoma, early-stage large cell neuroendocrine tumors of the cervix are aggressive. Disease recurrences are frequent and distant metastasis is common. Multimodal therapy should be considered at the time of initial diagnosis.

### Second primary head and neck tumor risk in patients with cervical cancer — SEER data analysis [^115vh6a5]. Head & Neck (2008). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes over 99% of cervical carcinomas and is associated with approximately 25% of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). The role of HPV infection in HNSCC development following a first diagnosis of cervical cancer is unknown.

- **Methods**: Using the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data, the authors compared the risk of second primary cancer (SPC) HNSCC in patients with cervical cancer with the general population and females with other primary cancers.

- **Results**: The lifetime risk of SPC HNSCC for patients with cervical cancer was higher than in the general population (standardized incidence ratio [SIR]: 1.7). When compared with that in females with other cancers, the risk of anogenital and oropharyngeal SPC was in excess, but not of SPC in the oral cavity.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with cervical cancer develop an excess SPC HNSCC in comparison with females with other cancers. A possible role of HPV is suggested.

### Early detection of esophageal second primary tumors using Lugol chromoendoscopy in patients with head and neck cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111ntMEJ]. Head & Neck (2019). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: We searched the Embase, Medline (including PubMed), Web of Science, Cochrane, and Google Scholar databases for relevant studies. The search was performed in April 2017 without a limit on publication date. The following keywords were used for the search: "second/multiple primary tumor", "esophageal cancer", and "head and neck cancer". We limited our search to studies written in English and involving humans. Duplicate studies were removed. The remaining citations were reviewed (by OB) based on title and abstract, and in a second stage on full text. We included studies that investigated the use of Lugol chromoendoscopy to detect esophageal second primary tumors (SPTs) in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We excluded studies primarily designed as case reports or reviews.

The next paragraph presents our full electronic search strategy for the Embase database (see e‐content 1 in the Supplement for full search strategy):

### Evolving treatment landscape for advanced esophageal and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma [^113PUADw]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Esophageal cancer (EC) represents a significant source of morbidity and mortality worldwide, accounting for approximately 604,100 new cases and 544,100 deaths in 2020. Globally, it ranks seventh in incidence and sixth in mortality compared to other types of cancer. The age-standardized incidence rates are 2.5-fold higher in men than women, although that varies considerably by population. Over the past four decades, there has been a considerable shift in the regional incidence of the different subtypes of esophageal cancer. Previously, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) comprised the vast majority of EC, but esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) now predominates in several high-income countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and France. SCC rates are highest in Eastern Asia, Southern Africa, Eastern Africa, and parts of Northern Europe. In contrast, EAC accounts for 64% of EC in the United States, compared to 31% SCC and 5% other types.

In the US, the incidence of EAC increased from 3.6 cases per million to 25.6 cases per million between 1973–2006, although incidence rates appear to have stabilized or decreased between 1997–2014 with some variation between sexes, ethnic groups, and age groups. The incidence of gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (GEJAC) increased 2.5-fold between the 1970s–1990s and later stabilized, although the exact incidence is difficult to ascertain due to inconsistencies in classification systems in defining EAC versus GEJAC. These shifting epidemiologic trends likely reflect the rise and fall of certain risk factors in different populations, regardless of subtype.

### Treatment vs prevention of head and neck cancer: Are we doing our best for patients [^114tqHjM]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Along with the relief of suffering, caring for the ill, and avoiding premature death, one of the goals of medicine is disease prevention. The majority of head and neck cancer is preventable. Every head and neck surgeon should ask whether or not our resources and efforts are being used in a manner that will provide maximum benefit to patients. In this commentary, we assess what the outcome might be if all head and neck surgeons focused solely on prevention.

### Does esophagogastric anastomotic technique influence the outcome of patients with esophageal cancer [^111qnLDi]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

We sought to compare the outcome of patients with esophageal cancer who had either modified Collard or standard hand-sewn cervical esophagogastric anastomoses in reconstruction during esophagectomy. From March of 1996 to October of 2002, 274 patients with esophageal cancer underwent esophagectomy with gastric replacement and cervical esophagogastric anastomosis. Beginning in March of 2001, a modified Collard technique (stapled) was used in most patients (n = 86) for cervical esophagogastric anastomosis; a standard hand-sewn technique (sewn) was used in all others (n = 188). Using a propensity score based on 8 variables (age, gender, race, surgeon, surgical approach, pathologic stage, histologic cell type, and induction chemoradiotherapy), 85 patient pairs were matched and followed for time-related events. Outcome comparisons included cervical wound infection, cervical anastomotic leak, other hospital complications, length of stay, anastomotic dilatation, reflux symptoms, and survival.

At 30 days, freedom from cervical wound infection was 92% for stapled versus 71% for sewn anastomoses (P = 0.001), and freedom from cervical anastomotic leak was 96% versus 89% (P = 0.09), respectively. Other hospital complications occurred in 58% and 49%, respectively (P = 0.17). The median length of stay was 10 days for both (P = 0.3). At 2 years, freedom from anastomotic dilatation was 34% for stapled versus 10% for sewn anastomoses (P < .0001), and the mean number of dilatations per patient was 2.4 versus 4.1 (P = 0.0001), respectively. Reflux was rare for both.

### What is behind the remarkable increase in esophageal adenocarcinoma [^112PDtih]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Esophageal adenocarcinoma has undergone a marked increase in incidence in Western cultures. The cause of this rise is unclear, and multiple putative causal factors have been implicated in the literature. Although data regarding some of these factors are suggestive, none appear to completely explain the observed trends. Given the complexity of cancer biology, the variety of causative and protective factors involved, and the difficulty in accurately measuring exposures and outcomes, isolating one or a few causative factors is challenging. Understanding the driving forces behind these trends may require a better understanding of the interaction between risk factors and the multiple ways in which a single risk factor may affect the pathogenesis of the tumor.

### The Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American Society for Radiation Oncology updated clinical practice guidelines on multimodality therapy for locally advanced cancer of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction [^1169oxyo]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for esophageal cancer, specifically the management of locally advanced disease, surgery, ASTRO/STS 2024 guidelines recommend considering either a transhiatal or transthoracic approach for esophagectomy after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Consider performing minimally invasive esophagectomy for reduced perioperative pulmonary complications and improved short-term quality of life (QoL).

### Successful en bloc endoscopic full-thickness resection of a giant cervical esophageal leiomyoma originating from muscularis propria [^115HtFyK]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Esophageal leiomyomas, the most common benign primary tumors of the esophagus, are traditionally treated by surgery. In recent years, endoscopic submucosal dissection and related endoscopic treatment techniques have been adopted by endoscopists to resect gastrointestinal submucosal tumors. However, if a giant esophageal leiomyoma approaches the esophagus entrance and originates from the deep layer of the muscularis propria, both endoscopic resection and surgical treatment become challenging. Endoscopic resection, in particular, carries a high risk of causing a significant perforation that is difficult to suture.

- **Case presentation**: A 72-year-old man with dysphagia underwent a gastroscopy examination, which indicated a large submucous eminence lesion located approximately 18–24 cm from the incisors. Endoscopic ultrasonography revealed that the lesion was hypoechoic and originated from the muscularis propria with a clear boundary. The patient refused invasive surgical resection. Consequently, an en bloc endoscopic full-thickness resection was performed. The perforation was successfully closed with purse-string sutures using a novel endoloop device through standard single-channel endoscopy, and histopathologic examination confirmed an esophageal leiomyoma.

- **Conclusion**: This endoscopic procedure may serve as an alternative to surgery for the removal of a giant upper esophagus tumor originating from the muscularis propria layer.

Treatment is complex for patients with head and neck (H&N) cancers, with the specific site of disease, stage, and pathologic findings guiding treatment decision-making. Treatment planning for H&N cancers involves a multidisciplinary team of experts. This article describes supportive care recommendations in the NCCN Guidelines for Head and Neck Cancers, as well as the rationale supporting a new section on imaging recommendations for patients with H&N cancers. The article also describes updates to treatment recommendations for patients with very advanced H&N cancers and salivary gland tumors, specifically systemic therapy recommendations.

### Should multidisciplinary treatment differ for esophageal adenocarcinoma versus esophageal squamous cell cancer [^1137QZsr]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2019). Low credibility.

The treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancers (ECs) centers on a multimodal approach regardless of histology. While surgery remains the mainstay of curative intent therapy, its implementation alone results in suboptimal outcomes, which have improved significantly with the increased utilization of induction regimens comprising chemoradiation (CRT) or chemotherapy alone followed by surgery. Due in large part to the positive results of the CROSS trial, neoadjuvant CRT has become the predominant standard applied in the West. However, the bulk of the data published at the time of writing suggests that a more nuanced approach to the management of locally advanced EC is required concerning the application of radiation, which relates to the differential sensitivity of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) to radiation.

- **Radiosensitivity and outcomes**: While the latter, SCC, demonstrates excellent radiosensitivity, which has translated into improved survival outcomes, the same cannot be said for patients with EAC who may be subject to greater toxicity without any benefit. Herein, the differential effectiveness of CRT in patients with EAC versus SCC is highlighted, with a focus on the randomized evidence at the time of writing.

### The relation between gastroesophageal reflux disease and esophageal and head and neck cancers: a critical appraisal of epidemiologic literature [^113TE3kc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The prevalence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has increased substantially in the United States. Studies demonstrate that certain preexisting conditions place individuals at an increased risk for developing adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and of the head and neck. Such conditions include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and Barrett's esophagus (BE). The degree to which these conditions increase the risk is variable. This article critically evaluates data on the relationships between GERD and esophageal adenocarcinoma, between BE and esophageal adenocarcinoma, and between GERD and cancers of the head and neck.

### Head and neck cancer of unknown primary: Unveiling primary tumor sites through machine learning on DNA methylation profiles [^117MyTTc]. Clinical Epigenetics (2024). Low credibility.

On the other hand, the classifier predicted only one hnCUP sample to be originating from the esophagus. Based on our analysis of the occurrence of cervical lymph node metastasis, we would have statistically expected to locate six primaries in the esophagus. Possibly, even small esophageal carcinomas are more easily diagnosed in the smoothly surfaced mucosa with modern techniques compared to, e.g. the poorly visible crypts in the tonsils or tongue base. Lymph node metastasis in ESCC is associated with advanced-stage tumors, which could also contribute to this observation.

To calculate the expected proportion of origins for head and neck SCC lymph node metastasis, the worldwide incidence rates and rates of cervical metastasis were used, since no data on the proportion are available. However, it must be noted that metastasis with loss of the primary tumor site, as is presumed to be the case in a proportion of hnCUP cases, may be subject to different epidemiology. In addition, the calculated incidence rates are only a rough estimate. They would be more accurately described based on the anatomic localization of the metastasis, since lymph nodes from ESCC are more commonly found in neck level 4. In contrast, oropharyngeal carcinoma metastasizes in early stages, primarily in neck levels 2 and 3.

### Section II: Pathology and pathologic staging of esophageal cancer [^115hxtB2]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Most benign and malignant neoplasms of the esophagus are epithelial in origin. Esophageal carcinomas typically exhibit either glandular or squamous differentiation and develop through the progression of premalignant conditions: Barrett's esophagus for adenocarcinoma and squamous dysplasia for squamous cell carcinoma. These carcinomas are aggressive neoplasms that invade the esophageal wall, metastasizing to regional lymph nodes and distant organs. Early detection and treatment of these tumors are crucial for improving patient survival.

### A cause-specific Cox model for second primary tumors in patients with head and neck cancer: A RONCDOC study [^114qwcGg]. Head & neck (2021). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for the development of second primary tumors (SPTs) in the head and neck region, lungs, and esophagus in patients with head and neck cancer. Data was collected from 1581 patients. A cause‐specific Cox model for the development of an SPT was fitted, accounting for the competing risks of residual or recurrent tumor and mortality.

Of all patients, 246 (15.6%) developed SPTs. Analysis showed that tobacco and alcohol use, comorbidity, and the oral cavity subsite were risk factors for SPTs. The C‐index, which measures the discriminative accuracy of the model for SPT, was 0.65 (95% confidence interval, 0.61–0.68).

The results demonstrate potential in identifying patients at increased risk of developing an SPT, which could improve their survival chances and quality of life. Further research is necessary to provide head and neck clinicians with definitive recommendations.

### Esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancers, version 2.2023, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116FGCB4]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Cancers originating in the esophagus or esophagogastric junction constitute a major global health problem. Esophageal cancers are histologically classified as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or adenocarcinoma, which differ in their etiology, pathology, tumor location, therapeutics, and prognosis. In contrast to esophageal adenocarcinoma, which usually affects the lower esophagus, esophageal SCC is more likely to localize at or higher than the tracheal bifurcation. Systemic therapy can provide palliation, improved survival, and enhanced quality of life in patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease.

The implementation of biomarker testing, especially analysis of HER2 status, microsatellite instability status, and the expression of programmed death-ligand 1, has had a significant impact on clinical practice and patient care. Targeted therapies, including trastuzumab, nivolumab, ipilimumab, and pembrolizumab, have produced encouraging results in clinical trials for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease. Palliative management, which may include systemic therapy, chemoradiation, and/or best supportive care, is recommended for all patients with unresectable or metastatic cancer.

Multidisciplinary team management is essential for all patients with locally advanced esophageal or esophagogastric junction cancers. This selection from the NCCN Guidelines for Esophageal and Esophagogastric Junction Cancers focuses on the management of unresectable or metastatic disease.

### Not all esophageal tumors equal [^116y7Mjf]. Cancer Discovery (2017). Low credibility.

Although squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the esophagus differ histologically, they are often lumped together in clinical trials. Genomic analysis shows that the two cancers are molecularly distinct. Esophageal adenocarcinomas are more similar to stomach adenocarcinomas, whereas esophageal squamous cell carcinomas are closer to head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.

### Comparisons between minimally invasive and open esophagectomy for esophageal cancer with cervical anastomosis: a retrospective study [^116H16NZ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Esophageal carcinoma is a type of digestive system tumor characterized by high malignancy and poor prognosis. It has been reported that the overall survival rate of esophageal cancer over five years is only 15–20%, making it the sixth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (AC) are the most common pathological types of esophageal cancer, with squamous cell carcinoma being the principal type.

The distribution of esophageal cancer varies significantly by region. The incidence of SCC predominantly occurs in Asia, especially in China, which accounts for more than half of global SCC cases. Conversely, the highest burden of adenocarcinoma is found in Western countries where its incidence has markedly increased over recent decades, particularly among esophagectomy patients.

Treatment strategies for esophageal cancer have developed in two main directions: local-regional therapy and systemic treatment. Additionally, an optimized individual therapeutic protocol should be tailored for patients based on the type of tumor, its location, local infiltration, and individual physiological conditions. Nonetheless, esophagectomy with radical lymph node dissection is recognized as one of the standard treatments for patients with localized and locally advanced disease. However, due to the complexity of surgical procedures, the significant trauma involved, severe postoperative complications (especially pulmonary infections), and poor quality of life after the operation, surgical treatment poses considerable challenges.

### Modern approaches to localized cancer of the esophagus [^114UATA5]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical spectrum of esophageal cancer has changed dramatically over the past couple of decades. Most notably, a profound rise in esophageal adenocarcinoma and a decrease in the incidence of squamous carcinomas have occurred. An understanding of the factors that influence survival for patients with localized esophageal cancer has evolved concomitantly with these changes in epidemiology. Significant advancements in endoscopic and radiographic staging allow for more selective use of treatment modalities.

The treatment of localized esophageal cancer mandates a multidisciplinary approach, with treatment tailored to disease extent, location, histology, and an accurate assessment of pretreatment staging. Despite these improvements in staging and the use of multimodality therapy, only modest improvements in patient survival have been observed. This article summarizes these modern approaches to localized cancer of the esophagus.

### Second primary tumors in patients with head and neck cancer [^112ZFP2K]. Current Oncology Reports (2011). Low credibility.

This review discusses second primary tumors in patients with head and neck cancer and highlights their high risk of developing additional cancers either simultaneously or subsequently. The incidence of multiple primary tumors in this population can reach as high as 27%. Recurrences are the most common cause of treatment failure within the first two years of follow-up. However, after the third year, the diagnosis of a second primary tumor becomes the most significant cause of morbimortality in head and neck cancer patients, particularly among those treated for early-diagnosed cancers.

Most second primary tumors occur in the upper aerodigestive tract (40%-59%), lungs (31%-37.5%), and esophagus (9%-44%). Patients who develop a second primary tumor experience a significant reduction in survival expectancy.

### The global, regional, and national burden of oesophageal cancer and its attributable risk factors in 195 countries and territories, 1990–2017: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 [^114WJm5r]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

Oesophageal cancer is a common and often fatal cancer that has two main histological subtypes: oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Updated statistics on the incidence and mortality of oesophageal cancer, and on the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) caused by the disease, can assist policymakers in allocating resources for prevention, treatment, and care of oesophageal cancer. We report the latest estimates of these statistics for 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2017 by age, sex, and Socio-demographic Index (SDI), using data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD).

- **Methods**: We used data from vital registration systems, vital registration samples, verbal autopsy records, and cancer registries, combined with relevant modeling, to estimate the mortality, incidence, and burden of oesophageal cancer from 1990 to 2017. Mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs) were estimated and fed into a Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), including risk factors. MIRs were used for mortality and non-fatal modeling. Estimates of DALYs attributable to the main risk factors of oesophageal cancer available in GBD were also calculated. The proportion of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma to all oesophageal cancers was extracted using publicly available data, and its variation was examined against SDI, the Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index, and available risk factors in GBD that are specific for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (e.g. unimproved water source and indoor air pollution).

### Ten-year survival and recurrence patterns after three-field lymph node dissection for squamous cell and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus [^117XGwX3]. Annals of Surgery (2023). High credibility.

The aim was to determine the prevalence of metastases to the cervical and cervicothoracic (CT) nodes, as well as survival and recurrence patterns after esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection (TFD) in patients with predominately adenocarcinoma (AC) of the esophagus.

Although esophagectomy with TFD is commonly practiced in Japan and Southeast Asia for squamous cell cancer (SCC) of the esophagus, there are only a handful of reports about its utilization and survival benefit in North American patients.

This study is a retrospective case series of patients who had an esophagectomy with TFD. The primary outcomes of interest were the prevalence of nodal metastases to the CT nodes, overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival. Secondary outcomes included time to recurrence, recurrence patterns, operative morbidity, as well as 30 and 90-day mortality.

Two hundred forty-two patients with esophageal cancer (AC: 67%) underwent esophagectomy with TFD. Metastases to the CT nodes were present in 56 patients (23%; AC: 20% and SCC: 30%). Positive CT nodes were present in 14% of pT1/T2 tumors and 30% of pT3 tumors. For the 56 patients with CT positive nodes, 5-year OS was 25% (AC: 16%; SCC: 39%). Fifteen of 56 (26.7%) patients with metastases to the CT nodes were alive and disease-free at a minimum of 5 years postoperatively. Ten-year OS was 43% for all patients with SCC and 28% for patients with AC.

Metastases to the CT nodes are common in both SCC and AC of the esophagus.

### Cervical esophageal cancers: Challenges and opportunities [^116JrUur]. Current Oncology Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Cervical esophageal cancers (CECs) are a rare subset of esophageal cancers that are distinct in their management and outcomes. This review explores data on the optimal management of this disease.

While outcomes for CEC have been suboptimal, several strategies have proven beneficial in recent years. These include selective surgical resection or salvage surgery, chemoradiation (CRT) versus radiation (RT) alone, dose escalation, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and induction chemotherapy. The optimal management of CEC to achieve the best oncological outcomes and minimize morbidity appears to be definitive chemoradiation, with surgery reserved for selective salvage. Although the benefit of dose escalation versus standard dosing for radiation is unclear, most approaches utilize doses in excess of 50.4 Gy, even in the United States. IMRT might provide a benefit independent of allowing for dose escalation. Additionally, induction chemotherapy might allow for "chemoselection", though the benefit remains unclear.

### Extraosseous Ewing sarcoma of the cervical esophagus: Case report and literature review [^111kZjRC]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2022). Low credibility.

This study presents a case of extraosseous Ewing sarcoma arising in the cervical esophagus of a 36-year-old woman who presented with a cervical mass and dysphagia. Imaging studies demonstrated a well-defined, cystic-solid mass in the neck extending into the upper mediastinum, resulting in deviation of the trachea and esophagus. The relationship between the tumor and the cervical esophagus was confirmed during the operation. The patient underwent localized tumor resection without radical esophagectomy. Accurate diagnosis was obtained through immunohistochemistry and molecular genetic assays. Although this is a rare site for this type of tumor to occur, extraosseous Ewing sarcoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of small round cell tumors of the cervical esophagus. Postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy are of great value in improving the prognosis of cervical esophageal Ewing sarcoma.

### The risk of second primary tumors in head and neck cancer: A systematic review [^115acPQ1]. Head & Neck (2020). Low credibility.

Second primary tumors (SPTs) are a common cause of reduced life expectancy in patients treated for head and neck cancer (HNC). This phenomenon is an area to be addressed during post-treatment follow-up.

- **Methods**: We conducted a systematic review of literature following PRISMA guidelines, from 1979 to 2019, to investigate the incidence of SPTs — both synchronous and metachronous — in the HNC population.

- **Results**: Our review includes data of 456,130 patients from 61 articles. With a minimum follow-up of 22 months, the mean incidence of SPTs was 13.2% (95% CI: 11.56–14.84): 5.3% (95% CI: 4.24–6.36) for synchronous SPTs and 9.4% (95% CI: 7.9–10.9) for metachronous SPTs. The most frequent site for SPTs was the head and neck area, followed by the lungs and esophagus.

- **Conclusion**: Although there are wide variations between studies, the rate of SPTs in HNC patients is high. Given the impact on prognosis, we must develop strategies for the early diagnosis of SPTs.

### Application of modified neck drainage in the management of cervical anastomotic fistula in esophageal cancer patients [^114Le6mB]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Common surgical procedures for esophageal cancer include the Ivor-Lewis operation, which involves an abdominal and right chest incision for esophageal cancer resection; the McKeown operation, which involves three incisions in the right chest, abdomen, and neck for esophageal cancer resection; and left chest esophageal cancer resection. With the development of minimally invasive techniques, thoracoscopic surgery is increasingly used in thoracic surgery, and the McKeown operation has gradually become the mainstream surgical procedure for esophageal cancer. This approach is advantageous for lymph node dissection in the three fields and can improve patients' survival rates.

Anastomotic fistula is one of the serious complications after esophageal cancer surgery. The rapid recovery of esophageal cancer patients after surgery largely depends on whether anastomotic fistula complications occur. Although surgical techniques have made significant progress, anastomotic fistula remains a challenging issue that surgeons need to address. The tension at the anastomosis site is closely related to anastomotic leakage. The length of the remaining esophagus and whether the tumor is located in the cervical esophagus on the oral side are two important considerations for predicting the tension of esophagogastric anastomosis. If the remaining esophagus is short, the anastomosis may be subjected to greater tension during esophagogastric anastomosis. This tension can not only affect the healing of the anastomosis but also increase the risk of complications such as postoperative anastomotic leakage.

### Human papillomavirus typing of rare cervical carcinomas [^116Cjjf4]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Most cervical tumors are classified as squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma, both of which are associated with persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Although other, rarer types represent less than 5% of all cervical carcinomas, it is necessary that these more unusual tumors be studied in the era of papillomavirus vaccine development, especially in regions with a high incidence of cervical cancer.

- **Objective**: To compare papillomavirus types found in histologically rare cervical carcinomas (n = 29) with those types found in common cervical carcinomas (n = 14) archived at the Institute of Cancer in Mexico City, Mexico.

- **Design**: Paraffin-embedded tissues were received and sectioned at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center at Shreveport. One section for each block was stained and examined by two pathologists. Specific histologies were categorized into two broad groups: common (squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma) or rare (adenosquamous, papillary, villoglandular, anaplastic, transitional, spindle, adenoid basal, colloid, neuroendocrine, and glassy cell carcinomas). Papillomavirus typing results were based on Roche Molecular Systems line-blot assay.

- **Results**: No significant difference was found for dual HPV types (21% of both groups), positivity for HPV-16 (66% of rare tumors and 71% of common tumors), or absence of HPV types 16 or 18; although the rare cancers had a greater tendency toward more unusual HPV types (8/29 rare tumors and 1/14 common tumors had no HPV-16 or HPV-18 DNA). Non-HPV-16/18 types were found only in rare tumors.

### American Cancer Society head and neck cancer survivorship care guideline [^112cgN9i]. CA (2016). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for oropharyngeal cancer, particularly concerning survivorship and rehabilitation from neuromuscular complications, the ACS 2016 guidelines recommend assessing patients for cervical dystonia following neck dissection or radiotherapy. Refer patients with cervical dystonia or neuropathy to a rehabilitation specialist for comprehensive neuromusculoskeletal management. Offer nerve-stabilizing agents such as pregabalin, gabapentin, and duloxetine, or administer botulinum toxin type A injections into the affected muscles for pain management and spasm control.

### Society for immunotherapy of cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immunotherapy for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancer [^113kFu53]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for esophageal cancer, more specifically with respect to ancillary testing, PD-L1 testing, SITC 2023 guidelines recommend using the CPS to quantify PD-L1 expression in patients with gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. Use the CPS or the TPS to determine eligibility for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in patients with esophageal SCC.

### Platinum-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy for tumors of the head and neck and the esophagus [^1168CuuK]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

The addition of chemotherapy (CT) to standard radiotherapy (RT) for locoregional treatment has been established to improve overall survival in a variety of solid tumors. Among the many CT regimens evaluated in combination with RT in randomized controlled clinical trials and summarized in meta-analyses, platinum-containing regimens have consistently shown a survival benefit across tumor types. Cisplatin and carboplatin have been studied both as single agents and in combination with other cytotoxic drugs, concurrently with RT, but the optimal platinum-based regimen to be combined with RT continues to be explored with further investigation.

In this article, the role of platinum-based CT as part of combined chemotherapy/radiotherapy (conCT/RT) is discussed using two tumor sites in the aerodigestive tract as a paradigm: squamous-cell carcinomas of the head and neck and esophageal carcinomas. For each tumor type, we will review the state of the evidence, comment on the state of practice, and consider future directions for clinical research in combined modality CT/RT.

### Patterns and trends in esophageal cancer mortality and incidence in Europe (1980–2011) and predictions to 2015 [^113jcjbW]. Annals of Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Over the last few decades, esophageal cancer incidence and mortality trends have varied substantially across Europe, with important differences between sexes and the two main histological subtypes: squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and adenocarcinoma (EAC).

- **Patients and methods**: To monitor recent esophageal cancer mortality trends and to compute short-term predictions in the European Union (EU) and selected European countries, we analyzed data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) for 1980–2011. We also analyzed incidence trends and relative weights of ESCC and EAC across Europe using data from Cancer Incidence in Five Continents.

- **Results**: Long-term decreasing trends were observed for male esophageal cancer mortality in several southern and western European countries, whereas in central Europe mortality increased until the mid-1990s and began to stabilize or decline over recent years. In some eastern and northern countries, the rates were still increasing. Mortality among European women remained comparatively low and showed stable or decreasing trends in most countries. Between 2000–2004 and 2005–2009, esophageal cancer mortality declined by 7% (from 5.34 to 4.99 per 100,000) in EU men, and by 3% (from 1.12 to 1.09 per 100,000) in EU women. Predictions to 2015 show persistent declines in mortality rates for men in the EU overall and stable rates for EU women, with rates for 2015 of 4.5 per 100,000 men (about 22,300 deaths) and 1.1 per 100,000 women (about 7,400 deaths). In northern Europe, EAC is now the predominant histological type among men, while for European women, rates remain low.

### Esophageal cancer: Challenges, concerns, and recommendations for management amidst the COVID-19 pandemic [^1166imhn]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Since December 2019, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide, raising great concern, particularly in immunosuppressed cancer patients. The pandemic situation remains extremely dynamic, necessitating proactive management decisions from oncologists and oncologic surgeons to mitigate the risk of both SARS-CoV-2 infection and cancer metastasis. Esophageal cancer, in particular, is one of the deadliest types of malignancy worldwide, reflecting its aggressive biology and the lack of adequate treatment options. Several challenges and concerns regarding the management of esophageal cancer have been raised in light of the ongoing viral pandemic. The primary aim of this review is to summarize the salient evidence for recommendations and optimal treatment strategies for patients with esophageal cancer amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Advances in diagnosis and management of cancer of the esophagus [^116Gmd4u]. BMJ (2024). High credibility.

Esophageal cancer is the seventh most common malignancy worldwide, with over 470,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Two distinct histological subtypes predominate and should be considered biologically separate disease entities: esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Outcomes remain poor regardless of subtype, with most patients presenting with late-stage disease. Novel strategies to improve early detection of the respective precursor lesions, squamous dysplasia, and Barrett's esophagus offer the potential to improve outcomes. The introduction of a limited number of biologic agents, as well as immune checkpoint inhibitors, is resulting in improvements in the systemic treatment of locally advanced and metastatic esophageal cancer. These developments, coupled with improvements in minimally invasive surgical and endoscopic treatment approaches, as well as adaptive and precision radiotherapy technologies, offer the potential to improve outcomes further. This review summarizes the latest advances in the diagnosis and management of esophageal cancer and the developments in understanding the biology of this disease.

### Survival of patients with head and neck cancer with metachronous multiple primary tumors is surprisingly favorable [^116fzqmJ]. Head & Neck (2019). Low credibility.

Several studies advocate the use of surveillance and screening for esophageal-MPTs. A French multicentered study investigated the use of endoscopy of the esophagus in the work-up of patients with HNSCC to screen for MPTs. They found an eight-times higher percentage of 6.8% esophageal carcinoma and high-grade dysplasia than the 0.8% in our study. A study by De Vries et al. also showed high percentages of esophageal-MPTs in a cohort of Dutch patients with HNSCC. Several Asian studies have shown esophageal-MPT incidences of up to 41%. Therefore, we believe our incidence of esophageal-MPTs is an underestimation of the actual incidence. This discrepancy between the literature and our findings could indicate that many esophageal-MPTs are never diagnosed, despite the fact that diagnosis of early-stage esophageal-MPTs could improve the outcome of patients with HNSCC. It is even suggested that early esophageal-MPT diagnosis and treatment could give these patients a similar prognosis as patients who did not develop an esophageal-MPT. These findings suggest that endoscopic screening for esophageal-MPTs in the workup of patients with HNSCC might cause a health benefit.

### Human papillomavirus infection in lung and esophageal cancers: analysis of 485 Asian cases [^115hFmSH]. Journal of Medical Virology (2011). Low credibility.

The role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in the development of lung and esophageal cancer remains inconclusive, which contrasts with the established role HPV plays in the development of uterine cervical cancer. One reason for this uncertainty is the variation in reported HPV infection rates among these cancers. An analysis of 485 lung and esophageal cancers (176 lung squamous cell carcinoma, 128 lung adenocarcinoma, 181 esophageal carcinoma) across eight institutions in Asia (Tokyo, Kochi, Kagoshima, and Okinawa, Japan; Seoul and Daegu, Korea; Changhua, Republic of China (Taiwan); Singapore, Singapore) was carried out to clarify infection rates with HPV.

Samples were examined at a single laboratory within the Department of Pathology, University of Tokyo, Japan, to avoid inter-laboratory variation using a combination of polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization (ISH). HPV was found in 6.3%, 7%, and 9.4% of patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and esophageal cancer, respectively. Among the geographic areas surveyed, Kagoshima exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of HPV infection in cases of esophageal carcinoma (24.1%). There was no geographical difference observed in the infection rates of HPV in lung carcinomas. Subtype-specific ISH identified high-risk HPV types 16/18 in the majority (75.7%) of the patients with lung and esophageal cancer positive for HPV.

### PET in the assessment of therapy response in patients with carcinoma of the head and neck and of the esophagus [^114xcR6b]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

In patients with carcinoma of the head and neck and of the esophagus, metabolic and functional imaging by PET with (18)F-FDG plays a pivotal role in evaluating tumor response to therapy, specifically in predicting progression-free survival and overall survival. Metabolic imaging facilitates the detection of biochemical changes within tumor cells as opposed to identifiable morphologic changes. Anatomic imaging modalities do not reliably differentiate between responders and nonresponders early during the follow-up period. The correlation between histopathologic tumor response after preoperative therapy and clinical prognosis is well established for many cancers.

Squamous carcinoma of the head and neck and esophageal carcinoma are known for avid (18)F-FDG uptake. For these cancers, (18)F-FDG PET parallels histopathologic findings in its ability to detect residual viable tumor, making it a valuable tool for the noninvasive assessment of histopathologic tumor response in advanced-stage cases after neoadjuvant therapy before surgery. Early determination of nonresponders is crucial, as timely modifications in therapy can be implemented for patients who do not demonstrate a response. This determination is exceptionally important for head and neck and esophageal malignancies, both of which are known for their unfavorable prognosis. Early adjustments in therapy regimens for nonresponders may improve patient outcomes.

There is now evidence that (18)F-FDG PET is a sensitive and specific method for determining therapy response and for providing important clinical insights.

### Survival of patients with head and neck cancer with metachronous multiple primary tumors is surprisingly favorable [^111W2Shh]. Head & neck (2019). Low credibility.

The study examines the outcomes of patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer who subsequently develop metachronous multiple primary tumors. Results indicate a surprisingly favorable survival rate among these patients. The findings challenge existing perceptions regarding prognoses and suggest a need for further research into the underlying mechanisms driving this unexpected outcome.

### Carcinoma of esophagus: radiologic diagnosis and staging [^117DM9Xo]. European Journal of Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Esophageal carcinoma is an uncommon malignancy, accounting for approximately 7% of gastrointestinal tract cancers and 1% of all cancers. Esophageal cancer still remains one of the most lethal of all cancers. Since a multimodality approach is presently used to treat esophageal cancer, early radiologic diagnosis and accurate tumor staging are essential to direct therapy toward cure or palliation. This article presents a review of radiologic diagnosis and staging of esophageal cancer.
