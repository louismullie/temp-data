## Question

60/70 mm of hg - bp - what does it mean

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a blood pressure of 60/70 mmHg means and how to interpret it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this notation is physiologically plausible and what the correct interpretation should be. Then, I should verify the clinical significance of a diastolic pressure around 60 mmHg versus 70 mmHg. Next, I will review guideline-based targets and the evidence for a diastolic J-curve. After that, I should consider special populations and measurement context. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-aligned interpretation and next steps, including when to adjust therapy or investigate causes of low diastolic pressure.

> Let me first confirm the notation, because 60/70 mmHg reverses the usual order of systolic over diastolic and is not physiologically credible; I should double-check that the intended reading is 70/60 mmHg, meaning systolic 70 mmHg and diastolic 60 mmHg, which would represent low blood pressure rather than hypertension, and would warrant clinical attention for hypotension rather than antihypertensive intensification [^11768rLa].

> Now, I will examine the clinical significance of a diastolic pressure around 60 mmHg; wait, let me verify the risk signal from high-quality data. In patients with treated systolic blood pressure less than 130 mmHg, an achieved diastolic pressure less than 60 mmHg is associated with a 46% higher risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, whereas the lowest risk appears when diastolic pressure is between 70 and 80 mmHg, supporting a diastolic J-curve phenomenon in this context [^111yY47c] [^11521VcP] [^116eU2g3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should review guideline targets to ensure I am not overgeneralizing. Contemporary European guidance recommends an on-treatment diastolic target of 70–79 mmHg when intensifying therapy, and it cautions against letting diastolic pressure fall too low, especially in patients with coronary artery disease where coronary perfusion is diastole-dependent; this aligns with the observed J-curve and supports avoiding sustained diastolic pressures below about 60 mmHg when feasible [^117H9vff] [^1142u5ao] [^115syZP7].

> I need to check special populations and contexts where a low diastolic pressure matters differently; in pregnancy with diabetes or chronic hypertension, therapy should generally be deintensified if blood pressure falls below about 90/60 mmHg, reflecting concern for uteroplacental perfusion, whereas in older adults with isolated systolic hypertension, many guidelines still prioritize systolic control while accepting a diastolic that remains above roughly 60 mmHg if tolerated, balancing perfusion needs against event reduction [^114u8JmL] [^115dsv7w] [^114C7Bck].

> Next, I should review measurement context because misclassification can mislead interpretation; let me verify that the reading was obtained with standardized technique and multiple measurements, ideally with automated office blood pressure or out-of-office monitoring, since clinic readings can overestimate and single readings are unreliable, and ambulatory or home monitoring better predicts outcomes and helps avoid overtreatment of white-coat hypertension or undertreatment of masked hypertension [^111yVXAL] [^1134FGFD] [^117U4zK6].

> But wait, what if the low diastolic is a marker rather than a mediator of risk; I should confirm whether low diastolic pressure itself is causally harmful or a confounded signal. Mediation analyses from SPRINT suggest that while low diastolic pressure correlates with worse outcomes, much of that association attenuates after adjustment, implying that very low diastolic may be a marker of vascular disease severity or frailty rather than a direct harm from therapy itself, though this does not negate the practical caution to avoid sustained diastolic pressures below 60 mmHg when possible [^111qRWU6] [^114Gufds].

> Let me synthesize the clinical interpretation now; a notation of 60/70 mmHg almost certainly reflects a mistake and should be clarified as 70/60 mmHg, indicating hypotension with a diastolic pressure of 60 mmHg, which sits at the lower bound of concern for coronary perfusion and is below the 70–80 mmHg range associated with the lowest cardiovascular risk in treated patients with systolic blood pressure under 130 mmHg, warranting evaluation for symptoms, orthostasis, medication effects, and underlying conditions rather than intensification of antihypertensive therapy [^111yY47c] [^117H9vff] [^115syZP7].

> I should double-check the practical next steps; confirm the measurement with proper technique and repeat readings, assess for symptoms such as dizziness, syncope, fatigue, or chest discomfort, review antihypertensive regimen for agents that disproportionately lower diastolic pressure, consider ambulatory or home monitoring to characterize out-of-office blood pressure, and in patients with coronary disease or ischemic symptoms, prioritize maintaining diastolic pressure at or above about 70 mmHg if tolerated while still addressing systolic targets within guideline ranges [^111yVXAL] [^117H9vff] [^1142u5ao].

> In summary, I need to ensure the blood pressure is correctly recorded as 70/60 mmHg, recognize that a diastolic pressure around 60 mmHg is below the 70–80 mmHg sweet spot and is associated with higher adverse cardiovascular risk in treated high-risk patients, avoid further diastolic lowering when feasible, and tailor therapy to the clinical context, comorbidities, and accurate out-of-office measurements rather than reacting to a single low reading [^111yY47c] [^117H9vff] [^111yVXAL].

A blood pressure of 60/70 mmHg is **not physiologically possible** because diastolic pressure cannot exceed systolic pressure. This likely reflects a **measurement error** or a **recording mistake**. Please confirm the reading and, if accurate, treat it as a **medical emergency** due to severe hypotension [^11768rLa]. If the intended reading was 70/60 mmHg, this indicates **dangerously low blood pressure** that risks organ hypoperfusion and shock; urgent evaluation is required to identify and treat the cause [^1148HtWV].

---

## Physiological interpretation

- **Normal blood pressure**: Typically around 120/80 mmHg, where systolic (top) is always higher than diastolic (bottom).
- **Impossible reading**: A diastolic value (70 mmHg) higher than systolic (60 mmHg) is physiologically impossible and indicates a measurement error.
- **Corrected interpretation**: If the intended reading was 70/60 mmHg, this represents severe hypotension, far below normal limits.

---

## Clinical significance of 70/60 mmHg

If the intended reading was 70/60 mmHg, this reflects **severe hypotension**, which poses **critical risks**:

- **Organ hypoperfusion**: Inadequate blood flow to vital organs (brain, heart, kidneys) [^1148HtWV].
- **Shock**: Life-threatening condition requiring immediate intervention [^notfound].
- **Symptoms**: Dizziness, confusion, fainting, cold/clammy skin, rapid breathing, and weak pulse.

---

## Potential causes of severe hypotension

Severe hypotension can result from **various conditions**, including:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Cardiovascular | - Heart failure <br/> - Arrhythmias <br/> - Myocardial infarction <br/> - Valvular heart disease |
| Hemorrhagic | - Severe blood loss <br/> - Internal bleeding |
| Infectious | - Sepsis <br/> - Severe infection |
| Endocrine | - Adrenal insufficiency <br/> - Hypothyroidism |
| Medication-related | - Overdose of antihypertensives <br/> - Sedatives <br/> - Anesthetics |
| Other | - Dehydration <br/> - Anaphylaxis <br/> - Pulmonary embolism |

---

## Immediate medical interventions

Severe hypotension requires **urgent care**:

- **Stabilization**: Airway, breathing, circulation (ABC) and supplemental oxygen.
- **Fluid resuscitation**: Intravenous fluids to restore blood volume.
- **Vasopressors**: Medications (e.g. norepinephrine) to raise blood pressure [^116RcFc5].
- **Identify and treat cause**: Address underlying cause (e.g. bleeding, infection, heart failure).
- **Monitoring**: Continuous blood pressure, heart rate, and organ function surveillance.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

A recorded blood pressure of 60/70 mmHg is **not physiologically possible** and likely reflects a **measurement or recording error**. If the intended reading was 70/60 mmHg, this indicates **severe hypotension** requiring immediate medical attention. Please confirm the reading and seek urgent care if accurate.

### How low can you go? Achieved blood pressure and cardiovascular outcomes [^112GyNqV]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

The benefits of controlling blood pressure to levels < 140/90 mm Hg are well established, but the risks and benefits of further reductions in blood pressure are less clear. A recent observational study using pooled data from 2 large randomized trials of renin-angiotensin system blockers suggested no added benefit and some increased risk of cardiovascular events with achieved blood pressures < 120 mm Hg systolic or 70 mm Hg diastolic. Caveats of observational studies notwithstanding, these results add to the ongoing controversy over the optimal blood pressure target for high-risk individuals.

Key Points

Question

What are the safe and optimal diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ranges among adults with treated systolic blood pressure (SBP) of less than 130 mm Hg?

Findings

In this cohort study of 7515 patients from 2 randomized clinical trials who had treated SBP of less than 130 mm Hg, a DBP of less than 60 mm Hg was associated with increased cardiovascular risk and a DBP between 70 and 80 mm Hg was associated with lower cardiovascular risk.

Meaning

The findings suggest that a DBP of less than 60 mm Hg may be harmful and a DBP between 70 and 80 mm Hg is an optimal target for patients with treated SBP of less than 130 mm Hg; this topic merits further study.

Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

High-value care in hypertension for adults aged 60 years or older — most patients with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 150 mm Hg or greater who receive antihypertensive medications will benefit, with acceptable harms and costs, from treatment to a blood pressure (BP) target of less than 150/90 mm Hg. When prescribing drug therapy, clinicians should select generic formulations over brand-name drugs, which have similar efficacy, reduced cost, and therefore better adherence, and clinicians should consider the patient's treatment burden. Because some patients may have falsely elevated readings in clinical settings ("white-coat hypertension"), it is important to ensure accurate BP measurement before initiating or changing treatment of hypertension, and the most accurate measurements come from multiple BP measurements made over time.

### Is 60 the new 80 in hypertension? [^114use8x]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Since the release of the "2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)", much controversy has ensued over the appropriate systolic blood pressure goal for those over the age of 60 years. This guideline suggested liberalizing the target for this population to < 150 mmHg, moving away from previous guidelines suggesting a target of < 140 mmHg. While some national quality measures have accepted the new relaxed blood pressure goal, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology have not. Recently published data show that millions of adults over 60 years of age would be classified as controlled using a threshold of < 150 mmHg, but not with a target of < 140 mmHg. In addition, emerging randomized trial evidence suggests that targeting a systolic blood pressure well below 140 mmHg is beneficial in older adults. In light of the improved health and vitality of older adults, and the steady decline in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality over recent decades, we do not think it is in good judgment to liberalize the treatment target in adults less than 80 years of age.

### What is normal blood pressure? [^115DwSgx]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Given the continuous relations of blood pressure to cardiovascular risk, any definition of high blood pressure is arbitrary, and based on thresholds at which there is clear evidence that treatment benefits outweigh potential risks. This review examines what constitutes optimal blood pressure.

Recent Findings

A recent report raised the possibility of an age- and sex-dependent threshold for risk associated with systolic blood pressure, questioning the use of a single threshold (such as 140/90 mmHg) for defining hypertension. Several subsequent studies have questioned this notion and reemphasized that lower blood pressure levels are associated with less morbidity and mortality even within the nonhypertensive range. A recent meta-analysis confirmed that a blood pressure of 115/75 mmHg is associated with minimal vascular mortality and likely constitutes optimal blood pressure. Such blood pressure levels are infrequent in westernized societies. The target blood pressure goal for treated hypertensives is higher at 140/90 mmHg but is infrequently achieved. Select individuals at high absolute risk of cardiovascular disease events and/or with specific conditions (notably diabetes, renal insufficiency and prior vascular disease) may benefit from blood pressure lowering below this threshold.

Summary

At a population level, a blood pressure of 115/75 mmHg seems optimal because it is associated with minimal vascular risk. Over half of all hypertensives do not have their blood pressure controlled underscoring the challenges facing health care providers. Efforts should be strengthened for the primary prevention of hypertension and the promotion of optimal blood pressure through lifestyle measures.

Blood pressure measurement and monitoring before treatment changes — procedural guidance: most included studies measured seated blood pressure after 5 minutes of rest and used multiple readings; clinicians should ensure accurate measurement before beginning or changing treatment, and assessment may include multiple measurements such as 2 to 3 readings separated by 1 minute in a seated patient resting alone in a room or ambulatory or home monitoring.

### Evaluation of optimal diastolic blood pressure range among adults with treated systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg [^111yY47c]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Extremely low diastolic blood pressure has been reported to be associated with increased adverse cardiovascular events (ie, the diastolic J-shape phenomenon); however, current US guidelines recommend an intensive blood pressure target of less than 130/80 mm Hg without mentioning the lower limits of diastolic blood pressure.

Objectives

To evaluate whether there is a diastolic J-shape phenomenon for patients with an treated systolic blood pressure of less than 130 mm Hg and to explore the safe and optimal diastolic blood pressure ranges for this patient population.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study analyzed outcome data of patients at high cardiovascular risk who were randomized to intensive or standard blood pressure control and achieved treated systolic blood pressure of less than 130 mm Hg in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) and Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes-Blood Pressure (ACCORD-BP) trial. Data were collected from October 2010 to August 2015 (SPRINT) and from September 1999 to June 2009 (ACCORD-BP). Data were analyzed from January to May 2020.

Exposure

Treated diastolic blood pressure, divided in intervals of less than 60, 60 to less than 70, 70 to less than 80, and 80 mm Hg and greater.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. A composite cardiovascular outcome, including cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke, was among the key secondary outcomes.

Results

A total of 7515 patients (mean [SD] age, 65.6 [8.7] years; 4553 [60.6%] men) were included in this analysis. The nominally lowest risk was observed at a diastolic blood pressure between 70 and 80 mm Hg for the primary outcome, the composite cardiovascular outcome, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death. A mean diastolic blood pressure of less than 60 mm Hg was associated with significantly increased risk of the primary outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 1.46; 95% CI, 1.13–1.90; p = 0.004), the composite cardiovascular outcome (HR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.26–2.41; p = 0.001), nonfatal myocardial infarction (HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.15–2.59; p = 0.008), and nonfatal stroke (HR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.26–5.63; p = 0.01).

Conclusions and Relevance

This cohort study found that lowering diastolic blood pressure to less than 60 mm Hg was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with high cardiovascular risk and an treated systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg. The finding that a diastolic blood pressure value between 70 and 80 mm Hg was an optimum target for this patient population merits further study.

Post-cardiac arrest care — mean arterial blood pressure goal in adults: A 2015 International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) systematic review found insufficient evidence to recommend a specific hemodynamic target for patients with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after cardiac arrest, and a later ILCOR systematic review evaluated outcomes when targeting a mean arterial pressure (MAP) higher or lower than 70 mmHg post-ROSC. The Red Cross guideline states it is reasonable to maintain a mean arterial blood pressure of at least 60 mmHg to 65 mmHg after out-of-hospital and in-hospital cardiac arrest.

### Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, European guideline targets, and cardiovascular outcomes: an individual patient data meta-analysis [^111KEiHm]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

The 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of BPconsidered that the association between adverse health outcomes and BP is continuous with risk increasing from levels of systolic/diastolic OBP as low as 110/70 mmHg. The task force therefore simplified the classification of OBP into non-elevated BP (< 120/70 mmHg), elevated BP (120–139/70–89 mmHg), and hypertension (≥ 140/90 mmHg). In addition to lifestyle measures, antihypertensive drug treatment is indicated in hypertensive patients. In recognition of the multiplicative nature of cardiovascular risk factors, the same recommendation also applies to patients with elevated OBP, if their 10–year cardiovascular risk is ≥ 10% or in the presence of comorbidities. Furthermore, the 2024 ESC guidelinesrecommended out-of-office BP monitoring to confirm the classification of patients and to ensure that the OBP target of 120–129/70–79 mmHg is corroborated by the out-of-office BP. Ambulatory BP monitoring is the state-of-the-art method for assessing the out-of-office BP. The proposed thresholds are < 115/65, < 120/70, and < 110/60 mmHg for the non-elevated 24–h, daytime, and nighttime ABP, respectively. The 2018 ESC/ESH actionable thresholdswere ≥ 130/80, ≥ 135/85, and ≥ 120/70 mmHg, i.e. 15/15 mmHg higher for systolic/diastolic 24–h and daytime ABP and 10/10 mmHg higher for nighttime ABP.

### Time to clinical benefit of intensive blood pressure lowering in patients 60 years and older with hypertension: a secondary analysis of randomized clinical trials [^111febvs]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study to use robust quantitative methods to determine the TTB for the prevention of cardiovascular events with intensive BP control in patients 60 years and older. It fills a critical gap for individually weighing benefits against potential harms while considering intensive BP control in this population, especially those with limited life expectancy. In this study, we found strong evidence for intensive BP treatment (SBP goal of < 140 mm Hg) to lower MACE events, and intensive BP treatment took 9, 19, and 34 months on average to prevent 1 MACE in 500, 200, and 100 patients, respectively, which suggested that intensive BP may be appropriate for older patients with a life expectancy greater than corresponding years after considering their adverse events (such as hypotension or falls) from more aggressive BP treatment.

The concept of intensive BP control has been extensively discussed. However, controversies still exist among the current guidelines for treating older patients. A BP target of less than 130/80 mm Hg is recommend for most adults 65 years and older in the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association BP guideline, which contrasts with the American College of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians BP guideline where SBP less than 150 mm Hg is recommended in adults 60 years and older. These also differ from the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension BP guideline, in which a BP of 130 to 139/70 to 79 mm Hg is considered. This is mainly due to the limited evidence and uncertain treatment effect from some trials, in such population. Recently, the STEP trialshowed that in patients aged 60 to 80 years with hypertension, targeting a reduction in SBP to 110 to 130 mm Hg resulted in a significantly lower incidence of MACE than a targeted reduction to 130 to 150 mm Hg. This was in line with the final report of SPRINT trial and its subgroup analysis report for patients 75 years and older. More recently, in a meta-analysis with more than 350 000 individual participants from 51 randomized clinical trials, pharmacological BP lowering to less than 120/70 mm Hg was effective into old age. This was consistent with our findings, which included more than 27 000 participants with a mean age of 70 years from 6 BP target trials.

### Advancing risk-based approaches in blood pressure management: reflections on the 2025 AHA / ACC statement [^1168APub]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

According to the 2017 Guideline, 68 million individuals had uncontrolled hypertension and were recommended for antihypertensive therapy; of these, 35 million were untreated, and 33 million were receiving treatment but had not attained target BP levels. We advocate for the application of risk stratification to guide priority interventions in both cohorts, informing optimal escalation strategies for those inadequately controlled, and prioritizing interventions to address nontreatment in the untreated population. Drawing a parallel with lipid-lowering therapy, it is both rational and evidence-based to ensure that individuals at the highest risk receive the most effective — and, where appropriate, more intensive — therapeutic regimens. We propose that BP-lowering interventions should be classified by intensity, analogous to lipid-lowering therapies: low, moderate, and high intensity, corresponding to reductions in systolic BP of < 10, 10 to 19, and ≥ 20 mm Hg, respectively. Those at the highest absolute risk should generally be prioritized for high-intensity regimens, provided adverse effects do not preclude their use. Achieving a mean SBP of ≤ 120 mm Hg is essential to maintain the majority of BP readings below 130/80 mm Hg over time, given the natural intraindividual variability in BP. Thus, all patients with untreated mean SBP > 140 mm Hg will require high-intensity regimens to attain and sustain optimal BP control and minimize cardiovascular risk. The substantial expansion of high-intensity therapy should therefore be directed primarily towards individuals at the highest absolute risk and with the greatest gap to achieving optimal BP. Given the heightened urgency in patients with high predicted risk, immediate pharmacological intervention — potentially with dual therapy — should be considered as the default strategy. Naturally, this approach must be tailored to patient preferences and tolerability; nonetheless, the evidence increasingly supports early, decisive intervention in those most likely to benefit.

### Methods of blood pressure measurement in the ICU [^1148HtWV]. Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Minimal clinical research has investigated the significance of different blood pressure monitoring techniques in the ICU and whether systolic vs. mean blood pressures should be targeted in therapeutic protocols and in defining clinical study cohorts. The objectives of this study are to compare real-world invasive arterial blood pressure with noninvasive blood pressure, and to determine if differences between the two techniques have clinical implications.

Design

We conducted a retrospective study comparing invasive arterial blood pressure and noninvasive blood pressure measurements using a large ICU database. We performed pairwise comparison between concurrent measures of invasive arterial blood pressure and noninvasive blood pressure. We studied the association of systolic and mean invasive arterial blood pressure and noninvasive blood pressure with acute kidney injury, and with ICU mortality.

Setting

Adult intensive care units at a tertiary care hospital.

Patients

Adult patients admitted to intensive care units between 2001 and 2007.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Pairwise analysis of 27,022 simultaneously measured invasive arterial blood pressure/noninvasive blood pressure pairs indicated that noninvasive blood pressure overestimated systolic invasive arterial blood pressure during hypotension. Analysis of acute kidney injury and ICU mortality involved 1,633 and 4,957 patients, respectively. Our results indicated that hypotensive systolic noninvasive blood pressure readings were associated with a higher acute kidney injury prevalence (p = 0.008) and ICU mortality (p < 0.001) than systolic invasive arterial blood pressure in the same range (≤ 70 mm Hg). Noninvasive blood pressure and invasive arterial blood pressure mean arterial pressures showed better agreement; acute kidney injury prevalence (p = 0.28) and ICU mortality (p = 0.76) associated with hypotensive mean arterial pressure readings (≤ 60 mm Hg) were independent of measurement technique.

Conclusions

Clinically significant discrepancies exist between invasive and noninvasive systolic blood pressure measurements during hypotension. Mean blood pressure from both techniques may be interpreted in a consistent manner in assessing patients' prognosis. Our results suggest that mean rather than systolic blood pressure is the preferred metric in the ICU to guide therapy.

### Debate on the 2025 guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults: new blood pressure targets, lower is better-and possible [^117CAWRS]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines has now released the long-awaited 2025 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/AANP/AAPA/ABC/ACCP/ACPM/AGS/AMA/ASPC/NMA/PCNA/SGIM Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults. Since the previous version, which had been in place for 8 years, meta-analyses and several treat-to-target trials investigating lower versus standard blood pressure targets have been published. Based on these, the 2025 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommends in adults with confirmed hypertension, an office blood pressure goal of < 130/80 mmHg, with encouragement to further reduce systolic blood pressure to < 120 mmHg. Here, we set out why we support these lower blood pressure targets and outline strategies to achieve them.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older to higher versus lower blood pressure targets: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians [^114HyeaP]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Higher versus lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) targets — subgroup effects: High-quality evidence showed a similar risk reduction for mortality and cardiac events when comparing trials with target ≥ 140 mm Hg versus < 140 mm Hg, with mortality (RR for target ≥ 140 mm Hg, 0.91 [CI, 0.84 to 0.99] vs. RR for target < 140 mm Hg, 0.84 [CI, 0.74 to 0.95]) and cardiac events (RR for target ≥ 140 mm Hg, 0.78 [CI, 0.68 to 0.93] vs. RR for target < 140 mm Hg, 0.83 [CI, 0.70 to 0.94]). The relative reduction in stroke events was slightly larger for studies that achieved a target SBP of 140 mm Hg or greater (RR, 0.72 [CI, 0.62 to 0.82]) than those that achieved a target SBP of less than 140 mm Hg (RR, 0.81 [CI, 0.66 to 0.96]).

### Blood pressure and the new ACC / AHA hypertension guidelines [^115GPRbD]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines cover virtually all aspects of the diagnosis, evaluation, monitoring, secondary causes as well as drug and non-drug treatment of hypertension. Substantial and appropriate emphasis has been given to the strategies necessary for accurate measurement of blood pressure in any setting where valid blood pressure measurements are desired. Most "errors" made during blood pressure measurement bias readings upwards resulting in over-diagnosis of hypertension and, amongst those already on drug therapy, underestimating the true magnitude of blood pressure lowering resulting in over-treatment. Hypertension is diagnosed when blood pressure is consistently ≥ 130 and/or ≥ 80 mm Hg. However, the majority of patients with hypertension between 130–139/80–89 mm Hg (stage 1 hypertension) do not qualify for immediate drug therapy. The guideline breaks new ground with some of its recommendations. Absolute cardiovascular risk is utilized, for the first time, to determine high-risk status when BP 130–139/80–89 mm Hg (Stage 1 hypertension) and high-risk patient characteristics/co-morbidities are absent including age 65 and older, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, known cardiovascular disease; high-risk individuals initiate drug therapy when BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg. The exception amongst high-risk individuals is for secondary stroke prevention in drug naïve individuals as drug therapy is initiated when blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. Non-high risk individuals will initiate drug therapy when BP is ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. Irrespective of blood pressure threshold for initiation of drug therapy, the target BP is minimally < 130/80 mm Hg in most. However, target BP is < 130 systolic amongst those 65 and older as the committee made no recommendation for a DBP target. Treatment should be initiated with two drugs having complementary mechanisms of action when blood pressure is > 20/10 mm Hg above goal.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^114C7Bck]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — systolic blood pressure (SBP) targets in older adults: In older patients (65–80 years), an SBP target of between 140–150 mmHg is recommended, whereas in older patients (> 65 years), it is recommended that SBP should be targeted to a BP range of 130–139 mmHg. In people older than 80 years with an initial SBP ≥ 160 mmHg, an SBP target between 140–150 mmHg should be considered provided that they are in good physical and mental condition, while an SBP target range of 130–139 mmHg is recommended for people older than 80 years, if tolerated.

### Blood pressure: the lower, the better: the con side [^111Hq4vk]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Recent guideline recommendations to lower BP to < 140/90 mmHg in all hypertensive patients, including the elderly, and to < 130/80 mmHg in diabetic and high-risk patients is not based on solid evidence. It is clear that lowering SBP to 140 mmHg is beneficial, but there is no evidence that lowering BP to < 140 mmHg in all patients adds benefit. The blood pressure target should be determined according to the patients' global risk and accompanied diseases. Lowering SBP to < 140 mmHg may be prudent in diabetic and high-risk patients. Lowering BP too much is associated with more side effects and may be dangerous. This scenario may be especially true in the elderly with isolated systolic hypertension.

### Evaluation of optimal diastolic blood pressure range among adults with treated systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg [^111Zed9e]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this study, lowering DBP to less than 60 mm Hg was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with high cardiovascular risk and an treated SBP of less than 130 mm Hg. The finding that a DBP value between 70 and 80 mm Hg was an optimal target for this patient population merits consideration and further study.

### Commentary on the 2014 BP guidelines from the panel appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^116xjPrG]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

The recently published article "2014 Evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)" (James et al. JAMA 311: 507–520, 2014) has generated considerable controversy. In this commentary, we evaluate the document and compare the recommendations contained within it with those of the JNC 7 and other national and international guidelines. The evidence quality rating approach followed by the article "2014 Evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)" (James et al. JAMA 311: 507–520, 2014) disqualified nearly 98% of previous studies from review; as a result, some of the key recommendations were on the basis of expert opinion alone. We are especially concerned that the recommendation to raise the systolic/diastolic BP levels at which treatment is initiated to ≥ 150/ ≥ 90 mmHg in adults ≥ 60 years old may affect cardiovascular and renal health in these patients. Additionally, we recommend that hypertension guidelines should be updated every 3–4 years with a fresh approach to the definition of target BP levels, the use of modern technology in the diagnosis of hypertension, and the treatment of hypertension in special populations not addressed in earlier guidelines.

### Treatment blood pressure targets for hypertension [^115tJF58]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors need to know what blood pressure (BP) target they should try to achieve. The standard of clinical practice for some time has been ≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg. New guidelines are recommending BP targets lower than this standard. It is not known whether attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard reduces mortality and morbidity.

Objectives

To determine if lower BP targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard BP targets (≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (1966–2008), EMBASE (1980–2008), and CENTRAL (up to June 2008); references from review articles, clinical guidelines, and clinical trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing patients randomized to lower or to standard BP targets and providing data on any of the primary outcomes below.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers (JAA, MIP) independently assessed the included trials and data entry. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; total cardiovascular events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure and end stage renal disease. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean systolic and diastolic BP and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Main Results

No trials comparing different systolic BP targets were found. Seven trials (22,089 subjects) comparing different diastolic BP targets were included. Despite a -4/-3 mmHg greater achieved reduction in systolic/diastolic BP, p < 0.001, attempting to achieve "lower targets" instead of "standard targets" did not change total mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86–1.15), myocardial infarction (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74–1.09), stroke (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79–1.25), congestive heart failure (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59–1.32), major cardiovascular events (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83–1.07), or end-stage renal disease (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.81–1.27). The net health effect of lower targets cannot be fully assessed due to lack of information regarding all total serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse effects in 6 of 7 trials. A sensitivity analysis in diabetic patients and in patients with chronic renal disease also did not show a reduction in any of the mortality and morbidity outcomes with lower targets as compared to standard targets.

Authors' Conclusions

Treating patients to lower than standard BP targets, ≤ 140–160/90–100 mmHg, does not reduce mortality or morbidity. Because guidelines are recommending even lower targets for diabetes mellitus and chronic renal disease, we are currently conducting systematic reviews in those groups of patients.

### Blood pressure targets for hypertension in people with diabetes mellitus [^1134KvG7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

When treating elevated blood pressure (BP), doctors often want to know what blood pressure target they should try to achieve. The standard blood pressure target in clinical practice for some time has been less than 140–160/90–100 mmHg for the general population of people with elevated blood pressure. Several clinical guidelines published in recent years have recommended lower targets (less than 130/80 mmHg) for people with diabetes mellitus. It is not known whether attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard target reduces mortality and morbidity in those with elevated blood pressure and diabetes.

Objectives

To determine if 'lower' BP targets (any target less than 130/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity compared with 'standard' BP targets (less than 140–160/90–100 mmHg) in people with diabetes.

Search Methods

We searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for related reviews. We conducted electronic searches of the Hypertension Group Specialised Register (January 1946 - October 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE (January 1946 - October 2013), EMBASE (January 1974 - October 2013) and ClinicalTrials.gov. The most recent search was performed on October 4, 2013. Other search sources were the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), and reference lists of all papers and relevant reviews.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing people with diabetes randomized to lower or to standard BP targets as previously defined, and providing data on any of the primary outcomes below.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed and established the included trials and data entry. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure and end-stage renal disease. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean systolic and diastolic BP, and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Main Results

We found five randomized trials, recruiting a total of 7314 participants and with a mean follow-up of 4.5 years. Only one trial (ACCORD) compared outcomes associated with 'lower' (< 120 mmHg) or 'standard' (< 140 mmHg) systolic blood pressure targets in 4734 participants. Despite achieving a significantly lower BP (119.3/64.4 mmHg vs 133.5/70.5 mmHg, P < 0.0001), and using more antihypertensive medications, the only significant benefit in the group assigned to 'lower' systolic blood pressure (SBP) was a reduction in the incidence of stroke: risk ratio (RR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.88, P = 0.009, absolute risk reduction 1.1%. The effect of SBP targets on mortality was compatible with both a reduction and increase in risk: RR 1.05 CI 0.84 to 1.30, low quality evidence. Trying to achieve the 'lower' SBP target was associated with a significant increase in the number of other serious adverse events: RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.91, P < 0.00001, absolute risk increase 2.0%. Four trials (ABCD-H, ABCD-N, ABCD-2V, and a subgroup of HOT) specifically compared clinical outcomes associated with 'lower' versus 'standard' targets for diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in people with diabetes. The total number of participants included in the DBP target analysis was 2580. Participants assigned to 'lower' DBP had a significantly lower achieved BP: 128/76 mmHg vs 135/83 mmHg, P < 0.0001. There was a trend towards reduction in total mortality in the group assigned to the 'lower' DBP target (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.01), mainly due to a trend to lower non-cardiovascular mortality. There was no difference in stroke (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.05), in myocardial infarction (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.40) or in congestive heart failure (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.92), low quality evidence. End-stage renal failure and total serious adverse events were not reported in any of the trials. A sensitivity analysis of trials comparing DBP targets < 80 mmHg (as suggested in clinical guidelines) versus < 90 mmHg showed similar results. There was a high risk of selection bias for every outcome analyzed in favor of the 'lower' target in the trials included for the analysis of DBP targets.

Authors' Conclusions

At the present time, evidence from randomized trials does not support blood pressure targets lower than the standard targets in people with elevated blood pressure and diabetes. More randomized controlled trials are needed, with future trials reporting total mortality, total serious adverse events as well as cardiovascular and renal events.

### Pharmacotherapy for hypertension in adults 60 years or older [^115sVpty]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the second substantive update of this review. It was originally published in 1998 and was previously updated in 2009. Elevated blood pressure (known as 'hypertension') increases with age - most rapidly over age 60. Systolic hypertension is more strongly associated with cardiovascular disease than is diastolic hypertension, and it occurs more commonly in older people. It is important to know the benefits and harms of antihypertensive treatment for hypertension in this age group, as well as separately for people 60 to 79 years old and people 80 years or older.

Objectives

Primary objective• To quantify the effects of antihypertensive drug treatment as compared with placebo or no treatment on all-cause mortality in people 60 years and older with mild to moderate systolic or diastolic hypertensionSecondary objectives• To quantify the effects of antihypertensive drug treatment as compared with placebo or no treatment on cardiovascular-specific morbidity and mortality in people 60 years and older with mild to moderate systolic or diastolic hypertension• To quantify the rate of withdrawal due to adverse effects of antihypertensive drug treatment as compared with placebo or no treatment in people 60 years and older with mild to moderate systolic or diastolic hypertension SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to 24 November 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of at least one year's duration comparing antihypertensive drug therapy versus placebo or no treatment and providing morbidity and mortality data for adult patients (≥ 60 years old) with hypertension defined as blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg.

Data Collection and Analysis

Outcomes assessed were all-cause mortality; cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality; coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality; and withdrawal due to adverse effects. We modified the definition of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity to exclude transient ischaemic attacks when possible.

Main Results

This update includes one additional trial (MRC-TMH 1985). Sixteen trials (N = 26,795) in healthy ambulatory adults 60 years or older (mean age 73.4 years) from western industrialised countries with moderate to severe systolic and/or diastolic hypertension (average 182/95 mmHg) met the inclusion criteria. Most of these trials evaluated first-line thiazide diuretic therapy for a mean treatment duration of 3.8 years. Antihypertensive drug treatment reduced all-cause mortality (high-certainty evidence; 11% with control vs 10.0% with treatment; risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 0.97; cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (moderate-certainty evidence; 13.6% with control vs 9.8% with treatment; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.77; cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity (moderate-certainty evidence; 5.2% with control vs 3.4% with treatment; RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.74; and coronary heart disease mortality and morbidity (moderate-certainty evidence; 4.8% with control vs 3.7% with treatment; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.88. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were increased with treatment (low-certainty evidence; 5.4% with control vs 15.7% with treatment; RR 2.91, 95% CI 2.56 to 3.30. In the three trials restricted to persons with isolated systolic hypertension, reported benefits were similar. This comprehensive systematic review provides additional evidence that the reduction in mortality observed was due mostly to reduction in the 60- to 79-year-old patient subgroup (high-certainty evidence; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.95). Although cardiovascular mortality and morbidity was significantly reduced in both subgroups 60 to 79 years old (moderate-certainty evidence; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.77) and 80 years or older (moderate-certainty evidence; RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87), the magnitude of absolute risk reduction was probably higher among 60- to 79-year-old patients (3.8% vs 2.9%). The reduction in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity was primarily due to a reduction in cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity.

Authors' Conclusions

Treating healthy adults 60 years or older with moderate to severe systolic and/or diastolic hypertension with antihypertensive drug therapy reduced all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity, and coronary heart disease mortality and morbidity. Most evidence of benefit pertains to a primary prevention population using a thiazide as first-line treatment.

### How well do clinic-based blood pressure measurements agree with the mercury standard? [^111Q5fA5]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Obtaining accurate blood pressure (BP) readings is a challenge faced by health professionals. Clinical trials implement strict protocols, whereas clinical practices and studies that assess quality of care utilize a less rigorous protocol for BP measurement.

Objective

To examine agreement between real-time clinic-based assessment of BP and the standard mercury assessment of BP.

Design

Prospective reliability study.

Patients

One hundred patients with an International Classification of Diseases-9th edition code for hypertension were enrolled.

Measures

Two BP measurements were obtained with the Hawksley random-zero mercury sphygmomanometer and averaged. The clinic-based BP was extracted from the computerized medical records.

Results

Agreement between the mercury and clinic-based systolic blood pressure (SBP) was good, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.91 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.83 to 0.94); the agreement for the mercury and clinic-based diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was satisfactory, ICC = 0.77 (95% CI: 0.62 to 0.86). Overall, clinic-based readings overestimated the mercury readings, with a mean overestimation of 8.3 mmHg for SBP and 7.1 mmHg for DBP. Based on the clinic-based measure, 21% of patients were misdiagnosed with uncontrolled hypertension.

Conclusions

Health professionals should be aware of this potential difference when utilizing clinic-based BP values for making treatment decisions and/or assessing quality of care.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older to higher versus lower blood pressure targets: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians [^116y9jy9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Hypertension blood pressure targets — trial evidence contrasts SPRINT and ACCORD. In SPRINT, "targeting SBP to less than 120 mm Hg compared with less than 140 mm Hg in adults without diabetes or prior stroke, at high-risk for cardiovascular disease, and with a baseline SBP of less than 140 mm Hg significantly reduced fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality", and increased-risk criteria included "an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 20 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2", "10-year risk for cardiovascular disease of 15% or greater", and "age 75 years or older". In contrast, ACCORD "included only adults with type 2 diabetes" and found "no statistically significant reduction in the primary composite outcome… (RR, 0.94 [CI, 0.80 to 1.11])", did find a "reduction in stroke events (RR, 0.58 [CI, 0.39 to 0.88])", and reported "more serious adverse events associated with an SBP target of less than 120 mm Hg versus less than 140 mm Hg".

### Bottom blood pressure or bottom cardiovascular risk? How far can cardiovascular risk be reduced? [^113CeLJr]. Journal of Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Recent intervention trials have been conducted in patients at high cardiovascular risk, and their results have reopened the issue whether lowering blood pressure to normotensive values is of greater benefit than lowering blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg. These trials have made widespread use of concomitant therapies (lipid-lowering, antiplatelet and background antihypertensive agents). The question has been addressed whether in these trials a bottom level of cardiovascular risk (i.e. one that cannot be further reduced) rather than a bottom level of blood pressure (i.e. one below which risk cannot be further reduced) was achieved.

Methods

The 'residual risk', that is, the incidence of major cardiovascular events achieved in trials with antihypertensive agents, was calculated by reviewing endpoint data in all major trials after classifying them into four categories according to patients' baseline cardiovascular risk: low-risk patients; elderly patients; diabetic patients; high-risk patients.

Results

Low rates of major cardiovascular events (below 3–6% in 5 years) were only achieved in trials enrolling low-risk patients. In elderly hypertensive patients, hypertensive patients with diabetes and particularly patients with previous cardiovascular disease quite rarely could incidence of major cardiovascular events be reduced below a bottom level of 12–14% in 5 years, and remained within the high-risk range (above the conventional threshold of 10% in 5 years) despite extensive use of concomitant therapies.

Conclusion

In high-risk patients there is a 'ceiling effect' for treatment benefits. Delaying therapeutic correction of cardiovascular risk factors until a high level of risk is achieved blunts the full benefits of interventions.

### What is the evidence base for diagnosing hypertension and for subsequent blood pressure treatment targets in the prevention of cardiovascular disease? [^113f4ipA]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

What is the evidence for treatment targets in hypertension?

Although it can be argued that the relationship between BP and cardiovascular risk is continuous, hypertension targets provide an essential management guide. The Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) trial, which compared three diastolic targets (≤ 90 mmHg, ≤ 85 mmHg and ≤ 80 mmHg), tried to provide definitive data and found no difference overall in the rate of cardiovascular events between targets. Interestingly, there was a 51% reduction in cardiovascular events between the ≤ 90 mmHg target group and ≤ 80 mmHg target group in diabetic patients, highlighting the need to consider different targets depending on the level of cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, post hoc analyses suggested that the lowest incidence of cardiovascular events was at 82.6 mmHg, whilst the lowest mortality rate was at 86.5 mmHg, and the small differences in achieved BP between groups have been criticised. The use of diastolic targets has declined more recently with the evidence that systolic BP carries the greatest risk for heart disease and stroke, and this is reflected in most current guidelines.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^117AAnBo]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Hypertension management in patients 60 years and over — treatment target and strength: For patients 60 years and over, we recommend treating to a systolic blood pressure goal of < 150 mm Hg with added benefit to lowering systolic blood pressure further for those between 130 mm Hg and 150 mm Hg (Strong for | Reviewed, Amended). Among people age 60 and over with moderate to severe HTN, there is evidence that treating to an SBP goal of 150 mm Hg or less reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and among people 60 years and over, there was also evidence of further benefit in lowering systolic blood pressure to levels between 130 and 150 mm Hg.

### Blood pressure targets in adults with hypertension [^1148paiZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of this review first published in 2009. When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors usually try to achieve a blood pressure target. That target is the blood pressure value below which the optimal clinical benefit is supposedly obtained. "The lower the better" approach that guided the treatment of elevated blood pressure for many years was challenged during the last decade due to lack of evidence from randomised trials supporting that strategy. For that reason, the standard blood pressure target in clinical practice during the last years has been less than 140/90 mm Hg for the general population of patients with elevated blood pressure. However, new trials published in recent years have reintroduced the idea of trying to achieve lower blood pressure targets. Therefore, it is important to know whether the benefits outweigh harms when attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard target.

Objectives

The primary objective was to determine if lower blood pressure targets (any target less than or equal to 135/85 mm Hg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard blood pressure targets (less than or equal to 140/ 90 mm Hg) for the treatment of patients with chronic arterial hypertension. The secondary objectives were: to determine if there is a change in mean achieved systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP associated with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets" in patients with chronic arterial hypertension; and to determine if there is a change in withdrawals due to adverse events with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets", in patients with elevated blood pressure.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to May 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2019, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing patients allocated to lower or to standard blood pressure targets (see above).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (JAA, VL) independently assessed the included trials and extracted data. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, end stage renal disease, and other serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean SBP and DBP, withdrawals due to adverse effects, and mean number of antihypertensive drugs used. We assessed the risk of bias of each trial using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: This update includes 11 RCTs involving 38,688 participants with a mean follow-up of 3.7 years. This represents 7 new RCTs compared with the original version. At baseline the mean weighted age was 63.1 years and the mean weighted blood pressure was 155/91 mm Hg. Lower targets do not reduce total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05; 11 trials, 38,688 participants; high-certainty evidence) and do not reduce total serious adverse events (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.08; 6 trials, 18,165 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This means that the benefits of lower targets do not outweigh the harms as compared to standard blood pressure targets. Lower targets may reduce myocardial infarction (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.96; 6 trials, 18,938 participants, absolute risk reduction (ARR) 0.4%, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 250 over 3.7 years) and congestive heart failure (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.92; 5 trials, 15,859 participants, ARR 0.6%, NNTB 167 over 3.7 years) (low-certainty for both outcomes). Reduction in myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure was not reflected in total serious adverse events. This may be due to an increase in other serious adverse events (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.59; 6 trials. 18,938 participants, absolute risk increase (ARI) 3%, number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 33 over four years) (low-certainty evidence). Participants assigned to a "lower" target received one additional antihypertensive medication and achieved a significantly lower mean SBP (122.8 mm Hg versus 135.0 mm Hg, and a lower mean DBP (82.0 mm Hg versus 85.2 mm Hg, than those assigned to "standard target".

Authors' Conclusions

For the general population of persons with elevated blood pressure, the benefits of trying to achieve a lower blood pressure target rather than a standard target (≤ 140/90 mm Hg) do not outweigh the harms associated with that intervention. Further research is needed to see if some groups of patients would benefit or be harmed by lower targets. The results of this review are primarily applicable to older people with moderate to high cardiovascular risk. They may not be applicable to other populations.

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older to higher versus lower blood pressure targets: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians [^112JCKBz]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) jointly developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations based on the benefits and harms of higher versus lower blood pressure targets for the treatment of hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older.

Methods

This guideline is based on a systematic review of published randomized, controlled trials for primary outcomes and observational studies for harms only (identified through EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, and ClinicalTrials.gov), from database inception through January 2015. The MEDLINE search was updated through September 2016. Evaluated outcomes included all-cause mortality, morbidity and mortality related to stroke, major cardiac events (fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death), and harms. This guideline grades the evidence and recommendations using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) method.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes all adults aged 60 years or older with hypertension.

Recommendation 1

ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians initiate treatment in adults aged 60 years or older with systolic blood pressure persistently at or above 150 mm Hg to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less than 150 mm Hg to reduce the risk for mortality, stroke, and cardiac events. (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians select the treatment goals for adults aged 60 years or older based on a periodic discussion of the benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets with the patient.

Recommendation 2

ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians consider initiating or intensifying pharmacologic treatment in adults aged 60 years or older with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg to reduce the risk for recurrent stroke. (Grade: weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians select the treatment goals for adults aged 60 years or older based on a periodic discussion of the benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets with the patient.

Recommendation 3

ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians consider initiating or intensifying pharmacologic treatment in some adults aged 60 years or older at high cardiovascular risk, based on individualized assessment, to achieve a target systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg to reduce the risk for stroke or cardiac events. (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians select the treatment goals for adults aged 60 years or older based on a periodic discussion of the benefits and harms of specific blood pressure targets with the patient.

### Evaluation of optimal diastolic blood pressure range among adults with treated systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg [^113SU4QV]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Baseline Characteristics

In SPRINT and ACCORD-BP trials, we included 7515 patients (mean [SD] age 65.6 [8.7] years) with 4553 (60.6%) men (Figure 1). Most patients achieved a DBP of between 60 and less than 70 mm Hg (3250 [43.2%]) and between 70 and less than 80 mm Hg (2545 [33.9%]) (Table). Patients who achieved lower DBP were generally older (eg, 60 to < 70 mm Hg vs ≥ 80 mm Hg: mean [SD] age, 66.9 [8.2] years vs 59.0 [5.6] years; P < .001), had lower mean (SD) BMI (eg, 60 to < 70 mm Hg vs ≥ 80 mm Hg: 30.9 [5.7] vs 31.0 [5.9]; P < .001), had lower mean (SD) baseline DBP (eg, 60 to < 70 mm Hg vs ≥ 80 mm Hg: 75.0 [9.0] vs 89.0 [10.3]; P < .001), had higher mean (SD) baseline SBP (eg, 60 to < 70 mm Hg vs ≥ 80 mm Hg: 136.8 [15.1] vs 135.0 [15.1]; p = 0.004), had lower mean (SD) LDL-C levels (eg, 60 to < 70 mm Hg vs ≥ 80 mm Hg: 108.0 [34.9] mg/dL vs 120.7 [38.4] mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259]; P < .001), had higher mean (SD) glycemic levels (eg, 60 to < 70 mm Hg vs ≥ 80 mm Hg: 129.0 [51.2] mg/dL vs 111.0 [38.4] mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]; P < .001), were less likely to currently use tobacco (eg, 60 to < 70 mm Hg vs ≥ 80 mm Hg: 369 [11.4%] vs 121 [25.4%]; P < .001), and more likely to have a history of cardiovascular disease (1509 [46.4%] vs 114 [23.9%]; P < .001).

### Opposing age-related trends in absolute and relative risk of adverse health outcomes associated with out-of-office blood pressure [^114ZCXkf]. Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Participant-level meta-analyses assessed the age-specific relevance of office blood pressure to cardiovascular complications, but this information is lacking for out-of-office blood pressure. At baseline, daytime ambulatory (n = 12624) or home (n = 5297) blood pressure were measured in 17921 participants (51.3% women; mean age, 54.2 years) from 17 population cohorts. Subsequently, mortality and cardiovascular events were recorded. Using multivariable Cox regression, floating absolute risk was computed across 4 age bands (≤ 60, 61–70, 71–80, and > 80 years). Over 236491 person-years, 3855 people died and 2942 cardiovascular events occurred. From levels as low as 110/65 mmHg, risk log-linearly increased with higher out-of-office systolic/diastolic blood pressure. From the youngest to the oldest age group, rates expressed per 1000 person-years increased (P < 0.001) from 4.4 (95% CI, 4.0–4.7) to 86.3 (76.1–96.5) for all-cause mortality and from 4.1 (3.9–4.6) to 59.8 (51.0–68.7) for cardiovascular events, whereas hazard ratios per 20-mmHg increment in systolic out-of-office blood pressure decreased (P ≤ 0.0033) from 1.42 (1.19–1.69) to 1.09 (1.05–1.12) and from 1.70 (1.51–1.92) to 1.12 (1.07–1.17), respectively. These age-related trends were similar for out-of-office diastolic pressure and were generally consistent in both sexes and across ethnicities. In conclusion, adverse outcomes were directly associated with out-of-office blood pressure in adults. At young age, the absolute risk associated with out-of-office blood pressure was low, but relative risk high, whereas with advancing age relative risk decreased and absolute risk increased. These observations highlight the need of a lifecourse approach for the management of hypertension.

Conclusions

In summary, a hypertension treatment strategy focused solely on blood pressure thresholds leaves substantial ASCVD risk unaddressed. Multivariable risk estimation may help identify the types of persons who are likely to benefit from risk-reducing therapies across the spectrum of SBP. Clinical trials that stratify participants by pretreatment absolute risk and blood pressure and then randomize the groups with discordant treatment recommendations to antihypertensive medications and other risk-reducing therapies versus placebo are needed to confirm the merits of absolute risk assessment in guiding primary prevention therapies.

Reflections

Although differences in guidelines are invariably highlighted, it is notable that the core advice in the ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH guidelines is remarkably similar in most important areas of practice (Table 9). Even for the area of greatest difference, the definition of hypertension, there is still considerable overlap. In both guidelines, adults with an average SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg are designated as having hypertension and treatment with a combination of lifestyle counseling and antihypertensive drug therapy is recommended. Those with an average SBP 130 to 139 mm Hg are designated as having stage 1 hypertension in the ACC/AHA and high normal BP in the ESC/ESH. However, both guidelines recommend lifestyle modification for most adults in this BP category, the addition of antihypertensive drugs only being recommended for the ≈30% of US adults with CVD or a 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 10% in the ACC/AHA guideline and only to be considered in very-high-risk patients, especially those with coronary artery disease, in the ESC/ESH CPG. For many other treatment differences, the 2 guidelines provide overall advice that is similar but sometimes discrepant in the specifics. For example, both guidelines recommend combination antihypertensive drug therapy but the specific application for this advice is somewhat different. The ESC/ESH places great emphasis on single-pill combination drug therapy, whereas the ACC/AHA encourages single-pill combinations when possible but notes that many of the combination pills available in the United States use hydrochlorothiazide rather than chlorthalidone and often use a diuretic dose that is lower than what has been used in the landmark treatment trials. Likewise, both guidelines recommend a lower BP target during treatment compared with what was advised in previous guidelines, including in older adults. Overall, the difference lies in the ESC/ESH taking a more stepped approach, first recommending achievement of an SBP/DBP < 140/90 mm Hg before targeting a lower BP, if tolerated, and identifying SBP 120 mm Hg and DBP 70 mm Hg as the lower safety boundary for BP reduction in adults 18 to 65 years of age (130 mm Hg in those with CKD). The ACC/AHA recommends a single SBP/DBP target of < 130/80 mm Hg in most adults but SBP < 130 mm Hg in older well adults, if tolerated.

### Randomized controlled trials of blood pressure lowering in hypertension: a critical reappraisal [^116bYnzk]. Circulation Research (2015). Low credibility.

Sixty-eight blood pressure (BP)-lowering randomized controlled trials (defined as randomized controlled trials comparing active treatment with placebo, or less active treatment, achieving a BP difference, performed between 1966 and end 2013 in cohorts with ≥ 40% hypertensive patients, and exclusive of trials in acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, acute stroke, and dialysis) were identified and meta-analyzed grouping the randomized controlled trials on the basis of clinically relevant questions: (1) does BP lowering reduce all types of cardiovascular outcome? (2) Is prevention of all outcomes proportional to the extent of systolic, diastolic, and pulse BP? (3) Have all classes of BP-lowering drugs been shown capable of reducing all types of cardiovascular outcome? (4) Is BP lowering beneficial when intervention is initiated at any grade (or stage) of hypertension? (5) Do BP-lowering randomized controlled trials provide evidence about systolic BP and diastolic BP targets of treatment? (6) Should BP-lowering treatment be preferentially addressed to patients in higher risk categories promising larger absolute treatment benefits? The results of these meta-analyses provide further support to current hypertension treatment guidelines by showing that BP lowering can significantly reduce major cardiovascular outcomes largely independent of the agents used, significant risk reduction is found at all hypertension grades (stages), and when systolic BP is lowered below a cut off of 140 mm Hg with some further reduction limited to stroke at systolic BP values just < 130 mm Hg. Absolute risk reduction progressively increases higher is total cardiovascular risk, but this greater benefit is associated with a progressively higher residual risk, ie, higher treatment failures.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^115z4TP1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

JNC 8 Recommendations 2 to 5

In all persons < 60 years or in persons > 18 years (and either those younger or older than 60 years with either diabetes or CKD), initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower SBP ≥ 140 or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and treat to a goal BP of < 140/90 mm Hg.

Basis of Recommendation

There is broader agreement between the professional societies on how to treat younger patients with hypertension. While most studies examined adults > 30 years, JNC 8 extends the same target to those aged 18 to 30 years. More support can be found for DBP versus SBP goals among younger adults with hypertension, especially in the Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) trial. 34 This trial randomized 18 790 hypertensive patients (aged 50 to 80 years) with baseline DBP 100 to 115 mm Hg into 3 groups based on target DBP ≤ 90, ≤ 85, or ≤ 80 mm Hg.

The main goal of this study was to assess the association between these 3 target DBPs and major CVD events (nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, and cardiovascular death). There was little difference in event rates between the 3 groups, except that the rate of MI was reduced in the 2 lower DBP target groups compared with the DBP ≤ 90 mm Hg group. Further subgroup analyses of patients with diabetes demonstrated fewer major CVD events, fewer strokes, and reduced cardiovascular mortality in the lowest BP treatment target group, while those with prior CVD had a significant reduction in stroke across the 3 groups. 34

While all 3 groups in HOT achieved a mean DBP < 90 mm Hg, the lowest risk of cardiovascular mortality was seen at 85.6 mm Hg and the lowest rate of CVD events was seen at 82.6 mm Hg. Based on this trial, everyone with hypertension under the JNC 8 guidelines has a DBP goal of < 90 mm Hg. There is less evidence supporting an SBP target of < 140 mm Hg in this group of patients. However, in trials like HOT, even though DBP was being targeted, SBP also fell at least 25 mm Hg in all 3 groups. 34 Indeed, given SPRINT suggests clinical benefit for an SBP target of 120 mm Hg among higher risk persons < 60 years, it is likely that forthcoming guidelines may even reduce this SBP target to a threshold lower than 140. However, the DBP values in the intensive therapy arm of SPRINT are not currently known.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — standardized office blood pressure (BP) protocol emphasizes correct technique, validated devices, averaging, and training. Accurate measurement of BP is essential to diagnose high BP, ascertain BP-related CVD risk, and assess response to therapy. A standardized protocol, provided in Figure 3, includes proper patient preparation, standardized measurement technique and approach, documentation of BP, analysis of the readings, and providing the readings to the patient. The use of a BP device validated against a reference standard with an appropriately sized cuff is paramount for accurate BP measurement (see https://www.validatebp.org for a carefully vetted list of validated devices available in the United States). Further, because individual BP measurements may vary in an unpredictable or random manner, a single reading is inadequate for clinical decision-making. Office BP should be based on the average of available readings, and an average of ≥ 2 BP measurements obtained on ≥ 2 separate occasions may minimize error and provide a more accurate estimation of office BP. Regardless of the office BP measurement approach, clinicians and staff should have initial and ongoing training; competency checks ideally every 6 to 12 months to maintain best practices for measuring BP.

### Variation in hypertension clinical practice guidelines: a global comparison [^117CuFBg]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

CPGs from higher-income contexts were more likely to recommend initiating dual-drug therapy at a BP ≥ 160/100 mmHg. Recent evidence suggests that most patients will require two drug classes in order to achieve adequate BP control. CPGs from lower-income settings may have opted for the initiation with monotherapy again due to barriers including the low availability of affordable drugs. Studies have shown that low- and middle-income countries often closely follow the release of guidelines from high-income regions, for instance, the 2016 Government of India Hypertension CPG from this study, explicitly states that the guideline is "adopted and/or adapted from existing evidence-based guidelines", including the European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension (ESC/ESH), Joint National Committee (JNC) and NICE guidelines. The Indian guidelines made it clear that they chose aspects from each of these guidelines which were best suited to their particular context. Changes such as the first-line use of combination therapy as recommended by HIC guidelines may not be feasible in low-resource regions. Recognising these difficulties, the ISH 2020 guidelines have produced "essential" recommendations for lower-income settings, which advocate the use of any available antihypertensives, compared to "optimum" recommendations, in order to act as a global resource; this was the only guideline assessed by this study to use this approach.

For patients that were hypertensive, most CPGs recommended a target BP of less than 140/90 mmHg whilst 9% of guidelines recommended a target of < 130/80 mmHg. The ESC/ESH 2018 guidelines recommended lower targets of SBP between 120 and 129 mmHg and a DBP between 70 and 79 mmHg in patients under 65 years. The lower BP targets recommended by these guidelines are partly influenced by findings from SPRINT, where lower rates of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events and deaths were observed in cohorts treated to a target systolic BP of less than 120 mmHg, compared to less than 140 mmHg. However, the methodology used in BP measurement may not be applicable to routine clinical practice, and following the publication of SPRINT, a Cochrane review updated in 2017, 2018 and 2020 based on six different randomised controlled trials (RCTs) showed no reduction in total mortality or serious adverse events when treating to a target less than 135/85 mmHg. The current mixed and evolving evidence regarding optimal BP targets offers a potential reason behind the variations in targets recommended by different CPGs. It is of note that most CPGs (88%) recommended a target BP for hypertensive patients that was identical to their diagnostic threshold for hypertension.

Blood pressure (BP) management strategies have evolved substantially over recent decades, shifting from approaches based exclusively on BP thresholds to the adoption of multidimensional, risk-based decision making. Within this context, the 2025 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) Scientific Statement on the use of risk assessment in BP managementrepresents a further welcome advancement towards aligning clinical practice with contemporary evidence.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^115CjvEw]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

### Association between baseline diastolic blood pressure and the efficacy of intensive vs standard blood pressure-lowering therapy [^11421LVU]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is there an interaction between baseline diastolic blood pressure and intensification of blood pressure–lowering therapy for survival and cardiovascular outcomes?

Findings

In this cohort study of 14 094 patients from 2 large randomized clinical trials, baseline DBP of 80 and 90 mm Hg were associated with significant reductions in the risk of a composite cardiovascular end point that included cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The same was not true for the outcome of all-cause death.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that further work is needed to determine whether blood-pressure lowering therapy should be intensified in patients whose diastolic blood pressure is low.

### Blood pressure: the lower, the better: the con side [^113vf546]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Hypertension is one of the major modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. It was recently shown that 7.6 million early deaths and 92 million disabled years are attributed to hypertension. Lowering blood pressure (BP) reduces CV morbidity and mortality. The benefit achieved in most hypertension outcomes studies was attributed to BP reduction, and the more aggressive the BP reduction, the greater the benefit. However, it is unclear what the target BP levels should be. Lewington et al. showed in a large collaborative meta-analysis that included 1 million adults with no previous vascular disease that usual BP is strongly and directly related to vascular (and overall) mortality, without any evidence of a threshold down to at least 115/75 mmHg. This observation led clinicians to believe that BP should be lowered to the lowest tolerable levels. Some of the guidelines even adopted this approach and recommended lowering BP to < 140/90 mmHg in all hypertensive patients, including the elderly, and to < 130/80 mmHg in diabetic and high-risk patients. The present review will analyze the available data showing that the notion "the lower, the better" is not evidence based and that there is evidence that lowering BP too aggressively may even be harmful.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^116hGx21]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Blood pressure targets in diabetes — intensive management reduces stroke and may allow goals below 130/80 mmHg if tolerated. Trials with achieved systolic blood pressures of < 135 mmHg versus < 140 mmHg reported a 10% reduction in all-cause mortality and a 17% reduction in stroke, and more intensive reduction to < 130 mmHg was associated with further stroke reduction but not other cardiovascular events. Meta-analyses indicate benefit is greatest when mean baseline blood pressure is ≥ 140/90 mmHg. A systematic review found reduced stroke (risk ratio 0.84 [95% CI 0.52–0.79]) and macroalbuminuria (0.77 [0.63–0.93]) with a posttreatment blood pressure of 125/73 mmHg, suggesting goals could be lowered from 130/80 mmHg if tolerated. This is consistent with guidance that advocates a goal of < 130/80 mmHg for all people. Potential adverse effects of antihypertensive therapy should also be taken into account, and low diastolic blood pressure is not necessarily a contraindication to more intensive management in otherwise standard care.

### Low on-treatment blood pressure and cardiovascular events in patients without elevated risk: a nationwide cohort study [^1129MSUn]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In 2019, hypertension accounted for > 20% of all deaths worldwide, and about half of the patients treated for hypertension still had on-treatment blood pressure (BP) > 140/90 mmHg. To mitigate the global burden of hypertension, intensifying treatments for patients with low cardiovascular risk is vital because a majority of patients with hypertension have 10-year atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risks < 10%, and such low-risk patients are reportedly more likely to be uncontrolled than patients with higher risk. However, the potential harm of excessive BP lowering is not well investigated in that patient population. Filling this evidence gap is imperative for physicians to optimize hypertension treatment for patients with low cardiovascular risk.

To the best of our knowledge, evidence for the potential harm of low on-treatment BP has been long discussed, but the discussion was limited to high-risk patients. Recently, two large observational studies in high-risk patients reported an increased risk of cardiovascular outcomes in low on-treatment systolic BP (SBP) of < 120 mmHg and diastolic BP (DBP) of < 70 mmHg. Based on these reports, the 2018 European Society of Cardiology and the European Society of Hypertension guidelines suggested maintaining SBP above 120 mmHg for patients with hypertension in general.

Thus, the potential harm of low on-treatment BP in low-risk patients is yet to be studied, presumably due to challenges in the required number of patients and length of follow-up for adequate statistical analysis. To address this knowledge gap, we used nationally representative data from the working-age general population in Japan to investigate the relationship between on-treatment BP and cardiovascular outcomes among low-risk patients with hypertension.

Point of view

Clinical relevance: In patients with a 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk below 10%, maintaining a low on-treatment blood pressure would be safe provided that the diastolic blood pressure remained above 60 mmHg.
Future direction: Clinical trials comparing blood pressure control strategies with multiple control targets in patients with low cardiovascular risk
Consideration for the Asian population: Considering that the harm of low blood pressure is often attributed to reduced coronary artery flow, the Asian population, which predominantly experiences stroke as a major cardiovascular event, might exhibit a better tolerance to lower blood pressure levels than other populations.

### Clinic, home, and kiosk blood pressure measurements for diagnosing hypertension: a randomized diagnostic study [^115vNgjn]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was participant's mean systolic BP for assigned diagnostic method using all available BP data. Mean diastolic BP and diagnostic accuracy were secondary outcomes. Daytime ABPM was defined as the mean of BPs collected 7AM-11PM. Nighttime plus daytime measurements were used for secondary outcomes of mean 24-h and mean nighttime ABPM. Adverse events potentially related to study participation were reported using the question: "Since your last research visit, have you experienced any new or serious health concerns?" BP outcomes at 6 months included receipt of a new hypertension diagnosis in the EHR (based on new ICD-10 code I-11, I-12, or 1–13). Prespecified subgroup comparisons were based on potential to influence diagnostic performance: baseline systolic BP (< 150 mmHg vs. ≥ 150); age (< 60 vs. ≥ 60 years); arm size (< 33 vs. ≥ 33 cm); body mass index (BMI as kg/m; < 30 vs. ≥ 30); cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk; and race.

Sample Size

With a sample size of 510 (170 per group) and assuming an outcome ascertainment rate of at least 80%, we could detect a 4.1-mmHg difference in systolic and a 2.8-mmHg difference in diastolic BP between any two groups (assuming standard deviation 12.1 mmHg systolic and 8.3 mmHg diastolic). BP differences and standard deviation were based on prior studies comparing clinic, home, and kiosk BP to ABPM.

Hypertension targets and outcomes in adults aged 60 years or older — evidence revisions report that among patients with a baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 160 mm Hg or greater who achieved a target SBP of less than 150 mm Hg, all-cause mortality reduction did not quite reach statistical significance (RR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.85 to 1.00]; ARR, 1.13), while high-quality evidence showed reductions in stroke (RR, 0.77 [CI, 0.64 to 0.91]; ARR, 0.92) and cardiac events (RR, 0.83 [CI, 0.71 to 0.96]; ARR, 0.72). In studies with lower SBP targets (< 140 mm Hg), low-quality evidence showed no statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality (RR, 0.93 [CI, 0.75 to 1.14]; ARR, 0.21), cardiac events (RR, 0.91 [CI, 0.77 to 1.04]; ARR, 0.35), or stroke (RR, 0.88 [CI, 0.64 to 1.01]; ARR, 0.19) compared with higher BP targets, and many studies did not achieve the targeted BP with little difference between intensive treatment and control groups. In the figure, the benefits statements read that "Incidence of stroke and cardiac events were reduced with treatment to < 150 mm Hg" and "Treating to 140 mm Hg did not have additional benefit".

### Diastolic hypotension due to intensive blood pressure therapy: is it harmful? [^111qRWU6]. Atherosclerosis (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Reducing the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) below a certain threshold may lead to inadequate organ perfusion. This raises some concerns, because pharmacotherapy reduces both systolic and diastolic pressure. We aimed to investigate whether a pathway from intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) treatment influences cardiovascular outcomes by inducing too low DBP.

Methods

We had access to data from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) including 9361 patients with a SBP of 130 mmHg or higher and an increased cardiovascular risk. In a formal mediation analysis, we investigated whether the effect of intense (target SBP: 120 mm Hg) vs. standard (target SBP: 140 mmHg) intervention on a composite endpoint would be mediated through an indirect, potentially harmful, effect through low DBP (< 60 mmHg).

Results

Adjusting for treatment, we find that low DBP per se is associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes (HR 1.90 (95% CI [1.46, 2.47]). However, in a formal mediation analyses, we observed that the unadjusted indirect effect of intensive blood pressure treatment going through low DBP of HR 1.12 (95% CI [1.06, 1.18]) attenuates to a statistically non-significant effect of HR 1.04 (95% CI [0.98, 1.10]) after adjustment for important covariates, suggesting that the mere association is considerably confounded.

Conclusions

The increased risk in subjects with diastolic pressure below 60 cannot fully be explained by the intensive treatment itself, but may be due to other measured factors. More generally, this analysis shows that adjusting for mediator-outcome confounding is essential, even in RCTs.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: a World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^114Gufds]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Prevailing concepts about BP have changed dramatically over time. Results of the Framingham Heart Study and many other cohort studies have shifted the emphasis from DBP to SBP by demonstrating that SBP was a more important predictor of CVD risk compared with DBP. In addition, almost all the recent landmark clinical trials have employed SBP rather than DBP as an inclusion criterion and for the trial BP treatment goals. Current US guidelines recommend an intensive BP target of < 130/80 mm Hg without mentioning the lower limits of diastolic BP. A recent cohort study found that lowering diastolic BP to < 60 mm Hg was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with high cardiovascular risk and a treated SBP < 130 mm Hg. The finding that a diastolic BP value between 70- and 80-mm Hg was an optimum target for this patient population merits further study, the results in this DBP group should be interpreted with caution, and these results may not apply to the general population. Since most recent clinical trials/studies use the SBP to initiate treatment as well as a treatment goal therefore the GDG felt it was appropriate to use SBP in the recommendation.

Intensive treatment for selected patients adds complexity for health workers; emphasis on team-based care in low-resource settings means that simple, protocolized care is needed. Intensive treatment for some patients complicates treatment protocols and may lead to decisional overload, especially for health workers with more limited training and/or autonomy. On the other hand, strict BP targets in the general population with hypertension are likely to be less acceptable to stakeholders. Most available evidence is derived from high-risk patients receiving intensive treatment and not the general population living with hypertension. Treating BP will reduce health inequity because preventing CV events reduces mortality across the population. Uncontrolled hypertension might be over-represented in vulnerable populations. Therefore, improvement of hypertension treatment and control through better treatment and a lower BP target could reduce long-standing inequality. The goal of the guideline is to facilitate uptake of a standard approach to the pharmacological treatment and management of hypertension which, in turn, will increase the hypertension control rate world-wide. However, several research gaps were identified by the GDG according to the theme of the PICOs (Figure 4). These gaps are summarized as follows:

Regarding medical management for hypertension, more specifically with respect to goals of treatment, BP targets, elderly, AAFP/ACP 2017 guidelines recommend to consider initiating or intensifying pharmacologic treatment to achieve a target SBP of < 140 mmHg with the goal of reducing the risk for stroke or cardiac event in selected ≥ 60 years old patients at high cardiovascular risk, based on individualized assessment.

ESC/ESH 2018 hypertension — blood pressure targets: In patients (≥ 65 years), SBP should be targeted to between 130 and 140 mmHg and diastolic BP (DBP) to < 80 mmHg, and treated SBP should not be targeted to < 120 mmHg. The guideline specifies a target range because the lower safety boundary assumes greater importance when BP is targeted to lower levels, and when SBP is lowered to < 120 mmHg in patients included in randomized controlled trials (older and higher-risk patients with comorbidities and cardiovascular disease), the risk of harm appears to increase and outweigh the benefits.

The Effect of systolic and diastolic blood pressure on cardiovascular outcomes

High SBP and DBP associate with increased CV events. However, it remained unclear whether either SBP or DBP carries more prognostic information. This question was addressed in a study, which evaluated data from an integrated health care delivery system in the US. Between 2007 and 2016, more than 36 million office BP measurements were analyzed from around 1.3 million people. The study confirmed that both SBP and DBP increased the risk of CV events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. A continuous burden of SBP (≥ 140 mmHg; hazard ratio (HR) per unit increase in z score, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.17 to 1.18) and DBP (≥ 90 mmHg; HR per unit increase in z score, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.07) independently predicted the composite outcome. A J-curve relationship between DBP and the composite outcome was detected. Elevated SBP had a greater prognostic effect on stroke and myocardial infarction (Fig. 1). However, DBP influenced the prognosis independently of SBP.

The relationship between systolic blood pressure (solid line) and diastolic blood pressure (dashed line) z scores and the risk of the composite outcome among participants with systolic blood pressure > 133 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 78 mmHg are shown.

The 2017 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association Guidelines on the management of hypertension revised the definition of hypertension, which has been defined as > 130/ > 80 mmHg. Contrary, in the 2018 European Guidelines, the definition remained unchanged (> 140/ > 90 mmHg). Against this background, the prevalence of hypertension according to the different definition criteria were analyzed. The prevalence of hypertension increased from 18.9% with a threshold of > 140/90 mmHg to 43.5% with > 130/80 mmHg. An SBP of > 130 mmHg was present in almost 50% of the participants over the age of 60 years (Fig. 2).

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of angiotensin receptor blockers for primary hypertension [^116BzPa5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely prescribed for hypertension so it is essential to determine and compare their effects on blood pressure (BP), heart rate and withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAE).

Objectives

To quantify the dose-related systolic and/or diastolic BP lowering efficacy of ARBs versus placebo in the treatment of primary hypertension.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2007), EMBASE (1988 to February 2007) and reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Double-blind, randomized, controlled trials evaluating the BP lowering efficacy of fixed-dose monotherapy with an ARB compared with placebo for a duration of 3 to 12 weeks in patients with primary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. WDAE information was collected from the trials.

Main Results

Forty six RCTs evaluated the dose-related trough BP lowering efficacy of 9 ARBs in 13 451 participants with a baseline BP of 156/101 mm Hg. The data do not suggest that any one ARB is better or worse at lowering BP. A dose of 1/8 or 1/4 of the manufacturers' maximum recommended daily dose (Max) achieved a BP lowering effect that was 60 to 70% of the BP lowering effect of Max. A dose of 1/2 Max achieved a BP lowering effect that was 80% of Max. ARB doses above Max did not significantly lower BP more than Max. Due to evidence of publication bias, the largest trials provide the best estimate of the trough BP lowering efficacy for ARBs as a class of drugs: -8 mm Hg for SBP and -5 mm Hg for DBP. ARBs reduced BP measured 1 to 12 hours after the dose by about 12/7 mm Hg.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence from this review suggests that there are no clinically meaningful BP lowering differences between available ARBs. The BP lowering effect of ARBs is modest and similar to ACE inhibitors as a class; the magnitude of average trough BP lowering for ARBs at maximum recommended doses and above is -8/-5 mmHg. Furthermore, 60 to 70% of this trough BP lowering effect occurs with recommended starting doses. The review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with ARBs because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in many of the trials.

### Gestational-age-specific reference intervals for blood pressure in normal pregnancy in a Southern Chinese population [^115pCni8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) collectively account for 14% of all maternal deaths worldwide. Due to the ascending trend in the prevalence of HDP, it is currently considered one of the major pregnancy health concerns. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has retained a definition of blood pressure greater than or equal to 140 / 90 mm Hg for hypertension in pregnancy. However, this definition is derived from hypertensive guidelines for nonpregnant individuals and is currently used as a screening tool for preeclampsia (PE). Several studies have reported a dose - response relationship between increased blood pressure (lower than 140 / 90 mm Hg) and adverse pregnancy outcomes across gestational age. These findings provide potential support for the redefinition of hypertension in pregnancy. Close antenatal care and proper intervention may reduce hypertension and preeclampsia - related morbidity and mortality.

Additionally, the literature on maternal hypotension is scarce, and inconsistent definitions for hypotension are used. Previous studies were based on arbitrary definitions of hypotension focusing on either the systolic blood pressure (SBP), the diastolic blood pressure (DBP), readings for both SBP and DBP, or a specific BP reading (e.g.110 / 70 mm Hg). Pregnant women with borderline DBP (60 to 70 mm Hg) were exposed to a greater risk of stillbirth relative to normotensive pregnancies. Furthermore, low risk nulliparous women with persistent maternal hypotension were found to be at an increased risk of delivering small-for-gestational age neonates. However, the BP reference ranges for normal pregnancies in Southern China remain unclear.

The aim of this study was to investigate the BP trajectories of uncomplicated pregnant women across gestation in a large retrospective population using a multilevel cubic spline model. Improving the understanding of the normal BP trajectory in pregnancy may promote appropriate prevention and intervention strategies for HDP and hypotension, thus improving maternal and fetal outcomes.

### Evaluation of optimal diastolic blood pressure range among adults with treated systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg [^116eU2g3]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we found that an achieved DBP value of less than 60 mm Hg was associated with significantly increased risk of the primary outcome, the composite cardiovascular outcome, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke in a population with a guideline-recommended SBP target of less than 130 mm Hg. The nominally lowest risk was observed at an achieved DBP value of between 70 and 80 mm Hg for the primary outcome, the composite cardiovascular outcome (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke), nonfatal myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death in this population.

Mainly driven by the results of SPRINT study, the 2017 AHA guidelines recommend an intensive BP target of less than 130/80 mm Hg without mentioning the lower limit of DBP. However, aggressively lowering SBP could result in a substantial reduction of DBP, counteracting the benefits of lowering SBP. Secondary analyses of SPRINT data showed that an excessively low achieved DBP was associated with a 25% increase in cardiovascular risk and even greater risk among patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease. The linear association between DBP and outcomes reported in a previous meta-analysis was only observed at a DBP value of greater than 75 mm Hg, which might not have been low enough to observe the diastolic J-shape phenomenon. A post hoc analysis of the SPRINT study reported that even in the lowest DBP quintile (ie, < 68 mm Hg), intensive BP lowering was associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular events (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.57–1.07) and all-cause death (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.60–1.29). However, the lowest quintile in the post hoc analysis of SPRINT may not have been low enough to reveal the potential hazardous effect, given that only 39.0% of patients achieved an treated DBP of less than 60 mm Hg in the lowest DBP quintile (ie, < 68 mm Hg) in SPRINT (eTable 5 in the Supplement). When we further analyzed the association of intensive BP lowering in the subgroup with baseline DBPs of less than 60 mm Hg — a group in which more than 59.0% of patients achieved treated DBPs of less than 60 mm Hg — a nonsignificant increase in all-cause and cardiovascular death was observed in patients from both the SPRINT and ACCORD-BP trials. Although no interaction between intensive BP lowering and baseline DBP was observed, the results still forced us to reflect on whether the potential additional benefits could counteract potential risks in intensively lowering DBP to less than 60 mm Hg. What if SBP has already reached the target level? Using integrated data from SPRINT and ACCORD-BP, we found that compared with lowering DBP to 70 to 80 mm Hg, lowering DBP to less than 60 mm Hg was associated with a 46% increased cardiovascular risk in patients who achieved an SBP of less than 130 mm Hg, suggesting the existence of diastolic J-shape phenomenon even when SBP reaches the target level.

### Association of blood pressure lowering with mortality and cardiovascular disease across blood pressure levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1166Bgts]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

High blood pressure (BP) is the most important risk factor for death and cardiovascular disease (CVD) worldwide. The optimal cutoff for treatment of high BP is debated.

Objective

To assess the association between BP lowering treatment and death and CVD at different BP levels.

Data Sources

Previous systematic reviews were identified from PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effect. Reference lists of these reviews were searched for randomized clinical trials. Randomized clinical trials published after November 1, 2015, were also searched for in PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials during February 2017.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials with at least 1000 patient-years of follow-up, comparing BP-lowering drugs vs placebo or different BP goals were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were extracted from original publications. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaborations assessment tool. Relative risks (RRs) were pooled in random-effects meta-analyses with Knapp-Hartung modification. Results are reported according to PRISMA guidelines.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Prespecified outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, major cardiovascular events, coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, heart failure, and end-stage renal disease.

Results

Seventy-four unique trials, representing 306 273 unique participants (39.9% women and 60.1% men; mean age, 63.6 years) and 1.2 million person-years, were included in the meta-analyses. In primary prevention, the association of BP-lowering treatment with major cardiovascular events was dependent on baseline systolic BP (SBP). In trials with baseline SBP 160 mm Hg or above, treatment was associated with reduced risk for death (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87–1.00) and a substantial reduction of major cardiovascular events (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.70–0.87). If baseline SBP ranged from 140 to 159 mm Hg, the association of treatment with mortality was similar (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75–1.00), but the association with major cardiovascular events was less pronounced (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80–0.96). In trials with baseline SBP below 140 mm Hg, treatment was not associated with mortality (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.90–1.06) and major cardiovascular events (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.90–1.04). In trials including people with previous CHD and mean baseline SBP of 138 mm Hg, treatment was associated with reduced risk for major cardiovascular events (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84–0.97), but was not associated with survival (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.89–1.07).

Conclusions and Relevance

Primary preventive BP lowering is associated with reduced risk for death and CVD if baseline SBP is 140 mm Hg or higher. At lower BP levels, treatment is not associated with any benefit in primary prevention but might offer additional protection in patients with CHD.

Office blood pressure treatment targets in hypertensive patients — It is recommended that the first objective of treatment should be to lower BP to < 140/90 mmHg in all patients and that, if the treatment is well tolerated, treated BP values should be targeted to 130/80 mmHg or lower in most patients. In patients < 65 years receiving BP-lowering drugs, it is recommended that SBP should be lowered to a BP range of 120–129 mmHg in most patients. In older patients (aged ≥ 65 years) receiving BP-lowering drugs, it is recommended that SBP should be targeted to a BP range of 130–139 mmHg, with close monitoring of adverse effects. These BP targets are recommended for patients at any level of CV risk and in patients with and without established CVD. A DBP target of < 80 mmHg should be considered for all hypertensive patients, independent of the level of risk and comorbidities.

Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older — evidence review scope and methods: Adults aged 60 years or older with a diagnosis of hypertension were studied. The interventions evaluated included treatment to higher (< 150 mm Hg) versus lower (≤ 140 mm Hg) SBP targets, with the comparator being less intensive BP treatment. Evaluated outcomes included all-cause mortality; cardiac events (myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death); morbidity and mortality related to stroke; and harms such as falls, fractures, syncope, functional status, hypotension, acute kidney injury (defined as the doubling of serum creatinine or need for renal replacement therapy), medication burden, and withdrawal due to adverse events. Outcomes were assessed in the long-term (> 6 months) for KQs 1, 2, and 3 and any time frame for KQs 4 and 5. Controlled study designs (randomized, controlled trials and nonrandomized, controlled trials) and cohort studies were included, whereas case reports; case series; randomized, controlled trials with less than 6-month follow-up; and controlled before-after studies were excluded. The reviewers conducted a meta-analysis on study-level data using the random-effects model and also conducted individual-patient data meta-analysis; study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and evidence graded using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality system. Searches covered EMBASE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from database inception through January 2015, MEDLINE through September 2016, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify studies that were in progress or unpublished.

### Blood pressure at age 60–65 versus age 70–75 and vascular dementia: a population based observational study [^116s42rC]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension and dementia are common disorders in the elderly. Among people aged 60 years and over, the prevalence is estimated to be around 5 to 7% for dementia and over 50% for hypertension. Vascular dementia (VaD) caused by a variety of vascular diseases is one of the most common forms of dementia. There are several different sets of clinical diagnostic criteria for VaD, though each set tends to consist of a combination of history of ischemic stroke, temporal relationship between onset of dementia and stroke, and/or evidence of cerebrovascular disease. High blood pressure (BP), or hypertension, is the leading risk factor for stroke and many other vascular diseases. Thus, hypertension likely plays an important role in the development of VaD, though this association remains unclear.

The association between BP and dementia may be age dependent, with high BP at midlife (age 40–64 years) being associated with an increased risk for VaD. In contrast, there is no consensus on the association between BP and dementia in those aged 75 and above. A history of hypertension at age 75 or over is not consistently a risk factor for VaD, with some studies even reporting an inverse association between level of blood pressure and risk of VaD. Previous studies have been focused on the association of systolic and diastolic BP with dementia. Pulse pressure (PP) is the difference between the systolic and diastolic pressure readings, and is a measure of arterial stiffness. The pulsatile component of BP and high PP has been shown to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and total mortality. The association of PP with dementia remains unclear.

Electronic medical records (EMR) contain rich clinical information, in which more than 50% of patients have at least 2 blood pressure measurements. EMR also provides a population-based sample with the ability to follow patients for long periods of time. The objective of this study was to investigate the association of BP and PP levels in late midlife and late-life with the risk of vascular dementia using United Kingdom (UK) primary care data. We developed two separate study cohorts (aged 60–65 and aged 70–75) to elucidate whether there is an age-dependent relationship of blood pressure with VaD.

### Blood pressure targets for hypertension in older adults [^113ZCV8W]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Eight out of 10 major antihypertensive trials in older adults attempted to achieve a target systolic blood pressure (BP) less than 160 mmHg. Collectively these trials demonstrated benefit for treatment, as compared to no treatment, for an older adult with BP greater than 160 mmHg. However an even lower BP target of less than 140 mmHg is commonly applied to all age groups. At the present time it is not known whether a lower or higher BP target is associated with better cardiovascular outcomes in older adults.

Objectives

To assess the effects of a higher (less than 150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg) BP target compared to the lower BP target of less than 140/90 mmHg in hypertensive adults 65 years of age or older.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to February 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials, of at least one year's duration, conducted on hypertensive adults aged 65 years or older, which report the effect on mortality and morbidity of a higher systolic or diastolic BP treatment target (whether ambulatory, home, or office measurements) in the range of systolic BP less than 150 to 160 mmHg or diastolic BP less than 95 to 105 mmHg as compared to a lower BP treatment target of less than 140/90 mmHg or lower.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We combined data for dichotomous outcomes using the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and for continuous outcomes we used mean difference (MD). Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, institutionalisation, and cardiovascular serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, non-cardiovascular mortality, unplanned hospitalisation, each component of cardiovascular serious adverse events separately (including cerebrovascular disease, cardiac disease, vascular disease, and renal failure), total serious adverse events, total minor adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse effects, systolic BP achieved, and diastolic BP achieved.

Main Results

We found and included three unblinded randomised trials in 8221 older adults (mean age 74.8 years), in which higher BP targets of less than 150/90 mmHg (two trials) and less than 160/90 mmHg (one trial) were compared to a lower target of less than 140/90 mmHg. Treatment to the two different BP targets over two to four years failed to produce a difference in any of our primary outcomes, including all-cause mortality (RR 1.24 95% CI 0.99 to 1.54), stroke (RR 1.25 95% CI 0.94 to 1.67) and total cardiovascular serious adverse events (RR 1.19 95% CI 0.98 to 1.45). However, the 95% confidence intervals of these outcomes suggest the lower BP target is probably not worse, and might offer a clinically important benefit. We judged all comparisons to be based on low-quality evidence. Data on adverse effects were not available from all trials and not different, including total serious adverse events, total minor adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

At the present time there is insufficient evidence to know whether a higher BP target (less than150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg) or a lower BP target (less than 140/90 mmHg) is better for older adults with high BP. Additional good-quality trials assessing BP targets in this population are needed.

### Analysis of late risk of systemic blood pressures [^113QTVXC]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

We studied categories of blood pressure (BP) < 120/80 mm Hg as predictors of hypertension 10 to 22 years later by logistic regression analyses with 6 covariates. There was progressively increased risk for subjects with systolic BP 100 to 109 and 110 to 119 mm Hg (vs < 100 mm Hg) or diastolic BP 70 to 74 and 75 to 79 mm Hg (vs < 70 mm Hg). These relations were similar in men, women, and several ethnic groups but stronger in subjects < 40 years old. These data suggest a definition of optimal BP of < 100/70 mm Hg, similar to usual BP levels in children < 10 years old.

### Hemodynamic management of cardiogenic shock in the intensive care unit [^116RcFc5]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Arterial blood pressure and vasopressors

Arterial BP measurements are ubiquitous and may be the only parameter available to guide treatment (e.g.: during the 'Rescue' phase). There are no established arterial BP targets in CS. Mean arterial BP of 60–65 mm Hg, extrapolated from other types of circulatory shockis a pragmatic therapeutic target during the 'Rescue' phase. This target is also indirectly supported by the BOX trial(no significant difference in death/disability between mean BP target of 63 mm Hg vs 77 mm Hg in patients who had been resuscitated after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac cause).

However, hemodynamic targets are not static. Arterial BP target may need to be revised during 'Optimization' depending on clinical response and phenotype. A sub-study of the Milrinone as Compared with Dobutamine in the Treatment of Cardiogenic Shock trial suggested poorer outcomes in patients with 36-hour-averaged mean arterial BP < 70 mm Hg. The study by Burstein et al suggested that the sub-group of patients with HF-CS had better clinical outcomes with average mean arterial BP of > 70 mm Hg. In patients with AMI-CS and cardiac arrest, maintaining mean BP > 80 mm Hg was associated with less myocardial damage compared to mean BP target of > 65 mm Hg. It is plausible that higher BP, especially diastolic BP, improves coronary perfusion pressure (diastolic BP–end-diastolic pressure), which may be beneficial in CS complicated by elevated filling pressures. A higher mean arterial BP target of 65–70 mm Hg may be considered during 'Optimization', especially if clinical response is inadequate. Arterial BP should be considered in parallel with other hemodynamic parameters such as central venous pressure and cardiac index.

Norepinephrine is generally regarded as the first-line vasopressor. There is also increasing consensus on a catecholamine-sparing strategy (generally with the addition of vasopressin at 0.03–0.06 U/min)at norepinephrine doses of > 0.2 mcg/kg/min. High-dose vasopressor therapy in pursuit of higher arterial BP targets could worsen tissue perfusion, as exogenous vasoconstrictors overwhelm regional control of vascular tone, resulting in regional tissue hypoperfusion.

Blood pressure management — older adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) has been evaluated in ACCORD-BP, INVEST, ONTARGET, VADT, and meta-analyses with the following findings. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes — Blood Pressure (ACCORD-BP) compared intensive treatment with a target of < 120 mmHg systolic versus a goal of 140 mmHg and did not find statistically significant reductions in primary outcomes, myocardial infarction (MI), or all-cause mortality, but reported fewer strokes in the intensive arm with number needed to treat (NNT) 89 over 5 years and a troubling rate of serious adverse events. INVEST concluded that controlling blood pressure to less than 130/80 mmHg was not associated with better cardiovascular outcomes than usual control of 140 to 130 mmHg in individuals aged 55 and older (mean age 66 ± 6), and ONTARGET findings were similar except for the risk of stroke (mean age 66 ± 7 and 57% aged ≥ 65). A VADT analysis reported greater cardiovascular risks with systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or greater or diastolic blood pressure of less than 70 mmHg (average age 60 ± 9). Two meta-analyses found that intensive control (< 130 mmHg) did not show MI or mortality benefits compared with less than 140 mmHg; benefits were between lower blood pressure and risk of stroke, but this was in the setting of more serious adverse events.

### Hypertension [^1153xnL8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Recent guidelines on diagnosis and management of high blood pressure (BP) include substantial changes and several new concepts compared with previous guidelines. These are reviewed and their clinical implications are discussed in this article. The goal is to provide a practical reference to assist clinicians with up-to-date management of patients with high BP. Important issues include new diagnostic thresholds, out-of-office BP monitoring, intensified treatment goals, and a different approach to resistant hypertension. Finally, differences among guidelines, the persistent controversies that have led to them, and their implications for clinical practice are discussed.

Office BP Treatment Targets

Both the ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH recommend lower BP treatment targets compared with the goals advised in previous guidelines. The ACC/AHA recommends SBP/DBP < 130/80 mm Hg as a general treatment target, if tolerated (Tables 6–8). For older adults (≥ 65 years), who are noninstitutionalized, ambulatory, and community dwelling, the target is SBP < 130 mm Hg, if tolerated. For older adults with a high burden of comorbidity and limited life expectancy, treatment decisions should be based on clinical judgment, patient preference, and a team-based assessment of risk/benefit. The ESC/ESH recommends target ranges but recognizes that the optimal and tolerated targets for individuals will differ. The initial SBP/DBP target is < 140/90 mm Hg for all adults with hypertension. Provided the treatment is well tolerated, targeting to 130/80 mm Hg is recommended, with subsequent efforts to achieve a lower BP in those 18 to 65 years of age. An exception to the general rule is that the SBP target in adults with hypertension and CKD should be < 140 to 130 mm Hg. The ESC/ESH advises against specifically targeting SBP to < 120 mm Hg for adults, but acknowledges that this may be achieved in some treated patients without adverse effects. A key emphasis, especially in older and frailer patients, is to tailor the treatment to achieve the best BP possible within the target range, while monitoring for adverse effects. The optimal DBP target is defined as 70 to 79 mm Hg for all patients, but the emphasis is on controlling SBP, even when DBP is below these levels, provided the treatment is tolerated.

### Achieved systolic blood pressure in older people: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116LRR8Z]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In this review, we found there is suggestive evidence that achieving SBP levels 130 to < 140 mmHg is associated with reductions in the risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality without a subsequent increased risk of serious adverse events among subjects aged ≥ 60 years old. Therefore, we showed that the evidence favoring this level is stronger than experts' opinion. Nevertheless, future trials including a larger number of participants with different cardiovascular risk profiles and longer follow-up periods are required to confirm these findings, to clarify which cardiovascular events might be prevented when the level 130 to < 140 mmHg is achieved and to provide additional evidence regarding the < 130 and 140 to < 150 mmHg SBP levels.

### 2025 AHA / ACC / AANP / AAPA / ABC / ACCP / ACPM / AGS / AMA / ASPC / NMA / PCNA / SGIM guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation and management of high blood pressure in adults: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1134FGFD]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — For adults with high office BP, it is reasonable to exclude white-coat hypertension using out-of-office BP monitoring for adults with high office BP (ie, SBP/DBP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg), with the caveat that adults with office SBP/DBP ≥ 160/100 mm Hg should be promptly treated and antihypertensive medication dose titrated as necessary to control BP. For those initially identified with white-coat hypertension or masked hypertension, it is reasonable to conduct out-of-office BP monitoring to exclude sustained hypertension, and the frequency of follow-up monitoring is unclear as only a single visit was conducted at follow-up in these studies (ie, approximately 7 to 11 years after the baseline visit). In apparent resistant hypertension, out-of-office BP monitoring is a central component of the initial work-up and it is reasonable to exclude a white-coat effect using out-of-office BP monitoring. Compared with controlled hypertension, white-coat effect is not associated with an increased risk of CVD events and mortality, whereas masked hypertension and masked uncontrolled hypertension are associated with a higher risk of CVD events and mortality.

### J-curve revisited: an analysis of blood pressure and cardiovascular events in the treating to new targets (TNT) trial [^113dXZnm]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Aim

In patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), a J-curve relationship has been reported between blood pressure (BP) and future cardiovascular events. However, this is controversial. The purpose of the study was to determine the relationship between on-treatment BP and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CAD.

Methods and Results

We evaluated 10 001 patients with CAD and a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level < 130 mg/dL, randomized to atorvastatin 80 vs. 10 mg, enrolled in the TNT trial. The post-baseline, time-dependent BPs [systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)] were categorized into 10 mmHg increments. The primary outcome was a composite of death from coronary disease, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal or non-fatal stroke. Among the 10 001 patients, 982 (9.82%) experienced a primary outcome at 4.9 years (median) of follow-up. The relationship between SBP or DBP and primary outcome followed a J-curve with increased event rates above and below the reference BP range, both unadjusted and adjusted (for baseline covariates, treatment effect, and LDL levels). A time-dependent, non-linear, multivariate Cox proportional hazard model identified a nadir of 146.3/81.4 mmHg where the event rate was lowest. A similar non-linear relationship with a higher risk of events at lower pressures was found for most of the secondary outcomes of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal MI, or angina. However, for the outcome of stroke, lower was better for SBP.

Conclusion

In patients with CAD, a low BP (< 110–120/ < 60–70 mmHg) portends an increased risk of future cardiovascular events (except stroke).

### Mean-ing beyond office blood pressure [^117U4zK6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Since the discovery of blood pressure (BP) as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in the early 20th century, the vast majority of evidence linking BP with cardiovascular disease events has been based on office measurements of seated, rested BP. Moreover, trials in support of BP treatment to prevent cardiovascular disease invariably titrate therapies based on office BP measurements, collected via standardized protocols. However, there is substantial evidence that out‐of‐office BP measurements, via self‐monitored BP (at home) or ambulatory BP monitoring, are robust predictors of cardiovascular disease and may better classify risk than traditional office assessments. This has led to the recognition that using BP measures derived outside of the clinic setting as a target of therapy may result in better outcomes, by either initiating or intensifying treatment for patients who truly have hypertension or avoiding treatment among those who have low BP outside the clinic setting. However, in absence of direct trials, there have been persistent questions about how to interpret home BPs such that trial evidence pertaining to BP treatment goals in the office may be applied to out‐of‐office measurements.

Multiple studies have observed differences between home and office BPand these differences can differ across demographic groups, such as among older and younger adults, and at different BP values. Both the 2017 ACC/AHA/AAPA/ABC/ACPM/AGS/APhA/ASH/ASPC/NMA/PCNA Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Japanese Society of Hypertension 2019 guidelines provided BP thresholds for ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) and home BP monitoring (HBPM) using BP measured in the office setting as reference (Figure 1). Both guidelines suggest similar interpretations of BP in the normal range but increasingly different values at higher BP. There are several common approaches to establishing thresholds between measurements based on population distributions, regression models, and risk for cardiovascular outcomes. The outcomes‐based approach was the primary source of evidence used to inform the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines ABPM and HBPM threshold selection. However, there has been limited evidence evaluating these thresholds through direct comparison with regression models.

### Conventional versus automated measurement of blood pressure in primary care patients with systolic hypertension: randomised parallel design controlled trial [^116o8Vht]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Should manual office blood pressure measurement be abandoned?

The mercury sphygmomanometer has been synonymous with blood pressure measurement for more than 100 years. Regardless of advances in alternative techniques for recording blood pressure, mercury seems destined to disappear from the workplace because of environmental concerns. Mercury is prohibited in at least two countries, and a recent report from the European Union suggests that a more widespread ban is imminent. The standard device for measuring blood pressure thus needs to be replaced, but the unknown factor is what comes next. Studies on white coat hypertension have identified a subset of about 25% of the hypertensive population who have clinically important increases in blood pressure when readings are taken in the treatment setting, especially by physicians. Even automated devices such as the BpTRU provoke a white coat response; readings are similar to manual office blood pressure if the observer remains present in the room when the reading is taken.

Studies comparing manual with automated office blood pressure have clearly shown that the increase in blood pressure associated with conventional manual office measurement can be eliminated if the three basic tenets of automated office blood pressure are followed: the patient rests alone in a quiet room, and multiple readings are taken with a fully automated device. The simple presence of an observer seems to increase blood pressure, as marked decreases in automated office blood pressure are evident within two minutes of the observer leaving the room, as seen in CAMBO and in a previous study.

The number of automated office blood pressure readings needed for the mean value to be equivalent to the awake ambulatory blood pressure depends on whether the patient rests before the first reading is taken. If current guidelines for manual office blood pressure are followed and the patient is allowed to rest for at least five minutes, only two or three readings may be needed. However, when five readings are taken at one minute intervals with devices such as the BpTRU, no antecedent period of rest is needed and mean readings are still equivalent to the awake ambulatory blood pressure. Also, readings obtained with the BpTRU are similar when taken at one or two minute intervals.

### Debate on the 2025 guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults: emphasis on defense against the BP threshold and why we may not get there easily [^114J7Li3]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated blood pressure (BP) is the most important noncommunicable disorder worldwide. Finding and effectively managing elevated BP is the single greatest public health benefit we can accomplish, as it will reduce premature death and enable patients to live longer free of the disabilities that target organ damage inflicts on the brain, heart, kidneys, and legs. Hypertension guidelines are an invaluable source of information on how to detect elevated BP, how to evaluate people for situations where hypertension is a symptom of other disorders, and how to apply the various treatments that lower BP effectively in patients. Determining the point at which treating high BP is more likely to result in benefit than harm is a marriage of science and art. There is no right answer to what clearly constitutes hypertension when using a systolic or diastolic BP to define it. The science shows the mathematics behind the reduction of BP and the number of lives saved and target organs preserved. The art comes into play when a decision is made that, when a systolic or diastolic BP exceeds a certain level, it becomes reasonable to intervene at that point with treatment. Caregivers play an important role in monitoring and educating patients with hypertension-especially in the detection of unintended effects of treatment, such as excessive BP lowering, symptomatic hypotension, and impacts on laboratory tests and well-being. Nonadherence to prescribed therapies is a barrier to effectively managing chronic disorders like hypertension. Having a solid foundation in the science behind the guidelines and recognizing that the application of guidelines requires some clinical judgment gleaned from balancing the risks and benefits of treatment in each individual patient, is the basis for healthy exchanges of ideas, like this pro and con series which discusses the science and furthers the art. This review has taken the con side of several issues in the latest American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2025 Hypertension Guidelines.

### Blood pressure trajectories in the 20 years before death [^115vpwhB]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

There is mixed evidence that blood pressure (BP) stabilizes or decreases in later life. It is also unclear whether BP trajectories reflect advancing age, proximity to end of life, or selective survival of persons free from hypertension.

Objective

To estimate individual patient BP for each of the 20 years before death and identify potential mechanisms that may explain trajectories.

Design, Study, and Participants

We analyzed population-based Clinical Practice Research Datalink primary care and linked hospitalization electronic medical records from the United Kingdom, using retrospective cohort approaches with generalized linear mixed-effects modeling. Participants were all available individuals with BP measures over 20 years, yielding 46 634 participants dying aged at least 60 years, from 2010 to 2014. We also compared BP slopes from 10 to 3 years before death for 20 207 participants who died, plus 20 207 birth-year and sex-matched participants surviving longer than 9 years.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Clinically recorded individual patient repeated systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP).

Results

In 46 634 participants (51.7% female; mean [SD] age at death, 82.4 [9.0] years), SBPs and DBPs peaked 18 to 14 years before death and then decreased progressively. Mean changes in SBP from peak values ranged from -8.5 mm Hg (95% CI, -9.4 to -7.7) for those dying aged 60 to 69 years to -22.0 mm Hg (95% CI, -22.6 to -21.4) for those dying at 90 years or older; overall, 64.0% of individuals had SBP changes of greater than -10 mm Hg. Decreases in BP appeared linear from 10 to 3 years before death, with steeper decreases in the last 2 years of life. Decreases in SBP from 10 to 3 years before death were present in individuals not treated with antihypertensive medications, but mean yearly changes were steepest in patients with hypertension (-1.58; 95% CI, -1.56 to -1.60 mm Hg vs -0.70; 95% CI, -0.65 to -0.76 mm Hg), dementia (-1.81; 95% CI, -1.77 to -1.87 mm Hg vs -1.41; 95% CI, -1.38 to -1.43 mm Hg), heart failure (-1.66; 95% CI, -1.62 to -1.69 mm Hg vs -1.37; 95% CI, -1.34 to -1.39 mm Hg), and late-life weight loss.

Conclusions and Relevance

Mean SBP and DBP decreased for more than a decade before death in patients dying at 60 years and older. These BP decreases are not simply attributable to age, treatment of hypertension, or better survival without hypertension. Late-life BP decreases may have implications for risk estimation, treatment monitoring, and trial design.

### Effects of blood pressure lowering on outcome incidence in hypertension: 2. effects at different baseline and achieved blood pressure levels – overview and meta-analyses of randomized trials [^113FqzEG]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Relevant clinical questions not approached by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of blood pressure (BP)-lowering treatment can be explored by meta-analyses stratified by clinical criteria.

Objectives

Investigating whether all grades of hypertension benefit from BP-lowering treatment and which are the target BP levels to maximize outcome reduction.

Methods

Of the 68 RCTs of intentional and nonintentional BP-lowering, those without baseline antihypertensive drugs were stratified by the average baseline SBP and DBP (hypertension grades 1, 2, and 3). RCTs with or without baseline treatment were considered for investigating the effects of mean achieved SBP/DBP across three SBP cutoffs and two DBP cutoffs. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) (random-effects model), standardized to 10/5mmHg SBP/DBP reduction, and absolute risk reductions of seven fatal and nonfatal outcomes were calculated. Differences between relative and absolute risk reductions in the different strata of baseline or achieved SBP/DBP were evaluated by trend or heterogeneity analyses.

Results

In 32 RCTs (104,359 individuals), significant outcome reductions were found independently of the hypertension grade, with no trend toward risk ratio changes with increasing baseline BP. A secondary analysis limited to RCTs on grade 1 hypertension at low-to-moderate risk showed significant outcome reductions [risk ratio: stroke 0.33 (0.11–0.98), coronary events 0.68 (0.48–0.95), and death 0.53 (0.35–0.80)]. In 32 RCTs (128,232 individuals), relative and absolute outcome reductions were significant for the SBP differences across 150 and 140mmHg cutoffs. Below 130mmHg, only stroke and all-cause death were significantly reduced. Absolute outcome reduction showed a significant trend to decrease, the lower the SBP cutoff considered. In 29 RCTs (107,665 individuals), outcomes were significantly reduced across DBP cutoffs of 90 and 80mmHg. After excluding RCTs with baseline DBP less than 90mmHg, only stroke reduction was significant at achieved DBP less than 80mmHg.

Conclusion

Meta-analyses favor BP-lowering treatment even in grade 1 hypertension at low-to-moderate risk, and lowering SBP/DBP to less than 140/90mmHg. Achieving less than 130/80mmHg appears safe, but only adds further reduction in stroke.

### What should be the target blood pressure in elderly patients with diabetes? [^115dsv7w]. Diabetes Care (2016). Low credibility.

Hypertension is very common in elderly subjects with type 2 diabetes. The coexistence of hypertension and diabetes can be devastating to the cardiovascular system, and in these patients, tight blood pressure (BP) control is particularly beneficial. Little information is available regarding the target BP levels in elderly hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, and therefore extrapolation from data in the general population should be done. However, it is difficult to extrapolate from the general population to these frail individuals, who usually have isolated systolic hypertension, comorbidities, organ damage, cardiovascular disease, and renal failure and have a high rate of orthostatic and postprandial hypotension. On the basis of the available evidence, we provide arguments supporting the individualized approach in these patients. Target BP should be based on concomitant diseases, orthostatic BP changes, and the general condition of the patients. It is recommended to lower BP in the elderly patient with diabetes to < 140–150/90 mmHg, providing the patient is in good condition. In patients with isolated systolic hypertension, the same target is reasonable providing the diastolic BP is > 60 mmHg. In patients with coronary artery disease and in patients with orthostatic hypotension, excessive BP lowering should be avoided. In elderly hypertensive patients with diabetes, BP levels should be monitored closely in the sitting and the standing position, and the treatment should be tailored to prevent excessive fall in BP.

Commentary and clinical utility of intensive BP targets — Postural hypotension is a common limiting condition for intensive control of BP to < 120/70 mm Hg, and the guideline emphasizes that the goal of < 120/70 mm Hg is only appropriate with oscillometric BP measured according to AHA protocols. The AHA/ACC and ADA recommend a BP goal of < 130/80 mm Hg, and home BP monitoring is an alternative if clinic BP is not standardized and to avoid overtreating "white coat" hypertension.

### Relation between blood pressure and vascular events and mortality in patients with manifest vascular disease: J-curve revisited [^111N3DAR]. Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Recent studies have challenged the notion that "lower is better" for blood pressure in relation to vascular events and mortality in patients with vascular disease, whereas practice guidelines currently recommend to lower blood pressure to < 130/80 mm Hg. We reassessed this J-curved relationship between blood pressure and cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in patients with various manifestations of vascular disease. For this purpose, 5788 patients with symptomatic vascular disease enrolled in the Secondary Manifestations of Arterial Disease Study were followed-up for the occurrence of new vascular events (ie, myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death) and all-cause mortality. During a median of 5.0 years (interquartile range: 2.6–8.1 years), 788 patients experienced a new vascular event, and 779 died. Overall, the covariate-adjusted relationship between mean baseline systolic, diastolic, or pulse pressure and the occurrence of vascular events followed a J-curve with increased event rates above and below the nadir blood pressure of 143/82 mm Hg. A similar nonlinear relationship was found for diastolic pressure and all-cause mortality. Elevated blood pressure was not associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with recently diagnosed coronary artery disease, ≥ 65 years, and having > 60 mm Hg pulse pressure. Importantly, especially in these subgroups, low blood pressure could also be a symptom rather than a cause of disease. Blood pressure level below and above 143/82 mm Hg is, thus, an independent risk factor for recurrent events in patients with manifest vascular disease. Uncertainty of whether this association is causal provides a strong rationale for trials evaluating blood pressure treatment targets.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112UCx31]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Office blood pressure protocol — validated oscillometric devices, averaging rules, and training standards are emphasized. Only oscillometric devices that were validated with a rigorous standardized protocol with BP measurement using a reference standard are recommended for use (termed validated devices), and in published papers, AOBP is typically measured without a clinician present. Further, because individual BP measurements may vary in an unpredictable or random manner, a single reading is inadequate for clinical decision-making; office BP should be based on the average of available readings, and an average of ≥ 2 BP measurements obtained on ≥ 2 separate occasions may minimize error and provide a more accurate estimation of office BP. Regardless of the office BP measurement approach, clinicians and staff should have initial and ongoing training, including competency checks ideally every 6 to 12 months to maintain best practices for measuring BP, and the use of a BP device validated against a reference standard with an appropriately sized cuff is paramount for accurate BP measurement (see https://www.validatebp.org).

### Pharmacologic treatment of hypertension in adults aged 60 years or older to higher versus lower blood pressure targets: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians [^117XLx38]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Areas of inconclusive evidence and multimorbidity — no trials assessed the relationship between individual comorbidities and the benefits and harms of treating to different blood pressure (BP) targets, and evidence was insufficient for targeting treatment according to diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Individual assessment is particularly important in adults aged 60 years or older with multiple chronic conditions, several medications, or frailty; they are more likely to be susceptible to serious harm from higher rates of syncope and hypotension, and the absolute benefits of more aggressive BP treatment in elderly persons, those with multimorbidity, or those who are frail are not well-known. Few trials compared patients with and without diabetes, and whether the difference in results between SPRINT and ACCORD was due to diabetes status is unclear, but the benefits observed with the lower targets achieved in SPRINT most closely apply to patient populations without diabetes; many studies also excluded patients with comorbidities or with dementia or diminished functional status.
