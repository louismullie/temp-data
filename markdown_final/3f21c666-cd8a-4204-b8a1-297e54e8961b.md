## Question

difference between PT and INR

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the difference between PT and INR, why INR was created, how it is calculated, and how each is used and limited clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition and physiology behind PT. Then, I should verify the rationale for INR standardization and the ISI concept. Next, I will review the INR formula and how MNPT and ISI are applied. After that, I need to assess clinical uses for warfarin monitoring, followed by key limitations such as DOACs, liver disease, and trauma. Finally, I will check device variability and summarize practical takeaways with cautions and quality considerations [^114USMrJ] [^111RtpwT] [^112Fp2To].

> Let me first confirm what PT actually measures: PT reports the time in seconds for clot formation after adding tissue factor and calcium to citrated plasma, essentially probing the extrinsic and common pathways and being sensitive to factors II, V, VII, and X, many of which are vitamin K–dependent; however, raw PT varies by reagent and instrument, so absolute values are not directly comparable across laboratories [^114USMrJ] [^1142xXX4].

> Wait, let me verify why INR was developed before I move on: because PT in seconds differed widely between thromboplastin reagents and coagulometers, the WHO standardization adopted the International Sensitivity Index (ISI) and a common framework so that anticoagulation intensity could be compared across sites, although even with standardization, some inter-laboratory and operator variability persists and requires harmonized methods and local calibration [^114USMrJ] [^114e5Fkj].

> I should confirm the math next: INR is not a separate assay but a calculated value from PT using INR = (patient PT / mean normal PT)^ISI, where the MNPT is the local normal plasma geometric mean and the ISI is reagent/instrument specific, both traceable to reference standards; small differences in reagent sensitivity can materially shift INR and thus clinical decisions, which is why understanding ISI and MNPT is essential [^114USMrJ] [^1139resK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about interchangeability: PT is a raw time in seconds and is not standardized, while INR is a dimensionless, standardized ratio designed to make results comparable across systems; in healthy individuals INR is usually near 1.0, whereas in warfarin therapy we use standardized INR targets rather than PT seconds to guide dosing because seconds are not portable across labs [^114USMrJ] [^111RtpwT].

> Next, I should review clinical use in warfarin therapy: INR is the accepted index for vitamin K antagonist monitoring, with most indications targeting INR 2.0–3.0 and the label cautioning that values above 4.0 add bleeding risk without added benefit; for major VKA-associated bleeding or urgent reversal prior to high-risk procedures, prothrombin complex concentrate plus IV vitamin K is recommended, and for supratherapeutic INR without bleeding, holding doses and adjusting maintenance is standard practice [^111RtpwT] [^115syHSH] [^116DBK2D] [^113F3oUj] [^113cfUPd].

> But wait, what if the patient is on a DOAC: I need to ensure we do not misapply PT/INR here because routine PT/INR is unreliable for dabigatran and variably responsive to rivaroxaban/apixaban; instead, use dilute thrombin time or ecarin-based assays for dabigatran and calibrated anti-Xa assays for Xa inhibitors when quantification is needed, acknowledging that standardized therapeutic ranges for DOAC assays are not established for routine care [^112Fp2To] [^113pprTM] [^1136kfi4].

> Let me think about liver disease now, because I should confirm that INR has a different meaning there: although INR is used within MELD for prognosis and transplant prioritization, it is a poor predictor of bleeding risk in cirrhosis due to rebalanced hemostasis; moreover, inter-reagent variability can alter MELD, leading to proposals for liver-specific calibrations (e.g. INR(liver) or modified INR) to improve comparability, so in cirrhosis an elevated INR should not be used in isolation to infer bleeding risk [^113Axzdh] [^1154dGHr] [^113exntH] [^111vLPxf] [^111bAwVJ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, technical sources of variability can still creep in: point-of-care INR devices can differ from laboratory values by clinically relevant margins due to differing reagents, calibration, and heparin effects, so periodic comparison with lab methods and participation in QA programs is prudent; also, preanalytical errors like underfilled citrate tubes can falsely elevate INR, so if a reported INR seems implausible, I should double-check sampling and retest [^114mcLLK] [^114gQLir] [^116oibRD] [^113Kunb7] [^112PSLLx].

> Next, I should review whether abnormal PT/INR always means factor deficiency in acute illness: in trauma, variability in INR and aPTT is not fully explained by coagulation factor levels, and discordant patterns reflect pathway-specific perturbations with complex phenotypes, underscoring that PT/INR is a limited snapshot and should be integrated with clinical context and other assays when diagnosing or managing coagulopathy [^112Y4fV4] [^113vpHVX].

> Hold on, I should verify the standardization caveats one more time: despite WHO anchoring of ISI and harmonized manual-tilt tube reference approaches, differences in thromboplastin composition and instrument platforms can still influence ISI and thus INR, which is why local calibration and awareness of reagent properties remain part of good laboratory practice [^114USMrJ] [^114BFknV] [^114e5Fkj] [^1142xXX4].

> Practical bottom line, let me summarize and check that nothing is missing: PT is the raw clotting time in seconds reflecting extrinsic/common pathways and varies by lab, whereas INR is a calculated, standardized derivative of PT built to normalize results for warfarin management; use INR to dose VKAs, do not rely on PT/INR to assess DOAC effect, interpret INR cautiously in liver disease and trauma, and always confirm unexpected results or critical decisions with appropriate assays, quality controls, and clinical context [^111RtpwT] [^112Fp2To] [^113Axzdh] [^114USMrJ].

---

PT is the **raw clotting time** in seconds, whereas INR is a **standardized ratio** [^114BFknV] that adjusts PT for reagent sensitivity, enabling consistent warfarin monitoring across laboratories [^112rg8jE]. Because PT varies by reagent and laboratory, the INR **uses the ISI** [^114USMrJ] to correct for this and guide safe dosing. Use PT for general coagulation screening and INR for warfarin management [^111RtpwT]; the INR is not reliable for DOACs [^112Fp2To] or in liver disease, where alternative tests are needed [^113Axzdh].

---

## Definition and measurement

### Prothrombin time (PT)

For prothrombin time (PT), **definition**: PT is the time (seconds) for plasma to clot after adding tissue factor and calcium, assessing the extrinsic and common pathways (factors I, II, V, VII, X) [^114BFknV]. For **measurement**, PT is a raw value that varies with the thromboplastin reagent and instrument, causing inter-laboratory variability [^114e5Fkj].

---

### International normalized ratio (INR)

INR is a **standardized ratio** that normalizes PT across laboratories by adjusting for reagent sensitivity (ISI) [^114USMrJ]. It is calculated as INR = (patient PT / mean normal PT)^ISI, where the ISI reflects reagent sensitivity to factor deficiencies [^1139resK]. This standardization enables consistent warfarin monitoring and dosing across laboratories [^111RtpwT].

---

## Clinical applications

### PT clinical applications

- **General coagulation screening**: PT screens for extrinsic/common pathway defects (e.g. vitamin K deficiency, liver disease, DIC) [^114BFknV] [^114oEurt].
- **Preoperative assessment**: PT helps assess bleeding risk before procedures [^114oEurt].
- **Liver function assessment**: PT reflects hepatic synthetic function, as clotting factors are made in the liver [^113ALfwN].

---

### INR clinical applications

The standard application is **warfarin monitoring**, guiding dosing to maintain therapeutic anticoagulation [^111RtpwT]. Reporting that is **standardized** allows consistent interpretation and dosing decisions across laboratories [^114e5Fkj].

---

## Clinical significance and interpretation

### PT clinical significance

- **Normal range**: Typically 11–13.5 seconds, but varies by lab and reagent.
- **Prolonged PT**: Indicates extrinsic/common pathway defects (e.g. vitamin K deficiency, liver disease, DIC) [^114BFknV].
- **Limitations**: PT variability limits comparability across labs [^114USMrJ].

---

### INR clinical significance

- **Normal range**: 0.8–1.2 in healthy individuals not on anticoagulation [^1139resK].
- **Therapeutic range**: Usually 2.0–3.0 for most warfarin indications; 2.5–3.5 for mechanical heart valves [^111RtpwT].
- **Elevated INR**: Indicates increased bleeding risk and may require dose adjustment or reversal [^113F3oUj].
- **Limitations**: INR is unreliable for DOACs and may not reflect bleeding risk in liver disease [^112Fp2To] [^113Axzdh].

## Factors influencing PT and INR

| **Factor** | **Influence on PT** | **Influence on INR** |
|-|-|-|
| Reagent sensitivity | Significant variability | Standardized by ISI |
| Laboratory methods | Significant variability | Standardized by ISI |
| Patient-specific factors (diet, drugs, liver function) | Significant variability | Significant variability |
| Anticoagulant therapy (warfarin) | Prolongs PT | Increases INR |
| Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) | Variable effect | Unreliable measurement |

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring PT or INR

PT testing is used for general coagulation screening, preoperative assessment, and liver function evaluation [^113ALfwN], whereas **INR testing** is used for warfarin monitoring, standardized anticoagulation management, and dosing adjustments [^111RtpwT].

---

## Limitations and challenges

PT limitations include **inter-laboratory variability** that limits comparability [^114USMrJ]. INR limitations include **unreliability for DOACs** [^112Fp2To] and may not reflect bleeding risk in liver disease [^113Axzdh].

---

PT is the **raw clotting time**, whereas **INR standardizes PT** for reagent sensitivity [^114BFknV] to enable consistent warfarin management [^111RtpwT]. Use PT for general screening and INR for warfarin dosing; the INR is not reliable for DOACs [^112Fp2To] or in liver disease, where alternative tests are needed [^113Axzdh].

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^112rg8jE]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The relevance of the INR for VKA-treated patients is profound. The INR is a standardized method for reporting results of the PT assay, which is sensitive to the coagulation factors prothrombin, tissue factor, and factors V, VII, and X. As these coagulation factors depend on vitamin K for synthesis, the INR reflects anticoagulation owing to warfarin. For a warfarin-anticoagulated patient, the INR can aid decision-making around the measures that may be needed to normalize coagulation activity and stop or stabilize bleeding.

Elevated INRs can arise from direct overdosing and interactions between warfarin and numerous other drugs or herbal remedies. These fluctuations may occur due to dietary vitamin K changes, intake of nutritional supplements, or as a consequence of alcohol abuse. Conditions such as hepatic or biliary disease, gastrointestinal illness, or sepsis can also increase the INR. In such situations, identifying the cause of the elevation is imperative to avoid repeated incidents and the resultant increased bleeding risk. In the event of a self-reported and/or unexplained elevation in INR, retesting in the ED can confirm the elevation and exclude erroneous results. However, errors in the ED, such as underfilling tubes when drawing blood for INR testing, can yield falsely elevated INR results due to excess levels of citrate in the test sample. These errors can be avoided through the use of the correct sample tubes and ensuring that they are adequately filled.

Finally, patients treated with warfarin to manage thrombosis or reduce therapeutic efficacy must be closely monitored to ensure optimal therapeutic outcomes.

### Micro-mechanical blood clot testing using smartphones [^1139resK]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

The PT/INR computation is performed by determining the time taken for particles to cease movement in the blood or plasma sample, calculated as \(PT = t_{end} - t_{start} \). INR levels are significant because they standardize PT values across various laboratories and testing methods, facilitating easier comparison.

INR is traditionally computed as follows: PT normal is the PT value corresponding to plasma samples in the normal PR range; ISI is the international sensitivity index, which compares the batch of tissue factor used with an international reference tissue factor; and α is a correction factor.

For plasma testing, a value of 16 seconds for PT normal was calculated as the average PT measurements from the system across 33 plasma samples within the normal INR range of 0.9–1.1. The ISI for the thromboplastin lot used was 1.23, with a correction factor α of 0.48 applied to normalize the calculated INR values for the system.

- **For coagulopathy evaluation**: PT normal was set to 16 seconds, similar to the initial plasma evaluation. The ISI for the thromboplastin lot was 1.31, and a correction factor of 0.2 was used.

- **For whole blood testing**: PT normal was set to 12 seconds, corresponding to an INR value of 1.0 on the commercial PT/INR test meter. The ISI for the thromboplastin lot used in these experiments was 1.31, with a correction factor α of -0.31.

### Coagulation in liver disease: A guide for the clinician [^113Axzdh]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

The human hemostasis system is complex and remains poorly understood despite decades of intense scientific study. Although patients with chronic liver disease exhibit multiple defects in routine coagulation laboratory studies, there is growing evidence that these patients are effectively "rebalanced" with regard to procoagulant and anticoagulant activity. Most of these patients remain in a tenuous but balanced state of hemostasis.

A major difficulty in assessing these patients is the absence of established laboratory tests that accurately reflect changes in both procoagulant and anticoagulant systems. Consequently, routine laboratory testing can be misleading to clinicians, potentially prompting inappropriate or risky therapies with little real benefit to the patient. The international normalized ratio is an example of such a misleading test. Although it is inextricably linked to prognosis and the severity of protein synthetic dysfunction in acute and chronic liver disease, it serves as a poor marker for bleeding risk and should not be used in isolation for this purpose.

- **Coagulation disorders**: These are critical in the management of frequent clinical scenarios such as esophageal variceal bleeding, invasive and percutaneous procedures, portal vein thrombosis, venous thromboembolism, and acute liver failure.

This article summarizes the pathophysiology of hemostasis in liver disease, describes the strengths and weaknesses of various laboratory tests for assessing these patients, and outlines the optimal management of hemostasis for some common clinical situations.

### INR comparison between the CoaguChek Pro PT(N) and a standard laboratory method [^114gQLir]. Thrombosis Research (2004). Low credibility.

The prothrombin time (PT), also called thromboplastin time ("Quick"), is usually measured using citrated plasma from venous blood. Recently, portable coagulation monitors have been developed that measure PT using non-anticoagulant capillary whole blood from a finger stick. In the present study, we compared the International Normalized Ratio (INR) of the standard laboratory method (INRven) with the newly developed reagent PT(N) for the CoaguChek Pro portable monitor (INRcap) in various patient groups: healthy individuals, patients with oral anticoagulation, and patients with a deficiency of coagulation factor V, factor VII, or factor X, respectively.

- **Methods**: One hundred and fifty-five patients were included in this prospective open comparison study. Capillary PT was measured with the portable coagulation monitor CoaguChek Pro using the new disposable cartridge PT(N), which contains rabbit brain thromboplastin. In contrast, PT was measured using citrated venous plasma and the reagent Innovin on the coagulation analyzer STA-R.

- **Results**: We found a correlation coefficient of 0.85 between capillary and venous INR values among the 100 patients with oral anticoagulation. The slope of the regression line was 1.4 and the y-intercept was -0.65. Agreement between both methods was 80% (95% CI: 72–88%), and the standard agreement was 85% (95% CI: 78–92%). Among the 30 healthy subjects, the individual differences between INRven and INRcap were 0 in 4 cases, 0.1 in 21 cases, and 0.2 in 5 cases.

- **Conclusion**: The new test cartridge PT(N) was found to be a valuable tool.

### Erlotinib [^1116U6dV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Hemorrhage in patients taking warfarin**: Severe and fatal hemorrhage associated with International Normalized Ratio (INR) elevations can occur when erlotinib and warfarin are administered concurrently. Regularly monitor prothrombin time and INR during erlotinib treatment in patients taking warfarin or other coumarin-derivative anticoagulants [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Drug Interactions (7)].

- **Embryo-fetal toxicity**: Based on animal data and its mechanism of action, erlotinib can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. When given during organogenesis, erlotinib administration resulted in embryo-fetal lethality and abortion in rabbits at exposures approximately 3 times the exposure at the recommended human daily dose of 150 mg. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy and for one month after the last dose of erlotinib [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) and (8.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].

### European stroke organisation guideline on reversal of oral anticoagulants in acute intracerebral haemorrhage [^116DBK2D]. European Stroke Journal (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for intracerebral hemorrhage, specifically in the management of VKA-induced coagulopathy, the ESO 2019 guidelines recommend administering prothrombin complex concentrate. This approach aims to decrease mortality and normalize INR in adult patients experiencing intracerebral hemorrhage during the use of VKAs with an INR above normal.

### Paving the way for establishing a reference measurement system for standardization of plasma prothrombin time: Harmonizing the manual tilt tube method [^114USMrJ]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). High credibility.

International normalized ratio (INR) is traceable to World Health Organization (WHO) International Standards for thromboplastins and must be used with a manual tilt tube technique (MTT) for prothrombin time (PT) determination. A significant component of the total variability of INR stems from the inadequate harmonization of MTT across WHO reference laboratories. This study aims to identify the origins of PT differences between operators using MTT and to develop a harmonized MTT.

Two workshops were conducted where WHO reference laboratory operators compared their PTs using MTT and identical equipment. In the second workshop, seven operators applied a harmonized MTT.

Differences were observed in tilting frequency and pipetting height of plasma in the test tube. Initially, tilting cycle times ranged from 1.1 to 2.7 seconds. The mean PT of normal plasma was 14.3 seconds when plasma was pipetted at the top of the tube, and 12.9 seconds when pipetted at the bottom. Employing the harmonized MTT for WHO International Standard rTF/16, the variation between operators was limited to 1.1 seconds in normal plasma and 1.3 seconds in patient plasma with an average INR of 3.0. The INR between‐operator coefficient of variation was 2.3%.

The application of a harmonized MTT in three reference laboratories led to a significant reduction in between‐operator variation of PT and INR. The harmonized MTT is proposed as a candidate reference method for standardization.

### Direct oral anticoagulant use: A practical guide to common clinical challenges [^113njy2S]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

There are no FDA-approved methods to monitor the anticoagulant effect of DOACs. Qualitative coagulation assays, such as activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, and prothrombin time, can be used as first-line tests if evaluation for medication compliance is clinically important. However, these tests are insufficient to assess the degree of anticoagulant effect as seen with INR for management of VKA therapy.

Quantitative measures exist, such as anti-factor Xa levels, plasma drug concentrations, dilute thrombin time, and ecarin thrombin time, to directly assess anticoagulation effects. However, quantitative tests do not have an established clinical role since standardized therapeutic ranges have not been established, and quantitative test results have not been correlated with clinical outcomes. Other general monitoring parameters include signs and symptoms of bleeding, complete blood count, and a comprehensive metabolic panel specifically evaluating liver function tests, albumin, total bilirubin, and serum creatinine. These monitoring parameters should be performed in all patients before initiation of a DOAC and routinely monitored 1 to 3 months after initiation, then every 6 to 12 months thereafter. More frequent follow-ups based on patient-specific characteristics are recommended in provider plans.

In addition to laboratory monitoring parameters, a comprehensive DOAC monitoring approach should include the following items assessed at each follow-up:

- **Health status**: Assess overall health status at regular intervals.
- **Adherence**: Ensure adherence to prescribed DOAC therapy.

### Quality assurance program for whole blood prothrombin time-international normalized ratio point-of-care monitors used for patient self-testing to control oral anticoagulation [^113Kunb7]. Thrombosis Research (2004). Low credibility.

Whole blood coagulation monitors are increasingly used for patient self-testing to control oral anticoagulation, but there are no comprehensive quality assurance (QA) programs to check their performance. We report on the experience with one of such programs applied in a field study where patients on prothrombin time (PT)-international normalized ratio (INR) self-testing were asked to bring their monitors to the anticoagulation clinic for checking. PT-INR testing was performed three times over 3 months with 14 patients' monitors and test strips on three recalcified QA plasmas by an experienced laboratory operator. Each patient was also asked to perform PT-INR self-testing (his/her own capillary blood), which was then compared to the laboratory PT-INR (plasma).

Overall, the comparison between the observed and the consensus PT-INR on QA plasmas was acceptable, with the majority of measurements lying within ± 15% or 20% of the consensus values. The comparison between the PT-INR self-testing and the laboratory method was also acceptable; overall, there was no statistically significant difference between the mean PT-INR values, and the majority of paired measurements were less than 15% or 20% apart.

In conclusion, our results show that the proposed QA scheme is feasible and may be implemented on a larger scale. Monitors should be recalled periodically to the clinic where they have been prescribed to the patient. During each visit, the clinic may check the monitors and patient self-testing performance as described. Such a comprehensive QA system would improve the monitoring of oral anticoagulation therapy.

### Reliability of international normalised ratios from two point of care test systems: Comparison with conventional methods [^114mcLLK]. BMJ (2003). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of two point of care test systems — CoaguChek Mini and TAS PT-NC (RapidPointCoag) — in displaying international normalised ratios (INRs).

- **Design**: INRs from the two systems were compared to a "true" INR obtained through conventional manual testing using the same blood sample.

- **Setting**: Research was conducted across 10 European Concerted Action on Anticoagulation centres.

- **Participants**: The study involved 600 patients undergoing long-term warfarin therapy.

- **Main outcome measures**: The main criterion was the comparability of results among the different methods.

- **Results**: On average, the mean displayed INR varied by 21.3% between the two point of care test systems. One system showed an INR that was 15.2% higher than the true INR, while the other system's INR was 7.1% lower. There was considerable variation in the percentage difference between the mean displayed INR and the true INR among individual centres for both systems.

- **Conclusions**: The study highlights the need for manufacturers to improve the international sensitivity index calibration of point of care test monitors. Additionally, there is a necessity for users to adopt better methods for quality control of individual instruments.

### Coagulometer international sensitivity index (ISI) derivation, a rapid method using the prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) line: a multicenter study [^114e5Fkj]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2012). Low credibility.

The original WHO procedure for prothrombin time (PT) standardization has been almost entirely abandoned due to the universal use of PT coagulometers. These coagulometers often yield different international normalized ratio (INR) results compared to the manual method, with variations between individual makes of instruments and even among instruments from the same manufacturer.

- **Method**: A simple procedure is required to derive local INR with coagulometers. The PT/INR Line method has recently been developed using five European Concerted Action on Anticoagulation (ECAA) certified plasmas to derive local INR. This procedure has been modified to derive a coagulometer PT/INR Line, providing International Sensitivity Index (ISI) and mean normal PT (MNPT) for coagulometers and yielding local INR. Results have been compared with conventional ISI calibrations at the same laboratories.

- **Results**: With human thromboplastins, the mean ISI by local calibration was 0.93 (range: 0.77–1.16). With the PT/INR Line, the mean coagulometer ISI was higher, for example, 0.99 (0.84–1.23). However, using the PT/INR Line derived MNPT, there was no difference in local INR. Between-centre INR variation of a certified validation plasma was reduced with human and bovine reagents after correction with local ISI calibrations and the PT/INR Line.

- **Conclusion**: The PT/INR Line-ISI, with its derived MNPT, is shown to provide reliable local INR with the 13 different reagent/coagulometer combinations at the 28 centres in this international study.

### Variability in international normalized ratio and activated partial thromboplastin time after injury are not explained by coagulation factor deficits [^112Y4fV4]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Conventional coagulation assays (CCAs), such as prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), detect clotting factor (CF) deficiencies in hematologic disorders. However, there is controversy about how these CCAs should be used to diagnose, treat, and monitor trauma-induced coagulopathy. The study's objectives were to determine whether CCA abnormalities reflect deficiencies of coagulation factor activity in the setting of severe injury.

- **Methods**: Patients without previous CF deficiency, within a prospective database at an ACS-verified Level I trauma center, had CF activity levels, PT/INR, aPTT, and fibrinogen levels measured upon emergency department arrival from 2014 to 2017. Linear regression assessed how CF activity explained the aPTT and PT/INR variation. Prolonged CCA values were set as INR greater than 1.3 and aPTT greater than 34 seconds. CF deficiency was defined as less than 30% activity, except for fibrinogen, which was defined as less than 150 mg/dL.

- **Results**: Sixty patients with a mean age of 35.8 (SD, 13.6) years and a median New Injury Severity Score of 32 (interquartile range, 12–43) were included. Of these, 53.3% sustained blunt injuries, 23.3% required massive transfusion, and mortality was 11.67%. Overall, 44.6% of the PT/INR variance and 49.5% of the aPTT variance remained unexplained by CF activity. Deficiencies of CFs were found as follows: common pathway, 25%; extrinsic pathway, 1.7%; and intrinsic pathway, 6.7%. The positive predictive value for CF deficiencies was 4.4% for the extrinsic pathway when PT/INR was greater than 1.3.

### Poor comparability of coagulation screening test with specific measurement in patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants: results from a multicenter/multiplatform study [^113pprTM]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

Prothrombin and partial thromboplastin time (PT/APTT) are used to measure direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). PT, APTT, and specific tests for DOACs were conducted on patients treated for atrial fibrillation. Normal PT/APTT results do not exclude DOAC activity, and their prolongation does not confirm DOAC action. Using PT or APTT to evaluate DOAC activity could lead to dangerous misinterpretations.

- **Background**: Prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) have been proposed to measure the effect of oral anti-activated factor X (FXa) or anti-activated FII drugs, respectively.

- **Aims**: To evaluate the relationships and responsiveness of PT and APTT versus direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) concentrations measured with specific coagulation tests performed on different platforms in four Italian anticoagulation clinics.

- **Methods**: Six hundred and thirty-five patients with atrial fibrillation participated in the study: 240 were receiving dabigatran, 264 were receiving rivaroxaban, and 131 were receiving apixaban. Blood samples were taken at trough and peak within the first month (15–25 days) of treatment. PT, APTT, diluted thrombin time (dTT) calibrated for dabigatran, and anti-FXa calibrated for rivaroxaban or apixaban were determined.

- **Results**: For dabigatran, the correlation between APTT and dTT ranged from r = 0.80 to r = 0.62. For rivaroxaban, the correlation between the anti-FXa assay and PT ranged from r = 0.91 to r = 0.73. For apixaban, the correlation between the anti-FXa assay and PT was lower than for the other two drugs (r = 0.81 to r = 0.54).

### Guideline on the management of bleeding in patients on antithrombotic agents [^113F3oUj]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for bleeding in patients on antithrombotic agents, particularly in cases of supratherapeutic INR without bleeding, the BSH 2013 guidelines recommend the following approach: withhold 1–2 doses of warfarin and reduce the maintenance dose in patients with an INR greater than 5.0 but who are not experiencing active bleeding.

### Discrepant sensitivity of thromboplastin reagents to clotting factor levels explored by the prothrombin time in patients on stable oral anticoagulant treatment: impact on the international normalized ratio system [^1142xXX4]. Haematologica (2002). Low credibility.

We tested the principle of local International Normalized Ratio (INR) calibration using INR calibrator plasmas (PT Calibration Plasma Kit, Behring), two thromboplastin reagents (Neoplastin Plus, rabbit brain, Stago, and Recombiplastin, recombinant human tissue factor, Ortho Diagnostics), and the same coagulometer (STA, Stago) on 92 patients on stable oral anticoagulant treatment.

- **Design and methods**: A four-point calibration was obtained with each reagent by linear regression (sec/INR) on a log-log scale (r ≥ 0.999). The bias between the two reagents (Recombiplastin - Neoplastin Plus) was reduced from 31.7% to 17.5% and 7.5% (p = 0.001) when results were expressed, respectively, as PT ratio (using the mean normal prothrombin time as the denominator), INR (using instrument-specific ISI supplied by the manufacturers), and calibrated INR. However, there was a consistently significant regression of the differences over the average values, even after log transformation (r ≥ 0.586). The bias between the reagents was reduced to 1% (p = ns) when assuming Recombiplastin as the reference thromboplastin and applying Tomenson's correction, but limits of agreement were as large as 20%. Factor VII, X, V, and II activity was measured with the two thromboplastin reagents in all plasma samples using immunodepleted plasmas (Stago).

- **Results**: Statistically significant biases were observed for all clotting factors with the two reagents (Recombiplastin and Neoplastin Plus) and ranged from 3.5% (FII) to 37.2% (FVII). In addition, for FVII and FV, there was a significant regression of the differences.

### Clinical impact of point-of-care vs laboratory measurement of anticoagulation [^111RbQU4]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

Patients using anticoagulation point-of-care (POC) monitors are advised to periodically test these systems against laboratory methods to monitor performance. The international normalized ratio (INR), however, can vary between test systems owing to different instrument-reagent combinations. In a randomized study evaluating warfarin self-management, we compared INR measured by patients on a POC monitor (ProTime, International Technidyne Corporation, Edison, NJ) with those obtained at a hospital laboratory within 1 hour. Ninety-one paired INR determinations from 55 patients met inclusion criteria. Clinical agreement, in which POC and laboratory INR were within or outside the target INR range, occurred in 56 (62%) of 91 cases (kappa = 0.35). The mean (SD) difference between POC and laboratory INR was 0.44 (0.61). Six pairs differed by 1 or more INR units, 3 at study initiation resulting in POC monitor replacement. The accuracy of INR self-testing with ProTime was acceptable. The small failure rate of INR agreement might be clinically important, suggesting the need for external quality control systems.

### Interpretation of the international normalised ratio in patients with liver disease [^111bAwVJ]. Lancet (2002). Low credibility.

Wide acceptance of the international normalised ratio (INR) and thromboplastins with low international sensitivity indices (ISIs) has inadvertently led to the application of the INR to patients other than those on anticoagulation treatment. I examined the degree of factor deficiency for a given INR in patients with liver disease and controls receiving stable-dose warfarin. The degree of factor V and VII, but not prothrombin, deficiencies for a given INR were greater in liver patients than controls. The INR measured with a low-ISI thromboplastin can quantify the coagulation status of patients with liver disease but should not be interpreted as having the same meaning as the INR in patients receiving warfarin.

### The international normalized ratio calibrated for cirrhosis (INR(liver)) normalizes prothrombin time results for model for end-stage liver disease calculation [^113exntH]. Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) is a mathematical score used to prioritize patients for liver transplantation and includes results for creatinine, bilirubin, and prothrombin time (PT) expressed as the international normalized ratio (INR). The rationale for using the MELD rests on the assumption that the score would be consistent across the country if the methods used to measure the variables yield the same numerical results, regardless of the testing laboratory.

Evidence was provided that specific methodologies may influence the MELD, and the PT-INR was identified as the most important. This study was designed to provide information on the between-thromboplastin variability and to explore alternatives to circumvent such variability.

Fifty-seven patients with cirrhosis were selected, and their PTs were measured with seven thromboplastins. The thromboplastins were previously calibrated by testing plasmas from patients on vitamin K antagonists and healthy subjects to assign the international sensitivity index (ISI(vka)) needed to convert PT into INR. Each of the thromboplastins was also assigned an ISI(liver) by substituting in the calibration the plasmas from vitamin K antagonist patients with plasmas from patients with cirrhosis.

INR and MELD values for individual patients were calculated using the ISI(vka) or the ISI(liver). The mean INR(vka) obtained with the seven thromboplastins were significantly different (P < 0.001). Conversely, the mean INR(liver) were not. Similarly, the mean MELD(vka) were significantly different (P < 0.001), but those differences were abr.

### The historical origins of modern international normalized ratio targets [^112QHUn4]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Low credibility.

Prothrombin time (PT) and its derivative, the international normalized ratio (INR), are frequently ordered to assess the coagulation system. Plasma transfusion to treat incidentally abnormal PT/INR is a common practice with low biological plausibility and lacks credible evidence, yet INR targets appear in major clinical guidelines and account for the majority of plasma use at many institutions. In this article, we review the historical origins of INR targets by recounting historical milestones in the development of the PT, the discovery of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), the motivation for INR standardization, and the justification for INR targets in patients receiving VKA therapy.

Next, we summarize the evidence for INR testing to assess bleeding risk in patients not on VKA therapy and plasma transfusion for treating mildly abnormal INR to prevent bleeding in these patients. We conclude with a discussion of the parallels in misunderstanding of historic PT and present-day INR testing, offering lessons from the past that might help rationalize plasma transfusion in the future.

### Laboratory assessment of the anticoagulant activity of direct oral anticoagulants: A systematic review [^112Fp2To]. Chest (2017).

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are the treatment of choice for most patients with atrial fibrillation and/or noncancer-associated venous thromboembolic disease. Although routine monitoring of these agents is not required, assessment of anticoagulant effect may be desirable in special situations. The objective of this review was to systematically summarize evidence regarding laboratory assessment of the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban.

- **Methods**: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for studies reporting relationships between drug levels and coagulation assay results.

- **Results**: We identified 109 eligible studies: 35 for dabigatran, 50 for rivaroxaban, 11 for apixaban, and 13 for edoxaban. The performance of standard anticoagulation tests varied across DOACs and reagents; most assays showed insufficient correlation to provide a reliable assessment of DOAC effects. Dilute thrombin time (TT) assays demonstrated linear correlation (r² = 0.67–0.99) across a range of expected concentrations of dabigatran, as did ecarin-based assays. Calibrated anti-Xa assays demonstrated linear correlation (r² = 0.78–1.00) across a wide range of concentrations for rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban.

- **Conclusions**: An ideal test, offering both accuracy and precision for measurement of any DOAC, is not widely available. We recommend a dilute TT or ecarin-based assay for assessment of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran and anti-Xa assays with drug-specific calibrators for direct Xa inhibitors. In the absence of these tests, TT remains an option.

### Extended international normalized ratio testing intervals for warfarin-treated patients [^112sJKPs]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018). Low credibility.

Warfarin typically requires International Normalized Ratio (INR) testing at least every four weeks. We implemented extended INR testing for stable warfarin patients in six anticoagulation clinics. The use of extended INR testing increased from 41.8% to 69.3% over the three-year study, appearing safe and effective.

- **Background**: A previous single-center randomized trial suggested that patients with stable INR values could safely receive INR testing as infrequently as every 12 weeks.

- **Objective**: To test the success of implementing an extended INR testing interval for stable warfarin patients in a practice-based, multicenter collaborative of anticoagulation clinics.

- **Methods**: At six anticoagulation clinics, patients were identified as being eligible for extended INR testing based on prior INR value stability and minimal warfarin dose changes between 2014 and 2016. We assessed the frequency with which anticoagulation clinic providers recommended an extended INR testing interval (> 5 weeks) to eligible patients and explored safety outcomes such as next INR values, bleeding events, and emergency department visits.

- **Results**: At least one eligible period for extended INR testing was identified in 890 of 3362 (26.5%) warfarin-treated patients. Overall, the use of extended INR testing in eligible patients increased from 41.8% in the first quarter of 2014 to 69.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The number of subsequent out-of-range next INR values was similar between eligible patients.

### Oral anticoagulation thresholds [^115u5Ehm]. Circulation (2001). Low credibility.

Monitoring patients on oral anticoagulation is essential to prevent hemorrhage and re-thrombosis. We studied tissue factor-induced whole-blood coagulation in patients on warfarin therapy with similar international normalized ratios (INRs).

- **Methods and results**: Contact pathway-suppressed whole-blood coagulation initiated with tissue factor was studied in 8 male subjects (group W) and in 1 individual multiple times (subject A). Coagulation profiles for group W showed that subjects with similar INRs had widely varying clot times (6.2 to 23 minutes) and thrombin-antithrombin III (TAT) profiles with rates of 25 to 40 nmol. L(-1). min(-1) and maximum levels varying from 192 to 349 nmol/L. The normal control group exhibited clot times of 5.7 ± 0.3 minutes and TAT rates of 57 ± 13 nmol. L(-1). min(-1), reaching maximum levels of 742 ± 91 nmol/L. Subject A, who was stably anticoagulated at an INR of 2.1 ± 0.4 for 6 months, had widely ranging profiles with clot times of 9.0 to 22.7 minutes, TAT maximums varying from 141 to 345 nmol/L, and TAT formation rates of 10 to 57 nmol. L(-1). min(-1). INR did not correlate with TAT formation. Platelet activation was decreased by anticoagulants but also displayed variability. Fibrinopeptide A generation showed threshold variability independent of the INR. Factor VIII levels were increased (P = 0.03) in group W (204 ± 34.4%) compared with normal control subjects (149.4 ± 37.4%). A significant correlation was identified between increasing factor VIII levels and years on warfarin therapy (r = 0.78, P = 0.01), suggesting a possible factor.

### Variations of prothrombin time and international normalized ratio in patients treated with warfarin [^1116RqqG]. Thrombosis Research (2002). Low credibility.

Prothrombin time is a standard screening test used to monitor patients treated with oral anticoagulants. We hypothesize that INR measurements will not vary significantly within a given day in a given patient. The present study was conducted to compare the change in the international normalized ratio (INR) of prothrombin time (PT) within one day in patients treated with warfarin. Thirty such patients and nineteen healthy controls were enrolled in this study. PT was performed at four time points during the day for all subjects, with two measurements taken in the morning and two in the afternoon.

The four INR values obtained were compared with each other to identify minimal changes over the series of time points, both in patients and healthy controls. These values were not influenced by factors such as renal function, liver function, sex, age, hemoglobin levels, white cell count, platelet count, duration of warfarin treatment, or alcohol consumption. Therefore, INR can be measured at any time of the day, providing values that are equally valuable for clinical use.

### European concerted action on anticoagulation. Correction of displayed international normalized ratio on two point-of-care test whole-blood prothrombin time monitors (CoaguChek Mini and TAS PT-NC) by independent international sensitivity index calibration [^116oibRD]. British Journal of Haematology (2003). Low credibility.

The international normalized ratio (INR) on two widely used point-of-care test (POCT) prothrombin time (PT) monitors, the CoaguChek Mini and TAS PT-NC, differed considerably and also differed from the 'true' INR obtained on the same samples using a manual PT and the same species thromboplastin international reference preparation. Agreement between the displayed INR and difference from the 'true' INR has been reassessed following an independent international sensitivity index (ISI) calibration of the two systems.

The displayed INRs taken at seven centers were compared with 'true' INRs from the same blood donations and INRs based on the resulting ISI. The overall difference between the displayed INRs on the two monitor systems was reduced from 21.0% to 3.5%. The overall difference in mean INR of system A from the 'true' INR was reduced from 19.0% to 9.5%, and system B from 6.8% to 0.3%. However, individual center results still showed considerable mean INR variability.

Differences between the overall displayed INRs with the two monitor systems have been reduced by an independent multicenter calibration, and agreement with 'true' INR on the same blood samples improved. However, marked variability in mean INR at individual centers remained after ISI correction, which demonstrates the need for external quality control of individual POCT whole-blood PT monitors.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^115GWqZC]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

When a patient presents in the emergency department (ED) and is known or suspected to be on oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy, it is often helpful to measure the level of anticoagulation.

- **Reasons for assessment**:
	- The patient may have unintentionally or intentionally overdosed on the OAC but exhibits no related symptoms. For example, in the case of warfarin, the patient's routine monitoring could result in an overly elevated INR value due to an overdose or pharmacological interaction.
	- The patient might be experiencing spontaneous external or internal bleeding, or such bleeding may be suspected.
	- The patient has suffered an injury causing external or internal bleeding.
	- An urgent surgical or other invasive procedure is deemed necessary because of trauma or acute illness. It is essential for the surgical team to know the level of anticoagulation in the patient.

### Comparison and evaluation of a point-of-care device (CoaguChek XS) to Owren-type prothrombin time assay for monitoring of oral anticoagulant therapy with warfarin [^114FsaTo]. Thrombosis Research (2009). Low credibility.

The standardized test used for evaluating the effect of warfarin is the prothrombin time (PT), which is measured and expressed as the international normalized ratio (INR). Regular control of treatment intensity is required since inappropriate dosage increases the risk for complications. Portable point-of-care analytical instruments for the measurement of capillary whole blood PT have been available for the last decades. The purpose of this study was to compare and evaluate INR values obtained by the point-of-care device CoaguChek XS to Owren PT in a hospital setting.

- **Materials and methods**: In 397 warfarin-treated patients, capillary whole blood was analyzed with the CoaguChek XS, and the results were compared to the analysis of venous plasma samples with the Owren PT assay. To study reproducibility and rule out preanalytical errors, a subgroup of 152 patients had two capillary blood samples analyzed with the CoaguChek XS.

- **Results**: In 397 patients, with a median age (± 2SD) of 69.0 (50–88) years, there was a positive correlation between results from the CoaguChek XS and the Owren-type PT assay (r = 0.94; p < 0.001) and concordance of 88.2%. The mean INR difference (S.D.) was 0.02 (0.22). Comparison of the 152 double samples analyzed with the CoaguChek XS produced a positive correlation of 0.99; p < 0.001.

- **Conclusions**: The CoaguChek XS presents reproducible, highly comparable results with Owren PT at therapeutic levels of INR. The CoaguChek XS seems to produce better results than the earlier CoaguChek S, probably due to a new method of PT measurement where levels of fibrinogen and…

### Ignoring instead of chasing after coagulation factor VII during warfarin management: an interrupted time series study [^111CPQqi]. Blood (2021). Low credibility.

During warfarin management, variability in prothrombin time-based international normalized ratio (PT-INR) is caused, in part, by clinically inconsequential fluctuations in factor VII (FVII). The new factor II and X (Fiix)-prothrombin time (Fiix-PT) and Fiix-normalized ratio (Fiix-NR), unlike PT-INR, are only affected by reduced FII and FX. We assessed the incidence of thromboembolism (TE) and major bleeding (MB) in all 2,667 patients on maintenance-phase warfarin managed at our anticoagulation management service during 30 months; 12 months prior to and 18 months after replacing PT-INR monitoring with Fiix-NR monitoring.

Months 13 to 18 were predefined as transitional months. Using 2-segmented regression, a breakpoint in the monthly incidence of TE became evident 6 months after test replacement, which was followed by a 56% reduction in incidence (from 2.82% to 1.23% per patient-year; p = 0.019). Three-segmented regression did not find any significant trend in TE incidence (slope, +0.03) prior to test replacement; however, during months 13 to 18 and 19 to 30, the incidence of TE decreased gradually (slope, -0.12; R2 = 0.20; p = 0.007).

The incidence of MB (2.79% per patient-year) did not differ. Incidence comparison during the 12-month Fiix and PT periods confirmed a statistically significant reduction (55–62%) in TE. Fiix monitoring reduced testing, dose adjustments, and normalized ratio variability, and prolonged testing intervals and time in range. We conclude that ignoring FVII during Fiix-NR monitoring in real-world practice stabilizes the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.

### During warfarin induction, the Fiix-prothrombin time reflects the anticoagulation level better than the standard prothrombin time [^1165Q5xC]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Fiix-prothrombin time (PT) monitoring of warfarin, measuring factor (F) II and X, is effective. Plasma obtained during warfarin induction and the stable phase in the Fiix-trial was assayed. Fiix-PT stabilized anticoagulation earlier than monitoring with traditional PT-INR. FVII had little effect on thrombin generation, which was mainly determined by FII and FX.

- **Background**: The prothrombin time (PT) is equally prolonged by the reduction of each of the vitamin K-dependent (VKD) factors (F) II, VII, and X. The Fiix-PT is only affected by FII and FX, the main contributors to thrombin generation (TG).

- **Objective**: To test the hypothesis that variability in warfarin anticoagulation is reduced early during monitoring with the normalized PT-ratio calculated from Fiix-PT (Fiix-International Normalized Ratio [INR]) compared with traditional PT-INR monitoring. It also proposes that, because of its insensitivity to FVII, Fiix-PT more accurately reflects TG when Fiix-INR and PT-INR are discrepant.

- **Methods**: Samples from Fiix-trial participants monitored with either Fiix-PT or PT were used. VKD coagulation factors and TG were measured in samples from 40 patients during stable anticoagulation and in serial samples obtained from 26 patients during warfarin induction. TG was assessed in relation to the selective reduction in single VKD factors.

- **Results**: During Fiix-warfarin induction, full anticoagulation measured as FII or FX activity was achieved at a similar rate to that with PT-warfarin but subsequently stabilized better. Fiix-INR, but not PT-INR, mirrored total TG during initiation.

### Fiix-prothrombin time versus standard prothrombin time for monitoring of warfarin anticoagulation: a single centre, double-blind, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^114cRvMJ]. The Lancet Haematology (2015). High credibility.

Rapid fluctuations in factor VII during warfarin anticoagulation change the international normalised ratio (INR) but contribute little to the antithrombotic effect. We aimed to assess the non-inferiority of anticoagulation stabilization with a warfarin monitoring method affected only by factors II and X (Fiix-prothrombin time [Fiix-PT]) compared with standard PT-INR monitoring that includes factor VII measurement as well.

- **Methods**: The Fiix trial was a single-centre, double-blind, prospective, non-inferiority, randomised controlled clinical trial. Ambulatory adults on warfarin with an INR target of 2–3, managed by an anticoagulation dosing service using software-assisted dosing at the National University Hospital of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland, were eligible for inclusion in this study. We excluded patients undergoing electroconversion and nursing home residents. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the Fiix-PT monitoring group or the PT monitoring group by block randomisation. A blinded research INR (R-INR) based on the results of the respective test was reported to the dosing staff. Participants were contacted by a study nurse at 4-week intervals to elicit information about thromboembolism or bleeding otherwise unknown to the anticoagulation management centre. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of objectively diagnosed non-fatal and fatal arterial or venous thromboembolism, including myocardial infarction and transient ischaemic attacks, assessed in all eligible patients who were randomised (intention-to-monitor population). The safety endpoint was…

### Randomized controlled trial of supervised patient self-testing of warfarin therapy using an internet-based expert system [^1115adE6]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

Increased frequency of prothrombin time testing, facilitated by patient self-testing (PST) of the International Normalized Ratio (INR), can improve the clinical outcomes of oral anticoagulation therapy (OAT). However, oversight of this type of management is often difficult and time-consuming for healthcare professionals. This study reports the first randomized controlled trial of an automated direct-to-patient expert system, enabling remote and effective management of patients on OAT.

- **Methods**: A prospective, randomized controlled crossover study was performed to test the hypothesis that supervised PST using an internet-based, direct-to-patient expert system could provide improved anticoagulation control compared with that provided by an anticoagulation management service (AMS). During the 6 months of supervised PST, patients measured their INR at home using a portable meter and entered this result, along with other information, onto the internet web page. Patients received instant feedback from the system as to what dose to take and when the next test was due. During the routine care arm, patients attended the AMS at least every 4–6 weeks and were dosed by the anticoagulation pharmacist or physician. The primary outcome variable was the difference in the time in therapeutic range (TTR) between both arms.

- **Results**: One hundred and sixty-two patients were enrolled (male 61.6%, mean age 58.7 years), and 132 patients (81.5%) completed both arms. TTR was significantly higher during PST management than during AMS management (median TTR 74% vs. 58.6%; z = 5.67, P < 0).

### Guideline on the management of bleeding in patients on antithrombotic agents [^115syHSH]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bleeding in patients on antithrombotic agents, specifically concerning patients on warfarin, BSH 2013 guidelines recommend administering a 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (25–50 units/kg) and vitamin K (5 mg IV, for one dose) in patients experiencing major bleeding while on warfarin.

### Long-term stability of frozen pooled plasmas stored at -70°C, -40°C, and -20°C for prothrombin time and international normalized ratio (INR) assessment [^111kWwWj]. Thrombosis Research (2013). Low credibility.

Frozen pooled plasmas may be used for quality assessment and local calibration of prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR) measurement systems. The purpose of the present study is to estimate the long-term stability of frozen pooled plasmas stored for at least three years.

- **Methods**: Six pooled plasmas with different INR levels were stored at -70°C, -40°C, and -20°C for various time periods up to 1453 days. PT of stored samples was measured with two thromboplastin reagents on a single automated coagulation instrument. INR was calculated from PT and plotted against plasma storage time. Linear regression lines of INR on storage time were used to estimate the percentage increase of INR.

- **Results**: INR of plasma stored at -40°C or -20°C increased significantly with time. INR of plasma stored at -70°C did not change significantly in 11 out of 12 cases. The INR change of pooled plasmas stored at -70°C for 3 years varied between 0.07% and 2.03%.

- **Conclusion**: Long-term storage of plasmas at -40°C or -20°C should be avoided. Pooled plasmas stored at -70°C can be used for quality assessment and local calibration for at least 3 years.

### Clinical decision-making as the basis for assessing agreement between measures of the International Normalized Ratio [^114SqjLc]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

The now classic approach of Bland and Altman is often used to assess the level of agreement between International Normalized Ratio (INR) measures. However, this method does not define agreement in a clinically meaningful way. Agreement between measures should be characterized explicitly in terms of the clinical decisions that result from INR measures.

- **Objectives**: To develop and validate an extension of the Bland-Altman method to assess agreement between INR measures, based explicitly on how clinicians make decisions.

- **Methods and results**: We developed a clinically based graphical method to estimate the level of agreement between measures of INR. Clinically relevant INR ranges were identified using epidemiologic and clinical evidence regarding risk and expected outcome at different INR levels. Clinical decisions were expected to agree within these INR ranges; thus, these ranges became the basis for establishing agreement between measures. Paired INR measures and resultant clinical decisions from a previous prospective study were used to validate and compare the accuracy of our model to those of Bland and Altman's and other published models. Our method more accurately predicts when warfarin dosing decisions differ than the Bland-Altman method (P < 0.02) and is superior to other published methods, particularly in identifying when measures lead to discrepant clinical decisions.

- **Conclusions**: We introduced and validated an improvement of the Bland-Altman method to assess agreement between INR measures.

	- **Coumarin-derivative anticoagulants**: Prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR) have been observed in patients receiving Zolinza concomitantly with coumarin-derivative anticoagulants. Physicians should monitor PT and INR more frequently in patients concurrently administered Zolinza and coumarin derivatives.

	- **Other HDAC inhibitors**: Severe thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal bleeding have been reported with concomitant use of Zolinza and other HDAC inhibitors (e.g. valproic acid). Monitor platelet count every 2 weeks for the first 2 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^1136kfi4]. Emergency medicine journal (2016). Low credibility.

The INR tests give misleading results with NOACs. Dabigatran inhibits coagulation by directly and specifically binding thrombin (factor IIa), while rivaroxaban and apixaban directly and specifically bind FXa. These modes of action differ from that of warfarin and make the results of PT/INR tests unreliable in patients treated with the newer agents.

The INR is relatively insensitive to dabigatran-induced anticoagulation, yielding normal or near-normal results at therapeutic dabigatran plasma concentrations and only slight increases at higher drug levels. INR testing with point-of-care devices in dabigatran-treated patients is similarly unreliable. The FXa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban have been reported to produce variable results with PT tests, which are relatively insensitive to FXa inhibitor-induced changes in coagulation. Therefore, for a patient treated with dabigatran, the PT will not provide valid information and could give the erroneous impression that the patient's coagulation status is normal or near-normal.

### Characterization of distinct coagulopathic phenotypes in injury: Pathway-specific drivers and implications for individualized treatment [^113vpHVX]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

International normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) are used interchangeably to diagnose acute traumatic coagulopathy but reflect disparate activation pathways. In this study, we identified injury/patient characteristics and coagulation factors that drive contact pathway, tissue factor pathway (TF), and common pathway dysfunction by examining injured patients with discordant coagulopathies. We hypothesized that patients with INR/PTT discordance reflect differing phenotypes representing contact versus tissue factor pathway perturbations and that characterization will provide targets to guide individualized resuscitation.

- **Methods**: Plasma samples were prospectively collected from 1,262 critically injured patients at a single Level I trauma center. Standard coagulation measures and an extensive panel of procoagulant and anticoagulant factors were assayed and analyzed with demographic and outcome data.

- **Results**: Fourteen percent of patients were coagulopathic on admission. Among these, 48% had abnormal INR and PTT (BOTH), 43% had isolated prolonged PTT (PTT-CONTACT), and 9% had isolated elevated INR (INR-TF). PTT-CONTACT and BOTH had lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores than INR-TF (p < 0.001). INR-TF had decreased factor VII activity compared with PTT-CONTACT, whereas PTT-CONTACT had decreased factor VIII activity compared with INR-TF. All coagulopathic patients had factor V deficits, but activity was lowest in BOTH, suggesting an additive downstream effect of disordered activation pathways. Patients with PTT-CONTACT received half as much packed re

### Falsely elevated prothrombin international normalized ratio values [^112PSLLx]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

International normalized ratio (INR) monitoring is essential during oral anticoagulation therapy to minimize bleeding complications and thrombotic events. Laboratory technicians cannot differentiate falsely elevated INR results due to problems in drawing blood from truly elevated INR values, but the extent of this phenomenon is unclear. We determined the proportion of patients with INR values of more than 9 in our laboratory who had values less than 6 in the hospital when retested on the same day. There were 251 tests with an INR of more than 9 (1.84 per 1,000 tests), and 188 of them (74.9%) had an INR of 10 or more, which equals 1.37 per 1,000 tests sent. There were 20 (33%) of 61 patients with INR values of more than 9 in our laboratory who had repeated test values in the hospital of less than 6. Efforts are warranted to decrease this proportion, and patients and physicians should be aware of this phenomenon to prevent dissatisfaction owing to inappropriate expectations.

### A comparison between six- and four-week intervals in surveillance of oral anticoagulant treatment [^111oPU2F]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

We determined whether international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring at 6 weeks rather than 4 weeks would benefit patients and reduce costs. Patients receiving stable oral anticoagulation treatment (target INR, 3.0) with a prosthetic mechanical heart valve for more than 6 months were randomized for a maximum interval between INR determinations of 6 weeks (group 1, n = 59) or 4 weeks (group 2 [control], n = 65). Patients were followed up for 2 years. The primary endpoint of the study was the biologic risk of overanticoagulation or underanticoagulation, estimated as the rate of values at risk (INR, > 5). The rates of INR values at risk for hemorrhagic (INR, > 5) or thromboembolic (INR, < 1.5) complications were 3.27% in group 1 and 3.09% in group 2 (P = .81). The INRs of patients in group 1 trended toward higher values, but no difference between groups was observed in time spent at various INR ranges by using the method of linear change. The mean time between INR determinations was 24.9 ± 18.1 days (1.20 per month) in group 1 and 22.5 ± 9.5 days (1.33 per month) in group 2 (P < .0003). For patients in stable condition with a prosthetic heart valve who are monitored at an anticoagulation clinic, a 6-week interval between INR determinations does not increase the biologic risk of thromboembolic or hemorrhagic events.

### Capillary whole blood testing by a new portable monitor. Comparison with standard determination of the international normalized ratio [^115RZAyT]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2003). Low credibility.

We evaluated a new portable monitor (AvoSure PT PRO, Menarini Diagnostics, Firenze, Italy) developed to test the prothrombin time in capillary blood and plasma by comparing it with the standard laboratory determination. We studied 62 patients receiving acenocoumarol therapy. The international normalized ratio (INR) in capillary blood was analyzed by two methods: AvoSure PT PRO and Thrombotrack Nycomed Analyzer (Axis-Shield, Dundee, Scotland). Parallel studies were performed in plasma samples using a reference method with the Behring Coagulation Timer (Behring Diagnostics, Marburg, Germany). Plasma samples were also tested with the AvoSure PT PRO.

Correlation was good for INR values for capillary blood and plasma samples by AvoSure PT PRO and our reference method (R² = 0.8596) and for capillary blood samples tested by the AvoSure PT PRO and Thrombotrack Nycomed Analyzer (R² = 0.8875). The correlation for INR in capillary blood and plasma samples by AvoSure PT PRO was 0.6939 (P < .0004). Capillary blood determinations are rapid and effective for monitoring oral anticoagulation therapy and have a high correlation to plasma determinations. AvoSure PT PRO is accurate for controlling INR in plasma and capillary blood samples, may be used in outpatient clinics, and has advantages over previous portable monitors.

The PT/INR (prothrombin time/international normalized ratio) blood test was developed in the 1930s and validated for warfarin monitoring. The aPTT (activated partial thromboplastin time) was developed in the 1940s to screen for hemophilia in high-risk individuals and later validated for heparin monitoring. Despite these specific indications, both tests are often ordered 'routinely' as 'coagulation' tests.

The SMART AIM of our study was to reduce PT/INR and aPTT blood testing in the emergency department (ED) over a 12-month period using an iterative quality improvement strategy.

### The international normalized ratio according to Owren in liver disease: Interlaboratory assessment and determination of international sensitivity index [^113HMifb]. Thrombosis Research (2013). Low credibility.

The international normalized ratio (INR) is used to prioritize liver disease patients for transplantation. Previous studies have shown high interlaboratory variability in Quick-based INR determinations in samples of patients with liver disease. We assessed Owren-based INR reagents for analyzing INR in patients with liver disease. Furthermore, we determined the difference between international sensitivity index (ISI) for patients on vitamin K antagonists (ISIVKA) and ISI for patients with liver disease (ISIliver).

- **Patients and methods**: Twenty patients with liver disease were included, 10 with INR 1.8–3.6 (group A1) and 10 with INR 1.2–1.5 (group C1). Plasma from these patients was analyzed for Owren-based INR in eight Swedish laboratories using either of the following reagents: SPA+, Owrens PT, or Nycotest PT. To determine ISIliver, the reference thromboplastin RBT/05 and an additional 41 patients with liver disease and 20 normal controls were included. ISIVKA was determined according to the WHO procedure. The difference between the ISIVKA and ISIliver was calculated.

- **Results**: The coefficients of variance for the Owren-based INR methods were 6.2% in group A1, 3.9% in group C1, and 5.3% for all patients. The differences between ISIVKA and ISIliver were -0.4%, -0.7%, and -0.2% for SPA+, Owrens PT, and Nycotest PT, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Interlaboratory variation in INR analyses according to Owren in patients with liver disease is low, and the difference between ISIVKA and ISIliver is below 10% with this method. ISIVKA can therefore be used in the INR calibration for the procedure.

### A comparative study of point-of-care prothrombin time in cardiopulmonary bypass surgery [^113yQvbG]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Point-of-care (POC) devices facilitate prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) testing in whole blood (WB). They allow for the timely administration of plasma or prothrombin complex concentrate during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. This study evaluated the sensitivities of a new POC PT test utilizing a dry-hematology method with heparin neutralization technology (DRIHEMATO PT-S [DRI PT-S]; A&T Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan). It compared DRI PT-S with other currently available POC tests.

- **Design**: Prospective, observational study.

- **Setting**: University hospital, single center.

- **Participants**: Healthy volunteers and warfarin-treated and cardiac surgical patients.

- **Measurement and main results**: In WB samples obtained from six healthy volunteers, PT-INR results of DRI PT-S were not affected by an in vitro addition of heparin < 6.0 U/mL. In warfarin-treated samples (n = 88, PT/INR 0.98–3.87), PT-INR with DRI PT-S showed an acceptable correlation with the laboratory method (r² = 0.85, p < 0.001). In blood samples obtained from cardiac surgical patients (n = 72), heparin prolonged the PT/INR with the laboratory assay, dry-hematology method with non-heparin neutralization technology (DRI PT), Coaguchek XS (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), and Hemochron Jr. (Accriva Diagnostics, Edison, NJ). However, DRI PT-S was not affected by heparin anticoagulation. In non-heparinized samples, the different methods between DRI PT-S and the laboratory method yielded acceptable correlations (r² = 0.76, p < 0.0001). There was a moderate correlation between factor levels and the PT-INR with DRI PT-S.

### Meta-analysis to assess the quality of international normalized ratio control and associated outcomes in venous thromboembolism patients [^117DrDxj]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) frequently require vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent recurrent events, but their use increases the risk of hemorrhage. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the quality of international normalized ratio (INR) control, identify study-level predictors of poor control, and examine the relationship between INR control and adverse outcomes in VTE patients.

- **Materials and methods**: We searched bibliographic databases (1990-June 2013) for studies of VTE patients receiving adjusted-dose VKAs. These studies reported time in range (2.0–3.0) or the proportion of INRs in range and/or INR measurements coinciding with thromboembolic or hemorrhagic events. Meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis were performed.

- **Results**: Upon meta-analysis, studies found 59% (95% CI: 54–64%) of INRs measured and 61% (95% CI: 59–63%) of the time patients were treated were spent outside the target range of 2.0–3.0, with a tendency for under- versus over-anticoagulation. This poor INR control resulted in a greater chance of recurrent VTE (beta-coefficient = -0.46, p = 0.01) and major bleeding (beta-coefficient = -0.30, p = 0.02). Patients with an INR > 3.0 made up 48% (95% CI: 34–61%) of major hemorrhage cases. Upon meta-regression, being VKA-naïve (-14%, p = 0.04) and treated in the community (-7%, p < 0.001) were associated with less time in range, while being treated in Europe/United Kingdom (compared to North America) was associated with a greater time in range (11%, p = 0.003).

- **Conclusions**: Strategic interventions are needed to improve INR control in VTE patients on VKAs, especially for those who are VKA-naïve or managed in the community. Further studies should focus on regional differences to optimize treatment strategies.

### Enhanced thrombin generation in patients with cirrhosis-induced coagulopathy [^112hHoLq]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

Prothrombin time (PT) and the international normalized ratio (INR) are still routinely measured in patients with liver cirrhosis to 'assess' their bleeding risk, despite the lack of correlation with the two. Thrombin generation (TG) assays are global assays of coagulation that are showing promise in assessing bleeding and thrombosis risks.

- **Aim**: To study the relationship between the INR and TG profiles in cirrhosis-induced coagulopathy.

- **Methods**: Seventy-three patients with cirrhosis were studied. All TG parameters were compared with those from a normal control group. Contact activation was prevented using corn trypsin inhibitor. TG was also assayed in the presence of Protac(®). The endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) ratio was derived by dividing the ETP with Protac(®) by the ETP without Protac(®).

- **Results**: The INR (mean 1.7) did not correlate with the ETP and the velocity of TG (P > 0.05). There was no difference between the lag time and ETP of the two groups (P > 0.05). The velocity of TG was increased in cirrhosis (67.95 ± 34.8 vs. 45.05 ± 25.9 nM min⁻¹; P = 0.016), especially in patients with INRs between 1.21 and 2.0. Both the ETP with Protac(®) and the ETP ratio were increased in cirrhosis (mean 1074 ± 461.4 vs. 818 ± 357.9 nM min, P = 0.004 and 0.80 ± 0.21 vs. 0.44 ± 0.15, P ≤ 0.0001, respectively).

- **Conclusion**: Despite a raised INR, TG parameters are consistent with a hypercoagulable profile in cirrhosis-related coagulopathy. This confirms that the PT or INR should not be used to assess bleeding risk in these patients, and other parameters, such as TG, need to be considered.

### Coagulopathy and hemostasis management in patients undergoing liver transplantation: Defining a dynamic spectrum across phases of care [^111WZjQu]. Liver Transplantation (2022). Low credibility.

In patients with acute liver failure (ALF), prolonged PT/INR defines the syndrome along with hepatic encephalopathy and may be significant, but does not predict bleeding complications, although it is a marker of poor prognosis. In contrast, thrombocytopenia is associated with bleeding complications in addition to increased mortality or the requirement for liver transplantation (LT). In ALF, there is a state of rebalanced hemostasis. Local hypercoagulability in the liver microvasculature, resulting from excessive von Willebrand factor (vWF) and deficient regulating protease (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif member 13, ADAMTS13), has recently been proposed to potentiate the primary liver injury of ALF. Hypofibrinogenemia, a consequence of decreased hepatic synthesis, may also contribute to deranged hemostasis in patients with ALF. A study of 200 patients with acute liver injury/ALF demonstrated that patients with abnormal ROTEM parameters were more likely to have severe systemic complications, such as high-grade encephalopathy or kidney failure, but not increased bleeding tendencies. Despite the profound laboratory derangement seen in ALF, these patients seldom bleed. Bleeding is the proximate cause of death in patients with ALF in less than 5% of cases.

### Jantoven [^111RtpwT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The dosage and administration of Jantoven must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated; consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

- **Recommended target INR ranges and durations for individual indications**: An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.
	- **Venous thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and pulmonary embolism [PE])**: Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:
		- For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
		- For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
		- For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

### Guideline on the management of bleeding in patients on antithrombotic agents [^113cfUPd]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for bleeding in patients on antithrombotics, more specifically with respect to warfarin reversal before surgery, the BSH 2013 guidelines recommend correcting the INR by administering prothrombin complex concentrate and intravenous vitamin K. This approach is specifically advised for surgeries that require the reversal of warfarin and cannot be delayed for vitamin K to have sufficient time to take effect.

### Do new oral anticoagulants require laboratory monitoring? The clinician point of view [^115dkaES]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Although no laboratory monitoring is needed for new anticoagulants, the measurement of their activity is required in special clinical situations. Standardized tests have been developed for rivaroxaban and dabigatran, which allow the measurement of the patient's response to the drug at Cmax (2 to 3 hours after intake) or at trough (before repeated administration). The results can be expressed in mg per mL of plasma and compared to the expected concentrations. The influence of the new anticoagulants on coagulation assays has been determined. Several clinical cases of major bleeding have been reported, and severe coagulopathy was found in these patients (prolonged PT and aPTT, increased drug concentration in plasma). These observations raise the question regarding the potential benefit of laboratory coagulation monitoring from time to time. Trials are needed to determine the relationship of assay results with bleeding or thrombotic complications. Pros and cons of laboratory measurements are discussed.

### Reducing unnecessary coagulation testing in the emergency department (REDUCED) [^115jS27w]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2017). Low credibility.

The strategy for this study involved several Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles.

- **PDSA Cycle 1**: The aim was to determine reasons for the frequent ordering of PT/INR and aPTT tests in the emergency department (ED). It was hypothesized that unfamiliarity with coagulation tests contributed to their frequent ordering. Interviews conducted with ED physicians, nurses, and laboratory staff revealed that PT/INR and aPTT tests were often ordered unknowingly because bloodwork in the ED was typically based on an order panel. Notably, these panels included both PT/INR and aPTT even though they were rarely required together. Additionally, PT/INR and aPTT were linked in laboratory software, causing both tests to be run automatically even if only one was ordered.

- **PDSA Cycle 2**: This cycle aimed to understand and modify the performance of coagulation tests in the laboratory. A team comprising a hematologist, a laboratory technologist, and the medical director of the coagulation laboratory discussed the possibility of uncoupling the tests in the laboratory software, ensuring that both tests would not be automatically processed together. It was hypothesized that uncoupling the tests would reduce the frequency of their combined execution. On May 20, 2015, it was implemented (Figure 1. See week -33) that the tests would not be automatically run together unless both were individually ordered. This change had a minimal impact on the…

### Assessment of the efficacy of a novel tailored vitamin K dosing regimen in lowering the international normalised ratio in over-anticoagulated patients: a randomised clinical trial [^115YLxsj]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Guidelines advocate using fixed doses of oral vitamin K to reverse excessive anticoagulation in warfarinized patients who are either asymptomatic or have minor bleeds. Over-anticoagulated patients present with a wide range of International Normalised Ratio (INR) values, and the response to fixed doses of vitamin K varies. Consequently, a significant proportion of patients remain outside their target INR after vitamin K administration, making them prone to either haemorrhage or thromboembolism.

We compared the performance of a novel tailored vitamin K dosing regimen to that of a fixed-dose regimen, with the primary measure being the proportion of over-anticoagulated patients returning to their target INR within 24 hours. One hundred and eighty-one patients with an index INR greater than 6.0 (asymptomatic or with minor bleeding) were randomly allocated to receive oral administration of either a tailored dose (based upon index INR and body surface area) or a fixed dose (1 or 2 mg) of vitamin K. A greater proportion of patients treated with the tailored dose returned to within the target INR range compared to the fixed-dose regimen (68.9% vs. 52.8%; P = 0.026), while a smaller proportion of patients remained above the target INR range (12.2% vs. 34.0%; P < 0.001). Individualised vitamin K dosing is more accurate than a fixed-dose regimen in lowering INR to within the target range in excessively anticoagulated patients.

### The optimal range of international normalized ratio for radiofrequency catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation during therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin [^114MSXwk]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2013). Low credibility.

Uninterrupted anticoagulation with warfarin during radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA) of atrial fibrillation is associated with a lower risk of periprocedural complications than when warfarin is temporarily discontinued. However, the optimal international normalized ratio (INR) levels during RFA have not been defined.

- **Methods and results**: In this retrospective analysis, RFA was performed in 1133 consecutive patients (mean age, 61 ± 10 years) with paroxysmal (550) or persistent atrial fibrillation (583). Patients were grouped based on the INR on the day of RFA. There was a quadratic relationship between the INR and bleeding and vascular complications; INRs greater than 3.0 led to more complications (12% [9/76]; P = 0.03). The prevalence of pericardial tamponade (1%) was similar at all INRs. From the quadratic model, the optimal range of INR was calculated as 2.1 to 2.5. INRs above 3.0 were associated with a greater than two-fold increase in complications, with a further steep rise beyond an INR greater than 3.5. Concomitant clopidogrel use was associated with a significant increase in complications at all INRs (odds ratio = 3.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.4–7.4). Unfractionated heparin requirements to maintain a therapeutic activated clotting time during RFA were reduced by 50% in patients with an INR greater than 2.0.

- **Conclusions**: The optimal INR range during uninterrupted periprocedural anticoagulation using warfarin is narrow. Therefore, INR levels should be carefully monitored in preparation for RFA.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^114KX42i]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Long-term oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy is used for the treatment and prevention of thrombosis and thromboembolism. As OAC use is widespread, emergency physicians are likely to encounter patients on anticoagulant therapy in the emergency department (ED) on a regular basis, either for the same reasons as the general population or due to the increased bleeding risk that OAC use entails.

The vitamin K antagonist warfarin has been the standard OAC for several decades. Recently, newer agents such as dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, and apixaban (collectively known as novel OACs, non-vitamin K OACs, or simply 'NOACs') have become available for long-term use. Protocols for assessing and managing warfarin-treated patients in the ED are well established and include international normalised ratio (INR) testing, which helps guide patient management. However, the INR does not provide an accurate evaluation of coagulation status with NOACs. Therefore, alternative tests are needed in emergency settings.

This paper discusses what information the INR provides for a patient taking warfarin and which coagulation tests can guide the physician when treating patients on one of the NOACs, as well as other differences in emergency anticoagulation management.

### Simplified method for local correction of system international normalized ratio [^113qu76k]. Laboratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The international normalized ratio (INR) derivation depends on the international sensitivity index (ISI) of thromboplastin and varies with the instrument and reagents used.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the role of a correction factor in the derivation of INR.

- **Methods**: We studied prothrombin time (PT) and INR from patients using three thromboplastins of varying ISI values. The correction factor was applied to the observed INR to obtain a corrected INR.

- **Results**: The difference between corrected INR and observed INR values varies from -0.8 through 0.96.

- **Conclusions**: Corrected INR is dependent on PT only; it can be applied to all patients irrespective of the cause for elevated PT.

### Guidance for diagnosis and treatment of DIC from harmonization of the recommendations from three guidelines [^114oEurt]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for disseminated intravascular coagulation, more specifically with respect to FFP transfusion, the ISTH 2013 guidelines recommend considering the administration of FFP in patients with active bleeding with either prolonged PT/aPTT (> 1.5 times normal) or decreased fibrinogen (< 1.5 g/dL). Additionally, consider administering FFP in patients with DIC requiring an invasive procedure with similar laboratory abnormalities.

### A modified international normalized ratio as an effective way of prothrombin time standardization in hepatology [^111vLPxf]. Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

International Normalized Ratio (INR), which standardizes prothrombin time (PT) during oral anticoagulation, has been extended to standardize PT in liver diseases and is included in prognostic models such as the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD). However, mechanisms of PT prolongation in liver diseases differ from those involved in oral anticoagulation, and the thromboplastin reagents differ in their sensitivities to these two mechanisms. Our aim was to determine whether, in the calibration model for thromboplastins proposed by the World Health Organization, the use of plasmas from patients with liver diseases instead of plasmas from patients on oral anticoagulation could lead to a new INR specific for liver diseases (INR "LD"), achieving a real standardization of PT.

First, five thromboplastins were calibrated against an international reference using 60 plasmas of patients with liver failure. In a second step, the variation of PT, reported as seconds, the ratio of patient PT to normal PT, INR, and INR "LD" was assessed in 34 other patients. MELD scores were calculated with the INR values obtained with the five thromboplastins. Only INR "LD" eliminated variability in PT results observed with the different thromboplastins. The discrepancy between MELD scores was up to 4 and 7 points in 52% and 17% of the patients, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: INR "LD" may provide a common international scale of PT reporting in hepatology. Its adoption would be an important step because of the significant impact on MELD score induced by interlaboratory variability in INR determination.

### The international normalized ratio (INR) in the MELD score: Problems and solutions [^1154dGHr]. American Journal of Transplantation (2010). Low credibility.

The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is widely used to prioritize patients for liver transplantation. One of the pitfalls of the MELD score is the interlaboratory variability in all three components of the score (INR, bilirubin, creatinine). The interlaboratory variability in the INR has the largest impact on the MELD score, with a mean difference of around 5 MELD points in most studies. During the 3rd Conference on Coagulopathy and Liver Disease, a multidisciplinary group of scientists and physicians discussed possible solutions for the INR problem in the MELD score with the intention to provide a constructive contribution to the international debate on this issue. Here, we will discuss possible solutions and highlight advantages and disadvantages.

### Point of care testing for INR monitoring: Where are we now [^115fXx9N]. British Journal of Haematology (2004). Low credibility.

Point-of-care (POC, or near patient) testing for the measurement of the international normalized ratio (INR) has facilitated the devolution of service delivery from the traditional hospital outpatient setting. However, it must be undertaken within the confines of safe practice involving quality control procedures. The evaluation of INR POC tests should be closely related to the clinical issues of management and, specifically, improving the quality of care. One benefit of POC testing is the increased motivation that some practitioners feel, being able to perform diagnostic tests without sending samples to a laboratory. POC for INR testing within primary care eliminates the delay in waiting for the result to be processed by the hospital laboratory and the subsequent delay in informing the patient of their dosing advice. This review describes the utilization of POC testing outside the laboratory setting to develop models of care for oral anticoagulation management.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113ALfwN]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Prothrombin time (PT) and INR are assessments of blood clotting and are used to measure liver function, as the underlying protein clotting factors (II, V, VII, IX, and X) are made in the liver. If there is significant liver injury, usually a loss of more than 70% of synthetic function, this results in a reduction in clotting factor production and subsequent coagulopathy, as confirmed by a prolonged PT or INR. While a prolonged PT/INR can indicate either acute or chronic liver dysfunction, it can also be caused by vitamin K deficiency, as seen in fat malabsorption and chronic cholestasis.

A reduction in platelets, termed thrombocytopenia, is the most common hematological abnormality found in patients with chronic liver disease and is an indicator of advanced disease. Multiple factors culminate in a low platelet count: decreased production, splenic sequestration, and increased destruction. Decreased production is a consequence of bone marrow suppression, caused by alcohol, iron overload, drugs, and viridae, as well as by a reduction in thrombopoietin levels in chronic liver injury. Splenic sequestration results from hypersplenism, which is a consequence of portal hypertension seen in advanced liver fibrosis. Platelet destruction is also increased non-specifically in liver cirrhosis due to shear stress, fibrinolysis, and bacterial translocation. In specific causes of autoimmune liver disease, immunologically mediated destruction of platelets occurs due to antiplatelet immunoglobulin.

### Properties of recombinant human thromboplastin that determine the international sensitivity index (ISI) [^114BFknV]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2004). Low credibility.

Prothrombin time (PT) clotting tests are widely used to monitor oral anticoagulation therapy and to screen for clotting factor deficiencies. The active ingredient in PT reagents, thromboplastins, is tissue factor, the integral membrane protein that triggers the clotting cascade through the extrinsic pathway. Several years ago, a system for calibrating and using thromboplastin reagents, known as the International Sensitivity Index (ISI) and the International Normalized Ratio (INR), was developed to standardize the monitoring of oral anticoagulant therapy.

The ISI/INR method, while revolutionizing the monitoring of coumarin therapy, has been criticized for a number of perceived shortcomings. We have undertaken a series of studies aimed at achieving a detailed understanding of which parameters influence the ISI values of thromboplastin reagents, with an ultimate goal of creating 'designer thromboplastins' whose sensitivities to the various clotting factors can be individually tailored.

In this study, we demonstrate that ISI values of thromboplastin reagents based on relipidated, recombinant human tissue factor can be controlled by a combination of changes in the phospholipid content (in particular, the levels of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine) and ionic strength. The sensitivity of a given thromboplastin reagent can be increased, i.e. its ISI value decreased, by decreasing the content of phosphatidylserine and/or increasing the ionic strength. The molar ratio of phospholipid to tissue factor, on the other hand, had essentially no impact on ISI value.
