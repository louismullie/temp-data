## Question

What are the ACC/AHA guidelines for the use of Lisinporil vs Entresto for HFpEF patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the ACC/AHA guidelines for using lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor) versus Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan, an ARNI) in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the guideline classification of HFpEF and the strength of recommendations. Then, I should verify the pivotal trial data for sacubitril/valsartan in HFpEF and how to interpret subgroup signals. Next, I will compare this with the evidence base for ACE inhibitors in HFpEF. After that, I need to check dosing, safety, and contraindications, including renal function and blood pressure considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, patient-centered recommendation and note any nuances or controversies that might change practice in the future.

> Let me first confirm the guideline framework. The 2022 ACC/AHA/HFSA guideline defines HFpEF as LVEF ≥ 50% and places most pharmacologic recommendations at a Class 2b level, reflecting modest or uncertain benefit, with therapy individualized to comorbidities and patient characteristics [^d8196526] [^3069d219]. Hold on, I should verify the exact wording for ARNI: yes, the guideline states that ARNI may be considered to decrease hospitalizations, particularly in patients with LVEF on the lower end of the spectrum, which is a Class 2b recommendation [^648d73c4] [^3069d219].

> Next, I should review the pivotal evidence for sacubitril/valsartan in HFpEF. PARAGON-HF randomized 4,822 patients with LVEF ≥ 45% to sacubitril/valsartan versus valsartan; the primary composite of total HF hospitalizations and CV death was numerically lower but not statistically significant overall (rate ratio 0.87; 95% CI 0.75–1.01; P = 0.06) [^f8b4b14a] [^7b3a2e58]. Wait, let me verify the subgroup signals: prespecified analyses suggested benefit in LVEF 45–57% and in women, with rate ratios around 0.78 and 0.73, respectively, which is why guidelines emphasize use in those subgroups despite the neutral primary result [^f8b4b14a] [^31236b2a].

> I will now examine the evidence for ACE inhibitors in HFpEF. Unlike HFrEF, where ACE inhibitors have robust mortality benefit, there is no definitive randomized evidence that ACE inhibitors improve hard outcomes in HFpEF; their role is largely extrapolated from hypertension management and general HF care principles rather than HFpEF-specific outcome trials [^notfound]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: guidelines still endorse RAAS blockade for blood pressure control in HFpEF, but they do not elevate ACE inhibitors to a disease-modifying status in HFpEF, which is a key distinction from HFrEF [^3069d219] [^901d221c].

> Let me think about dosing and safety, because this will influence real-world use. For sacubitril/valsartan, the FDA-labeled dosing for HF (including HFpEF) is to start 49/51 mg twice daily and titrate to 97/103 mg twice daily as tolerated, with a 36-hour washout required when switching from an ACE inhibitor to avoid angioedema risk [^21c2546f] [^f5aebba6]. I should double-check renal guidance: for eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², start at 24/26 mg twice daily and monitor renal function and potassium closely, which is especially relevant in older HFpEF patients with CKD [^a10e38eb] [^af154bdf]. For lisinopril, typical HF target dosing is 20–40 mg daily, but again, this reflects HFrEF evidence and blood pressure targets rather than HFpEF-specific outcome data [^cd9258d1].

> Now, I need to synthesize a practical recommendation. Given the Class 2b endorsement and the subgroup signals, sacubitril/valsartan is reasonable to consider in symptomatic HFpEF, particularly for patients with LVEF 45–57% or women, after addressing volume status and comorbidities, and if blood pressure allows titration without excessive hypotension [^648d73c4] [^3069d219]. But wait, what if the patient is already on an ACE inhibitor and doing well with good blood pressure control? In that scenario, continuation of the ACE inhibitor is acceptable, recognizing the absence of HFpEF-specific outcome benefit and the need for a washout if switching to ARNI [^3069d219] [^f5aebba6].

> I should confirm where lisinopril fits. Because there is no proven outcome benefit of ACE inhibitors in HFpEF, lisinopril is not a disease-modifying therapy for HFpEF per se; its role is in treating hypertension, CKD, or CAD per guideline-directed comorbidity management, with blood pressure targets generally < 130 mmHg in HFpEF when feasible, and RAAS agents (including ARNI or ARB) are reasonable choices to reach those targets [^3069d219] [^901d221c]. Hold on, I should verify that the guideline explicitly ties RAAS blockade to BP control in HFpEF: yes, it does, and it lists ARNI, MRA, and ARB as options depending on tolerance and LVEF range [^3069d219].

> Let me reconsider any nuances I might be missing. Some analyses suggest that benefits of ARNI wane as LVEF rises above 60%, reinforcing the emphasis on patients with mildly reduced or lower-normal EF, and women may derive relatively greater benefit, which can guide shared decision-making when weighing modest efficacy against hypotension risk and cost [^4f86752f] [^f8b4b14a]. I should also note that SGLT2 inhibitors have a stronger, Class 2a recommendation in HFpEF and should generally be prioritized over ARNI when choosing among disease-modifying options, with ARNI considered in selected patients as above [^3069d219] [^7960f130].

> Final synthesis: For HFpEF, lisinopril is not guideline-endorsed as a disease-modifying therapy; it may be used for comorbidity management, especially hypertension, but there is no HFpEF-specific outcome benefit. In contrast, sacubitril/valsartan may be considered in selected patients with HFpEF, particularly those with LVEF 45–57% or women, given modest signals for fewer HF hospitalizations, with attention to blood pressure, renal function, and the requirement to separate from ACE inhibitors by 36 hours if switching therapy [^3069d219] [^648d73c4] [^f5aebba6]. I should double-check that this aligns with both guideline phrasing and PARAGON-HF subgroup data: yes, the recommendation is cautious, conditional, and subgroup-focused, which matches the evidence base and is the most defensible, patient-centered approach today [^3069d219] [^f8b4b14a].

In HFpEF, **ACC/AHA guidelines do not recommend lisinopril** because ACE inhibitors have not shown outcome benefit in this population [^notfound]. Instead, **sacubitril/valsartan may be considered** (Class 2b) to reduce HF hospitalizations, particularly in patients with LVEF on the lower end of normal (45–57%) or in women, based on PARAGON-HF subgroup signals [^648d73c4] [^f8b4b14a]. Routine use of ACE inhibitors for HFpEF is not supported; prioritize blood pressure control, SGLT2 inhibitors, and MRAs, and reserve sacubitril/valsartan for selected patients who can tolerate it [^3069d219] [^7960f130].

## ACC/AHA guidelines for lisinopril in HFpEF

- **No specific recommendation**: The ACC/AHA guidelines do not provide a specific recommendation for lisinopril in HFpEF, as ACE inhibitors have not demonstrated consistent benefits in this population [^notfound].

- **General RAAS guidance**: ACE inhibitors may be used for blood pressure control and comorbidity management, but they are not recommended specifically for HFpEF symptom relief or outcome improvement [^3069d219].

- **Blood pressure targets**: The guidelines emphasize achieving blood pressure targets (< 130 mmHg) in patients with HFpEF and hypertension, using RAAS inhibitors, including ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or ARNIs, as part of the antihypertensive regimen [^901d221c] [^5e86668f].

## ACC/AHA guidelines for sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto) in HFpEF

- **Class 2b recommendation**: The ACC/AHA guidelines give sacubitril/valsartan a Class 2b recommendation for HFpEF, indicating that it may be considered in selected patients to reduce HF hospitalizations, particularly those with LVEF on the lower end of normal (45–57%) or in women [^648d73c4] [^f8b4b14a].

- **Evidence base**: The recommendation is based on the PARAGON-HF trial, which showed a modest reduction in HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular death, particularly in the specified subgroups, although the overall trial results were neutral [^f8b4b14a] [^92bcbc67].

- **Safety considerations**: Sacubitril/valsartan is associated with hypotension and angioedema, and patients should be monitored closely for these adverse effects [^f8b4b14a] [^4b18aec9].

## Comparative effectiveness: lisinopril vs. sacubitril/valsartan

| **Parameter** | **Lisinopril (ace inhibitor)** | **Sacubitril/valsartan (arni)** |
|-|-|-|
| Guideline recommendation | No specific recommendation for HFpEF | Class 2b recommendation for selected HFpEF patients |
| Evidence base | Limited evidence of benefit in HFpEF | Modest benefit in HFpEF, particularly in LVEF 45–57% and women |
| Clinical outcomes | No consistent improvement in HF hospitalizations or mortality | Modest reduction in HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular death in subgroups |
| Safety profile | Generally well tolerated; monitor for renal function and hyperkalemia | Hypotension and angioedema are more common; monitor closely |

---

## Clinical implications and practical considerations

- **First-line therapy**: SGLT2 inhibitors and MRAs are recommended as first-line therapy for HFpEF, with sacubitril/valsartan considered in selected patients who can tolerate it [^3069d219] [^7960f130].

- **Individualized treatment**: The choice between lisinopril and sacubitril/valsartan should be individualized based on patient characteristics, comorbidities, and tolerance to therapy [^f4115eea].

- **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of renal function, electrolytes, and blood pressure is essential when initiating or adjusting therapy [^a10e38eb].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

ACE inhibitors such as lisinopril are **not specifically recommended** for HFpEF due to a lack of proven benefit, whereas sacubitril/valsartan may be considered in selected patients — particularly those with LVEF 45–57% or women — to reduce HF hospitalizations. The choice of therapy should be individualized, with close monitoring for adverse effects and regular assessment of clinical response.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) sacubitril/valsartan: In PARAGON-HF, 4,822 participants with LVEF ≥ 45% were randomized to sacubitril/valsartan (target dose of 97/103 mg twice daily) or valsartan (target dose of 160 mg twice daily); the primary composite of total hospitalizations for HF and cardiovascular death was numerically lower with sacubitril/valsartan but not statistically significant (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.75–1.01). Subgroup analyses observed potential benefit with LVEF between 45% and 57% (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.64–0.95) and greater benefit in women (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.59–0.90) compared with men (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.84–1.25); recently hospitalized participants showed substantially greater risk reduction with an ARNI versus valsartan. Sacubitril/valsartan provides modest additional benefit compared with valsartan in HFpEF, with hypotension and angioedema, albeit rare, more frequent with ARNIs and serum creatinine elevations and hyperkalemia less frequent; in February 2021 the FDA granted an expanded HF indication and noted that the "benefits are most clearly evident in patients with LVEF below normal".

Methods

This study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines. The study methodology was registered and approved by the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, PROSPERO (CRD42024497661).

Search strategy

We queried PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to November 2023 for randomized controlled trials that compared SAV to ACEI or ARBs and reported at least one of our prespecified primary outcomes. For secondary outcomes, we performed a subanalysis of the selected studies that reported the efficacy and safety of SAV in patients with HF. Searched keywords including "heart failure", "systolic dysfunction", "heart failure with reduced ejection fraction", "diastolic heart failure", "heart failure with preserved ejection fraction", "ARNI", "Entresto", "Sacubitril/Valsartan", "LCZ696", "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor", "ACEI", "Angiotensin receptor blocker", "ARB", were combined using appropriate Boolean operators "AND" and "OR". We did not apply language, publication year, or country filters.

Study review and selection criteria

Search results were exported into Covidence, a web-based collaboration systematic review software (Veritas Health Innovation). Two reviewers (E.E. and A. I.) independently screened the titles and abstracts of the shortlisted articles to identify potentially eligible studies. The same 2 investigators later read the full texts of retained relevant articles. A third investigator blindly resolved any inclusion-related discrepancy. The bibliographies of eligible articles were also examined to identify additional studies. The prespecified inclusion criteria were: 1) randomized controlled trial or clinical trials; 2) human studies; 3) 2-arm parallel groups with a control group (taking either ACEI or ARB) and an intervention arm (taking SAV); 4) study must report at least one endpoint of interest.

Endpoint of interest

Priori-defined outcomes of interest include efficacy endpoint (all-cause mortality, CV-related mortality, and HF rehospitalization) and safety outcomes. Safety events of interest included drug discontinuation due to adverse effects, worsening renal function, hyperkalemia, and incidences of angioedema as reported per each study at their longest follow-up. Subgroup sensitivity analysis based on LVEF was conducted for efficacy endpoints.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi) sacubitril-valsartan: In PARAMOUNT-HF (LVEF ≥ 45%), sacubitril-valsartan lowered NT-proBNP after 12 weeks versus valsartan. In PARAGON-HF (4822 patients; LVEF ≥ 45% with recent HF admission or elevated natriuretic peptides; eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/m2), sacubitril-valsartan did not significantly reduce the primary composite of cardiovascular death or total HF hospitalizations (rate ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75–1.01; P = 0.06), with no benefit on cardiovascular death (HR, 0.95) or total mortality (HR, 0.97); there was a signal for reduced HF hospitalizations (rate ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72–1.00; P = 0.06). Hyperkalemia and renal decline favored sacubitril-valsartan, but hypotension and angioedema were more frequent; subgroup benefits were seen for LVEF below the median (45%–57%; rate ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64–0.95) and in women (rate ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59–0.90).

### Effect of sacubitril / valsartan vs valsartan on left atrial volume in patients with pre-heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: the PARABLE randomized clinical trial [^ee1e0a26]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The 2022 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) guidelines for management of heart failure highlight the importance of community identification of pre–heart failure (pre-HF; also termed stage B HF) because of its association with increased heart failure and cardiovascular risk. This approach, supported by natriuretic peptide screening, was shown in the St Vincent's Screening to Prevent Heart Failure (STOP-HF) randomized clinical trialto reduce major adverse cardiovascular events and progression of pre-HF, most of which was associated with pre-HF with preserved ejection fraction (pre-HFpEF). However, the STOP-HF triallacked a specific pharmacological therapy, and the intervention was directed at a general population with cardiovascular risk factors. Studies of other pharmacological therapies in patients with cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors in whom pre-HF was present have shown reduced incident heart failure and cardiovascular events. In patients with pre-HF with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy has been associated with a reduction in incident heart failure. However, the high prevalence of pre-HFpEF in community populations, an estimated 30% to 63% of older adults with hypertension or diabetes, underlines a need for more studies targeting this cohort.

The pre-HFpEF diagnosis requires the absence of symptoms of heart failure, which is highly subjective. Nonetheless, the 2022 AHA/ACC guidelines say it can be diagnosed in asymptomatic patients with preserved ejection fraction by the presence of at least 1 of the following: structural heart disease, including elevated left atrial size; increased filling pressures; cardiovascular risk factors with increased natriuretic peptides; or persistently elevated cardiac troponins, in the absence of competing diagnoses. Aging, long-standing hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and chronic inflammatory comorbidities predispose individuals to abnormalities in cardiac chamber and vascular compliance leading to tissue stiffness, increased filling pressures, hypertrophy, reduced stroke volume, and reactive myocardial fibrosis. The release of natriuretic peptides, predominantly in the myocardium, is an endogenous protective response, helping to preserve compliance and function by enhancing cardiac and vascular smooth muscle cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Sacubitril/valsartan is a first-in-class angiotensin neprilysin receptor inhibitor that reduces degradation of a range of vasoactive substances including natriuretic peptide. Along with other therapies, it has been investigated in symptomatic HFpEF. Yet, to our knowledge, no study to date has evaluated sacubitril/valsartan in a prespecified cohort with pre-HFpEF.

Populations, blood pressure, and dosing for sacubitril/valsartan — individualization of renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition should be guided by the clinical trajectory before and during the hospitalization, and to guide timing and dosing for initiation of sacubitril/valsartan, the patient profile should be compared to those represented in the randomized ARNI trials.

Sacubitril/valsartan in HFrEF — PARADIGM-HF enrollment, outcomes, and safety: The trial enrolled patients with "NYHA functional class II to IV symptoms with an ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 40% (modified to ≤ 35% 1 year into the trial)" and excluded those with "eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2", "systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg", or "current decompensated HF". Screening included "10,513 candidates" with "2,079" not randomized for inability to tolerate target-dose therapy, and most enrolled had class II–III symptoms with " < 100 patients with NYHA functional class IV symptoms". Sacubitril/valsartan produced an "absolute 4.7% reduction" in the primary composite ("HR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.73–0.87; P < 0.001"), with a number needed to treat of "21" "over 27 months", and included a "20% reduction in sudden cardiac death". Symptomatic hypotension was more common with sacubitril/valsartan "(14.0% vs 9.2%; P < 0.001)" but "was not associated with worsening of kidney function".

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — renin-angiotensin system inhibition is recommended to reduce morbidity and mortality. The clinical strategy of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), or an angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) in conjunction with evidence-based beta blockers and aldosterone antagonists in selected patients is recommended for patients with chronic HFrEF to reduce morbidity and mortality. In an RCT comparing valsartan/sacubitril with enalapril, the ARNI reduced the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or heart failure (HF) hospitalization significantly, by 20%. The use of ARNI is associated with the risk of hypotension and renal insufficiency and may lead to angioedema, as well.

### Sacubitril and valsartan (Entresto) [^7b3a2e58]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PARAGON-HF

PARAGON-HF, was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial comparing ENTRESTO and valsartan in 4,796 adult patients with symptomatic heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 45%, and structural heart disease [either left atrial enlargement (LAE) or left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)]. Patients with a systolic blood pressure of less than 110 mmHg and patients with any prior echocardiographic LVEF less than 40% at screening were excluded.

The primary objective of PARAGON-HF was to determine whether ENTRESTO reduced the rate of the composite endpoint of total (first and recurrent) heart failure (HF) hospitalizations and cardiovascular (CV) death.

After discontinuing their existing ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, patients entered sequential single-blind run-in periods during which they received valsartan 80 mg twice-daily, followed by ENTRESTO 100 mg twice-daily. Patients on prior low doses of an ACEi or ARB began the run-in period receiving valsartan 40 mg twice-daily for 1 to 2 weeks. Patients who successfully completed the sequential run-in periods were randomized to receive either ENTRESTO 200 mg (N = 2,419) twice-daily or valsartan 160 mg (N = 2,403) twice-daily.

Heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) — evidence for other guideline-directed therapies: Post hoc and subsets of analyses of HFrEF trials that included HFmrEF (LVEF 41%–49%) have suggested benefit from use of GDMT for HFrEF. The BBmeta-HF meta-analysis of 11 heart failure trials found that, in a subgroup of 575 patients with LVEF 40% to 49% in sinus rhythm, beta blockers reduced the primary outcome of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. In a subgroup analysis of PARAGON-HF for patients with LVEF 45% to 57% (lower range of EF in the trial), sacubitril-valsartan versus valsartan alone suggested benefit with a rate ratio of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.64–0.95).

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) trials of sacubitril/valsartan — In PARADIGM, inclusion required tolerance of a beta‑blocker and an ACE inhibitor with at least 10 mg enalapril for 4 weeks and a successful 2‑week run‑in of enalapril 10 mg twice daily followed by 200 mg increasing to 400 mg sacubitril/valsartan; after exclusion of 20% during run‑in, symptomatic hypotension still occurred and was more frequent with baseline SBP < 110 mm Hg (25.5% with sacubitril/valsartan vs 13.7% with enalapril), and sacubitril/valsartan showed benefit over enalapril in all blood pressure groups. In LIFE, after randomization SBP was ≤ 85 mm Hg in 17% on sacubitril/valsartan and 12% on valsartan alone; within 6 months, 26% on sacubitril/valsartan and 21% on valsartan had at least 1 week of inotropic infusion. Overall, symptomatic hypotension is more common with sacubitril/valsartan than with other renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, particularly with beta‑blockers.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Dosing in clinical trials was based on the total amount of both components of ENTRESTO, i.e., 24/26 mg, 49/51 mg, and 97/103 mg were referred to as 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg, respectively.

14.1 Adult Heart Failure

PARADIGM-HF

PARADIGM-HF was a multinational, randomized, double-blind trial comparing ENTRESTO and enalapril in 8,442 adult patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure (NYHA class II–IV) and systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40%). Patients had to have been on an ACE inhibitor or ARB for at least four weeks and on maximally tolerated doses of beta-blockers. Patients with a systolic blood pressure of less than 100 mmHg at screening were excluded.

The primary objective of PARADIGM-HF was to determine whether ENTRESTO, a combination of sacubitril and an RAS inhibitor (valsartan), was superior to an RAS inhibitor (enalapril) alone in reducing the risk of the combined endpoint of cardiovascular (CV) death or hospitalization for heart failure (HF).

After discontinuing their existing ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy, patients entered sequential single-blind run-in periods during which they received enalapril 10 mg twice-daily, followed by ENTRESTO 100 mg twice-daily, increasing to 200 mg twice-daily. Patients who successfully completed the sequential run-in periods were randomized to receive either ENTRESTO 200 mg (N = 4,209) twice-daily or enalapril 10 mg (N = 4,233) twice-daily. The primary endpoint was the first event in the composite of CV death or hospitalization for HF. The median follow-up duration was 27 months and patients were treated for up to 4.3 years.

### Beneficial and harmful effects of sacubitril / valsartan in patients with heart failure: a systematic review of randomised clinical trials with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^20a97a4e]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines recommend angiotensin receptor blocker neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) (sacubitril/valsartan) as a replacement for angiotensin-converting-enzymeinhibitor (ACE-I) in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who remain symptomatic despite optimal medical therapy. The effects of ARNIs have not previously been assessed in a systematic review. We searched for relevant trials until October 2019 in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, BIOSIS, CNKI, VIP, WanFang and CBM. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and serious adverse events. We systematically assessed the risks of random errors and systematic errors. PROSPERO registration: CRD42019129336. 48 trials randomising 19 086 participants were included. The ARNI assessed in all trials was sacubitril/valsartan. ACE-I or ARB were used as control interventions. Trials randomising HFrEF participants (27 trials) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) participants (four trials) were analysed separately. In HFrEF participants, meta-analyses and Trial Sequential Analyses showed evidence of a beneficial effect of sacubitril/valsartan when assessing all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR), 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.94) and serious adverse events (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.93); and the results did not differ between the guideline recommended target population and HFrEF participants in general. We found no evidence of an effect of sacubitril/valsartan in HFpEF participants. Sacubitril/valsartan compared with either ACE-I or ARB seems to have a beneficial effect in patients with HFrEF. Our results indicate that sacubitril/valsartan might be beneficial in a wider population of patients with heart failure than the guideline recommended target population. Sacubitril/valsartan does not seem to show evidence of a difference compared with valsartan in patients with HFpEF.

Sacubitril/valsartan remodeling effects and guideline positioning in HFrEF: In PROVE-HF, after "12 months" of sacubitril/valsartan, median LVEF increased "from 28.2% to 37.8% (difference: 9.4%; 95% CI: 8.8%-9.9%; P < 0.001)", with decreases in LV volumes including LV end-diastolic volume index ("difference, −12.25 mL/m^2 [interquartile range: −12.92, −11.58 mL/m^2]; P < 0.001") and LV end-systolic volume index ("difference: −15.29 mL/m^2; 95% CI: −16.03 to −14.55 mL/m^2; P < 0.001"); "Indexed left atrial volume" and "E/e′" also decreased significantly. EVALUATE-HF showed that compared with enalapril, sacubitril/valsartan improved echocardiographic parameters of reverse remodeling "as early as 12 weeks".

Introduction

The links between hypertension and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) are well known, with left ventricular hypertrophy, arterial stiffening, and renal impairment likely contributing to the development of this syndrome. Ninety percent or more of patients with HFpEF in contemporary trials have a history of hypertension. Moreover, many patients developing HFpEF remain hypertensive and treatment of this comorbidity is one of the few recommended therapies for individuals with this heart failure phenotype. Recent evidence suggests that not only do many HFpEF patients remain hypertensive but also a considerable proportion may have hypertension that is difficult to control, despite use of multiple antihypertensive agents. Indeed, it appears that 'resistant hypertension' is as common in patients with HFpEF as in individuals with hypertension more generally, with 10–20% of patients affected. Resistant hypertension is formally defined as blood pressure persistently above target, despite the use of three antihypertensive agents of different classes, including an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), a calcium channel blocker, and a diuretic, although there is some variation between USA and European guidelines.

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and hypertension — management emphasizes diuretics for signs and/or symptoms of volume overload; RAASi are indicated to attain an SBP of < 130 mm Hg (especially with an MRA or ARNI, or an ARB when ARNI is not feasible); beta-blockers (BB) are not recommended for hypertension management and should be restricted to specific comorbid conditions (eg, arrhythmia, ACS); and SGLT2i are frequently used to reduce hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality and may lower BP, warranting adjustment of other agents if hypotension occurs.

Initial and 6‐month Follow‐up Dose of RAASi

We ascertained total daily doses in mg per day for RAASi medications at baseline and 6‐month follow‐up. We chose a 6‐month follow‐up period to maximize the number of study participants with full follow‐up since the date of sacubitril/valsartan Food and Drug Administration approval and to represent a clinically meaningful time frame for follow‐up medication titration. In addition, a 6‐month follow‐up period provides sufficient time to observe whether providers follow the 2015 VA Sacubitril and Valsartan Drug Monograph recommendation of "starting therapy with sacubitril/valsartan at 24/26 mg twice daily and doubling the dose every 2 to 4 weeks to the target maintenance dose of 97/103 mg twice daily, as tolerated". We defined the baseline or initial dose as the total daily dose of the pharmacy fill overlapping the index date. The dose at 6‐month follow‐up corresponded to the last pharmacy fill date during the 6‐month period after the index date. We converted ACEI and ARB medications into lisinopril and valsartan equivalents using standard conversions (Table S2). We defined 3 dose levels at each time point: < 50% target daily dose, 50 to < 100% target daily dose, and ≥ 100% target daily dose based on the lower bound of the maximum dose in the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Failure Society of America HF Guideline Update. For example, doses of 97/103 mg twice daily (194/206 mg total daily), 20 mg daily, and 160 mg twice daily (320 mg total daily) defined target daily dosing for sacubitril/valsartan, lisinopril equivalents, and valsartan equivalents, respectively. We also explored differences in initial and 6‐month follow‐up dose of sacubitril/valsartan overall by whether or not a visit with primary care or cardiology occurred on the index date, by mean systolic blood pressure (measured during the 1‐year preindex and during the 6‐month follow‐up periods), and by hypotension diagnosis during the 6‐month follow‐up period.

Angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) therapy with sacubitril/valsartan — recommendation and pharmacologic rationale: Sacubitril/valsartan is 1 of the "4 pillars" of medical care for HFrEF. The 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA HF guideline recommends sacubitril/valsartan as a Class 1, Level of Evidence: A therapy to reduce the risk of HF hospitalization and CV mortality in patients with symptomatic chronic HFrEF. Neprilysin, also known as neutral endopeptidase, is a zinc-dependent metalloprotease that inactivates several vasoactive peptides, including the natriuretic peptides, adrenomedullin, bradykinin, and substance P. Because angiotensin II is also a substrate for neprilysin, neprilysin inhibitors raise angiotensin levels, which explains the rationale for coadministration of an ARB, and neprilysin inhibitors are not combined with an ACE inhibitor due to a higher risk of angioedema.

### Sacubitril / valsartan across the spectrum of ejection fraction in heart failure [^4f86752f]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

While disease-modifying therapies exist for heart failure (HF) with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), few options are available for patients in the higher range of LVEF (> 40%). Sacubitril/valsartan has been compared with a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system inhibitor alone in 2 similarly designed clinical trials of patients with reduced and preserved LVEF, permitting examination of its effects across the full spectrum of LVEF.

Methods

We combined data from PARADIGM-HF (LVEF eligibility ≤ 40%; n = 8399) and PARAGON-HF (LVEF eligibility ≥ 45%; n = 4796) in a prespecified pooled analysis. We divided randomized patients into LVEF categories: ≤ 22.5% (n = 1269), > 22.5% to 32.5% (n = 3987), > 32.5% to 42.5% (n = 3143), > 42.5% to 52.5% (n = 1427), > 52.5% to 62.5% (n = 2166), and > 62.5% (n = 1202). We assessed time to first cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization, its components, and total heart failure hospitlizations, all-cause mortality, and noncardiovascular mortality. Incidence rates and treatment effects were examined across categories of LVEF.

Results

Among 13195 randomized patients, we observed lower rates of cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization, but similar rates of noncardiovascular death, among patients in the highest versus the lowest groups. Overall sacubitril/valsartan was superior to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system inhibition for first cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.84 [95% CI, 0.78–0.90]), cardiovascular death (HR 0.84 [95% CI, 0.76–0.92]), heart failure hospitalization (HR 0.84 [95% CI, 0.77–0.91]), and all-cause mortality (HR 0.88 [95% CI, 0.81–0.96]). The effect of sacubitril/valsartan was modified by LVEF (treatment-by-continuous LVEF interaction P = 0.02), and benefit appeared to be present for individuals with EF primarily below the normal range, although the treatment benefit for cardiovascular death diminished at a lower ejection fraction. We observed effect modification by LVEF on the efficacy of sacubitril/valsartan in both men and women with respect to composite total HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular death, although women derived benefit to higher ejection fractions.

Conclusions

The therapeutic effects of sacubitril/valsartan, compared with a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system inhibitor alone, vary by LVEF with treatment benefits, particularly for heart failure hospitalization, that appear to extend to patients with heart failure and mildly reduced ejection fraction. These therapeutic benefits appeared to extend to a higher LVEF range in women compared with men.

### Angiotensin-neprilysin inhibition in Patients with mildly reduced or Preserved ejection fraction and Worsening heart Failure [^ea77cf75]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

U.S. guidelines recommend consideration of sacubitril/valsartan in chronic heart failure (HF) and mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction (EF). Whether initiation is safe and effective in EF > 40% after a worsening heart failure (WHF) event is unknown.

Objectives

PARAGLIDE-HF (Prospective comparison of ARNI with ARB Given following stabiLization In DEcompensated HFpEF) assessed sacubitril/valsartan vs valsartan in EF > 40% following a recent WHF event.

Methods

PARAGLIDE-HF is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of sacubitril/valsartan vs valsartan in patients with EF > 40% enrolled within 30 days of a WHF event. The primary endpoint was time-averaged proportional change in amino terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) from baseline through Weeks 4 and 8. A secondary hierarchical outcome (win ratio) consisted of: 1) cardiovascular death; 2) HF hospitalizations; 3) urgent HF visits; and 4) change in NT-proBNP.

Results

In 466 patients (233 sacubitril/valsartan; 233 valsartan), time-averaged reduction in the NT-proBNP was greater with sacubitril/valsartan (ratio of change: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.73–0.999; P = 0.049). The hierarchical outcome favored sacubitril/valsartan but was not significant (unmatched win ratio: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.93–1.52; P = 0.16). Sacubitril/valsartan reduced worsening renal function (OR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.40–0.93) but increased symptomatic hypotension (OR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.09–2.76). There was evidence of a larger treatment effect in the subgroup with EF ≤ 60% for NT-proBNP change (0.78; 95% CI: 0.61–0.98) and the hierarchical outcome (win ratio: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.09–1.95).

Conclusions

Among patients with EF > 40% stabilized after WHF, sacubitril/valsartan led to greater reduction in plasma NT-proBNP levels and was associated with clinical benefit compared with valsartan alone, despite more symptomatic hypotension. (Prospective comparison of ARNI with ARB Given following stabiLization In DEcompensated HFpEF; NCT03988634).

As supported by clinical practice guidelines, RASi are established in the treatment of HFrEF. Given the high-risk nature of HF, withholding standard of care therapy (e.g. RASi) in a placebo-controlled trial was considered unethical in the evaluation of sacubitril/valsartan in HFrEF. While guidelines support management of prevalent comorbidities of HFpEF, there is currently no pharmacological standard of care for this cohort of patients. Renin–angiotensin system inhibitors are widely used among patients with HFpEF, mostly in the treatment of hypertension. Since the addition of sacubitril/valsartan to background ACEi may increase risks of angioedema, a placebo-controlled trial could not be practically carried out and an active control (valsartan) was instead selected as the comparator in PARAGON-HF. As such, we conducted a comprehensive putative placebo analysis to estimate the treatment effects of sacubitril/valsartan if a placebo was selected across key cardiovascular endpoints. We uniquely leveraged pooled, patient-level data from the only clinical trials examining ARNI and RASi across the full range of LVEF. These data reinforce the robust clinical benefits of sacubitril/valsartan in HF. In the aggregate analysis across the full range of LVEF, we estimate treatment effects of 46% reductions in total HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular death. However, we detected notable non-linearity in the treatment effects with event reductions waning at higher LVEF, especially above 60%. Event reductions for the recurrent primary endpoint were estimated to be 48% (when assessing PARADIGM-HF and CHARM-Alternative) and 29% (when assessing PARAGON-HF and CHARM-Preserved). Across the spectrum of LVEF, consistent reductions were observed for all cardiovascular events and mortality endpoints analysed.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^3069d219]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — Patients with HFpEF and hypertension should have medication titrated to attain blood pressure targets in accordance with published clinical practice guidelines to prevent morbidity. In patients with HFpEF, sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) can be beneficial in decreasing HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality, and management of atrial fibrillation (AF) can be useful to improve symptoms. In selected patients with HFpEF, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) may be considered to decrease hospitalizations, and the use of angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi) may be considered to decrease hospitalizations, particularly among patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on the lower end of this spectrum. In patients with HFpEF, routine use of nitrates or phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors to increase activity or quality of life (QOL) is ineffective.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) in chronic symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) NYHA class II or III is recommended as a replacement for an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) to further reduce morbidity and mortality in patients who tolerate an ACE inhibitor or ARB. Trial criteria included mild-to-moderate HF with natriuretic peptide thresholds of either BNP > 150 pg/mL or NT-proBNP ≥ 600 pg/mL, or BNP ≥ 100 pg/mL or NT-proBNP ≥ 400 pg/mL with a prior hospitalization in the preceding 12 months, and required tolerability of enalapril 10 mg twice daily before subsequent ARNI (valsartan/sacubitril) 200 mg twice daily with the ARB component equivalent to valsartan 160 mg, which significantly decreased hospitalizations and mortality compared with enalapril. For initiation and titration, the approved ARNI is available in 3 doses with a trial target dose of 97/103 mg twice daily, and use is associated with hypotension and a low-frequency incidence of angioedema.

### Sacubitril / valsartan initiation among veterans who are renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor Naïve with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction [^ea9455ff]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Multiple approaches that target patients, healthcare providers and healthcare systems may be needed to overcome therapeutic inertia and to increase guideline‐directed medical therapy for patients with HFrEF. Possible patient/provider targeted strategies include increased education, electronic health record embedded clinical decision support tools, remote monitoring, and protocolized care such as the biomarker‐guided care intervention tested in the GUIDE‐IT (Guiding Evidence‐Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment) trial. Healthcare system targeted strategies may include increased alignment across guidelines and performance metrics. Peri‐Okonny et al noted that current performance measures do not include medication intensity information, highlighting an opportunity to support guideline‐directed medical therapy. However, these interventions need to be guided by a greater understanding of the reasons for deviations from guideline‐directed medical therapy. In the GUIDE‐IT trial the most common reasons for lack of titration documented among experienced HF cardiologists was "clinically stable" and "already at maximally tolerated therapy". This finding led Fiuzat et al to speculate that the low prevalence of achieved guideline‐directed medical therapy in their study may have been due to unrealistic goals, in addition to therapeutic inertia. Carefully designed implementation studies are needed to identify barriers to guideline adoption in clinical care, whether there is a need to reevaluate recommendations and to design or adapt strategies to address barriers that can be scaled across healthcare settings.

### Eligibility for sacubitril / valsartan in heart failure across the ejection fraction spectrum: real-world data from the Swedish heart failure registry [^07739b8f]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prognosis in patients with heart failure (HF) remains poor regardless of ejection fraction (EF) [1]. An increasing number of pharmacological treatments have been shown to benefit patients with HF with reduced EF (HFrEF; EF < 40%) [2]. In contrast, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with HF with preserved EF (HFpEF; EF ≥ 50%) were not successful to date. Thus, treatment recommendations in HFpEF are limited to risk factors modification, comorbidities and symptoms management [2]. Notably, patients with HF with mid‐range EF (HFmrEF; EF = 40–49%) have mildly reduced EF but were excluded from HFrEF trials [1]. Post hoc analyses of RCTs suggest that HFmrEF may benefit from established HFrEF treatments [3].

In the PARADIGM‐HF trial, sacubitril/valsartan improved survival/morbidity in HFrEF compared to enalapril [4]. Recently, the PARAGON‐HF trial tested sacubitril/valsartan vs. valsartan in HF with EF ≥ 45% [5]. Lower, although not statistically significant, rates of cardiovascular death/total HF hospitalizations were observed in patients treated with sacubitril/valsartan [5]. Notably, a prespecified subgroup analysis suggested a potential efficacy in patients with EF ≤ median, which was 57%. This suggests that the benefit of sacubitril/valsartan observed in PARADIGM‐HF could extend at least to the mildly reduced EF [5], and thus may even challenge the current definition of HFrEF to include also the mid‐range or mildly reduced EF.

RCTs apply inclusion/exclusion criteria to ensure HF diagnosis, enrich for modifiable events and minimize nonmodifiable competing risk [6, 7]. Therefore, generalizability of RCTs is often questioned and may limit implementation [8]. We assessed the proportion and characteristics of HF patients with reduced/mildly reduced EF (< 50%) and with mildly reduced/preserved EF (EF ≥ 40%) who would be eligible for sacubitril/valsartan based on PARADIGM‐HF/PARAGON‐HF trial inclusion/exclusion criteria.

### Trajectories of sacubitril / valsartan adherence among Medicare beneficiaries with heart Failure [^1feb634d]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a prevalent condition affecting over 6 million Americans, and projections suggest that the number could rise to 8 million by 2030. The incidence rate of HF approaches 10 per 1,000 population after the age of 65 years.HF is also the second-leading cause of hospitalizations in the United States, resulting in more than 4.4 million hospital admissions and costing over $31 billion annually.

Clinical trials have demonstrated that sacubitril/valsartan, an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNi), can improve clinical outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) by reducing the risk of hospitalizations and death. ARNi was approved as a long-term treatment for CHF in the United States in 2015, and it was recommended as a first-line therapy for CHF by the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines in 2017. In the latest AHA/ACC/Heart Failure Society of American (HFSA) 2022 HF treatment guidelines, ARNi is recommended as first-line RASi to reduce morbidity and mortality in HF with reduced ejection fraction and HF with preserved ejection fraction. Due to its efficacy and guideline recommendations, the uptake of ARNi has been steadily increasing. A study utilizing data from the Veterans Health Administration suggested that 26% of veterans with HF with reduced ejection fraction who were renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor naïve in 2019 initiated an ARNi. Despite the benefits of ARNi therapy, adherence remains low among those who use it, limiting the potential for improving health outcomes in patients with HF. For example, in patients from healthcare databases in Sweden, the UK, and the United States between 2016 and 2019, approximately 30% of ARNi users discontinued treatment within 1 year. Furthermore, prior studies have elucidated that patients who identify as Black race or exhibit higher comorbidity burdens, or have lower household income are less likely to initiate or adhere to ARNi therapy.

14.2 Pediatric Heart Failure

The efficacy of ENTRESTO was evaluated in a multinational, randomized, double-blind trial PANORAMA-HF comparing ENTRESTO (n = 187) and enalapril (n = 188) in pediatric patients aged 1 month to less than 18 years old due to systemic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF ≤ 45% or fractional shortening ≤ 22.5%). Patients with systemic right ventricle, single ventricle, restrictive cardiomyopathy or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were excluded from the trial. Efficacy of ENTRESTO in patients less than 1 year old was not established. At Week 52, there were 144 ENTRESTO and 133 enalapril patients with a post-baseline assessment of NT-proBNP. The estimated least squares mean percent reduction from baseline in NT-proBNP was 65% and 62% in the ENTRESTO and enalapril groups, respectively. While the between-group difference was not nominally statistically significant, the reductions for ENTRESTO and enalapril were larger than what was seen in adults; these reductions did not appear to be attributable to post-baseline changes in background therapy.

Because ENTRESTO improved outcomes and reduced NT-proBNP in adults in PARADIGM-HF, the effect on NT-proBNP was the basis to infer improved cardiovascular outcomes in pediatric patients.

### Beneficial and harmful effects of sacubitril / valsartan in patients with heart failure: a systematic review of randomised clinical trials with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^3f1c6ff1]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Worldwide, an estimated 37 million people have a diagnosis of heart failure. The lifetime risk for developing heart failure is approximately 20%. The prevalence of heart failure is increasing, presumably caused by an increase in both life expectancy and risk factors leading to heart failure as well as improved treatment of acute cardiovascular events.

Guidelines recommend treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with a beta-blocker and an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)). It is recommended to add a mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonist in patients who remain symptomatic after this initial treatment.

New drugs for heart failure have been developed and approved that combine inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system pathway (with an ARB) with inhibition of the neprilysin enzyme. These new types of drugs are classified as angiotensin receptor blocker neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs).

The European Society of Cardiology recommends ARNIs as a replacement for ACE-I in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (EF < 35%) who remain symptomatic (New York Heart Association (NYHA) II to IV) despite optimal medical therapy with an ACE-I, a beta-blocker and a mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonist (unless there are contraindications). The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Heart Failure Society of America, make similar recommendations.

To our knowledge, the effects of ARNIs have not been assessed previously in a systematic review.

### Sacubitril / valsartan and loop diuretic requirement in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in the PARAGON-HF trial [^0cc7b8d1]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clinical congestion represents a hallmark feature of heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and its management, typically with loop diuretics, is guideline‐recommended as a key component of comprehensive care. Higher doses of loop diuretics however have been associated with markers of neurohormonal excess and progression of kidney disease; as such, loop diuretic sparing strategies are welcome in clinical practice. Neprilysin inhibition results in increases in circulating natriuretic peptides which in turn promote diuresis and natriuresis. In patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), sacubitril/valsartan was associated with reduced loop diuretic requirement compared with treatment with enalapril. Expert consensus guidelines now suggest consideration of reduced loop diuretic requirement upon initiation of sacubitril/valsartan; however, limited data exist on the effect of sacubitril/valsartan on longitudinal diuretic use specifically in patients with HFpEF. This may be particularly important in HFpEF given a tendency to greater preload dependence compared to patients with HFrEF.

The PARAGON‐HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI with ARB Global Outcomes in HF with Preserved Ejection Fraction) trial demonstrated a modest, but statistically non‐significant reduction in the primary composite outcome of total HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular death with sacubitril/valsartan versus valsartan. Secondary analyses have suggested the potential for accentuated clinical benefit of sacubitril/valsartan in proximity to HF hospitalization. Some have even suggested that initiation of sacubitril/valsartan may be preferentially considered in patients with a more congested HF phenotype.

In this secondary analysis of the PARAGON‐HF trial, we sought to assess the efficacy and safety of sacubitril/valsartan relative to valsartan according to background diuretic therapy and to examine the effect of sacubitril/valsartan on longitudinal patterns of diuretic use.

### A putative placebo analysis of the effects of sacubitril / valsartan in heart failure across the full range of ejection fraction [^39f4649a]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), sacubitril/valsartan, was tested against active comparators in paired, similarly designed trials of heart failure (HF) that covered the spectrum of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Trials were designed to test the value of neprilysin inhibition, added to standard background therapy, inclusive of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi). The PARADIGM-HF (Prospective comparison of ARNI with ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and morbidity in Heart Failure) trialcompared sacubitril/valsartan against enalapril, as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) are ethically mandated background therapy, represent the regulatory gold standard, and are supported by Class I, level of evidence A recommendations by international guidelines in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The PARAGON-HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI with ARB Global Outcomes in HF With Preserved Ejection Fraction) trialcompared sacubitril/valsartan against valsartan, as RASi are used in the vast majority of patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) to achieve blood pressure control and to treat comorbidities (such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and coronary artery disease) to goals recommended by clinical practice guidelines. While these trials inform the incremental efficacy and safety of ARNI compared with RASi, regulators and clinicians may be interested in understanding the combined effects of ARNI when compared with placebo. We employed established statistical approaches to estimate treatment effects of ARNI against a putative placebo comparator, leveraging data from two large clinical trial programmes evaluating sacubitril/valsartan and the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), candesartan, across the full range of LVEF.

Abstract

Aims

Whether prior treatment with angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) modifies efficacy and safety of sacubitril/valsartan (Sac/Val) in patients with heart failure (HF) and ejection fraction (EF) > 40% is unclear, thus Sac/Val according to ACEi/ARB status at baseline was assessed.

Methods and results

This was a pre‐specified analysis of Prospective comparison of ARNI with ARB Given following stabiLization In DEcompensated HFpEF (PARAGLIDE‐HF), a double‐blind, randomized controlled trial of Sac/Val versus valsartan, categorizing patients according to baseline ACEi/ARB status. The primary endpoint was time‐averaged proportional change in N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) from baseline through weeks 4 and 8. Secondary analyses included a win‐ratio analysis of the hierarchical outcome of (i) cardiovascular death; (ii) HF hospitalizations; (iii) urgent HF visits; and (iv) time‐averaged proportional change in NT‐proBNP from baseline to weeks 4 and 8, in addition to safety outcomes. Among 466 patients, 107 (23%) were ACEi/ARB naïve at the time of randomization. NT‐proBNP favoured Sac/Val irrespective of ACEi/ARB status (naïve: 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51–1.13; users: 0.88, 95% CI 0.74–1.05; p interaction = 0.52). The win ratio of the hierarchical outcome was 1.13 (95% CI 0.86–1.49) for ACEi/ARB users and 1.38 (95% CI 0.81–2.37) for ACEi/ARB naïve (p interaction = 0.51). Safety endpoints showed non‐significant interactions by ACEi/ARB status, with odds ratio of 1.79 (95% CI 0.68–4.72) and 0.71 (95% CI 0.29–1.78) for symptomatic hypotension and worsening renal function, respectively for ACEi/ARB naïve.

Conclusion

In HF with EF > 40% stabilized after worsening HF, safety and efficacy were similar irrespective of ACEi/ARB status at baseline, supporting early initiation irrespective of prior ACEi/ARB use.

### Sacubitril / valsartan and loop diuretic requirement in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in the PARAGON-HF trial [^01c7db15]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Aims

As sacubitril/valsartan may potentiate early natriuresis, expert consensus documents recommend diuretic dose reduction on first initiation. However, there are limited data on the effects of sacubitril/valsartan on the background of varying diuretic regimens or on diuretic requirements over time in heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

Methods and results

In this post hoc analysis of PARAGON‐HF, of the 4796 patients, background diuretic therapy was distributed as follows: 341 (7%) on no diuretic, 698 (15%) on non‐loop diuretic, and 3757 (78%) were on loop diuretics (1255, 1589, and 913 were on < 40, 40 and > 40 mg furosemide equivalent doses, respectively). The primary composite outcome of total HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular death was analysed using semiparametric proportional rates methods. The cumulative incidence of the primary composite outcome (first events) was lowest in patients on no diuretic and highest in those on > 40 mg of loop diuretic (p < 0.001). The effects of sacubitril/valsartan (vs. valsartan) on the primary composite outcome (recurrent events) did not significantly vary by baseline diuretic use (p interaction = 0.65). Treatment effects on safety outcomes were similar across diuretic categories. Sacubitril/valsartan reduced new loop diuretic initiations over the course of the trial (hazard ratio 0.83; 95% confidence interval 0.68–1.00, p = 0.055), with similar mean loop diuretic dose and rates of diuretic discontinuation between treatment groups in follow‐up. Patients randomized to sacubitril/valsartan experienced a slight early reduction in diuretic initiation or dose escalation at 30 days after initiation (net reduction 1.7%, p = 0.02), but these differences were not sustained beyond this timepoint.

Conclusions

Patients with HFpEF on higher baseline diuretic doses were at heightened risk of HF events, but similarly benefited from sacubitril/valsartan with a consistent safety profile across a range of diuretic doses. Initiation of sacubitril/valsartan was associated with modestly lower new loop diuretic requirement in follow‐up.

Use of ARNI in advanced HFrEF and tolerance: In LIFE, which randomized HFrEF patients with NYHA functional class IV symptoms to ARNI vs ARB, sacubitril/valsartan showed no statistically significant difference in NT-proBNP versus valsartan, no difference in clinical outcomes, and an increase in hyperkalemia events; nearly one-half of participants were unable to tolerate ARNI. Nonetheless, the Writing Committee recommends its use in those who can tolerate it, with careful monitoring for adverse side effects, such as hyperkalemia.

### Sacubitril and valsartan (Entresto) [^f94397e9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The population was 66% Caucasian, 18% Asian, and 5% Black; the mean age was 64 years and 78% were male. At randomization, 70% of patients were NYHA Class II, 24% were NYHA Class III, and 0.7% were NYHA Class IV. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 29%. The underlying cause of heart failure was coronary artery disease in 60% of patients; 71% had a history of hypertension, 43% had a history of myocardial infarction, 37% had an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73m2, and 35% had diabetes mellitus. Most patients were taking beta-blockers (94%), mineralocorticoid antagonists (58%), and diuretics (82%). Few patients had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D) (15%).

PARADIGM-HF demonstrated that ENTRESTO, a combination of sacubitril and an RAS inhibitor (valsartan), was superior to a RAS inhibitor (enalapril), in reducing the risk of the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure, based on a time-to-event analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73, 0.87, p < 0.0001). The treatment effect reflected a reduction in both cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization; see Table 4 and Figure 3. Sudden death accounted for 45% of cardiovascular deaths, followed by pump failure, which accounted for 26%.

### Systolic blood pressure in heart Failure with preserved ejection fraction treated With sacubitril / valsartan [^0bee536a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend targeting systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 130 mm Hg in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) with limited data.

Objectives

This study sought to determine the optimal achieved SBP and whether the treatment effects of sacubitril/valsartan on outcomes are related to BP lowering, particularly among women who derive greater benefit from sacubitril/valsartan.

Methods

Using 4,795 trial participants, this study related baseline and time-updated mean achieved SBP quartiles (< 120, 120 to 129, 130 to 139, ≥ 140 mm Hg) to the primary outcome (cardiovascular death and total heart failure hospitalization), its components, myocardial infarction or stroke, and a renal composite outcome. At the 16-week visit, the study assessed the relationship between SBP change and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary score (KCCQ-OSS) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). The study analyzed whether the BP-lowering effects of sacubitril/valsartan accounted for its treatment effects.

Results

Average age was 73 ± 8 years, and 52% of participants were women. After multivariable adjustment, baseline and mean achieved SBP of 120 to 129 mm Hg demonstrated the lowest risk for all outcomes. Sacubitril/valsartan reduced SBP by 5.2 mm Hg (95% confidence interval: 4.4 to 6.0) compared with valsartan at 4 weeks, which was not modified by baseline SBP. However, sacubitril/valsartan reduced SBP more in women (6.3 mm Hg) than men (4.0 mm Hg) (interaction p = 0.005). Change in SBP was directly associated with change in NT-proBNP (p < 0.001) but not KCCQ-OSS (p = 0.40). The association between sacubitril/valsartan and the primary outcome was not modified by baseline SBP (interaction p = 0.50) and was similar when adjusting for time-updated SBP, regardless of sex.

Conclusions

Baseline and mean achieved SBP of 120 to 129 mm Hg identified the lowest risk patients with HFpEF. Baseline SBP did not modify the treatment effect of sacubitril/valsartan, and the BP-lowering effects of sacubitril/valsartan did not account for its effects on outcomes, regardless of sex.

### A putative placebo analysis of the effects of sacubitril / valsartan in heart failure across the full range of ejection fraction [^833ea52a]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Ideally, active-controlled and reference trials are similarly designed in the same era of background therapy with comparable reference drugs and dosing. However, as CHARM is the only clinical trial programme which evaluated a RASi in symptomatic HF across the full range of LVEF with long-term outcomes, this was selected as the historical reference comparator. While the SOLVD (Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction) Treatment trial could have been used as a comparator for PARADIGM-HF, patients were enrolled in this trial from 1986 to 1989 and CHARM-Alternative reflects a more conservative treatment effect estimate (as candesartan displayed relatively less benefit than enalapril as compared with placebo). As such, the RASi evaluated in the active-controlled trials (PARADIGM-HF and PARAGON-HF) differed from that studied in the reference trials (CHARM-Alternative and CHARM-Preserved). While irbesartan, another ARB, has been studied in HFpEF, the agent has not been studied in a comparable trial in HFrEF. However, it is reassuring that valsartan 160 mg twice daily (as tested in PARAGON-HF) and candesartan 32 mg once daily (as tested in CHARM) both have similarly potent biological activity in blood pressure loweringand both represent target doses in contemporary guidelines. It is further reassuring that the primary endpoints (either first or total HF hospitalization and/or cardiovascular death) were common across trials, and events were adjudicated under similar rigorous procedures by independent clinical endpoints committees.

These analyses further inform decision-making surrounding use of sacubitril/valsartan in HF. Estimation of the placebo-controlled response of a novel therapy is especially relevant in a disease entity, such as HFpEF that lacks a definitive standard of care. These data reinforce that the beneficial effects of sacubitril/valsartan on HF events and cardiovascular mortality appear to extend up to an LVEF below normal, including in 'HF with mid-ranged ejection fraction'. Sacubitril/valsartan is currently approved for use in HFrEF and is undergoing regulatory review for use at higher LVEF. Defining single LVEF thresholds for use is challenging given the inherent imprecision and variability in LVEF assessment and since certain subgroups (such as women) may derive benefits to a higher LVEF. Costs, access, and ease of implementation will further modify the ultimate application of this therapy in HF at higher ranges of LVEF.

Economic value of angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) therapy — three high‑quality analyses consistently found costs per QALY ≤ $60 000, providing high value by the guideline's benchmarks; results were robust to sacubitril‑valsartan cost ranges but sensitive to estimated mortality reduction and duration of treatment effect; ARNi would need to maintain effectiveness beyond the PARADIGM‑HF study period (mean, 27 months) to be considered high value, and if clinical benefit were limited to 27 months, ARNi would be intermediate value; an additional analysis found inpatient initiation was also high value versus delayed postdischarge initiation.

### Sacubitril / valsartan: the newest addition to the toolbox for guideline-directed medical therapy of heart failure [^cb47b370]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Sacubitril/valsartan combines a neprilysin inhibitor with an angiotensin receptor blocker. As an inhibitor of neprilysin, an enzyme that degrades biologically active natriuretic peptides, this first-in-class therapy increases levels of circulating natriuretic peptides, resulting in natriuretic, diuretic, and vasodilatory effects. In patients with chronic New York Heart Association class II-IV heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, the PARADIGM-HF trial demonstrated that sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the primary endpoint of cardiovascular mortality and heart failure hospitalization, compared with enalapril. The rate of all-cause mortality was also significantly reduced. Subsequently, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Failure Society of America recently updated guideline recommendations for Stage C patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction to recommend angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or sacubitril/valsartan in conjunction with other evidence-based therapies to reduce morbidity and mortality. Several analyses have suggested the cost-effectiveness of this new therapy. To ensure tolerability, initiating the lower dosage form of sacubitril/valsartan is warranted in patients with severe renal impairment, moderate hepatic impairment, and low blood pressure, and close monitoring is warranted in such patients. A 36-hour washout period is recommended when switching patients from an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor to sacubitril/valsartan. Similarly, sacubitril/valsartan is contraindicated in patients receiving concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker and those with a history of angioedema.

### Sacubitril / valsartan versus valsartan initiation in patients naïve to renin-angiotensin system inhibitors: insights from PARAGLIDE-HF [^2d98baee]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Whether prior treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) modifies efficacy and safety of sacubitril/valsartan (Sac/Val) in patients with heart failure (HF) and ejection fraction (EF) > 40% is unclear, thus Sac/Val according to ACEi/ARB status at baseline was assessed.

Methods and Results

This was a pre-specified analysis of Prospective comparison of ARNI with ARB Given following stabiLization In DEcompensated HFpEF (PARAGLIDE-HF), a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of Sac/Val versus valsartan, categorizing patients according to baseline ACEi/ARB status. The primary endpoint was time-averaged proportional change in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) from baseline through weeks 4 and 8. Secondary analyses included a win-ratio analysis of the hierarchical outcome of (i) cardiovascular death; (ii) HF hospitalizations; (iii) urgent HF visits; and (iv) time-averaged proportional change in NT-proBNP from baseline to weeks 4 and 8, in addition to safety outcomes. Among 466 patients, 107 (23%) were ACEi/ARB naïve at the time of randomization. NT-proBNP favoured Sac/Val irrespective of ACEi/ARB status (naïve: 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51–1.13; users: 0.88, 95% CI 0.74–1.05; p interaction = 0.52). The win ratio of the hierarchical outcome was 1.13 (95% CI 0.86–1.49) for ACEi/ARB users and 1.38 (95% CI 0.81–2.37) for ACEi/ARB naïve (p interaction = 0.51). Safety endpoints showed non-significant interactions by ACEi/ARB status, with odds ratio of 1.79 (95% CI 0.68–4.72) and 0.71 (95% CI 0.29–1.78) for symptomatic hypotension and worsening renal function, respectively for ACEi/ARB naïve.

Conclusion

In HF with EF > 40% stabilized after worsening HF, safety and efficacy were similar irrespective of ACEi/ARB status at baseline, supporting early initiation irrespective of prior ACEi/ARB use.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^901d221c]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

HFpEF blood pressure management — blood pressure control is well established for prevention of HF and reduction of cardiovascular events and mortality; in HFpEF, targets are extrapolated from hypertension guidelines. RAAS antagonists including ACEi, ARB, MRA, and possibly ARNi, could be first-line agents in HFpEF trials. Beta blockers may be used to treat hypertension in patients with a history of MI, symptomatic CAD, or AF with rapid ventricular response, and this needs to be balanced with the potential contribution of chronotropic incompetence to exercise intolerance in some patients.

Heart failure (HF) is a global epidemic affecting millions of individuals worldwide. Although important progress has been made in the management of HF, this condition remains a common cause of morbidity and death. Since the publication of the previous sets of guidelines for the management of HF, new diagnostic and therapeutic options for HF have emerged. Now, both the ESC and the ACC/AHA/HFSA have simultaneously published an update of their guidelines incorporating, among others, recommendations for the use of new pharmacological therapies for the treatment of HF. For this Viewpoint article, we have asked the chairs of the ESC Task Force, the chairs of the ACC/AHA/HFSA Writing Committee, and an independent opinion leader in the field to offer their expert insight into the new guidelines, highlighting what is new, what the main differences are between the two sets of guidelines, and what steps should be taken to improve the guidelines in future updates.

### What is the current best drug treatment for hypertensive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction? Review of the totality of evidence [^a66461a7]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

The effect of sacubitril–valsartan in patients with HFpEF was investigated in the Prospective comparison of Angiotensin Receptor neprilysin inhibitor with Angiotensin receptor blocker Global Outcomes in the HFpEF (PARAGON-HF) trial, which was designed for ethical reasons using valsartan rather than placebo as the comparator. However, 95% of patients received a diuretic and 75% a beta-blocker at baseline. Thus, the comparison was valsartan + hydrochlorothiazide + beta-blockade vs. valsartan–sacubitril + hydrochlorothiazide + beta-blockade. Ideally, the comparison should have been valsartan + hydrochlorothiazide + beta-blockade vs. valsartan–sacubitril + beta-blockade. The double dose of diuretics with different sites of action is probably important. Despite the intrinsically effective comparator, valsartan, considering the results of candesartan in CHARM and irbesartan in I-PRESERVE and the inclusion of a predominance of patients with NYHA class II (not-so-severe HF), PARAGON-HF showed borderline significant results favoring ARNI (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87, 95% confidence intervals 0.753–1.005, P = 0.058). After subsequent review of the totality of the evidence, and taking into consideration the benefits in HFrEF in the Prospective Comparison of ARNI with ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure Trial (PARADIGM), suggesting benefit across a wide range of LVEF, FDA approved sacubitril–valsartan as a treatment for HF with "up to normal" LVEF. Additionally, the reno-protective properties of ARNI were superior to those of RAS inhibitors — a further benefit for the HFpEF population, in which renal dysfunction is common.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^d8196526]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Classification of HF by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) — definitions and thresholds are specified: LVEF is considered important in classifying patients because of differing prognosis, treatment responses, and trial selection, and randomized controlled trials with survival benefit have mainly enrolled patients with an LVEF ≤ 35% or ≤ 40%, often labeled HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). In this guideline, HFrEF is defined as LVEF ≤ 40%. HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) represents at least 50% of the HF population and has been variably classified as LVEF > 40%, > 45%, or ≥ 50%; in this guideline, the threshold for HFpEF is an LVEF ≥ 50%.

Heart failure classification and trajectories based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) indicate that patients with HFrEF who improve LVEF to > 40% are considered HFimpEF and should continue HFrEF treatment; for those improving from mildly reduced LVEF (41%-49%) to ≥ 50% there is limited evidence to guide therapy, and it is unclear whether to treat these patients as HFpEF or HFmrEF.

New presentation of HFrEF — prevalence, outcomes, and initial therapy considerations during hospitalization. "A new diagnosis of HFrEF may be present in a third or more of patients hospitalized with HF". Compared with decompensated chronic HF, "new-onset (or "de novo") HF usually presents at a younger age and with fewer comorbidities; congestive symptoms are similar, but rales are somewhat more common", and "rates of discharge with residual congestion, early readmission, and mortality at 1 and 6 months are lower for new-onset HF, excluding the few patients presenting initially with cardiogenic shock". "Ideally, patients with new HF would receive all "pillars" of HF therapy during the initial hospitalization, including SGLT inhibitors, a diuretic plan, and the 3 neurohormonal modulators", though combining therapies rapidly "may require distribution in a "spending function", due to effects on blood pressure". Baseline therapy is variable as "20% to 40% of patients admitted with new-onset HF may be on ACE inhibitors/ARBs or beta-blockers for other reasons", yet "most patients with newly diagnosed HF are not on neurohormonal modulators". The PIONEER-HF trial "included 34% of patients with a new HF diagnosis (mean SBP 118 mm Hg)", and "showed substantial benefit for sacubitril/valsartan over enalapril".

### Sacubitril / valsartan and loop diuretic requirement in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in the PARAGON-HF trial [^92532e64]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

As sacubitril/valsartan may potentiate early natriuresis, expert consensus documents recommend diuretic dose reduction on first initiation. However, there are limited data on the effects of sacubitril/valsartan on the background of varying diuretic regimens or on diuretic requirements over time in heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

Methods and Results

In this post hoc analysis of PARAGON-HF, of the 4796 patients, background diuretic therapy was distributed as follows: 341 (7%) on no diuretic, 698 (15%) on non-loop diuretic, and 3757 (78%) were on loop diuretics (1255, 1589, and 913 were on < 40, 40 and > 40mg furosemide equivalent doses, respectively). The primary composite outcome of total HF hospitalizations and cardiovascular death was analysed using semiparametric proportional rates methods. The cumulative incidence of the primary composite outcome (first events) was lowest in patients on no diuretic and highest in those on > 40mg of loop diuretic (p < 0.001). The effects of sacubitril/valsartan (vs. valsartan) on the primary composite outcome (recurrent events) did not significantly vary by baseline diuretic use (p interaction = 0.65). Treatment effects on safety outcomes were similar across diuretic categories. Sacubitril/valsartan reduced new loop diuretic initiations over the course of the trial (hazard ratio 0.83; 95% confidence interval 0.68–1.00, p = 0.055), with similar mean loop diuretic dose and rates of diuretic discontinuation between treatment groups in follow-up. Patients randomized to sacubitril/valsartan experienced a slight early reduction in diuretic initiation or dose escalation at 30days after initiation (net reduction 1.7%, p = 0.02), but these differences were not sustained beyond this timepoint.

Conclusions

Patients with HFpEF on higher baseline diuretic doses were at heightened risk of HF events, but similarly benefited from sacubitril/valsartan with a consistent safety profile across a range of diuretic doses. Initiation of sacubitril/valsartan was associated with modestly lower new loop diuretic requirement in follow-up.

### Sacubitril and valsartan (Entresto) [^92bcbc67]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The population was 81% Caucasian, 13% Asian, and 2% Black; the mean age was 73 years and 52% were female. At randomization, 77% of patients were NYHA Class II, 19% were NYHA Class III, and 0.4% were NYHA Class IV. The median left ventricular ejection fraction was 57%. The underlying cause of heart failure was of ischemic etiology in 36% of patients. Furthermore, 96% had a history of hypertension, 23% had a history of myocardial infarction, 46% had an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and 43% had diabetes mellitus. Most patients were taking beta-blockers (80%) and diuretics (95%).

PARAGON-HF demonstrated that ENTRESTO had a numerical reduction in the rate of the composite endpoint of total (first and recurrent) HF hospitalizations and CV death, based on an analysis using a proportional rates model (rate ratio [RR] 0.87; 95% CI [0.75, 1.01], p = 0.06); see Table 5. The treatment effect was primarily driven by the reduction in total HF hospitalizations in patients randomized to ENTRESTO (RR 0.85; 95% CI [0.72, 1.00]).

Figure 5 shows the mean number of composite endpoint events of total HF hospitalizations and CV death over time.

### Factors associated with sacubitril / valsartan continuation and the methods of combining heart failure medications in patients with heart failure [^b1421354]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The number of patients with heart failure (HF) is increasing annually worldwide. In Japan, the 1-year rehospitalization rate due to worsening HF is 25%, and the 1-year all-cause mortality rate is 23%, with poor prognosis.HF is classified into 3 categories based on the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF), and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). HF treatment guidelines indicate the treatment for each category. - For patients with HFrEF, a combination of 4 HF medications is recommended: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB)/angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). - For patients with HFmrEF and HFpEF, treatment of comorbidities, such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes, and administration of diuretics for congestion is the standard treatment. - This includes using medications, such as ACEi/ARB/ARNI, beta-blockers, MRA, SGLT2i, anticoagulants, antiarrhythmics, and hypoglycemic agents. Furthermore, patients whose LVEF is improved to > 40%, referred to as patients HF with improved ejection fraction, are recommended to continue HF treatment even after their LVEF has increased.

### Safety and tolerability of sacubitril / valsartan in chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction: results from the open-label extension of the PARADIGM-HF study [^4e1c6d5d]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Sacubitril/valsartan, an angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), is recommended by the 2022 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Failure Society of America guideline for heart failure (HF) in patients with HF with reduced ejection faction, New York Heart Association class II−III, and by the 2021 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines to replace angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) for reducing HF hospitalizations and death risk. These recommendations stem from the PARADIGM‐HF trial, which showed sacubitril/valsartan's superiority over enalapril in reducing cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization by 20%, although long‐term safety data beyond 27 months were not available.

Despite guideline recommendations, clinical practice highlights a low adoption of recommended doses of HF therapies. In CHAMP‐HF, most patients received ACEIs/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB)/ARNI, beta‐blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists; however, only 13% of patients were prescribed ARNI, with 14% at target dose. Similarly, the ESC‐HF Registry data indicate that only 30% of patients received recommended doses, often limited by adverse event (AE) concerns. Patients in PARADIGM‐HF largely represent the real‐world HF population. Safety assessment of PARADIGM‐HF trial over 12 months showed that sacubitril/valsartan reduced blood pressure, while enalapril increased renal impairment, hyperkalaemia, and cough incidents. The PARADIGM‐HF open‐label extension (OLE; NCT02226120), a single‐arm follow‐up study, continued safety and tolerability evaluations of sacubitril/valsartan post‐trial until clinical approval (from October 2014 to December 2017) at 397 centres across 60 countries. The study enrolled patients who completed the double‐blind phase of the PARADIGM‐HF trial. After an initial treatment with 49/51 mg sacubitril/valsartan twice daily (BID), the dose was planned to be up‐titrated to 97/103 mg, with dose adjustments based on tolerance (online supplementary Figure S1). Safety was assessed every 6 months. The primary outcome of the study was to evaluate the long‐term (30 months) safety and tolerability of sacubitril/valsartan, based on the incidence of AEs, serious AEs, AEs leading to dose adjustments, and temporary or permanent discontinuations.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension — heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) management: Diuretics should be used for signs and/or symptoms of volume overload. RAASi are indicated for management of HFpEF to attain an SBP of < 130 mm Hg, especially with an MRA or ARNi, or ARB when ARNi is not feasible. BB are not recommended for hypertension management with HFpEF and should be restricted to specific comorbid conditions. SGLT2i are used frequently for HFpEF treatment to reduce hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality, may lower BP, and may require adjustment of other antihypertensives if hypotension symptoms are present.

### How to manage heart Failure with preserved ejection fraction: practical guidance for clinicians [^5859fcf4]. JACC: Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

Although patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) (left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 50%) comprise nearly half of those with chronic heart failure, evidence-based treatment options for this population have historically been limited. Recently, however, emerging data from prospective, randomized trials enrolling patients with HFpEF have greatly altered the range of pharmacologic options to modify disease progression in selected patients with HFpEF. In the context of this evolving landscape, clinicians are increasingly in need of practical guidance regarding the best approach to management of this growing population. In this review, the authors build on the recently published heart failure guidelines by integrating contemporary data from recent randomized trials to provide a contemporary framework for diagnosis and evidence-based treatment of patients with HFpEF. Where gaps in knowledge persist, the authors provide "best available" data from post hoc analyses of clinical trials or data from observational studies to guide management until more definitive studies are available.

### Effects of sacubitril / valsartan vs valsartan in De novo vs acute on chronic HFpEF and HFmrEF [^20c597f1]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

These findings suggest that once removing the "noise" of the population least likely to benefit (EF > 60%), the beneficial effect of sacubitril/valsartan appears to be even stronger, regardless of HF chronicity. Direct comparison between EF ≤ 60% and > 60% was not within the scope of this paper, and analysis of the > 60% group was not performed due to small sample size in this group. Although a small sample size may limit the power of this analysis, future studies could specifically recruit patients with a below normal EF to provide further evidence.

Study limitations

This study is a prespecified subgroup analysis but is nonetheless hypothesis-generating, and thus causations cannot be inferred from the associations presented here. Furthermore, the smaller sample size created by subgroup analysis, in addition to a low event rate, may result in limited power to detect differences between groups. Randomization was not stratified by HF chronicity, and there may be residual unmeasured confounding that affects the outcomes of this study.

### Sacubitril / valsartan versus valsartan initiation in patients naïve to renin-angiotensin system inhibitors: insights from PARAGLIDE-HF [^45566f77]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with heart failure (HF) with mildly reduced and preserved ejection fraction (EF) represent growing subsets of patients with HF with substantial morbidity and mortality. The PARAGLIDE‐HF (Prospective comparison of ARNI with ARB Given following stabiLization In DEcompensated HFpEF) trial evaluated sacubitril/valsartan (Sac/Val) compared with valsartan (Val) among a diverse group of patients with an EF > 40% enrolled within 30 days of a worsening heart failure (WHF) event. The primary results demonstrated a greater reduction in time‐averaged N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) in the Sac/Val group. The inclusion of patients with and without prior use of renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors in PARAGLIDE‐HF provides an opportunity to evaluate different treatment effects according to baseline exposure to RAS inhibitors, which is in this patient population incompletely characterized.

Previous research in patients with HF with reduced EF supports that Sac/Val is equally beneficial in patients who are naïve to angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) compared with ACEi/ARB users. Whether these findings extend to patients with EF > 40% who are naïve to an ACEi or ARB is unknown. Hence, this pre‐specified subgroup analysis of the PARAGLIDE‐HF trial aims to investigate the effects of Sac/Val on NT‐proBNP and clinical outcomes compared with Val among patients with HF and EF > 40% who are ACEi/ARB naïve.

### Clinical effectiveness of sacubitril / valsartan among patients hospitalized for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^71e4ba25]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background Sacubitril/Valsartan has been highly efficacious in randomized trials of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, the effectiveness of sacubitril/valsartan in older patients hospitalized for HFrEF in real-world US practice is unclear. Methods and Results This study included Medicare beneficiaries age ≥ 65 years who were hospitalized for HFrEF ≤ 40% in the Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure registry between October 2015 and December 2018, and eligible for sacubitril/valsartan. Associations between discharge prescription of sacubitril/valsartan and clinical outcomes were assessed after inverse probability of treatment weighting and adjustment for other HFrEF medications. Overall, 1551 (10.9%) patients were discharged on sacubitril/valsartan. Of those not prescribed sacubitril/valsartan, 7857 (62.0%) were prescribed an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker. Over 12-month follow-up, compared with a discharge prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker, sacubitril/valsartan was independently associated with lower all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72–0.94; P = 0.004) but not all-cause hospitalization (adjusted HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.89–1.07; P = 0.55) or heart failure hospitalization (adjusted HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.91–1.18; P = 0.59). Patients prescribed sacubitril/valsartan versus those without a prescription had lower risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.60–0.79; P < 0.001), all-cause hospitalization (adjusted HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82–0.98; P = 0.02), but not heart failure hospitalization (adjusted HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.82–1.08; P = 0.40). Conclusions Among patients hospitalized for HFrEF, prescription of sacubitril/valsartan at discharge was independently associated with reduced postdischarge mortality compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker, and reduced mortality and all-cause hospitalization compared with no sacubitril/valsartan. These findings support the use of sacubitril/valsartan to improve postdischarge outcomes among older patients hospitalized for HFrEF in routine US clinical practice.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Prevention of HF in adults with hypertension — epidemiology and rationale: "Incident hypertension is present in 71% of patients with HFpEF, and the presence of hypertension in people < 40 years of age is highly associated with the development of incident HF". Furthermore, "There is a dose-dependent association between BP level and HF risk, and long-term treatment of systolic and diastolic hypertension has been shown to reduce this risk". Additionally, "Meta-analyses of clinical trials support BP control, rather than a specific medication class, to prevent HF".

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^8a92eedc]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for heart failure, more specifically with respect to management of HFpEF, ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend to consider initiating mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists to decrease hospitalizations in selected patients with HFpEF, particularly with LVEF on the lower end of this spectrum.

### Sacubitril / valsartan and loop diuretic requirement in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in the PARAGON-HF trial [^f511a137]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2023). Medium credibility.

The discrepancy in influence of sacubitril/valsartan on diuretic dose between patients with HFpEF versus HFrEF may lie in reasons for diuretic dose titration. Downstream diuretic dose adjustments are frequently made to mitigate the deleterious effects of diuretics including hypotension, even in the face of persistent congestion. Patients with HFpEF are known to have a blood pressure profile that is significantly higher in comparison to patients with HFrEF. Indeed, the baseline systolic blood pressure among randomized patients in PARAGON‐HFwas approximately 10 mmHg higher than patients in PARADIGM‐HF. The difference in baseline blood pressure in these two HF phenotypes may partially explain the observed variability in diuretic dose adjustment.

On the other hand, sacubitril/valsartan resulted in a borderline significant 17% reduction in new loop diuretic initiations and a small early net reduction in overall loop diuretic requirement. Worsening HF is common in patients with HFpEF, and may occur even in those in ambulatory care, and often managed with escalation of loop diuretics. The borderline reduction in new loop diuretic use may represent another facet of prevention of worsening HF with sacubitril/valsartan.
