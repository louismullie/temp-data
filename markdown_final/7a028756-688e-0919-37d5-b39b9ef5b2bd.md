## Question

How to use nicotine patch

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to use a nicotine patch for smoking cessation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about selecting the right patch dose and formulation. Then, I should verify timing relative to the quit date, including preloading. Next, I will review application technique and rotation. After that, I need to check duration, tapering, and what to do if a lapse occurs. I will then consider combination therapy and special populations. Finally, I should confirm safety, monitoring, and how to integrate behavioral support and guideline preferences into a practical plan.

> Let me first confirm dose selection and formulation, because getting the right starting dose matters for withdrawal control. For most adults who smoke 10 or more cigarettes per day, a 21 mg/24-hour patch is standard, with 14 mg and 7 mg used for tapering. For lighter smokers or those with sensitivity, a 15 mg/16-hour patch may be reasonable, though higher-dose patches outperform lower-dose ones in some comparisons, so I should tailor to dependence and tolerance while avoiding excessive nicotine exposure [^d7b0d877] [^3c129d56]. Wait, let me verify the higher-dose question: 42/44 mg patches have not shown clear superiority over 21/22 mg and may increase withdrawals, so I should not routinely escalate above 21 mg unless there is a compelling, individualized rationale and close monitoring for tolerability [^d7b0d877] [^2e5f0222].

> Next, I should review timing relative to quit day, and here is where preloading enters the conversation. Preloading with a patch for about 1–2 weeks before the target quit date can modestly improve quit rates, likely via receptor desensitization and reduced smoking satisfaction, but the signal is heterogeneous and sensitive to risk of bias, so I need to discuss pros and cons and consider patient preference and prior failures with standard starts [^d7b0d877] [^92ad5841]. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude: pooled estimates suggest roughly a 25% relative increase in quit chances with preloading, but removing high-bias studies attenuates the effect, so I should frame this as a conditional strategy rather than default care [^d7b0d877] [^79cf0b30].

> I will now examine application technique, because adherence and skin tolerance drive outcomes. The patch should be applied to clean, dry, hair-free skin on the upper body, rotating sites daily and avoiding the same spot for at least a week to minimize irritation. If sleep disturbance or vivid dreams occur with a 24-hour patch, switching to 16-hour use or removing the patch at night is reasonable, and I should confirm that patients wash hands after handling patches to avoid inadvertent nicotine exposure [^903a2888]. Let me double-check disposal: fold used patches in half, sticky sides together, and keep out of reach of children and pets to prevent accidental ingestion or exposure [^903a2888].

> Now, duration and tapering. Standard treatment is 8–12 weeks, but extending therapy to 24 weeks can improve outcomes in some smokers, and maintenance up to 52 weeks is safe though benefits beyond 24 weeks are less clear, so I should individualize duration based on dependence, cravings, and relapse risk, and consider tapering the dose in the final weeks rather than abrupt cessation to ease withdrawal [^9556eb0f] [^b99a68f6]. Wait, I should verify whether tapering is mandatory: labeling often includes a taper, but evidence does not show a consistent advantage of tapering over abrupt cessation, so tapering is reasonable but not strictly required if the patient prefers to stop abruptly and is doing well [^d7b0d877].

> If the patient lapses, I need to ensure we do not stop the patch prematurely. Continuing the patch after a slip is associated with higher recovery of abstinence than stopping it, so I should counsel patients to persist with treatment and recommit to quitting rather than abandoning therapy after a single cigarette [^def11948]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies to real-world dosing: yes, the data supporting continuation come from trials using standard 21 mg patches and behavioral support, reinforcing the message to keep going despite setbacks [^def11948].

> Combination therapy is the next critical decision. I should confirm that adding a fast-acting NRT to the patch increases quit rates by about 27% compared with patch alone, which is why many guidelines recommend patch plus gum, lozenge, inhaler, or nasal spray as first-line when using NRT, with the patch providing background nicotine and the fast-acting form rescuing acute cravings [^d7b0d877] [^f42dcfd8]. Let me reconsider dosing of the fast-acting form: for gum or lozenge, 2 mg is typical for low-to-moderate dependence and 4 mg for high dependence or within 30 minutes of waking, and I should set expectations for frequency and technique to optimize absorption and minimize side effects [^2567a8c7].

> Special populations require tailored choices. In adolescents, evidence for patch efficacy is limited and mixed, so I should prioritize counseling and consider pharmacotherapy case-by-case. In pregnancy, NRT is generally considered safer than smoking, but I should use the lowest effective dose, prefer short-acting forms, and monitor closely. In patients with cardiovascular disease, NRT is safe and recommended, and combination therapy can be used judiciously with clinical judgment [^5c0dd420] [^b99a68f6]. But wait, what if the patient is not ready to quit? Even then, starting varenicline can increase later abstinence, and while preloading with patch is reasonable, I should set expectations that the evidence base is less definitive than for standard post-quit use [^d67b34a8] [^d7b0d877].

> Safety monitoring is essential. I should confirm that serious adverse events are uncommon with standard-dose patches, though higher-dose patches may increase withdrawals, and I should screen for contraindications such as severe skin reactions, recent myocardial infarction, or arrhythmias. Localized skin irritation is common and manageable with rotation, and if sleep disturbance or vivid dreams occur, switching to 16-hour use or night-time removal is appropriate [^2e5f0222] [^903a2888]. I need to ensure patients know to seek care for persistent palpitations or chest symptoms, even though causal links to NRT are rare at standard doses [^183c24b8].

> Next, I should review behavioral support, because medication plus counseling outperforms medication alone. Even brief advice improves quit rates, and connecting patients to quitlines or structured counseling increases success. I should also emphasize adherence, since wearing the patch for at least 20 of the first 21 days triples the odds of abstinence at 6 weeks compared with less consistent use, and I should plan follow-up to troubleshoot side effects and reinforce use of the fast-acting rescue product [^c2192ed7] [^4cf3dae1]. Hold on, I should verify that this adherence signal holds under real-world conditions: yes, the analysis simulated over-the-counter use and still found a strong adherence–outcome relationship, which supports proactive adherence counseling [^4cf3dae1].

> Finally, I should align with guideline hierarchies and be transparent about alternatives. Contemporary guidelines favor varenicline over nicotine patch as first-line pharmacotherapy due to higher quit rates, though patch remains effective and combination NRT is a reasonable alternative when varenicline is not suitable or acceptable. If using NRT, combination therapy is preferred over monotherapy, and extending patch use beyond 12 weeks can be considered for those with persistent withdrawal or relapse risk [^72a880a8] [^f42dcfd8] [^9556eb0f]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied patch monotherapy is inadequate; that overstates it, as patch monotherapy still doubles quit chances versus placebo, but in head-to-head and network meta-analyses, varenicline and combination NRT achieve higher absolute quit rates, which justifies prioritizing them when appropriate and acceptable to the patient [^183c24b8] [^be12ece0].

Use the nicotine patch by applying a **21 mg/24-hour patch** to clean, dry, hair-free skin on the upper body or outer arm [^903a2888] [^be906d5b] each morning for 8–12 weeks, rotating sites daily to avoid irritation [^903a2888]. If sleep is disturbed, use a **16-hour patch** or remove at night [^903a2888]. For heavy smokers (> 10 cigarettes/day), consider **combination therapy** (patch plus gum or lozenge) to improve quit rates [^d7b0d877] [^f42dcfd8]. Taper to 14 mg then 7 mg if needed, and continue through cravings or lapses to support recovery [^def11948]. Common side effects are skin irritation and vivid dreams; rotate sites and remove at night if needed [^903a2888] [^183c24b8].

## Selecting the appropriate nicotine patch

Nicotine patches come in different strengths and formulations; **select the dose based on daily cigarette consumption and smoking habits**:

| **Daily cigarette consumption** | **Recommended patch strength** |
|-|-|
| More than 10 cigarettes per day | 21 mg/24-hour patch |
| 10 or fewer cigarettes per day | 14 mg/24-hour patch |

---

Patches are available as **24-hour** formulations (worn continuously) and **16-hour** formulations (removed at night) [^903a2888]. Use the 24-hour patch if you have strong morning cravings or smoke soon after waking; use the 16-hour patch if you experience sleep disturbances or vivid dreams with the 24-hour patch [^903a2888].

---

## Application instructions

Proper application is essential for **optimal nicotine delivery and minimal side effects**:

- **Choose a site**: Apply the patch to clean, dry, hair-free skin on the upper body (upper chest, upper arm, shoulder, back, or inner arm) [^903a2888].
- **Avoid irritated skin**: Do not apply to irritated, oily, scarred, or damaged skin [^903a2888].
- **Rotate sites**: Use a different site each day; avoid using the same spot more than once per week [^903a2888].
- **Application**: Remove the patch from the foil, peel the protective strips, and press firmly onto the skin for about 10 seconds [^903a2888].
- **Hand hygiene**: Wash hands thoroughly after application to remove residual nicotine [^903a2888].

---

## Duration of therapy

Standard therapy lasts **8–12 weeks**, but some patients benefit from extended use (up to 24–52 weeks), particularly those with high dependence or prior relapse [^9556eb0f]. Taper the dose to 14 mg then 7 mg if cravings persist or if you are using higher-dose patches initially [^be906d5b].

---

## Managing side effects

Common side effects include **skin irritation, vivid dreams, and sleep disturbances**. Strategies to manage these include:

- **Skin irritation**: Rotate application sites daily; use a different spot each week [^903a2888].
- **Vivid dreams or sleep disturbances**: Use a 16-hour patch or remove the 24-hour patch at night [^903a2888].
- **Allergic reactions**: Discontinue use and consult a healthcare provider if severe skin reactions occur [^notfound].

---

## Combination therapy

For heavy smokers or those with strong cravings, **combination therapy** (patch plus a fast-acting NRT such as gum or lozenge) significantly increases quit rates compared with the patch alone [^d7b0d877] [^f42dcfd8]. Use the patch for baseline nicotine needs and the fast-acting NRT for breakthrough cravings [^c2192ed7].

---

## Handling lapses

If you slip and smoke while using the patch, **do not stop the patch**; continuing use increases the likelihood of returning to abstinence [^def11948]. Reaffirm your quit goal and consider adding or increasing use of fast-acting NRT [^c2192ed7].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Consult a healthcare provider before use; NRT is generally considered safer than smoking, but professional guidance is essential [^notfound].
- **Cardiovascular disease**: NRT is generally safe, but patients with severe cardiovascular conditions should consult a healthcare provider [^b99a68f6].
- **Adolescents**: Limited evidence supports NRT use in adolescents; behavioral support is critical [^5c0dd420].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **Select dose**: Based on daily cigarette consumption and smoking habits [^notfound].
- **Apply correctly**: Rotate sites daily; avoid irritated skin [^903a2888].
- **Use duration**: 8–12 weeks; extend if needed [^9556eb0f].
- **Manage side effects**: Rotate sites; use 16-hour patch if sleep is disturbed [^903a2888].
- **Consider combination therapy**: For heavy smokers or strong cravings [^d7b0d877] [^f42dcfd8].
- **Continue through lapses**: Do not stop the patch if you smoke [^def11948].

Abstract

Background

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) aims to replace nicotine from cigarettes. This helps to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, and ease the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence. Although there is high‐certainty evidence that NRT is effective for achieving long‐term smoking abstinence, it is unclear whether different forms, doses, durations of treatment or timing of use impacts its effects.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations and schedules of NRT, for achieving long‐term smoking cessation.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers mentioning NRT in the title, abstract or keywords, most recently in April 2022.

Selection criteria

We included randomised trials in people motivated to quit, comparing one type of NRT use with another. We excluded studies that did not assess cessation as an outcome, with follow‐up of fewer than six months, and with additional intervention components not matched between arms. Separate reviews cover studies comparing NRT to control, or to other pharmacotherapies.

Data collection and analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. We measured smoking abstinence after at least six months, using the most rigorous definition available. We extracted data on cardiac adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and study withdrawals due to treatment.

Main results

We identified 68 completed studies with 43,327 participants, five of which are new to this update. Most completed studies recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. We judged 28 of the 68 studies to be at high risk of bias. Restricting the analysis only to those studies at low or unclear risk of bias did not significantly alter results for any comparisons apart from the preloading comparison, which tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day whilst still smoking.

There is high‐certainty evidence that combination NRT (fast‐acting form plus patch) results in higher long‐term quit rates than single form (risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 1.37; I 2 = 12%; 16 studies, 12,169 participants). Moderate‐certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, indicates that 42/44 mg patches are as effective as 21/22 mg (24‐hour) patches (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29; I 2 = 38%; 5 studies, 1655 participants), and that 21 mg patches are more effective than 14 mg (24‐hour) patches (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.08; 1 study, 537 participants). Moderate‐certainty evidence, again limited by imprecision, also suggests a benefit of 25 mg over 15 mg (16‐hour) patches, but the lower limit of the CI encompassed no difference (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41; I 2 = 0%; 3 studies, 3446 participants).

Nine studies tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day (preloading) in comparison to using it from quit day onward. There was moderate‐certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, of a favourable effect of preloading on abstinence (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44; I 2 = 0%; 9 studies, 4395 participants).

High‐certainty evidence from eight studies suggests that using either a form of fast‐acting NRT or a nicotine patch results in similar long‐term quit rates (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05; I 2 = 0%; 8 studies, 3319 participants).

We found no clear evidence of an effect of duration of nicotine patch use (low‐certainty evidence); duration of combination NRT use (low‐ and very low‐certainty evidence); or fast‐acting NRT type (very low‐certainty evidence).

Cardiac AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment were all measured variably and infrequently across studies, resulting in low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence for all comparisons. Most comparisons found no clear evidence of an effect on these outcomes, and rates were low overall. More withdrawals due to treatment were reported in people using nasal spray compared to patches in one study (RR 3.47, 95% CI 1.15 to 10.46; 1 study, 922 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and in people using 42/44 mg patches in comparison to 21/22 mg patches across two studies (RR 4.99, 95% CI 1.60 to 15.50; I 2 = 0%; 2 studies, 544 participants; low‐certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions

There is high‐certainty evidence that using combination NRT versus single‐form NRT and 4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum can result in an increase in the chances of successfully stopping smoking. Due to imprecision, evidence was of moderate certainty for patch dose comparisons. There is some indication that the lower‐dose nicotine patches and gum may be less effective than higher‐dose products. Using a fast‐acting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge, resulted in similar quit rates to nicotine patches. There is moderate‐certainty evidence that using NRT before quitting may improve quit rates versus using it from quit date only; however, further research is needed to ensure the robustness of this finding. Evidence for the comparative safety and tolerability of different types of NRT use is limited. New studies should ensure that AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment are reported.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^e7dae1a0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) aims to replace nicotine from cigarettes to ease the transition from cigarette smoking to abstinence. It works by reducing the intensity of craving and withdrawal symptoms. Although there is clear evidence that NRT used after smoking cessation is effective, it is unclear whether higher doses, longer durations of treatment, or using NRT before cessation add to its effectiveness.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations and schedules of NRT, for achieving long-term smoking cessation, compared to one another.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register, and trial registries for papers mentioning NRT in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search: April 2018.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials in people motivated to quit, comparing one type of NRT use with another. We excluded trials that did not assess cessation as an outcome, with follow-up less than six months, and with additional intervention components not matched between arms. Trials comparing NRT to control, and trials comparing NRT to other pharmacotherapies, are covered elsewhere.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. Smoking abstinence was measured after at least six months, using the most rigorous definition available. We extracted data on cardiac adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and study withdrawals due to treatment. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome for each study, where possible. We grouped eligible studies according to the type of comparison. We carried out meta-analyses where appropriate, using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We identified 63 trials with 41,509 participants. Most recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. People enrolled in the studies typically smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day. We judged 24 of the 63 studies to be at high risk of bias, but restricting the analysis only to those studies at low or unclear risk of bias did not significantly alter results, apart from in the case of the preloading comparison. There is high-certainty evidence that combination NRT (fast-acting form + patch) results in higher long-term quit rates than single form (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.36, 14 studies, 11,356 participants; I 2 = 4%). Moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, indicates that 42/44 mg are as effective as 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29, 5 studies, 1655 participants; I 2 = 38%), and that 21 mg are more effective than 14 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.08, 1 study, 537 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence (again limited by imprecision) also suggests a benefit of 25 mg over 15 mg (16-hour) patches, but the lower limit of the CI encompassed no difference (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41, 3 studies, 3446 participants; I 2 = 0%). Five studies comparing 4 mg gum to 2 mg gum found a benefit of the higher dose (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.83, 5 studies, 856 participants; I 2 = 63%); however, results of a subgroup analysis suggest that only smokers who are highly dependent may benefit. Nine studies tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day (preloading) in comparison to using it from quit day onward; there was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, of a favourable effect of preloading on abstinence (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44, 9 studies, 4395 participants; I 2 = 0%). High-certainty evidence from eight studies suggests that using either a form of fast-acting NRT or a nicotine patch results in similar long-term quit rates (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05, 8 studies, 3319 participants; I 2 = 0%). We found no evidence of an effect of duration of nicotine patch use (low-certainty evidence); 16-hour versus 24-hour daily patch use; duration of combination NRT use (low- and very low-certainty evidence); tapering of patch dose versus abrupt patch cessation; fast-acting NRT type (very low-certainty evidence); duration of nicotine gum use; ad lib versus fixed dosing of fast-acting NRT; free versus purchased NRT; length of provision of free NRT; ceasing versus continuing patch use on lapse; and participant- versus clinician-selected NRT. However, in most cases these findings are based on very low- or low-certainty evidence, and are the findings from single studies.AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment were all measured variably and infrequently across studies, resulting in low- or very low-certainty evidence for all comparisons. Most comparisons found no evidence of an effect on cardiac AEs, SAEs or withdrawals. Rates of these were low overall. Significantly more withdrawals due to treatment were reported in participants using nasal spray in comparison to patch in one trial (RR 3.47, 95% CI 1.15 to 10.46, 922 participants; very low certainty) and in participants using 42/44 mg patches in comparison to 21/22 mg patches across two trials (RR 4.99, 95% CI 1.60 to 15.50, 2 studies, 544 participants; I 2 = 0%; low certainty).

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-certainty evidence that using combination NRT versus single-form NRT, and 4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum, can increase the chances of successfully stopping smoking. For patch dose comparisons, evidence was of moderate certainty, due to imprecision. Twenty-one mg patches resulted in higher quit rates than 14 mg (24-hour) patches, and using 25 mg patches resulted in higher quit rates than using 15 mg (16-hour) patches, although in the latter case the CI included one. There was no clear evidence of superiority for 42/44 mg over 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches. Using a fast-acting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge, resulted in similar quit rates to nicotine patches. There is moderate-certainty evidence that using NRT prior to quitting may improve quit rates versus using it from quit date only; however, further research is needed to ensure the robustness of this finding. Evidence for the comparative safety and tolerability of different types of NRT use is of low and very low certainty. New studies should ensure that AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment are both measured and reported.

### Nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^322d2051]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is to temporarily replace much of the nicotine from cigarettes to reduce motivation to smoke and nicotine withdrawal symptoms, thus easing the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence.

Objectives

The aims of this review were: To determine the effect of NRT compared to placebo in aiding smoking cessation, and to consider whether there is a difference in effect for the different forms of NRT (chewing gum, transdermal patches, oral and nasal sprays, inhalers and tablets/lozenges) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes. To determine whether the effect is influenced by the dosage, form and timing of use of NRT; the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; or the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated. To determine whether combinations of NRT are more likely to lead to successful quitting than one type alone. To determine whether NRT is more or less likely to lead to successful quitting compared to other pharmacotherapies.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers mentioning 'NRT' or any type of nicotine replacement therapy in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search July 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or to no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow-up of less than six months.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate on the type of participants, the dose, duration and form of nicotine therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We identified 150 trials; 117 with over 50,000 participants contributed to the primary comparison between any type of NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The risk ratio (RR) of abstinence for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.60 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53 to 1.68). The pooled RRs for each type were 1.49 (95% CI 1.40 to 1.60, 55 trials) for nicotine gum; 1.64 (95% CI 1.52 to 1.78, 43 trials) for nicotine patch; 1.95 (95% CI 1.61 to 2.36, 6 trials) for oral tablets/lozenges; 1.90 (95% CI 1.36 to 2.67, 4 trials) for nicotine inhaler; and 2.02 (95% CI 1.49 to 2.73, 4 trials) for nicotine nasal spray. One trial of oral spray had an RR of 2.48 (95% CI 1.24 to 4.94). The effects were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. The effect was similar in a small group of studies that aimed to assess use of NRT obtained without a prescription. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2 mg gum, but weaker evidence of a benefit from higher doses of patch. There was evidence that combining a nicotine patch with a rapid delivery form of NRT was more effective than a single type of NRT (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.51, 9 trials). The RR for NRT used for a short period prior to the quit date was 1.18 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.40, 8 trials), just missing statistical significance, though the efficacy increased when we pooled only patch trials and when we removed one trial in which confounding was likely. Five studies directly compared NRT to a non-nicotine pharmacotherapy, bupropion; there was no evidence of a difference in efficacy (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.18). A combination of NRT and bupropion was more effective than bupropion alone (RR 1.24; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.45, 4 trials). Adverse effects from using NRT are related to the type of product, and include skin irritation from patches and irritation to the inside of the mouth from gum and tablets. There is no evidence that NRT increases the risk of heart attacks.

Authors' Conclusions

All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) can help people who make a quit attempt to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking. NRTs increase the rate of quitting by 50 to 70%, regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the individual. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT.

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers with 'nicotine' or 'NRT' in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search July 2007.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or to no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow up of less than six months.

The RR of abstinence for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.58 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.50 to 1.66). The pooled RR for each type were 1.43 (95% CI: 1.33 to 1.53, 53 trials) for nicotine gum; 1.66 (95% CI: 1.53 to 1.81, 41 trials) for nicotine patch; 1.90 (95% CI: 1.36 to 2.67, 4 trials) for nicotine inhaler; 2.00 (95% CI: 1.63 to 2.45, 6 trials) for oral tablets/lozenges; and 2.02 (95% CI: 1.49 to 3.73, 4 trials) for nicotine nasal spray. The effects were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. The effect was similar in a small group of studies that aimed to assess use of NRT obtained without a prescription. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2 mg gum, but weaker evidence of a benefit from higher doses of patch. There was evidence that combining a nicotine patch with a rapid delivery form of NRT was more effective than a single type of NRT. Only one study directly compared NRT to another pharmacotherapy. In this study quit rates with nicotine patch were lower than with the antidepressant bupropion.

Authors' Conclusions

All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) can help people who make a quit attempt to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking. NRTs increase the rate of quitting by 50-70%, regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the individual. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT.

### Nicotine replacement therapy versus control for smoking cessation [^183c24b8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) aims to temporarily replace much of the nicotine from cigarettes to reduce motivation to smoke and nicotine withdrawal symptoms, thus easing the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), including gum, transdermal patch, intranasal spray and inhaled and oral preparations, for achieving long-term smoking cessation, compared to placebo or 'no NRT' interventions.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers mentioning 'NRT' or any type of nicotine replacement therapy in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search is July 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials in people motivated to quit which compared NRT to placebo or to no treatment. We excluded trials that did not report cessation rates, and those with follow-up of less than six months, except for those in pregnancy (where less than six months, these were excluded from the main analysis). We recorded adverse events from included and excluded studies that compared NRT with placebo. Studies comparing different types, durations, and doses of NRT, and studies comparing NRT to other pharmacotherapies, are covered in separate reviews.

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening, data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment followed standard Cochrane methods. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We identified 136 studies; 133 with 64,640 participants contributed to the primary comparison between any type of NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The majority of studies were conducted in adults and had similar numbers of men and women. People enrolled in the studies typically smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day at the start of the studies. We judged the evidence to be of high quality; we judged most studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias but restricting the analysis to only those studies at low risk of bias did not significantly alter the result. The RR of abstinence for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.55 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49 to 1.61). The pooled RRs for each type were 1.49 (95% CI 1.40 to 1.60, 56 trials, 22,581 participants) for nicotine gum; 1.64 (95% CI 1.53 to 1.75, 51 trials, 25,754 participants) for nicotine patch; 1.52 (95% CI 1.32 to 1.74, 8 trials, 4439 participants) for oral tablets/lozenges; 1.90 (95% CI 1.36 to 2.67, 4 trials, 976 participants) for nicotine inhalator; and 2.02 (95% CI 1.49 to 2.73, 4 trials, 887 participants) for nicotine nasal spray. The effects were largely independent of the definition of abstinence, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. A subset of six trials conducted in pregnant women found a statistically significant benefit of NRT on abstinence close to the time of delivery (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.69; 2129 participants); in the four trials that followed up participants post-partum the result was no longer statistically significant (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.86; 1675 participants). Adverse events from using NRT were related to the type of product, and include skin irritation from patches and irritation to the inside of the mouth from gum and tablets. Attempts to quantitatively synthesize the incidence of various adverse effects were hindered by extensive variation in reporting the nature, timing and duration of symptoms. The odds ratio (OR) of chest pains or palpitations for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.88 (95% CI 1.37 to 2.57, 15 included and excluded trials, 11,074 participants). However, chest pains and palpitations were rare in both groups and serious adverse events were extremely rare.

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-quality evidence that all of the licensed forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhalator and sublingual tablets/lozenges) can help people who make a quit attempt to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking. NRTs increase the rate of quitting by 50% to 60%, regardless of setting, and further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of the effect. The relative effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the individual. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT. NRT often causes minor irritation of the site through which it is administered, and in rare cases can cause non-ischaemic chest pain and palpitations.

### Nicotine patches used in combination with e-cigarettes (with and without nicotine) for smoking cessation: a pragmatic, randomised trial [^801b52d8]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Background

Combination nicotine replacement therapy shows additive cessation benefits. We aimed to find out the effectiveness of combining nicotine patches with an e-cigarette (with and without nicotine) on six-month smoking abstinence.

Methods

We did a pragmatic, three-arm, parallel-group trial in New Zealand in adult smokers who were e-cigarette naive and motivated to quit smoking. Participants were recruited from the general population using national media advertising. Participants were randomly assigned (1:4:4), with the use of stratified block randomisation, to receive 14 weeks (2 weeks before the agreed quit date) of 21 mg, 24h nicotine patches, patches plus an 18 mg/L nicotine e-cigarette, or patches plus a nicotine-free e-cigarette. We advised participants to use one patch daily, with e-cigarette use as and when necessary or desired. Participants and researchers were masked to e-liquid nicotine content. We offered 6 weeks of telephone-delivered behavioural support. The primary outcome was exhaled carbon monoxide (CO)-verified continuous smoking abstinence 6 months after the agreed quit date. Primary analysis was by intention to treat, with sensitivity analysis by per protocol, treatment adherence, varying CO cutoffs, and complete case analysis. This paper presents the main analyses and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02521662.

Findings

Between March 17, 2016 and Nov 30, 2017, 1124 people were assigned to nicotine patches (patches only group, n=125), patches plus a nicotine e-cigarette (patches plus nicotine e-cigarette group, n=500), or patches plus a nicotine-free e-cigarette (patches plus nicotine-free e-cigarette group, n=499). 62 (50%) of 125 participants in the patches only group withdrew or were lost to follow-up by 6 months compared with 161 (32%) of 500 in the patches plus nicotine e-cigarette group and 162 (33%) of 499 in the patches plus nicotine-free e-cigarette group. 35 (7%) participants in the patches plus nicotine e-cigarette group had CO-verified continuous abstinence at 6 months compared with 20 (4%) in the patches plus nicotine-free e-cigarette group (risk difference [RD] 2·99 [95% CI 0·17-5·81]), and three (2%) people in the patches only group (RD 4·60 [1·11-8·09]). 18 serious adverse events occurred in 16 people in the patches plus nicotine e-cigarette group compared with 27 events in 22 people in the patches plus nicotine-free e-cigarette group and four events in three people in the patches only group. In the patches plus nicotine e-cigarette group, two life-threatening serious adverse events were reported (two separate heart attacks in the one participant). In the patches plus nicotine-free e-cigarette group, one death occurred (accidental drug overdose) and one life-threatening serious adverse event (heart attack). No significant between-group differences were noted for serious adverse events, and none were treatment-related.

Interpretation

Combining reduced-harm nicotine products, such as nicotine patches with a nicotine e-cigarette, can lead to a modest improvement in smoking cessation over and above that obtained from using patches plus a nicotine-free e-cigarette (or patches alone), with no indication of any serious harm in the short-term. Future e-cigarette trials should focus on their use alone or in combination with usual smoking cessation support, given issues with differential loss to follow-up and withdrawal if a usual care group is used as a comparator.

### Nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^e816c74a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is to replace nicotine from cigarettes. This reduces withdrawal symptoms associated with smoking cessation thus helping resist the urge to smoke cigarettes.

Objectives

The aims of this review were:to determine the effectiveness of the different forms of NRT (chewing gum, transdermal patches, nasal spray, inhalers and tablets) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes, or a sustained reduction in amount smoked; to determine whether the effect is influenced by the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated, the dosage and form of the NRT used, or the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; to determine whether combinations of NRT are more effective than one type alone; to determine its effectiveness compared to other pharmacotherapies.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register in March 2004.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or to no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow up of less than six months.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate on the type of participants, the dose, duration and form of nicotine therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. For each study we calculated summary odds ratios. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed effect model.

Main Results

We identified 123 trials; 103 contributing to the primary comparison between NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The odds ratio (OR) for abstinence with NRT compared to control was 1.77 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.66 to 1.88). The ORs for the different forms of NRT were 1.66 (95% CI: 1.52 to 1.81) for gum, 1.81 (95% CI: 1.63 to 2.02) for patches, 2.35 (95% CI: 1.63 to 3.38) for nasal spray, 2.14 (95% CI: 1.44 to 3.18) for inhaled nicotine and 2.05 (95% CI: 1.62 to 2.59) for nicotine sublingual tablet/lozenge. These odds were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2 mg gum (OR 2.20, 95% CI: 1.85 to 3.25). There was weak evidence that combinations of forms of NRT are more effective. Higher doses of nicotine patch may produce small increases in quit rates. Only one study directly compared NRT to another pharmacotherapy. In this study quit rates with bupropion were higher than with nicotine patch or placebo.

Reviewers' Conclusions

All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) are effective as part of a strategy to promote smoking cessation. They increase the odds of quitting approximately 1.5 to 2 fold regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the smoker. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT.

### Continuing to wear nicotine patches after smoking lapses promotes recovery of abstinence [^def11948]. Addiction (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

Smokers who lapse during a cessation attempt are at particularly high risk of relapse, so interventions to help smokers recover from lapses are urgently needed. Two recent studies have suggested continuing to use nicotine patches following a lapse may be a beneficial relapse prevention strategy. However, to date no study that uses approved doses of nicotine patches under real-world conditions has tested this hypothesis.

Design and Setting

Clinical trial conducted across eight US study sites.

Participants and Measurements

Using data from 509 subjects (240 active; 269 placebo) who lapsed during weeks 3-5 of treatment in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 21-mg nicotine patches, we examined whether active nicotine patch use improved the chances of recovering abstinence (7-day point-prevalence) at weeks 6 and 10.

Findings

Active patch use (versus placebo) increased the likelihood of recovery from a lapse both at 6 weeks [8.3% versus 0.8%; relative risk (RR)=11.0, P<0.001] and at 10 weeks (9.6% versus 2.6%; RR=3.7, P<0.001).

Conclusions

Continuing treatment to aid smoking cessation with active patches promotes recovery from lapses. Smokers should be encouraged to persist with patch treatment if they lapse to smoking.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^91702563]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence

Following standard Cochrane methodology, we created summary of findings tables for the following comparisons, which we deemed to be most clinically relevant:

combination versus single‐form NRT;
duration of combination therapy;
patch dose;
duration of patch therapy;
fast‐acting NRT versus patch;
type of fast‐acting NRT;
NRT preloading versus standard post‐quit use.

Also, following standard Cochrane methodology (Higgins 2011 ; Higgins 2022), we used the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the certainty of the body of evidence for smoking cessation, SAEs and treatment withdrawals, and to draw conclusions about the certainty of the evidence within the text of the review.

### Long-term nicotine replacement therapy: a randomized clinical trial [^9556eb0f]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

The US Food and Drug Administration adopted labeling for nicotine patches to allow use beyond the standard 8 weeks. This decision was based in part on data showing increased efficacy for 24 weeks of treatment. Few studies have examined whether the use of nicotine patches beyond 24 weeks provides additional therapeutic benefit.

Objective

To compare 8 (standard), 24 (extended), and 52 (maintenance) weeks of nicotine patch treatment for promoting tobacco abstinence.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We recruited 525 treatment-seeking smokers for a randomized clinical trial conducted from June 22, 2009, through April 15, 2014, through 2 universities.

Interventions

Smokers received 12 smoking cessation behavioral counseling sessions and were randomized to 8, 24, or 52 weeks of nicotine patch treatment.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was 7-day point prevalence abstinence, confirmed with breath levels of carbon monoxide at 6 and 12 months (intention to treat).

Results

At 24 weeks, 21.7% of participants in the standard treatment arm were abstinent, compared with 27.2% of participants in the extended and maintenance treatment arms (χ(2)(1)= 1.98; P =.17). In a multivariate model controlled for covariates, participants in the extended and maintenance treatment arms reported significantly greater abstinence rates at 24 weeks compared with participants in the standard treatment arm (odds ratio [OR], 1.70 [95% CI, 1.03-2.81]; P =.04), had a longer duration of abstinence until relapse (β = 21.30 [95% CI, 10.30-32.25]; P <.001), reported smoking fewer cigarettes per day if not abstinent (mean [SD], 5.8 [5.3] vs 6.4 [5.1] cigarettes per day; β = 0.43 [95% CI, 0.06-0.82]; P =.02), and reported more abstinent days (mean [SD], 80.5 [38.1] vs 68.2 [43.7] days; OR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.06-2.26]; P =.02). At 52 weeks, participants in the maintenance treatment arm did not report significantly greater abstinence rates compared with participants in the standard and extended treatment arms (20.3% vs 23.8%; OR, 1.17 [95% CI, 0.69-1.98]; P =.57). Similarly, we found no difference in week 52 abstinence rates between participants in the extended and standard treatment arms (26.0% vs 21.7%; OR, 1.33 [95% CI, 0.72-2.45]; P =.36). Treatment duration was not associated with any adverse effects or adherence to the counseling regimen, but participants in the maintenance treatment arm reported lower adherence to the nicotine patch regimen compared with those in the standard and extended treatment arms (mean [SD], 3.94 [2.5], 4.61 [2.0], and 4.7 [2.4] patches/wk, respectively; F2,522 = 6.03; P =.003).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings support the safety of long-term use of nicotine patch treatment, although they do not support efficacy beyond 24 weeks of treatment in a broad group of smokers.

### Effectiveness and safety of nicotine replacement therapy assisted reduction to stop smoking: systematic review and meta-analysis [^70c9582c]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

For health services an important issue is whether nicotine replacement therapy should be reimbursed in nicotine assisted reduction to stop programmes and whether and how such programmes should be implemented. All the industry sponsored trials took place in specialist smoking cessation clinics with extensive monitoring and moderate behavioural support. The remaining trial w7 was rather analogous to use of nicotine replacement therapy purchased directly from retail outlets, but even here a 20 page booklet was given to participants to motivate and instruct on reduction. This trial showed lower relative efficacy than the overall effect estimate and a lower absolute benefit, but whether this was due to the setting or chance is unclear.

Currently, nicotine assisted reduction to stop is licensed in the UK but recent guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and a recent US Clinical Practice Guideline recommend its use only in the context of further research.Survey data show that large numbers are using nicotine replacement therapy to reduce consumption,but whether they are truly reading the packet inserts and seeking to follow a nicotine assisted reduction to stop programme is uncertain. Furthermore, most people who are reducing with nicotine replacement therapy are using a patch,which is not licensed for this use and does not come with such instructions. It is therefore unclear whether the outcomes observed in the trials are being achieved through such use.

In summary, these trials have shown proof of concept. People who would answer “no” to “do you want to stop smoking now?” may be helped to stop over a longer period by applying drugs formerly reserved only for abrupt cessation. The contribution of the behavioural support programme is unknown, and the optimum advice to give people in reduction programmes is also unknown as these have not been manipulated in comparative trials. The importance of these trials is that they show that treating a population of smokers not ready to stop means more of them stop. Therefore it is important to examine how nicotine assisted reduction to stop can be incorporated into tobacco control programmes.

### Initiating pharmacologic treatment in tobacco-dependent adults. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^f787ab6d]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Current tobacco treatment guidelines have established the efficacy of available interventions, but they do not provide detailed guidance for common implementation questions frequently faced in the clinic. An evidence-based guideline was created that addresses several pharmacotherapy-initiation questions that routinely confront treatment teams. Methods: Individuals with diverse expertise related to smoking cessation were empaneled to prioritize questions and outcomes important to clinicians. An evidence-synthesis team conducted systematic reviews, which informed recommendations to answer the questions. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach was used to rate the certainty in the estimated effects and the strength of recommendations. Results: The guideline panel formulated five strong recommendations and two conditional recommendations regarding pharmacotherapy choices. Strong recommendations include using varenicline rather than a nicotine patch, using varenicline rather than bupropion, using varenicline rather than a nicotine patch in adults with a comorbid psychiatric condition, initiating varenicline in adults even if they are unready to quit, and using controller therapy for an extended treatment duration greater than 12 weeks. Conditional recommendations include combining a nicotine patch with varenicline rather than using varenicline alone and using varenicline rather than electronic cigarettes. Conclusions: Seven recommendations are provided, which represent simple practice changes that are likely to increase the effectiveness of tobacco-dependence pharmacotherapy.

### Nicotine patch therapy prior to quitting smoking: a meta-analysis [^116f89b8]. Addiction (2008). Low credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the incremental efficacy of starting nicotine patch treatment prior to quitting compared to the current regimen of starting patch treatment on the target quit day.

Design and Measurements

Meta-analysis of four eligible studies using pre-cessation patch treatment, located by database search and contacts with cessation researchers. The studies all compared starting treatment with nicotine patch prior to the target quit date to starting active treatment at the quit date, some in the context of concurrent mecamylamine treatment. The primary end-point for the analysis was continuous abstinence for at least 28 days assessed at 6 weeks following quit day; 6-month outcomes were also examined.

Findings

Compared to starting active patch treatment on quit day, pre-cessation treatment with nicotine patches was found to double the odds of quitting. This was true both at 6 weeks [pooled odds ratio (OR) = 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.31-2.93] and 6 months (pooled OR = 2.17, 95% CI: 1.46-3.22) treatment outcomes. Mecamylamine co-treatment did not modify these effects.

Conclusions

Across the four studies analyzed, pre-cessation patch treatment was found to produce a robust increase in quit rates compared to current regimens starting patch at quit day. Pre-cessation patch use represents a promising innovation in smoking cessation therapy with potential beneficial implications for improved public health by further increasing quitting success.

FDA-Approved Smoking Cessation Medications—nicotine inhaler (10‑mg cartridge; Rx only) is administered by puffing into the mouth/throat without inhaling into the lungs until cravings subside, with cartridges changed when nicotine taste disappears; dosing includes using 1 cartridge every 1-2 hours with a maximum of 16/day and each cartridge has ~80 puffs; common side effects are mouth and throat irritation and coughing if inhaled too deeply; advantages include user-controlled nicotine dose, mimicking the hand‑to‑mouth ritual of smoking cigarettes, and the option to add to a patch for situational cravings; a listed disadvantage is that frequent puffing is required.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^79cf0b30]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

This review update continues to provide high‐certainty evidence that the use of combination NRT results in higher quit rates than single‐form NRT. This finding held true regardless of whether that single form was a patch or a fast‐acting version, such as gum or lozenge, or a choice of patch or fast‐acting single‐form NRT. For patch dose comparisons, we judged the evidence to be of moderate certainty due to imprecision. Of the patch dose comparisons, 21 mg patches resulted in higher quit rates than 14 mg (24‐hour) patches; 25 mg patches resulted in higher quit rates than 15 mg (16‐hour) patches, although the confidence interval (CI) included one; and there was no clear evidence of superiority for 42/44 mg over 21/22 mg (24‐hour) patches. In addition, results suggest that using 4 mg nicotine gum results in higher quit rates than using 2 mg nicotine gum. A post hoc subgroup analysis accounted for the moderate heterogeneity in the associated analysis. It indicated that this may only be true in smokers who are highly dependent, and that 4 mg and 2 mg gum may result in similar quit rates when used by people less dependent on smoking. However, this finding should be treated with caution and tested in primary, adequately‐powered studies to strengthen the evidence in this area. Moderate‐certainty evidence indicates that nicotine preloading (i.e. the use of NRT before the quit date) results in higher quit rates than using NRT from quit day onwards. However, when we removed the five studies (of nine) at high risk of bias from the analysis, the clear evidence of a positive effect did not remain. It is not possible to say conclusively that this was due to bias, and could be because removing more than half of the studies meant that the sample size was reduced by more than half, making the result less precise.

### Protecting children from tobacco, nicotine, and tobacco smoke [^6e57829b]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Tobacco dependence treatment in adults—guideline recommendations and precessation nicotine patch evidence—has quality of evidence: strong. The 2008 US Public Health Service–sponsored guideline advised that “Clinicians strongly recommend the use of effective tobacco dependence counseling and medication treatments to their patients who use tobacco,” and “Even brief advice can increase quit rates.” A 2013 Cochrane review concluded that “nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, varenicline, and cytisine … improved the chances of stopping smoking,” and “Combination nicotine replacement therapy outperformed single formulations.” FDA‑approved forms include “nicotine patches, nicotine gum, and nicotine lozenges … as well as nicotine nasal spray and nicotine inhalers.” The American College of Chest Physicians ToolKit notes, “The intensity of treatment should be based on the severity level of nicotine dependence. For highly nicotine-dependent patients, combination therapy is often needed.” In a multisite randomized trial of precessation therapy, “included 400 tobacco-dependent adult subjects” and used “a 21-mg nicotine patch versus placebo daily for 2 weeks before cessation,” with greatest benefit when “Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence [FTND] score <6”; among lower FTND smokers, “10-week continuous abstinence rates were 33.8% … versus 9.3%,” while with higher FTND “14.0% … vs 10.8%.” A meta-analysis found precessation nicotine patch “doubled abstinence rates at 6 weeks and 6 months (ORs: 1.96 [95% CI: 1.31–2.93] and 2.20 [95% CI: 1.39–3.48], respectively).”

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^9dbc198d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

We did not assess the potential bias imposed by studies funded by industry in this review. Given we investigated variations in the form, dose, delivery, duration and schedule of NRT, rather than the effectiveness of NRT compared to a placebo, we deemed industry funding of studies less applicable in this context.

We assessed the certainty of the evidence by creating summary of findings tables and carrying out GRADE ratings for seven of the comparisons: combination versus single‐form NRT (Table 1); duration of combination therapy (Table 2); patch dose (Table 3); duration of patch use (Table 4); fast‐acting NRT versus nicotine patch (Table 5); type of fast‐acting NRT (Table 6); NRT preloading versus standard post‐quit use (Table 7), across all outcomes, where possible. Two of the seven comparisons we assessed generated high‐certainty evidence for the efficacy of treatment for smoking cessation: combination versus single‐form NRT, and fast‐acting NRT versus nicotine patch. We judged the NRT preloading versus standard post‐quit use comparison to generate moderate‐certainty evidence. We rated the remaining efficacy comparisons to be of low or very low certainty. In all cases where data were available to contribute to any of the safety analyses for these comparisons, we rated the evidence to be of low or very low certainty. This was largely due to the fact that very few studies contributed data to these analyses, and where they did, the number of events was very low. We present effect estimates as risk ratios, as these are easier to interpret than odds ratios, but this means that where there are no events measured in both comparison groups, risk ratios cannot be calculated and therefore do not contribute to the meta‐analysis. We considered alternative statistical approaches to dealing with this data analysis. However, we concluded that other approaches would be more difficult to interpret and that overall conclusions would not change as a result.

The main reasons for downgrading the evidence were imprecision (low overall numbers of participants and events), risk of bias (judgements of high risk that may affect the result) and heterogeneity (high statistical heterogeneity detected in meta‐analyses).

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^282de508]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Types and uses of nicotine replacement therapy

Studies addressed a range of questions relating to the effectiveness of different types and uses of NRT. The variations on NRT use tested are listed below (some studies tested more than one NRT variant):

Patch dose (10 studies): three studies compared 25 mg to 15 mg (16‐hour) patches (CEASE 1999 ; Killen 1999 ; Paoletti 1996); one study compared 21 mg to 14 mg (24‐hour) patches (TNSG 1991); two studies compared 42 mg and 21 mg (24‐hour) patches (Kalman 2006 ; Rose 2010); and one study compared 44 mg to 22 mg (24‐hour) patches (Jorenby 1995). Dale 1995 and Hughes 1999 both compared three different doses: 44 mg versus 22 mg versus 11 mg (24‐hour), and 42 mg versus 35 mg versus 21 mg (24‐hour), respectively. Garvey 2006 randomised people to five nicotine patch treatment conditions: placebo, 21 mg, 42 mg, or a tailored dose at either 50% or 100% nicotine replacement based on smoking history.
24‐hours‐a‐day versus 16‐hours‐a‐day patch use (one study): one study included a direct comparison between groups wearing the same nicotine patches (dose and delivery system not specified) over either 16 hours (removing the patch at bedtime) or 24 hours (continuous use, including overnight) (Daughton 1991). All participants used patches for four weeks after the quit day.
Duration of patch therapy (seven studies): Schnoll 2015 compared 52‐week use of nicotine patches to 24‐week use and 8‐week use. CEASE 1999 compared 28‐week with 12‐week use, and Schnoll 2010a compared 24‐week with 8‐week use. Bolin 1999 and Hilleman 1994 both compared 12‐week patch use to shorter patch use, i.e. six weeks and three weeks, respectively. Cummings 2011 compared 6‐, 4‐ and 2‐week use and Glavas 2003 compared 6‐week and 3‐week patch use.
Effect of tapering patch dose (two studies): these studies compared the effect of stopping patch use abruptly at a high dose to gradually reducing patch dose over a prolonged time. Hilleman 1994 did this by providing one group of participants with 21 mg patches for six weeks and providing another group of participants with 21 mg patches for four weeks, then 14 mg patches for four weeks, then 7 mg patches for another four weeks. Stapleton 1995 gave all participants a 15 mg patch for one week; then participants could choose to receive either a continued 15 mg dose or a higher 35 mg dose for a further 11 weeks. Participants were randomised within these self‐selected groups to either taper their patch dose after the 12 weeks or to receive tapered placebo patches. Participants in the active patch group, therefore, received a further two‐week dose of 15 mg patches, followed by two weeks of 10 mg patches, followed by two weeks of 5 mg patches. The placebo group received the equivalent placebo patches.
Combination versus single form (16 studies): combination NRT usually describes using nicotine patches and a fast‐acting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge. Cooney 2009, Kornitzer 1995, Leung 2019, Puska 1995 and Smith 2013 all studied patch in combination with nicotine gum. Puska 1995 compared combination therapy to gum alone, whereas the other studies compared combination therapy to patch alone. Blondal 1999 and Croghan 2003 combined patch with nasal spray. Blondal 1999 used patch alone as the comparator, whereas Croghan 2003 had a group of participants that received patch alone and a group that received nasal spray alone. Bohadana 2000, Caldwell 2016 and Tønnesen 2000 combined patches with inhaler; Caldwell 2016 compared to patch alone, Bohadana 2000 to inhaler alone, and Tønnesen 2000 compared to both patch alone and inhaler alone. Baker 2016, Krupski 2016, Piper 2009 and Smith 2009 all used patch in combination with lozenge. Baker 2016 and Krupski 2016 compared combination NRT to patch alone, whereas both Piper 2009 and Smith 2009 compared combination NRT to a group receiving patch only and a group receiving lozenge only. Caldwell 2014 combined patch with oral spray and compared this to patch use alone. Finally, Dignan 2019 (incomplete factorial design) compared the choice of one NRT product with choice of two NRT products (patch or gum or lozenge); we assumed that patch was likely selected when used in combination with a choice of fast‐acting NRT (gum or lozenge), as this is in‐line with common practice.
Duration of combination therapy (three studies): these studies investigated the optimum length of combination patch plus gum use. Smith 2013 compared 6‐week to 2‐week use, Piper 2016 compared 16‐week to 8‐week use, and Schlam 2016 compared 26‐week to 8‐week use.
Fast‐acting NRT versus patch (eight studies): fast‐acting NRT refers to the faster‐acting (non‐patch) formulations of NRT, such as gum, lozenge, nasal spray, and so on. One study compared patch to inhaler (Tønnesen 2000), two studies compared patch to nasal spray (Croghan 2003 ; Lerman 2004), three studies compared patch to lozenge (Piper 2009 ; Schnoll 2010b ; Smith 2009), and two studies compared patch to gum (Kupecz 1996 ; Moolchan 2005).
Type of fast‐acting NRT (one study): only Bolliger 2007 compared the effectiveness of different forms of fast‐acting NRT by comparing oral spray to gum to inhaler.
Nicotine gum dose (five studies): these studies compared 4 mg nicotine gum to 2 mg nicotine gum (Garvey 2000 ; Herrera 1995 ; Hughes 1990 ; Kornitzer 1987 ; Tønnesen 1988).
Duration of gum use (one study): Hall 2009 investigated whether the duration of gum use affected quit rates. The intervention group used gum for 50 weeks and the comparison group used gum for 10 weeks.
Fixed versus ad lib dosing schedule (four studies): these studies investigated whether instructions on when to use fast‐acting NRT influenced effectiveness. Goldstein 1989 and Killen 1990 provided participants with 2 mg nicotine gum; Rey 2009 and Tønnesen 1996 provided participants with nasal spray. The fixed‐dosing groups were either asked to use one piece/puff per hour (Goldstein 1989 ; Killen 1990 ; Tønnesen 1996), or two puffs per hour (Rey 2009), regardless of cravings. The ad lib dosing groups were all asked to use their product when a craving occurred, with a maximum upper limit for daily use, i.e. 30 pieces of gum a day or 80 puffs of nasal spray.
NRT preloading versus standard post‐quit NRT use (nine studies): traditionally, NRT is used from a quit date onward, after tobacco use has ceased. NRT preloading is when NRT is used before the quit day, whilst the participant is still smoking. Seven studies provided participants with nicotine patches pre‐quit day (Dennis 2016 ; Preloading Investigators 2018 ; Rose 1994 ; Rose 1998 ; Rose 2006 ; Rose 2009 ; Schuurmans 2004), and two studies included participants that used patch alone, gum alone and patch plus gum pre‐quit day (Bullen 2010 ; Piper 2016). The length of nicotine preloading also varied across studies. Seven studies initiated NRT use two weeks before the quit date (Bullen 2010 ; Dennis 2016 ; Rose 1994 ; Rose 1998 ; Rose 2006 ; Rose 2009 ; Schuurmans 2004), one initiated use three weeks before the quit date (Piper 2016), and one initiated use four weeks before the quit date (Preloading Investigators 2018). Following the quit date, all study arms received active NRT.
Stopping patch use versus continuing patch use on relapsing (one study): Hughes 2018 tested whether the instruction to stop using a nicotine patch in the event of a smoking lapse resulted in different quit rates to the instruction to continue using a patch in the event of a lapse, in participants who were using nicotine patches after a quit day.
Free versus purchased NRT (two studies): these studies investigated whether buying NRT versus being provided with NRT free of charge resulted in different quit rates. Hughes 1991 had three study arms that all used nicotine gum. Participants were randomised to: 1) a free prescription for six months; 2) buying the gum for USD 6 per box; 3) buying the gum for USD 20 per box. Hays 1999 also randomised participants to three groups: 1) nicotine patches provided free of charge; 2) placebo patches provided free of charge; 3) nicotine patches bought by participants. The placebo patch group is excluded from this review.
Duration of free NRT (two studies): these studies provided participants with NRT free of charge for a limited period of the study, then encouraged participants to source the remainder of the treatment themselves. The length of free NRT varied between trial arms. Abdullah 2013 provided two weeks of free patch or gum (depending on participant preference) in one arm and one week free in the other arm. In both arms, participants were encouraged to use NRT for a total of eight to 12 weeks, sourcing the remainder themselves. Burns 2016 provided participants with eight weeks of nicotine patches in one arm and four weeks in another arm. Participants were encouraged to use patches for a total of 10 weeks and to source the remainder themselves.

### 2018 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on tobacco cessation treatment: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^b99a68f6]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) pharmacotherapy—availability, efficacy, and use: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved 5 nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products as well as bupropion and varenicline, and these medications are more effective than placebo for 6 months or more and are safe for patients with CVD; in the United States, NRT is available over the counter or by prescription as patches, gum, and lozenges, and by prescription only as a nasal spray and oral inhaler. Each NRT product has about the same efficacy, increasing quit rates with risk ratios of ~1.6 compared with placebo, and combining the nicotine patch with a more rapidly absorbed form is more effective than using a single product, with a risk ratio of 1.34 compared with single use of a single product. Combination NRT is now considered the standard of care for using NRT and should be recommended as initial therapy when NRT is chosen, nicotine patches are typically marketed with doses that taper over 12 weeks but tapering is optional, the typical duration of treatment is 12 weeks, and no harm from long-term NRT use has been reported.

### An algorithm for tailoring pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation: results from a Delphi panel of international experts [^1a2102e6]. Tobacco Control (2009). Low credibility.

Background:

Evidence-based smoking cessation guidelines recommend nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion SR and varenicline as first-line therapy in combination with behavioural interventions. However, there are limited data to guide clinicians in recommending one form over another, using combinations, or matching individual smokers to particular forms.

Objective:

To develop decision rules for clinicians to guide differential prescribing practices and tailoring of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation.

Methods:

A Delphi approach was used to build consensus among a panel of 37 international experts from various health disciplines. Through an iterative process, panellists responded to three rounds of questionnaires. Participants identified and ranked “best practices” used by them to tailor pharmacotherapy to aid smoking cessation. An independent panel of 10 experts provided cross-validation of findings.

Results:

There was a 100% response rate to all three rounds. A high level of consensus was achieved in determining the most important priorities: (1) factors to consider in prescribing pharmacotherapy: evidence, patient preference, patient experience; (2) combinations based on: failed attempt with monotherapy, patients with breakthrough cravings, level of tobacco dependence; (3) specific combinations, main categories: (a) two or more forms of NRT, (b) bupropion + form of NRT; (4) specific combinations, subcategories: (1a) patch + gum, (1b) patch + inhaler, (1c) patch + lozenge; (2a) bupropion + patch, (2b) bupropion + gum; (5) impact of comorbidities on selection of pharmacotherapy: contraindications, specific pharmacotherapy useful for certain comorbidities, dual purpose medications; (6) frequency of monitoring determined by patient needs and type of pharmacotherapy.

Conclusion:

An algorithm and guide were developed to assist clinicians in prescribing pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. There appears to be good justification for “off-label” use such as higher doses of NRT or combination therapy in certain circumstances. This practical tool reflects best evidence to date of experts in tobacco cessation.

### Initiating pharmacologic treatment in tobacco-dependent adults. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^90d18212]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Panel discussion and conclusions

The panel concluded 1) that varenicline plus a nicotine patch showed a large, desirable effect compared with varenicline alone on smoking abstinence and 2) that varenicline plus a nicotine patch may increase the risk of SAEs only slightly compared with varenicline alone. As a result, the panel suggested varenicline plus a nicotine patch rather than varenicline alone for treatment of tobacco dependence. The panel chose to make a conditional recommendation because the low certainty in estimated SAEs limited confidence in the overall certainty of the evidence.

Of note, the original clinical question sought to identify the relative effect of adding a nicotine reliever to the varenicline controller to manage acute cue-induced cravings, which returned no direct evidence for analysis. The panel therefore decided to liberalize the definition of nicotine therapy to include the patch, comparing varenicline plus a nicotine patch with varenicline alone. Given the differences in pharmacokinetics between a nicotine patch and other delivery forms, the panel did not believe that a conclusion regarding the effectiveness of other forms of nicotine replacement could be made at this time.

Recommendation 3

For tobacco-dependent adults in whom treatment is being initiated, we suggest varenicline plus a nicotine patch over using varenicline alone (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the estimated effects).

What others are saying

To our knowledge, no other clinical practice guideline has compared varenicline plus a nicotine patch with varenicline alone. The tobacco-cessation clinical pathway, recently produced by the American College of Cardiology, suggests that adding nicotine to varenicline may be an option for smokers who do not succeed with NRT or varenicline alone.

Research needs

A lack of randomized trials made answering the more specific question regarding the efficacy of varenicline plus nicotine relievers impossible. Given the potential utility of reliever medication in managing acute, cue-induced cravings and the advantages inherent to self-regulating nicotine concentrations, such trials are necessary to identify clinically relevant differences in outcomes. In addition, data are needed on the cost-effectiveness of combination therapy and on the impact on relapse after discontinuation. Mechanistic research into how nicotine potentiates varenicline’s effect could shed light on advanced pharmacologic strategies and new therapeutic targets.

Question 4: For Tobacco-Dependent Adults in Whom Treatment Is Being Initiated, Should Treatment Be Started with Varenicline or an Electronic Cigarette?

FDA-Approved Smoking Cessation Medications—nicotine lozenge is listed as OTC or Rx with dose selection by time to first cigarette (4 mg if ≤30 minutes after waking; 2 mg if >30 minutes), administration by placing between gum and cheek to melt slowly, dosing of 1 piece every 1-2 hours with a maximum of 20/day, and common side effects of mouth irritation, hiccups, heartburn, and nausea; advantages include user-controlled nicotine dose, oral substitute for cigarettes, ability to add to a patch for situational cravings, and easier use than gum for those with dental work or dentures, while a key disadvantage is no food or drink 15 minutes prior to use and during use.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^f557494f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Tobacco use is one of the leading causes of preventable illness and death worldwide, killing over eight million people every year (WHO 2022). Most people who smoke want to stop (CDC 2017); however, quitting tobacco use is difficult. This is due to an interplay of psychological, physiological, environmental and other factors that lead to dependence on smoking. The physiological dependence is caused by a chemical found in tobacco called nicotine (Benowitz 2010 ; McNeill 2017).

Description of the intervention

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is a medication formulated in a variety of ways for absorption through the oral mucosa (chewing gum, lozenges, sublingual tablets, inhaler/inhalator), nasal mucosa (spray) or skin (transdermal patches). Nicotine patches are worn on the body and deliver a nicotine dose slowly and passively through the skin. They do not replace any of the behavioural aspects of smoking. In contrast, the other types of NRT mimic some of the hand‐to‐mouth actions of smoking, provide an oral substitute, or do both, and are faster‐acting but require more effort on the user's part. Transdermal patches are available in several different doses. They deliver between 5 mg to 52.5 mg of nicotine over 24 hours, resulting in plasma levels similar to the trough levels seen between cigarettes in heavy smokers (Fiore 1992). Some brands of patch are designed to be worn for 24 hours, whilst others are to be worn for 16 hours each day. Nicotine gum is available in both 2 mg and 4 mg strengths, and nicotine lozenges are available in 1 mg, 1.5 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg strengths. However, the amount of nicotine absorbed by the user is less than the original dose. The availability of NRT products on prescription or for over‐the‐counter purchase varies from country to country. Table 8 summarises the products currently licensed in the United Kingdom.

### Diminishing benefit of smoking cessation medications during the first year: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^0a6cba1e]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Tobacco use is the most common cause of preventable death in the world today 1, 2, causing more than 7 million deaths per year 3. The fastest way to reduce the burden of smoking is through smoking cessation by current smokers 4. The effectiveness of US FDA‐recommended first‐line smoking cessation medications 5 is undisputed when considering evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Systematic reviews and meta‐analyses conducted by the Cochrane Collaboration 6, 7, 8, the US Public Health Services, 5 England's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 9 and others 10, 11, 12, 13 show consistently that smoking cessation medications help smokers quit.

However, the magnitude of benefit to individual smokers and populations is less well understood. There are two sources of confusion. First, it is possible that the benefits of medications decline, even in the context of RCTs. Many smokers who quit relapse 14, 15, 16, 17, leading to declines in quit rates over time 18, 19, 20, 21. This is well illustrated by a recent study (n = 1086), which found initial quit rates of at least 24 hours’ duration to be 70–80%, with declines over time to approximately 20% for varenicline, nicotine patch and combination nicotine groups by 1 year 22. Original reports of studies often describe quit rates at a single time‐point, with 6 months used as a standard, on the grounds that it is possible to ‘make reliable estimates of permanent cessation’ on the basis of 6‐month continued abstinence 23. Reviews and meta‐analyses usually provide a single summary measure based on quit rates at a single time‐point, or as a summary based on several time‐points (Cochrane Reviews: 6 months or more, 6–24 months 6, 7, 8 ; the US Public Health Service: 6 months 5 ; independent reviewers: 6 or 12 months 10, 12.). Representing smoking cessation at a single or composite time‐point obscures the more complex reality of declining quit rates: neither the benefit to an individual as time progresses nor to a population is easily grasped. The problem is compounded because few studies continue beyond 1 year 6, 7, 8.

### Electronic nicotine delivery systems [^178cf3e0]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Data on use of ENDS for smoking cessation—ENDS products have been promoted by some manufacturers, either explicitly or implicitly, as a smoking cessation aid, although they are not approved by the FDA as a smoking cessation product. As of publication date, 1 randomized controlled clinical trial compared nicotine-containing ENDS, nicotine-replacement therapy (21-mg nicotine patches), and placebo (no nicotine) ENDS, and six-month cessation rates were low overall with no statistically significant difference among the 3 groups. An earlier meta-analysis of tobacco dependence treatments that did not include ENDS found the nicotine patch effective, with cessation rates of 23% with the nicotine patch alone, and other population-based studies found no association between ENDS use and successful cessation of conventional cigarette use. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of ENDS for smoking cessation.

### Pharmacological treatments for smoking cessation [^be12ece0]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Among the 3 first-line smoking cessation treatments (nicotine replacement therapy [NRT], bupropion, and varenicline), which is most effective in helping people who smoke achieve and maintain abstinence from smoking for at least 6 months, and what serious adverse events are associated with each?

Bottom Line

Higher rates of smoking cessation were associated with NRT (17.6%) and bupropion (19.1%) compared with placebo (10.6%). Varenicline (27.6%) and combination NRT (31.5%) (eg, patch plus inhaler) were most effective for achieving smoking cessation. None of the therapies was associated with an increased rate of serious adverse events.

### Is a combination of varenicline and nicotine patch more effective in helping smokers quit than varenicline alone? A randomised controlled trial [^892bb472]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and varenicline are both effective in helping smokers quit. There is growing interest in combining the two treatments to improve treatment outcomes, but no experimental data exist on whether this is efficacious. This double-blind randomised controlled trial was designed to evaluate whether adding nicotine patches to varenicline improves withdrawal relief and short-term abstinence rates.

Methods

117 participants seeking help to stop smoking were randomly allocated to varenicline plus placebo patch or varenicline plus nicotine patch (15 mg/16 hour). Varenicline use commenced one week prior to the target quit date (TQD), patch use started on the TQD. Ratings of urges to smoke and cigarette withdrawal symptoms were collected weekly over 4 weeks post-TQD. Medication use and smoking status were established at 1, 4 and 12 weeks. Participants lost to follow-up were included as continuing smokers.

Results

92% of participants used both medications during the first week after the TQD. The combination treatment generated no increase in nausea or other adverse effects. It had no overall effect on urges to smoke or on other withdrawal symptoms. The combination treatment did not improve biochemically validated abstinence rates at 1 week and 4 weeks post-TQD (69% vs 59%, p=0.28 and 60% vs 59%, p=0.91, in the nicotine patch and placebo patch arm, respectively), or self reported abstinence rates at 12 weeks (36% vs. 29%, p=0.39, NS).

Conclusions

The efficacy of varenicline was not enhanced by the addition of nicotine patches, although further trials would be useful to exclude the possibility of type II error.

### A brief review of pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation [^d765afaf]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2006). Low credibility.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Clinical Practice Guidelines have established both nicotine and nonnicotine-based pharmacotherapies as efficacious treatments for smoking cessation. Smokers attempting to quit smoking can significantly increase their chances by using one of several first-line agents, including nicotine transdermal patches, gum, nasal spray, inhalers, tablets, and the antidepressant bupropion. Those who cannot use either bupropion or nicotine replacement therapy because of contraindications or lack of effectiveness may benefit from the second-line treatment nortriptyline. This article also discusses several novel compounds for smoking cessation.

NRT

NRT consists of products designed to deliver nicotine into the body in a form that does not involve smoking or ingestion of other toxins. The forms currently licensed for use in at least some countries of the world are 16‐ or 24‐hour transdermal patches, 2‐ or 4‐mg chewing gum, 1‐, 1.5‐, 2‐ or 4‐mg nicotine lozenges, 2‐mg sublingual tablet, nasal spray, inhalator, buccal pouch and mouth spray. Other nicotine products (e.g. some types of electronic nicotine delivery devices) are likely to be added to this list of licensed medicines in the coming years.

Smokers typically use these products starting on the designed target quit day and continuing for up to 12 weeks. Use can be started before the quit date, and they can be used for smoking reduction with a view to quitting at a later date.

Efficacy

When given to smokers of 15 or more cigarettes per day who are making a quit attempt on a pre‐specified day and willing to use NRT, multiple RCTs have shown that this type of aid increases 6–12‐month continuous abstinence rates by 6 percentage points (95% CI = 6–7) compared with placebo 57. These studies all involved some degree of contact with a health professional. There is no evidence from RCTs that the amount of health professional contact makes a difference to the effectiveness of the NRT although, as noted above, behavioural support has been shown to have an additive effect in and of itself 40.

There is insufficient information to draw conclusions about whether one form of NRT is likely to be more effective than another, overall, but evidence suggests that higher‐dose forms may be more effective than lower‐dose forms 57.

Evidence from multiple RCTs has shown that combining a nicotine patch with a faster‐delivery form of NRT (such as gum) increases 6–12‐month abstinence rates by 5 percentage points compared with single‐form NRT (95% CI = 3–7) 57.

NRT has not been adequately evaluated in smokers of fewer than 10 cigarettes per day and most studies have involved smokers of 15 or more cigarettes per day.

There is insufficient evidence from RCTs to draw firm conclusions as to whether or not NRT is an effective aid for smokeless tobacco cessation 58.

### Smoking cessation in clinical practice: how to get patients to stop [^ca52085a]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Tobacco use is an etiologic agent for many diseases treated by cardiac, vascular, and thoracic surgeons and contributes to increased perioperative complications and long-term risk. Smoking cessation may be challenging for patients and can be frustrating for clinicians. Lack of familiarity and pessimistic views toward cessation methods lead to underuse by physicians. Evidence-supported measures that increase chances of cessation include direct physician advice, approved pharmacotherapy, structured counseling, and a follow-up plan. Approved pharmacotherapy consists of varenicline, bupropion, or nicotine replacement therapy in the form of long-acting patches and short-acting forms of nicotine such as gum, lozenges, prescription nasal spray, or prescription inhaler. Direct physician advice is critical and strengthened when combined with more in-depth counseling from a specialist who may have more expertise and time. Integrating assessment and referral to counseling services into a clinical workflow can deliver resources in an efficient manner with the goal of providing the best available resources to all patients.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^50cd33b6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We assessed clinical and methodological heterogeneity, to establish how studies should be grouped and where it was appropriate to pool studies. To assess heterogeneity statistically, we used the I 2 statistic, given by the formula [(Q ‐ df)/Q] x 100%, where Q is the Chi 2 statistic and df is its degrees of freedom (Higgins 2003). This describes the percentage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity rather than to sampling error (chance). A value greater than 50% may be considered to indicate substantial heterogeneity.

Assessment of reporting biases

Reporting bias is best assessed using funnel plots, where 10 or more RCTs contribute to an outcome (Higgins 2011). Therefore, where a meta‐analysis included 10 or more studies, we generated and reported on a funnel plot.

Data synthesis

Following assessment of clinical heterogeneity, we separated studies into the following groups testing different NRT comparisons (based on types/uses of NRT).

Patch therapy Patch dose Duration of patch therapy Effect of tapering patch dose
Combination therapy Combination versus single form Duration of combination therapy
Fast‐acting NRT versus patch
Fast‐acting NRT Type of fast‐acting NRT Nicotine gum dose and duration Fixed versus 'ad lib' dosing schedule (ad libitum or 'ad lib' means as much and as often as desired)
NRT preloading versus standard post‐quit use
Costs Free versus purchased NRT Duration of free NRT

Studies were eligible to fall within more than one comparison.

Smoking cessation

Within these groups, we estimated pooled weighted averages using the Mantel‐Haenszel fixed‐effect method to generate risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), where appropriate. We chose a priori to use a fixed‐effect method, as we assumed that there would be minimal heterogeneity in the true effect due to the nature of the intervention. Where only one study tested a comparison, we report this narratively.

Adverse events

Within the groups above, we conducted three analyses where the relevant data were available. We estimated a pooled weighted average using Mantel‐Haenszel fixed‐effect methods comparing the number of cardiac AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to effects of the treatment, reported between trial arms. We generated effect estimates as the RR and 95% CI where appropriate.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^025ddf77]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Combination versus single form

See Table 1. Pooled data from 16 studies found greater quit rates following combination NRT treatment when compared to single‐type NRT for smoking cessation (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.37; I 2 = 12%; 16 studies, 12,169 participants; Analysis 4.1). When split into subgroups, this was equally true for combination therapy compared to: (1) patch alone (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.37; I 2 = 28%; 13 studies, 9522 participants); (2) a fast‐acting form of NRT alone (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.54; I 2 = 0%; 6 studies, 2364 participants); (3) a choice of a single form of NRT (patch or fast‐acting NRT; RR 5.16, 95% CI 1.18 to 22.6; 1 study, 253 participants). There was no clear evidence of subgroup differences (I 2 = 45.8%, P = 0.16, effect consistent across groups). Results were not sensitive to removing studies at a high risk of bias.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^3ad27e5c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Incomplete outcome data

We judged studies to be at low risk of attrition bias where the numbers of participants lost to follow‐up were clearly reported, the overall number lost to follow‐up was not more than 50%, and the difference in loss to follow‐up between groups was no greater than 20%. This is in accordance with risk of bias guidance produced by the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group for assessing smoking cessation studies. We found that 39 of the studies were at low risk of bias, 22 were at unclear risk and seven were at high risk. In six of the seven studies at high risk (Caldwell 2014 ; Dennis 2016 ; Dignan 2019 ; Krupski 2016 ; Leung 2019 ; Rose 2009), this was because overall loss to follow‐up was more than 50%. The rating of high risk in Hughes 1999 was because the study was terminated early by the sponsor, resulting in incomplete long‐term follow‐up data; losses were included in the analysis as non‐abstinent.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^8e5a1152]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

We found no clear evidence of an effect for: duration of nicotine patch use (low‐certainty evidence); 16‐hour versus 24‐hour daily patch use; duration of combination NRT use (low‐ and very low‐certainty evidence); tapering of patch dose versus abrupt patch cessation; fast‐acting NRT type (very low‐certainty evidence); duration of nicotine gum use; ad lib versus fixed dosing of fast‐acting NRT; free versus purchased NRT; length of provision of free NRT; ceasing versus continuous patch use on lapse; and participant‐ versus clinician‐selected NRT. However, this lack of evidence of an effect should not be interpreted as proof that these different forms of NRT will result in equal quit rates. In many cases, these findings are based on very low‐ or low‐certainty evidence and the findings of single studies. The exception to this is the high‐certainty evidence which suggests that using a form of fast‐acting NRT alone, such as gum or lozenge, results in similar quit rates to using a nicotine patch.

Many studies did not report cardiac AEs separately or did not report AEs and SAEs at all. Where these were reported, there was no evidence of differential cardiac AEs or overall SAEs across comparisons. Both rates were low or very low overall, except for one study of nicotine preloading, which found an excess of palpitations in the preloading arm. However, due to variations in reporting, we rate the evidence on which these findings were based as low or very low certainty. The number of withdrawals from trials reported to be due to treatment was also variably reported across studies. We rated the contributing evidence to be of low and very low certainty. For most comparisons, the frequency of these withdrawals was similar between groups; however, more withdrawals due to treatment were reported in participants using nasal spray (3.0%) in comparison to patch (0.9%) in one trial, and in participants using 42/44 mg patches (6.1%) in comparison to 21/22 mg patches (1.1%) across two trials (low‐certainty evidence). In both cases, the withdrawal rates due to treatment were low, so their clinical relevance may be limited when considered alongside other clinical factors, such as initial patient preference and efficacy.

### Effects on abstinence of nicotine patch treatment before quitting smoking: parallel, two arm, pragmatic randomised trial [^92ad5841]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

If smoking occurs without the reinforcement provided by nicotinic stimulation, the drive to smoke should diminish and, when a smoker attempts to quit, they should experience less intense craving and be more likely to succeed. One way to block the effect of nicotine from cigarettes is to use a nicotine patch. Doing so desensitises the cholinergic brain receptors, meaning they are refractory to further stimulation from cigarette supplied nicotine.This should reduce the intensity of the urge to smoke while smoking and, crucially, lowered dependence will reduce craving intensity if someone makes a quit attempt, facilitating abstinence.

Using a nicotine replacement treatment (or other smoking cessation drugs) before a quit attempt while smoking normally is called preloading. A systematic review showed some, but not convincing, evidence that nicotine preloading may be effective, with much unexplained heterogeneity between studies.Some studies suggested that nicotine preloading doubled the likelihood of achieving abstinence, which, if true, suggests that using nicotine replacement therapy before a quit attempt is more effective than when used in the conventional way to support smoking abstinence.Other studies suggested preloading had no effect. A partial explanation for the heterogeneity may relate to the form of nicotine replacement used. Smoking while using patches produces higher blood nicotine concentrations than just smoking, but smoking while using short acting nicotine replacement therapy, such as gum, does not.There was some but not strong evidence in the review that preloading using a nicotine patch was more effective than preloading with oral nicotine replacement therapy. Since then, three more studies using varenicline and bupropion preloading have been conducted, with some evidence of a benefit on short term cessation.These studies are relevant because they examine the same hypothetical active ingredient of the preloading interventions as studies of nicotine replacement therapy—that is, the effects of reduced satisfaction from smoking. Together, these studies have provided modest support that preloading works through reducing the intensity of urges to smoke. 78-12

Given the promise and uncertainty around this novel approach to treating tobacco dependence, we conducted a large trial in a routine health service context to examine the impact of nicotine replacement therapy preloading on long term abstinence and mechanisms of its action.

### 2018 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on tobacco cessation treatment: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^aedf0d0b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Smoking cessation pharmacotherapy—efficacy and first-line options in cardiovascular disease (CVD) smokers: In comparative trials, quit rates were varenicline (21.8%), bupropion (16.2%), nicotine patch (15.7%), and placebo (9.4%), and quit rates were higher in smokers without psychiatric illness than in those with psychiatric illness, but the relative efficacy across drugs was similar. Extending varenicline for 6 months to prevent relapse is effective and has been approved by the FDA, and meta-analyses suggest that varenicline and combination nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) are similarly efficacious as stand-alone therapies, making these 2 approaches first-line recommendations for smoking cessation in smokers with CVD. The efficacy of combining varenicline with nicotine patch to promote smoking cessation has been studied with mixed results; although the mechanism of benefit is not clear, the combination is generally well-tolerated and is an option for smokers who do not succeed with the individual products alone.

### Development of procedures for early screening of smoking cessation medications in humans [^55320d10]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Candidate medications for smoking cessation may be screened more efficiently if initial evaluations in humans combine the practical advantages of laboratory studies with the clinical validity of clinical trials, such as by increasing participants' "quit motivation" during brief testing. We manipulated "intrinsic" quit motivation by recruiting smokers who either did intend to quit soon ("treatment seekers," N = 47) or did not ("nonseekers," N = 93), and "extrinsic" quit motivation by providing or not providing reinforcement for abstinence ($12/day). All the subjects smoked as they would usually do during weeks 1 and 3, and tried to quit during weeks 2 and 4 using either a nicotine patch (21 mg) or a placebo patch, in accordance with the crossover design of the study. The nicotine patch increased abstinence in treatment seekers but not in nonseekers. Reinforcement had a main effect on abstinence but did not moderate the effects of the nicotine patch or treatment-seeking status. Intrinsic, but not extrinsic, quit motivation of participants may enhance the validity of brief tests of medication efficacy for smoking cessation.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^8f215aa5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster‐randomised trials and quasi‐randomised trials (i.e. trials where treatment allocation was not truly random). Cross‐over RCTs were not eligible for inclusion as this design does not allow for assessment of longer‐term intervention effects on smoking cessation.

Types of participants

We included people of any age who smoked and were motivated to quit, irrespective of the setting from which they were recruited or their initial level of nicotine dependence. We included studies that randomised therapists, rather than people who smoked, provided that the specific aim of the study was to examine the effect of different types of NRT use on smoking cessation. We have not included trials that randomised physicians or other therapists to receive an educational intervention, which included encouraging their patients to use NRT, but have reviewed them separately (Carson 2012).

Types of interventions

We included any form, dose, duration and schedule of NRT use (this could include any type of NRT, i.e. gum, transdermal patches, nasal and oral spray, inhalers and tablets or lozenges). Eligible comparisons were any other form(s), dose(s), duration(s) or schedule(s) of NRT use (this could also include any type of NRT).

The terms 'inhaler' and 'inhalator' (an oral device that delivers nicotine through the mouth by inhalation, for absorption through the buccal mucosa) are used interchangeably in the literature. We have used the term 'inhaler' throughout the rest of this review.

Studies were not eligible for inclusion if one of the study arms received an additional intervention component that could not be separated from the NRT intervention, making it impossible to establish whether any effect found was a result of the difference in NRT use or the additional component. We did not include studies that evaluated the effect of NRT for individuals who were attempting to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked rather than quit. A separate review of harm reduction approaches covers this type of study (Lindson‐Hawley 2016).

### Does improved access and greater choice of nicotine replacement therapy affect smoking cessation success? Findings from a randomized controlled trial [^e789b69f]. Addiction (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

To determine the effect of offering smokers who want to quit easy access to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), a period of familiarization and choice of product on smoking abstinence at 6 months.

Design

Single-blind, randomized controlled trial.

Setting

New Zealand.

Participants

A total of 1410 adult smokers who called the national Quitline for quitting support were randomized to usual Quitline care or a box containing different NRT products (patch, gum, inhaler, sublingual tablet, oral pouch) to try for a week prior to quitting, and then to choose one or two of these products for 8 weeks' use.

Measurements

The primary outcome was 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence 6 months after quit day. Secondary outcomes included continuous abstinence, cigarette consumption, withdrawal, NRT choice and serious adverse events at 1 and 3 weeks and 3 and 6 months.

Findings

No differences in 6-month quit rates (7-day point prevalence or continuous abstinence) were observed between the groups. However, smokers allocated to the intervention group were more likely to have quit smoking at 3 months [self-reported point prevalence, relative risk (RR)=1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02, 1.35, P=0.03], had a longer time to relapse (median 70 days versus 28 days, P<0.01) and used significantly more NRT. The selection box concept was highly acceptable to users, with the patch and inhaler combination the most popular choice (34%).

Conclusions

In terms of smoking abstinence at 6 months, offering smokers who want to quit free access to a wide range of nicotine replacement therapy, including a 1-week period of familiarization and choice of up to two products, appears no different to offering reduced cost and choice of nicotine replacement therapy, with no familiarization period. This trial is registered with the Australasian Clinical Trials Network Number: ACTRN 12606000451505.

### Adapting smoking cessation treatment according to initial response to precessation nicotine patch [^cbab5268]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE The authors evaluated an adaptive smoking cessation treatment strategy in which nicotine patch treatment was initiated before a quit date, and then, depending on initial therapeutic response, either the nicotine patch was continued or alternative pharmacotherapies were provided. METHOD The study was a double-blind, parallel-arm adaptive treatment trial. A total of 606 cigarette smokers started open-label nicotine patch treatment 2 weeks before the quit date. Those whose ad lib smoking did not decrease by &gt;50% after 1 week were randomly assigned to one of three double-blind treatments: nicotine patch alone (control condition); "rescue" treatment with bupropion augmentation of the patch; or rescue treatment with varenicline alone. Participants whose precessation smoking decreased &gt;50% but who lapsed after the quit date were also randomly assigned to the two rescue treatments or to nicotine patch alone. Logistic regression analyses compared each rescue treatment against the control condition in terms of abstinence at the end of treatment (weeks 8-11) and at 6 months. RESULTS Smokers who did not respond adequately to precessation nicotine patch benefited from bupropion augmentation; abstinence rates at end of treatment were 16% with nicotine patch alone and 28% with bupropion augmentation (odds ratio=2.04, 95% CI=1.03-4.01). Switching to varenicline produced less robust effects, but point abstinence at 6 months was 6.6% with the patch alone and 16.5% with a switch to varenicline (odds ratio=2.80, 95% CI=1.11-7.06). Postquit adaptive changes in treatment had no significant effects on any abstinence outcome. CONCLUSIONS It is possible to rescue a significant portion of smokers who would have failed to achieve abstinence if left on nicotine patch alone by identifying these smokers before their quit date and implementing adaptive changes in treatment.

### Efficacy of combined varenicline and nicotine replacement therapy compared with varenicline or nicotine replacement therapy alone for smoking cessation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4637246d]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To assess whether combining nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) with varenicline improves long-term smoking cessation rates compared with varenicline or NRT alone.

Method

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs, conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted through June 2025. The primary outcome was smoking abstinence at the longest follow-up (≥6months). Secondary outcomes included adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. The protocol was pre-registered in the PROSPERO (registration number CRD42024600510).

Results

Seven trials including 2631 participants met inclusion criteria. Compared with varenicline alone, combination therapy was associated with statistically significantly higher abstinence rates at the longest follow-up (RR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.04-1.69; 5 studies; I 2 =51%). A sensitivity analysis including trials with ≥3 months of follow-up yielded similar results (RR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.06-1.62; 6 studies). However, when excluding the trial at high risk of bias, the result was not statistically significant (RR = 1.26, 95% CI = 0.94-1.68). Compared with NRT alone, only one RCT was included, and the effect of combination therapy on abstinence was not statistically significant (RR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.51-1.72). AEs were more common with combination therapy compared with varenicline alone (RR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.02-1.20). Specifically, skin reactions were significantly increased with NRT patch plus varenicline (RR = 1.67; 95% CI = 1.29-2.16). Compared with NRT alone, combination therapy was associated with increased AEs (RR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.07-1.41). SAEs were infrequent and generally unrelated to treatment.

Conclusions

Low-certainty evidence indicates that combining varenicline with nicotine replacement therapy may improve long-term smoking cessation rates compared with varenicline alone and is generally well tolerated.

### Is a combination of varenicline and nicotine patch more effective in helping smokers quit than varenicline alone? A randomised controlled trial [^bfe5fa7e]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Trial medications

Varenicline

Commercial supplies were used as per standard labelling (0.5 mg/d for the first 3 days, 1 mg/d on days 4–7, followed by 2 mg/d for the rest of the 12-weeks course).

Patches

Nicotine (15 mg/16 hours) and placebo patches were identically packaged. Participants received a box containing a four-week supply (28 patches) on their TQD. We opted for a patch with proven efficacy, which avoids sleep disturbance sometimes associated with 24 h patch.

Sample size

Effective treatments typically generate a difference in MPSS ratings over the first week of abstinence of at least 0.7 compared to control procedures, e.g. 1.8 (SD=1) compared to 2.5 (SD=1). As in this case the advantage of the combination over the first week of abstinence may be subtle and even a difference of 0.6 would be worth detecting, 45 participants would be needed in each group (p<0.05, 2-tailed test, power=0.80). To allow for participant attrition, the study aimed to randomise between 110 and 120 participants. This sample size also provides 80% power to detect a clinically meaningful difference between abstinence rates of 50% vs 75% at four weeks (p<0.05, 2-tailed tests).

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^5edeb1aa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Other variations in patch use

Two final studies tested the effects of other variations in patch use (Daughton 1991 ; Hughes 2018). These studies did not fall under the headings above and we did not enter them into a meta‐analysis.

Daughton 1991 looked at the effect of using the same nicotine patches (nicotine dose and delivery system not specified) for 24 hours a day versus 16 hours a day (in the former group, participants wore patches overnight, and in the latter, during waking hours only). Quit rates were higher in the 16‐hour a day patch use group (17/55 participants) compared to the 24‐hour group (11/51 participants), but CIs encompassed no difference as well as an effect in the opposite direction (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.34; 106 participants; Analysis 13.1). Whilst Daughton 1991 reported common AEs, it did not report specifically on cardiac AEs or SAEs. Overall, 1.3% of participants withdrew due to treatment, but withdrawals by treatment arm were not reported (Appendix 2).
Hughes 2018 found no clear evidence that instructing participants to continue using a patch in the event of a smoking lapse resulted in higher quit rates than instructing participants to stop using a nicotine patch in the event of a lapse: 174/356 quit in the continuing group and 190/345 in the stopping group (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.02; 701 participants; Analysis 13.1). Hughes 2018 also found no evidence of an effect of differential NRT use on SAEs, though CIs were wide (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.84; 1 study, 701 participants; Analysis 13.6).

### Nicotine receptor partial agonists for smoking cessation [^00599cd5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Nicotine receptor partial agonists may help people to stop smoking by a combination of maintaining moderate levels of dopamine to counteract withdrawal symptoms (acting as an agonist) and reducing smoking satisfaction (acting as an antagonist). Varenicline was developed as a nicotine receptor partial agonist from cytisine, a drug widely used in central and eastern Europe for smoking cessation. The first trial reports of varenicline were released in 2006, and further trials have now been published or are currently underway.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review is to assess the efficacy and tolerability of nicotine receptor partial agonists, including varenicline and cytisine, for smoking cessation.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's specialised register for trials, using the terms ('varenicline' or 'cytisine' or 'Tabex' or 'nicotine receptor partial agonist') and 'smoking' in the title or abstract, or as keywords. We also searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL using MeSH terms and free text, and we contacted authors of trial reports for additional information where necessary. The latest search was in September 2010.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials which compared the treatment drug with placebo. We also included comparisons with bupropion and nicotine patches where available. We excluded trials which did not report a minimum follow-up period of six months from start of treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data on the type of participants, the dose and duration of treatment, the outcome measures, the randomization procedure, concealment of allocation, and completeness of follow up.The main outcome measured was abstinence from smoking after at least six months from the beginning of treatment. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence, and preferred biochemically validated rates where they were reported. Where appropriate we performed meta-analysis to produce a risk ratio, using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We found 11 trials of varenicline compared with placebo for smoking cessation; three of these included a bupropion experimental arm. We also found one relapse prevention trial, comparing varenicline with placebo, and two open-label trials comparing varenicline with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). We also include one trial in which all the participants were given varenicline, but received behavioural support either online or by phone calls, or by both methods. This trial is not included in the analyses, but contributes to the data on safety and tolerability. The included studies covered >10,300 participants, 6892 of whom used varenicline. We identified one trial of cytisine (Tabex) for inclusion.The pooled risk ratio (RR) (10 trials, 4443 people, excluding one trial evaluating long term safety) for continuous abstinence at six months or longer for varenicline at standard dosage versus placebo was 2.31 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.01 to 2.66). Varenicline at lower or variable doses was also shown to be effective, with an RR of 2.09 (95% CI 1.56 to 2.78; 4 trials, 1272 people). The pooled RR for varenicline versus bupropion at one year was 1.52 (95% CI 1.22 to 1.88; 3 trials, 1622 people). The RR for varenicline versus NRT for point prevalence abstinence at 24 weeks was 1.13 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.35; 2 trials, 778 people). The two trials which tested the use of varenicline beyond the 12-week standard regimen found the drug to be well-tolerated during long-term use. The main adverse effect of varenicline was nausea, which was mostly at mild to moderate levels and usually subsided over time. Post-marketing safety data raised questions about a possible association between varenicline and depressed mood, agitation, and suicidal behaviour or ideation. The labelling of varenicline was amended in 2008, and the manufacturers produced a Medication Guide. Thus far, surveillance reports and secondary analyses of trial data lend little support to a causal relationship.The one cytisine trial included in this review found that more participants taking cytisine stopped smoking compared with placebo at two-year follow up, with an RR of 1.61 (95% CI 1.24 to 2.08).

Authors' Conclusions

Varenicline at standard dose increased the chances of successful long-term smoking cessation between two- and threefold compared with pharmacologically unassisted quit attempts. Lower dose regimens also conferred benefits for cessation, while reducing the incidence of adverse events. More participants quit successfully with varenicline than with bupropion. Two open-label trials of varenicline versus NRT suggested a modest benefit of varenicline but confidence intervals did not rule out equivalence. Limited evidence suggests that varenicline may have a role to play in relapse prevention. The main adverse effect of varenicline is nausea, but mostly at mild to moderate levels and tending to subside over time. Possible links with serious adverse events, including depressed mood, agitation and suicidal thoughts, have been reported but are so far not substantiated.There is a need for further independent community-based trials of varenicline, to test its efficacy and safety in smokers with varying co-morbidities and risk patterns. There is a need for further trials of the efficacy of treatment extended beyond 12 weeks. Cytisine may also increase the chances of quitting, but the evidence at present is inconclusive.

Inpatient pharmacotherapy and counseling—Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is used because of its rapid onset of action and overall safety, with the nicotine patch the most often used product because of its ability to sustain nicotine levels over a 24-hour period and short-acting nicotine products (lozenges, gum, or an inhaler) used as needed to manage acute cravings in the hospital. Using nicotine replacement in the hospital also increases the odds that a smoker will use the medication after discharge, and adding nicotine replacement to counseling increases hospitalized smokers’ odds of long-term abstinence; for discharge, TOB-3 states to offer tobacco cessation treatment at hospital discharge, documenting the offer of both pharmacotherapy and counseling that will continue after discharge, with a prescription for a smoking cessation medication in the discharge medication list satisfying the pharmacotherapy criterion, and all cessation medications (NRT, bupropion, and varenicline) safe to prescribe at hospital discharge, even in patients admitted with ACS, with combination NRT and varenicline considered first-line options.

When you wake up, put a fresh patch on clean skin and wear it for a full 24 hours. If you find that you are having vivid dreams or that your sleep is disturbed, you can take the patch off before bed and put a new one on the next morning. Put the patch on clean, dry, hair-free skin on the upper body. Usual places to put the patch are the upper chest, upper arm, shoulder, back, or inner arm. Avoid putting the patch on areas of irritated, oily, scarred, or damaged skin. Remove the patch from the foil package, peel off the protective strips, and immediately apply the patch to your skin. Press down to ensure the patch sticks to your skin. Wash your hands with soap and water after you apply the patchto wash away any nicotine you may have gotten on your fingers when applying the patch. To avoid skin irritation, put the patch on a different area of your upper body each day. Avoid wearing the patch in the same place more than once per week.

If the patch loosens or falls off, replace it with a new one. When changing your patch, remove the patch carefully and dispose of it by folding it in half with the sticky sides touching. Then apply a new patch to a different part of your upper body. Keep out of reach of children and pets. When you wake up, put a fresh patch on clean skin and wear it for a full 24 hours.

### Pre-cessation nicotine replacement therapy: pragmatic randomized trial [^1d755ffc]. Addiction (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

To determine the effectiveness of 2 weeks' pre-cessation nicotine patches and/or gum on smoking abstinence at 6 months.

Design

Pragmatic randomized controlled trial.

Setting

New Zealand.

Participants

Eleven hundred adult, dependent smokers who called the New Zealand Quitline between March 2006 and May 2007 for support to stop smoking were randomized to 2 weeks of nicotine patches and/or gum prior to their target quit day followed by usual care (8 weeks of patches and/or gum plus support calls from a Quitline adviser), or to usual care alone.

Measurements

The primary outcome was self-reported 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence 6 months after quit day. Secondary outcomes included continuous abstinence, cotinine-verified abstinence, daily cigarette consumption, withdrawal symptoms and adverse events.

Findings

Six months after quit day 125 (22.7%) participants in the pre-cessation group and 116 (21.0%) in the control group reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence (relative risk 1.08 95% CI: 0.86, 1.35, P = 0.4, risk difference 1.7%, 95% CI: -3.2%, 6.6%). However, when pooled in a meta-analysis with other pre-cessation trials a moderate benefit of about a one-quarter increase in cessation rates was evident. There was no difference in adverse events between groups.

Conclusions

In this, the largest pre-cessation NRT trial to date, using NRT 2 weeks before the target quit day was safe and well tolerated but offered no benefit over usual care. However, in conjunction with previous pre-cessation trials there appears to be a moderate benefit, but not as large as that seen in most smaller trials.

### Effects of nicotine patch vs varenicline vs combination nicotine replacement therapy on smoking cessation at 26 weeks: a randomized clinical trial [^e48ab83f]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Smoking cessation medications are routinely used in health care; it is vital to identify medications that most effectively treat this leading cause of preventable mortality.

Objective

To compare the efficacies of varenicline, combination nicotine replacement therapy (C-NRT), and the nicotine patch for 26-week quit rates.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Three-group randomized intention-to-treat clinical trial occurring from May 2012 to November 2015 among smokers recruited in the Madison, Wisconsin, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, communities; 65.5% of smokers offered the study (2687/4102) refused participation prior to randomization.

Interventions

Participants were randomized to one of three 12-week open-label smoking cessation pharmacotherapy groups: (1) nicotine patch only (n=241); (2) varenicline only (including 1 prequit week; n=424); and (3) C-NRT (nicotine patch+nicotine lozenge; n=421). Six counseling sessions were offered.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was carbon monoxide-confirmed self-reported 7-day point-prevalence abstinence at 26 weeks. Secondary outcomes were carbon monoxide-confirmed self-reported initial abstinence, prolonged abstinence at 26 weeks, and point-prevalence abstinence at weeks 4, 12, and 52.

Results

Among 1086 smokers randomized (52% women; 67% white; mean age, 48 years; mean of 17 cigarettes smoked per day), 917 (84%) provided 12-month follow-up data. Treatments did not differ on any abstinence outcome measure at 26 or 52 weeks, including point-prevalence abstinence at 26 weeks (nicotine patch, 22.8% [55/241]; varenicline, 23.6% [100/424]; and C-NRT, 26.8% [113/421]) or at 52 weeks (nicotine patch, 20.8% [50/241]; varenicline, 19.1% [81/424]; and C-NRT, 20.2% [85/421]). At 26 weeks, the risk differences for abstinence were, for patch vs varenicline, -0.76% (95% CI, -7.4% to 5.9%); for patch vs C-NRT, -4.0% (95% CI, -10.8% to 2.8%); and for varenicline vs C-NRT, -3.3% (95% CI, -9.1% to 2.6%). All medications were well tolerated, but varenicline produced more frequent adverse events than did the nicotine patch for vivid dreams, insomnia, nausea, constipation, sleepiness, and indigestion.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults motivated to quit smoking, 12 weeks of open-label treatment with nicotine patch, varenicline, or C-NRT produced no significant differences in biochemically confirmed rates of smoking abstinence at 26 weeks. The results raise questions about the relative effectiveness of intense smoking pharmacotherapies.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^2e5f0222]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Three studies comparing patch doses collected data on overall serious adverse effects (SAEs); however, only two studies reported events and contributed to the pooled effect estimate (Hughes 1999 ; Jorenby 1995 ; TNSG 1991). This pooled estimate showed an increased number of events in the higher‐dose arm but with wide CIs incorporating no difference as well as potentially favouring the lower‐dose (RR 5.01, 95% CI 0.87 to 28.82; I 2 = 0%; 3 studies, 1560 participants; Analysis 1.4). The overall number of events was notably very small (seven in the higher‐dose arms and one in the lower‐dose arms).

When we compared 42/44 mg versus 21/22 mg (24‐hour) patches, we found a difference in study withdrawals due to treatment, with more withdrawals occurring in participants receiving higher‐dose patches and CIs excluding no difference (RR 4.99, 95% CI 1.60 to 15.50; I 2 = 0%; 2 studies, 544 participants; Analysis 1.5). However, when we compared 21 mg to 14 mg (24‐hour) patches, the evidence was inconclusive (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.64; 1 study, 537 participants; Analysis 1.5). Two additional studies reported treatment withdrawals overall rather than by trial arm: CEASE 1999 reported that 2% of participants withdrew overall and Rose 2010 reported 3% overall.

A final study randomised people to five nicotine‐patch treatment conditions (placebo, 21 mg, 42 mg, or a tailored dose at either 50% or 100% nicotine replacement based on smoking history) (Garvey 2006). The authors concluded that individualising 100% replacement of nicotine based on smoking history was not more efficacious than standard patch treatment in moderately‐ to heavily‐dependent people who smoked; however, findings of other relevant comparisons were not reported.

### Prevalence of popular smoking cessation aids in england and associations with quit success [^a9037171]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

This survey study examined the prevalence of use of different smoking cessation aids in England and associations with quit success. We found that many people who tried to stop smoking from 2006 to 2024 did so without using any support. This is the least effective way to quit: we found that after adjusting for their level of addiction and other features of their quit attempt, smokers who tried to quit unaided had around one-third lower odds of successfully quitting than those who used some form of support.

As of 2023 to 2024, the most commonly used smoking cessation aid was e-cigarettes, used in 40% of quit attempts. We found that quit attempts aided by e-cigarettes were more likely to be successful than those that were not. This is consistent with evidence from randomized clinical trials, and previous observational studies, and provides further evidence that, in addition to being popular, e-cigarettes offer one of the most effective methods of quitting smoking. Of individuals who used e-cigarettes to quit, most (85%) were still vaping at the time of the survey. This is in line with UK guidance, which encourages people not to rush to stop vaping immediately after quitting smoking, but to gradually decrease their vaping frequency or nicotine strength when they feel confident they can do so without risking relapse to smoking.

The next most popular aid in 2023 to 2024 was over-the-counter NRT, used in 17% of quit attempts. While substantial trial evidence shows NRT to be an effective treatment(albeit less effective than e-cigarettes), our data did not show any benefit of using over-the-counter NRT. We only found NRT to be associated with higher odds of success when it was obtained on prescription (which occurred much less frequently). This may be because when people buy NRT themselves, without any advice on how to use it effectively, they either do not use enough NRT or use it incorrectly. Evidence shows NRT is more effective for smoking cessation when used as a combination of a slow-release patch to suppress withdrawal symptoms and a fast-acting form (eg, gum, lozenge, inhaler) to satisfy in-the-moment urges.

### Effect of mailing nicotine patches on tobacco cessation among adult smokers: a randomized clinical trial [^2b5c6947]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

The efficacy of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is well demonstrated in clinical trials in which NRT is accompanied by behavioral support. Epidemiologic data, however, indicate that people using NRT are no more likely to successfully quit smoking than those who do not use NRT.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of mailing nicotine patches to smokers without behavioral support on quit success rates.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A single-blinded, 2-group randomized clinical trial of adult smokers recruited across Canada by random-digit dialing of home and cell telephone numbers from June 4, 2012, through June 26, 2014. Follow-up was completed on January 5, 2015, and data were analyzed from May 24, 2015, through July 6, 2015. A total of 2093 individuals who smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day were interviewed at baseline and asked if they would be hypothetically interested in receiving nicotine patches by mail to quit smoking. Those who were interested and deemed eligible to participate (no contraindications to NRT) were randomized to the experimental group to be mailed a 5-week supply of nicotine patches or to a control group. Telephone follow-ups were conducted at 8 weeks and 6 months.

Interventions

Participants in the experimental group were sent a 5-week course of nicotine patches by expedited postal mail (3 weeks of step 1 [21 mg of nicotine], 1 week of step 2 [14 mg of nicotine], 1 week of step 3 [7 mg of nicotine], no behavioral support provided). Participants randomized to the control group were not offered the nicotine patches or any other intervention.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was 30-day smoking abstinence at 6 months.

Results

Of the 2093 participants who were interviewed as part of the baseline survey (76.5% response rate), 1000 were found eligible for the trial and randomized to a group. Analyses were conducted on 500 participants in the experimental group (mean [SD] age, 48.0 [12.8] years; 255 female [51.0%]) and 499 in the control group (mean [SD] age, 49.7 [12.7] years; 256 female [51.3%]). Self-reported abstinence rates were significantly higher among participants who were sent nicotine patches compared with the control group (30-day abstinence: 38 [7.6%] of 500 vs 15 [3.0%] of 499; odds ratio, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.44-4.89; P =.002). Usable saliva samples were returned by only 50.9% of the participants. Biochemically validated abstinence at 6 months was found in 14 (2.8%) of 500 participants in the experimental group vs 5 (1.0%) of 499 in the control group (odds ratio, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.02-7.96; P =.046).

Conclusions and Relevance

The trial provides evidence of the effectiveness of mailed nicotine patches without behavioral support to promote tobacco cessation. The strength of these findings is tempered by the lack of biochemical validation for all participants.

### Initiating pharmacologic treatment in tobacco-dependent adults. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^0a0f913e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Question 1—tobacco-dependent adults in whom treatment is being initiated, varenicline versus a nicotine patch—summary of evidence indicates that only 3% of smokers who are untreated will achieve abstinence within a given year, and the systematic review identified 14 RCTs directly comparing varenicline with a nicotine patch. Eleven RCTs reported point-prevalence abstinence at 6 months after treatment, assessed by self-report and exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO) verification (n = 7,362), and nine RCTs (n = 7,153) reported important outcomes, including point-prevalence abstinence during the 10- to 12-week treatment period. Compared with a nicotine patch, varenicline increased long-term abstinence at 6-month follow-up (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.32; ARR, 40 more per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 18 more to 65 more; high certainty in the estimated effects) and increased 7-day point-prevalence abstinence during the treatment period (RR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.31 to 1.49; ARR, 101 more per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 79 more to 124 more; high certainty in the estimated effects). Varenicline likely reduced the risk of SAEs compared with a nicotine patch (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.00; ARR, 3 fewer per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 5 fewer to 0 fewer; moderate certainty in the estimated effects) and may also reduce relapse at the end of follow-up (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.11; low certainty in the estimated effects). Relative impact on QOL could not be evaluated because of a paucity of data.

### Strategies to help a smoker who is struggling to quit [^c2192ed7]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death worldwide. Stopping tobacco use benefits virtually every smoker. Most of the 19% of US residents who smoke want to quit and have tried to do so. Most individual quit attempts fail, but two-thirds of smokers use no treatment when trying to quit. Treating tobacco dependence is one of the most cost-effective actions in health care. With a brief intervention, physicians can prompt smokers to attempt to quit and connect them to evidence-based treatment that includes pharmacotherapy and behavioral support (ie, counseling). Physicians can link smokers to effective counseling support offered by a free national network of telephone quit lines. Smokers who use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, or varenicline when trying to quit double their odds of success. The most effective way to use NRT is to combine the long-acting nicotine patch with a shorter-acting product (lozenge, gum, inhaler, or nasal spray) and extend treatment beyond 12 weeks. Observational studies have not confirmed case reports of behavior changes associated with varenicline and bupropion, and these drugs' benefits outweigh potential risks. A chronic disease management model is effective for treating tobacco dependence, which deserves as high a priority in health care systems as treating other chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension.

### Nicotine patch, varenicline, or combination therapy for smoking cessation (...) [^be906d5b]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was carbon monoxide–confirmed self-reported 7-day point-prevalence abstinence at 26 weeks. Secondary outcomes were carbon monoxide–confirmed self-reported initial abstinence, prolonged abstinence at 26 weeks, and point-prevalence abstinence at weeks 4, 12, and 52. Participants were randomized to receive open-label varenicline, C-NRT, or nicotine patch. Pharmacotherapy duration was 12 weeks. The pre-quit varenicline regimen was a 0. 5-mg pill once daily for 3 days; a
0. 5-mg pill twice daily for 4 days; and a 1-mg pill twice daily for 3 days; starting on the TQD, participants took a 1-mg pill twice daily for 11 weeks. Dosage reduction was counseled in response to adverse events such as nausea.

The NRT patch regimens, beginning on the morning of the quit day were 8 weeks of 21-mg patches, then 2 weeks of 14-mg patches, then 2 weeks of 7-mg patches. Participants in the C-NRT condition were also given either 2-mg or 4-mg nicotine lozenges based on morning smoking latency and were asked to use at least 5 lozenges per day for the full 12 weeks unless this amount produced adverse effects. All participants were instructed about possible adverse effects and to contact the research staff in case of significant problems. Table 2 shows 7-day biochemically confirmed point-prevalence abstinence rates for the 3 treatment conditions.

Among those who smoked more than 30 minutes after waking the 26-week abstinence rates for the patch-only and C-NRT conditions were 36% and 31%, respectively; among those smoking within 30 minutes of waking, abstinence rates were 19. 1% and
25. 3%, respectively.

### Initiating pharmacologic treatment in tobacco-dependent adults. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^e6f933a4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ATS tobacco dependence—combination varenicline plus nicotine patch versus varenicline alone at treatment initiation: Varenicline plus a nicotine patch statistically increased abstinence compared with varenicline alone during treatment (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.54; ARR, 112 more per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 40 more to 196 more; high certainty) and at 6 months or later when assessed by self-report and confirmed by CO (RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.72; ARR, 105 more per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 21 more to 211 more; high certainty). Serious adverse events (SAEs) may be slightly increased with combination therapy versus varenicline alone (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.27 to 4.05; ARR, 1 more per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 10 fewer to 42 more; low certainty), and withdrawal symptom effects at 4 weeks were very uncertain (Mood and Physical Symptoms Scale: MD, 0.04 lower; Wisconsin Withdrawal Symptom Scale: MD, 0.1 higher). Accordingly, the guideline states, “we suggest varenicline plus a nicotine patch over using varenicline alone (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the estimated effects).”

### Health-care interventions to promote and assist tobacco cessation: a review of efficacy, effectiveness and affordability for use in national guideline development [^b02ec0fd]. Addiction (2015). Low credibility.

Effectiveness

Several cross‐sectional surveys have been reported as having failed to find that smokers using NRT to aid a quit attempt are more likely to still be abstinent at the time of the survey 59, 60, 61, but the data have, in some cases, been misinterpreted. Importantly, they failed to adjust adequately for major confounding variables such as dependence, and it is known that more dependent smokers opt to use NRT 62, 63. A large cross‐sectional study and a prospective study that adjusted for nicotine dependence found an effect of NRT when prescribed or given by a health professional that was similar to that found in RCTs, but no effect when NRT was bought over the counter 64, 65. Two other adequately designed prospective studies with sufficient power to detect an effect of NRT found that, adjusting for major confounding factors, smokers who used NRT in their most recent quit attempt were more likely than those who did not to maintain abstinence 66, 67. Both were multi‐national cohort studies. One involved follow‐up for 6 months and the other for a year; the effect size in both cases was in line with what would be predicted from the RCTs. It has also been shown that smokers in the English stop‐smoking services who use NRT are more likely to succeed in the short term than those who elect not to use any medication 41. A note of caution is sounded by the fact that the only RCT of nicotine patches in a low‐income country failed to find an effect 68.

Overall, our analysis suggests that NRT in the context of at least some behavioural support can aid smoking cessation in moderately heavy or heavy smokers. It appears not to be effective when bought from shops with no behavioural support. Combining transdermal patches with a faster‐acting product such as chewing gum or lozenge is more effective than using either alone.

Affordability

With an effect size of 6 percentage points at 6–12 months, and assuming up to 40 minutes of health‐worker time to explain and supervise use, NRT is affordable in middle‐ and high‐income countries but not in low‐income countries (see Table 2 and Supporting information). Generic NRT can now be produced cheaply, and this will increase its affordability. Prescribing combination NRT (patch plus a faster‐acting form) is likely to be more cost‐effective because of the additional effectiveness of the medication without an increase in prescriber time for supervision (see Supporting information).

### Flexible, dual-form nicotine replacement therapy or varenicline in comparison with nicotine patch for smoking cessation: a randomized controlled trial [^a4a086c6]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our trial suggests that, in comparison to a standard nicotine patch, flexible and dual-form NRT and varenicline enhance cessation in the short-term but, unfortunately, the effect appears to wane over time. Although both NRT+ and VR led to increased odds of quitting from 5 to 10 weeks and VR produced improved cessation rates from 5 to 22 weeks, only clinically significant differences between the NRT and VR groups (5.3 %) were observed at 1 year. The results presented herein, therefore, do not fully support the use of flexible, dual-form nicotine replacement therapies or varenicline rather than standard nicotine patch for smoking cessation maintenance. Future research is needed to clarify the effectiveness of these treatments; trials that investigate both the dose and duration of each treatment condition are needed.

### 2018 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on tobacco cessation treatment: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^491496a8]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Varenicline mechanism and comparative effectiveness for smoking cessation—Varenicline is a partial agonist at the α4β2 nicotinic cholinergic receptor that mediates brain dopamine release and is believed to be the primary mediator of nicotine addiction. As a partial agonist, varenicline activates the nicotine receptor, producing about 50% of the maximal effects at this receptor and thereby reducing the intensity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms, while binding tightly to the nicotine receptor prevents receptor binding by nicotine from cigarette smoke and reduces the rewarding effects of smoking. Varenicline is proven to be more effective in promoting smoking cessation than single NRT or bupropion in several clinical trials; the largest was the EAGLES randomized controlled trial, which included over 8,000 smokers and compared varenicline, bupropion, nicotine patch, and placebo given for 12 weeks along with brief counseling.

### Does cigarette reduction while using nicotine replacement therapy prior to a quit attempt predict abstinence following quit date? [^d76779e3]. Addiction (2016). Low credibility.

In both groups participants were provided with weekly behavioural support from 2 weeks prior to quit day to 4 weeks after quit day and then again at 8 weeks. In the 2 weeks prior to quit day, the reduction group discussed reduction strategies and progress made, and we addressed barriers to reduction. In the abrupt arm participants were prepared for quitting by asking them to think about scenarios that they may find difficult after the quit day and thinking of potential ways to deal with these if they should arise. After quit day, the treatment in both arms was identical. Participants used combination NRT (i.e. 21‐mg nicotine patches and an acute form of NRT) with weekly behavioural support focused on dealing with cravings and withdrawal and preventing relapse.

We exploited this design in an observational analysis to examine our competing hypotheses. First, we examined overall whether degree of reduction while smoking and using NRT was associated with future cessation. Secondly, we used the difference in instructions by trial arm to examine the degree to which intentional reduction was associated with cessation success. In the abrupt arm, the instruction was ‘try to smoke as normal’ but, as anticipated, not everyone could smoke the same number of cigarettes while using NRT. People who reduced despite advice to smoke the same number were probably doing so because they felt impelled to do so by the medication effect. In the other (reduction) arm, the instruction was to try to reduce smoking, and therefore the degree of reduction in this arm probably represents the ability to achieve intentional control over smoking. This difference in instruction differentiates between competing hypotheses in the way that the ad‐libitum smoking instruction in previous studies has not.

Participants

Twenty‐three nurses recruited people who smoked in 31 primary care practices in the West Midlands of England. Randomization was stratified by nurse and each nurse randomized between 6 and 120 participants. General practitioners (GPs) wrote to their patients who smoked asking them if they would like to quit smoking and, if so, to contact the trial team. Trial clinics took place in participants’ GP practices. Participants were eligible if they met the following criteria: smoking at least 15 cigarettes per day (CPD); willing to stop smoking completely in 2 weeks; not currently undergoing any other treatment to stop smoking; and no medical reasons that would mean concurrent smoking and use of NRT was inadvisable. Almost all people with medical, psychiatric and comorbid substance use problems were enrolled.

Fast‐acting NRT versus patch

See Table 5. None of the studies that compared a form of fast‐acting NRT to nicotine patch found an effect on smoking cessation, whether subgrouped according to type of fast‐acting NRT or combined (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05; I 2 = 0%; 8 studies, 3319 participants). There was no evidence of a difference in effects between subgroups (P = 0.57; I 2 = 0%; effects for individual subgroups can be found in Analysis 6.1). The overall effect was not sensitive to the removal of studies judged to be at a high risk of bias or the removal of the Moolchan 2005 study, which focused on adolescents, who may respond differently to NRT treatment. The latter sensitivity analysis was conducted post hoc.

### Electronic cigarettes in north America: history, use, and implications for smoking cessation [^513a3791]. Circulation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Designed to mimic the look and feel of tobacco cigarettes, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) may facilitate smoking cessation. However, the efficacy and safety of e-cigarette use for this purpose remain poorly understood. Our objectives were to review the available data on the efficacy and safety of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation and to consider issues relevant to the context in which they are used, including product awareness and regulatory and ethical concerns.

Methods and Results

We systematically searched PubMed for randomized controlled trials and uncontrolled, experimental studies involving e-cigarettes. Included studies were limited to English or French language reports. Quality assessment was performed according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. We identified 169 publications, of which 7 studies were included. Studies have concluded that e-cigarettes can help reduce the number of cigarettes smoked and may be as effective for smoking cessation as the nicotine patch. Although there is a lack of data concerning the safety and efficacy of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation therapy, available evidence showed no significant difference in adverse event rates between e-cigarettes and the nicotine patch. E-cigarettes are widely used among smokers attempting to quit. However, significant international variation remains in the regulatory mechanisms governing the sale and distribution of e-cigarettes. Ethical concerns surround the use of e-cigarettes among minors and their potential to undermine efforts to reduce cigarette smoking.

Conclusion

Given the limited available evidence on the risks and benefits of e-cigarette use, large, randomized, controlled trials are urgently needed to definitively establish their potential for smoking cessation.

### Flexible, dual-form nicotine replacement therapy or varenicline in comparison with nicotine patch for smoking cessation: a randomized controlled trial [^5136883e]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Table 1 
Baseline demographic information

M, mean; SD, standard deviation; NRT, standard dose, nicotine replacement therapy; NRT+, flexible, dual-form nicotine replacement therapy; VR, varenicline

a Motivation and confidence to quit were reported on 10-point scales where 0 = not at all confident/motivated to and 10 = completely confident. Please note that this table is an adapted version of a previously published table

Intervention

The median medication dose at week 5 was 21 mg, 21 mg, and 1 mg for NRT, NRT+, and VR, respectively. At week 10, reductions were noted for the NRT group (Mdn, 7 mg), but remained the same for the NRT+ and VR groups. The maximum average daily dosage of nicotine patches used by NRT+ participants was 24.4 mg daily (SD, 6.7 mg; range, 14–35 mg). Most participants (80.4 %) in the NRT+ group chose to use inhalers over gum. Adherence rates were similar across groups (P = 0.08): 84.3 % (n = 194), 79.7 % (n = 198), and 78.9 % (n = 200), respectively.

### Effects on abstinence of nicotine patch treatment before quitting smoking: parallel, two arm, pragmatic randomised trial [^0644096a]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Results

Between 13 August 2012 and 10 March 2015, 3837 people were telephoned about enrolment. In total, 490 (12.8%) were ineligible, most commonly owing to skin problems or unwillingness to use preloading patches. Of 1805 (47.0%) patients seen at the initial appointment, 1792 (99.3%) were eligible and enrolled (fig 1).

Fig 1 
CONSORT flow diagram. 893 control participants and 899 intervention participants were analysed for all primary and secondary outcomes, and those whose true status was unknown were counted as smokers

One week after baseline we followed-up 1702 (95.0%) participants, and five weeks after baseline, one week after quit day, we obtained data from 1456 (81.3%) participants. These assessments provided data on adverse events.

We obtained abstinence data on 1585 (88.5%) participants at four weeks, 1461 (81.5%) at six months, and 1389 (77.5%) at 12 months. A similar proportion was successfully followed in each arm. Although 331 (18.5%) participants were not available for the primary outcome assessment at six months, we knew that 97 were smoking at four weeks and that 54 never made a quit attempt; thus neither group could be classified as abstinent at six months. We were therefore certain of the primary outcome in 1612 (90.0%) participants.

### Pharmacological and electronic cigarette interventions for smoking cessation in adults: component network meta-analyses [^dbd185ce]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

How the intervention might work

NRT is a medication formulated for absorption through the oral mucosa (chewing gum, lozenges, sublingual tablets, inhaler/inhalator, mouth spray, strips), nasal mucosa (spray), or skin (transdermal patches) (Hartmann‐Boyce 2018). Nicotine transdermal patches are worn on the body and deliver a nicotine dose slowly and passively through the skin. Other types of NRT (e.g. gum or lozenge), deliver nicotine faster (described collectively here as fast‐acting NRT).

Nicotine is one of the vehicles of tobacco addiction and neuroadaptations in response to repeated inhalation, which means that when a person stops smoking tobacco, they experience withdrawal symptoms (including urges to smoke and aversive mood and physical symptoms). The aim of NRT is to replace the nicotine that the person smoking would have been receiving, ameliorating withdrawal. Inability to tolerate withdrawal accounts for most cases of early relapse to smoking. After some weeks, the urges to smoke abate, and nicotine can be stopped without precipitating withdrawal symptoms in most people. NRT is available worldwide and the World Health Organization (WHO) deems it an essential medicine; i.e. a medicine that satisfies a priority health need and that people should have access to in sufficient amounts at all times (WHO 2021b).

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^69b986c7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Similarly, LeBlanc 2017 compared 10 weeks of combination patch plus fast‐acting NRT (nicotine inhaler) to 10 weeks of patch treatment alone. Patches used in the combination arm were also titrated based on smoking history, while patches used alone were of standard dose (definition of standard dose not specified), thus potentially confounding the effect. At 52‐week follow‐up, this study reported a difference in quit rates of 5.4% in biochemically‐confirmed abstinence rates between groups, with imprecise CIs (OR 1.51, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.02; 303 participants).

Finally, Berlin 2011 compared (1) providing a nicotine dose aimed at substituting 100% (± 5%) of participants' nicotine, prescribed based on the previous week's saliva cotinine concentrations and delivered in the form of a patch, with gum or lozenge (as needed) to (2) standard care, in which nicotine patches were delivered by fixed monthly dose decreases (mixed based on dependence) with gum or lozenge (as needed). At six months' follow‐up, the study found no clear evidence of a difference between study groups for outcomes of smoking cessation (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.57; 1 study, 310 participants; Analysis 13.1), chest pain (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.20; 1 study, 310 participants; Analysis 13.4), palpitations (RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.49 to 12.69; 1 study, 310 participants; Analysis 13.5) or SAEs (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.73; 1 study, 310 participants; Analysis 13.6).

### Initiating pharmacologic treatment in tobacco-dependent adults. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^8542b557]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline—initiating pharmacologic treatment in tobacco-dependent adults—formulated five strong recommendations and two conditional recommendations regarding pharmacotherapy choices. Strong recommendations include using varenicline rather than a nicotine patch, using varenicline rather than bupropion, using varenicline rather than a nicotine patch in adults with a comorbid psychiatric condition, initiating varenicline in adults even if they are unready to quit, and using controller therapy for an extended treatment duration greater than 12 weeks. Conditional recommendations include combining a nicotine patch with varenicline rather than using varenicline alone and using varenicline rather than electronic cigarettes. Seven recommendations are provided, which represent simple practice changes that are likely to increase the effectiveness of tobacco-dependence pharmacotherapy. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach was used to rate the certainty in the estimated effects and the strength of recommendations.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^3c129d56]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Dose

See Table 3. We treated three groups of studies that compared different patch doses as separate groups for our first comparison: group 1: 42/44 mg versus 21/22 mg patches; group 2: 25 mg versus 15 mg patches; group 3: 21 mg versus 14 mg patches. Although the doses included in groups 2 and 3 appear comparable, the patches used in these groups did not have comparable delivery systems, meaning the doses delivered to participants per hour were likely to be different across the two groups. The three studies comparing the 25 mg dose to the 15 mg dose all used patches that delivered nicotine over a 16‐hour period (to be worn during waking hours) (CEASE 1999 ; Killen 1999 ; Paoletti 1996), so the doses delivered per hour were approximately 1.6 mg and 0.9 mg. However, in TNSG 1991, which compared a 21 mg dose with a 14 mg dose, the patches used delivered nicotine over 24 hours (to be worn continuously, including overnight), resulting in doses of approximately 0.9 mg and 0.6 mg per hour. The five studies comparing 42/44 mg doses with 21/22 mg doses all used patches that delivered nicotine over 24 hours (Dale 1995 ; Hughes 1999 ; Jorenby 1995 ; Kalman 2006 ; Rose 2010), so the approximate doses delivered per hour were 1.8 mg and 0.9 mg, respectively.

### Effects of interventions to combat tobacco addiction: cochrane update of 2019 and 2020 reviews [^4b02bb8b]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Aims

To summarize evidence on tobacco addiction interventions published by the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group (CTAG) from 2019 to 2020.

Methods

Narrative summary of all new and updated Cochrane Reviews published by CTAG in 2019 and 2020, outlining key results and promising avenues for future research.

Results

CTAG published six new reviews and updated 15 reviews. There is high-certainty evidence that combining fast-acting nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) with transdermal patches helped more people to quit than single-form NRT [risk ratio (RR)=1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.15-1.36, 14 studies, n=11356; I 2 =4%] and moderate-certainty evidence that using NRT before quitting can increase quit rates more than using NRT from quit day onwards (RR=1.25, 95% CI=1.08-1.44, nine studies, n=4395; I 2 =0%). Reducing smoking in order to quit completely results in similar quit rates to abrupt quitting (RR=1.01, 95% CI=0.87-1.17; I 2 =29%; 22 studies, n=9219; moderate-certainty). Electronic cigarettes may help more people quit than NRT (RR=1.53, 95% CI=1.21-1.93; I 2 =0%; four studies, n=1924; moderate certainty), nicotine-free electronic cigarettes (RR=1.94, 95% CI=1.21-3.13; I 2 =0%; five studies, n=1447; moderate-certainty) and behavioural/no support (RR=2.61, 95% CI=1.44-4.74; I 2 =0%; six studies, n=2886; very low-certainty). Varenicline may help prevent relapse in abstainers (RR=1.23, 95% CI=1.08-1.41; I 2 =82%; 11 studies, n=1297; moderate-certainty), but behavioural support did not prevent relapse (RR=0.98, 95% CI=0.87-1.11; I 2 =52%; 11 studies, n=5523; moderate-certainty). Financial incentives increased quit rates in the general population (RR=1.49, 95% CI=1.28-1.73; I 2 =33%; 30 studies, adjusted n=20097; high-certainty) and during pregnancy (RR=2.38, 95% CI=1.54-3.69; I 2 =41%; nine studies, n=2273; moderate-certainty). This overview also provides detail on a wider range of interventions.

Conclusions

There is high certainty that using nicotine replacement therapy from quit day increases smoking abstinence and no further research is required. Evidence is less certain that nicotine replacement increases abstinence when used in higher doses tailored to particular groups of smokers or use prior to quit day, and further research would be helpful. There is moderate-certainty evidence to support the use of e-cigarettes as cessation aids, but research on their role in preventing relapse would be particularly helpful.

### E-cigarettes best other cessation tools [^d7e0bf8e]. Cancer Discovery (2019). Medium credibility.

Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) may be an effective tool for smoking cessation. In a randomized trial, researchers found that 18% of those assigned to use e-cigarettes were smoke-free after a year, compared with 9.9% of those assigned to nicotine replacement therapies such as patches and gum. However, those in the e-cigarette group were more likely to continue using the products, maintaining their addiction to nicotine.

### Initiating pharmacologic treatment in tobacco-dependent adults. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^d67b34a8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary of Recommendations

1 For tobacco-dependent adults in whom treatment is being initiated, we recommend varenicline over a nicotine patch (strong recommendation, moderate certainty in the estimated effects). Remarks: To promote adherence to pharmacologic therapy, providers should be prepared to counsel patients about the relative safety and efficacy of varenicline treatment compared with a nicotine patch.
2 For tobacco-dependent adults in whom treatment is being initiated, we recommend varenicline over bupropion (strong recommendation, moderate certainty in the estimated effects).
3 For tobacco-dependent adults in whom treatment is being initiated, we suggest varenicline plus a nicotine patch over varenicline alone (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the estimated effects).
4 For tobacco-dependent adults in whom treatment is being initiated, we suggest varenicline over electronic cigarettes (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the estimated effects). Remarks: The recommendation’s strength reflects very low certainty in the effects used to derive the recommendation. After our evidence synthesis, new evidence emerged regarding serious adverse effects of electronic cigarettes. If these serious adverse effects continue to be reported, the strength of the recommendation should be reevaluated. Note that this recommendation is intended for treatment of tobacco dependence under the supervision of a clinician; it should not be extrapolated to unsupervised treatment or recreational use.
5 In tobacco-dependent adults who are not ready to discontinue tobacco use, we recommend that clinicians begin treatment with varenicline rather than waiting until patients are ready to stop tobacco use (strong recommendation, moderate certainty in the estimated effects).
6 For tobacco-dependent adults with comorbid psychiatric conditions, including substance-use disorder, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and/or bipolar disorder, for whom treatment is being initiated, we recommend varenicline over a nicotine patch (strong recommendation, moderate certainty in the estimated effects).
7 For tobacco-dependent adults for whom treatment is being initiated with a controller, we recommend using extended-duration (>12 wk) over standard-duration (6–12 wk) therapy (strong recommendation, moderate certainty in the estimated effects).

### Pharmacotherapy for nicotine dependence [^d21ff5e4]. CA (2005). Low credibility.

Approximately 50% of long-term cigarette smokers die prematurely from the adverse effects of smoking, including on cancer, cardiovascular disease, lung disease, or other illness. This risk can be substantially reduced by smoking cessation, with greater benefits occurring the earlier in the smoking career that cessation occurs. However, cessation provides benefits at any stage, including after the onset of smoking-related disease, by improving the prognosis and quality of life. Clinicians can have a significant impact on reducing tobacco use by their patients by following the US Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guidelines. Proven strategies include structured methods of advising cigarette smokers to quit and guidance to facilitate their efforts, as well as the use of various pharmacotherapies. Pharmacotherapies for tobacco dependence include nicotine replacement medications in the form of gum, transdermal patch, lozenge, sublingual tablet, nasal spray, and vapor inhaler formulations. The only nonnicotine medication that has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration is bupropion. Combination therapies, long-term medication therapies, and harm reduction strategies may further improve outcome with approved medications. Further, new medications such as varenicline and rimonabant are likely to reach tobacco users who are refractory to current treatments. Increasing the treatment options, increasing availability, and reducing the perceived cost of these medications may have an additional public health impact.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^a3ed5152]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

We split the following comparisons into subgroups, to investigate whether variations between intervention characteristics resulted in varied effects.

Patch dose: studies split according to the dosage administered; namely, 42/44 mg versus 21/22 mg and 21/25 mg versus 14/15 mg.
Duration of patch therapy: studies split according to duration of treatment. This ranged from two weeks to 52 weeks.
Combination versus single‐form therapy: studies split by type of combination NRT used (e.g. patch plus gum, patch plus nasal spray, etc.) and type of single NRT used (e.g. patch alone, fast‐acting NRT alone, choice of single‐form NRT, etc.).
Duration of combination therapy: studies split according to duration of treatment. This ranged from two weeks to 16 weeks.
Fast‐acting NRT versus patch: studies split by type of fast‐acting NRT used.
Type of fast‐acting NRT: studies split by type of fast‐acting NRT used in either comparison group.
4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum: participants split into high‐ versus low‐dependency smokers, as defined by study authors.
Fixed versus ad lib dosing schedule: studies split by the type of NRT used; namely, gum or nasal spray.
NRT preloading versus standard post‐quit use: studies split by the type of NRT used (e.g. patch, gum, patch and gum).
Free versus purchased NRT: studies split by the type of NRT used; namely, patch or gum.
Duration of free NRT: studies split by length of period free NRT provided. This ranged from one week to eight weeks.

Sensitivity analysis

We carried out the following sensitivity analyses.

We tested the impact of removing any study judged at high risk of bias for any domain on the relevant meta‐analyses.
In Walker 2011, a very low proportion of participants who claimed to have quit completed verification (34%). We extracted actual verified rates and used these in our main analysis. We conducted a sensitivity analysis comparing these figures to data extrapolated from these proportions to the wider trial population and non‐verified rates.
We tested, post hoc, the impact of removing studies focussed on specific populations that may be considered vulnerable (e.g. adolescents, people with alcohol use disorder, people with psychiatric disorders).

### Adaptive smoking cessation using precessation varenicline or nicotine patch: a randomized clinical trial [^f384bce4]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Adaptive treatment, ie, assessing the patient’s response to an initial medication and then modifying the medication regimen based on the patient’s response, is a common medical practice. However, this approach has not been widely adopted for smoking cessation. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved specific protocols for smoking cessation medications in which medications are started on the quit-smoking day (nicotine patch, gum, lozenge inhaler nasal spray) or 1 week before the quit-smoking day (bupropion, varenicline).Research has demonstrated acceptable safety and efficacy of starting medications 4 weeks before the quit smoking day for varenicline,,, bupropion,and nicotine patches, and opened the door to the exploration of precessation adaptive treatment. It may be helpful to conceptualize precessation adaptive smoking cessation pharmacotherapy as having 3 components: extended precessation pharmacotherapy, assessment of response to precessation pharmacotherapy, and adaptation of medication regimens for nonresponders.

Regarding extended precessation pharmacotherapy, trials have now shown that 4, 6, and 12 weeks of precessation varenicline all show higher smoking abstinence rates than 1 week of precessation varenicline. The efficacy of precessation nicotine patches is less certain, with the most recent meta-analysis (8 trials, 2813 participants) showing no significant association of precessation nicotine patch use with smoking abstinence (RR, 1.16, 95% CI: 0.97-1.38).

Regarding assessment of response to precessation pharmacotherapy, studies have shown that precessation smoking reduction was associated with postcessation smoking abstinence when smokers used precessation varenicline or nicotine patches. A study on precessation nicotine patches found that responders (ie, those who showed ≥50% precessation carbon monoxide reduction) showed a 2-fold higher smoking abstinence rate than nonresponders.A study on precessation varenicline found that responders showed a 2.95-fold higher smoking abstinence rate than non-responders.

Regarding adapting of medication regimens for nonresponders, a 2013 studyfound that precessation nicotine patch nonresponders could be rescued by adding bupropion 150 mg twice daily, resulting in significantly higher 6-month smoking abstinence compared with participants who continued using nicotine patch alone. To our knowledge, there have been no studies assessing adaptive treatment in clinical populations with minimal exclusion criteria, nor studies assessing adaptive treatment for smokers using precessation varenicline.

### Effect of combination treatment with varenicline and nicotine patch on smoking cessation among smokers who drink heavily: a randomized clinical trial [^5712cff6]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the combination of varenicline tartrate and nicotine patch a more effective treatment than placebo with nicotine patch for smoking cessation in adult cigarette smokers who drink heavily?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial of 122 smokers who drink heavily, combination treatment with varenicline and nicotine patch significantly improved continuous cigarette abstinence during the final 4 weeks of treatment relative to placebo and nicotine patch.

Meaning

This study found that combined treatment with varenicline and nicotine patch improved smoking cessation outcomes among smokers who drink heavily, a population who have historically experienced worse outcomes with standard approved treatments for tobacco cessation.

### Pharmacological and electronic cigarette interventions for smoking cessation in adults: component network meta-analyses [^102f582d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Potential biases in the review process

This review was carried out according to Cochrane methods, which are rigorous and considered best practice. However, it is impossible to eradicate the possibility of all potential biases. For example, there may have been differences in the ways review authors assessed risk of bias across the studies eligible in previous reviews. The Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group have made an attempt to minimise this by generating guidelines for assessing risk of bias in RCTs of smoking cessation interventions that is shared with authors of our reviews (Hartmann‐Boyce 2023).

Additionally, some of the authors of this review are authors of included studies; they were not involved in screening, data extraction or risk of bias assessments for their own studies to attempt to mitigate any impact of this.

As highlighted in our previous cNMA (Hartmann‐Boyce 2021b), the cNMA methods used here remain relatively new. We are not aware of any established or agreed way to judge certainty, present summary of findings tables or evaluate publication bias within cNMA. We therefore consulted with the methodological experts within Cochrane and made informed decisions about our approach to each of these areas; other methods may emerge over time. In addition, when estimating the effect of combination NRT, we did so by looking at the additive effect of nicotine patch alone and a fast‐acting form of NRT. We did not assume an interaction and so the prediction is purely the sum of the individual component effects (on a log scale). It is possible that the effect of one component could be lowered by the presence of another effective component. We have not tested the potential effects of delivering more than one pharmacotherapy for other combinations of treatment but hope to pursue this in a separate publication.

### Relationship between adherence to daily nicotine patch use and treatment efficacy: secondary analysis of a 10-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial simulating over-the-counter use in adult smokers [^4cf3dae1]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

It has been reported that the efficacy of acute forms of nicotine replacement therapy, such as nicotine gum and lozenges, improves when sufficient quantities of medication are used.

Objective

This analysis examined whether adherence with daily nicotine patch wear was associated with improved rates of smoking abstinence.

Methods

This was a secondary analysis of data from a double-blind study in which subjects were randomized to receive either an active nicotine patch or a placebo patch under simulated over-the-counter conditions. Subjects were asked to complete a daily diary on their patch use and smoking. Logistic regression, controlling for smoking in the first 3 weeks of treatment, was used to evaluate the likelihood of abstinence at 6 weeks as a function of treatment assignment (active vs placebo) and adherence (ie, patch wear for >or=20 of the first 21 days of treatment). The relationship between reported adverse events and adherence was also examined.

Results

This analysis involved data from 371 subjects, 204 using the active patch and 167 using the placebo patch. The study population was mainly white (87.3%), had a mean age of 42.8 years, a mean weight of 77.3 kg, had been smoking for a mean of 24.4 years, and smoked a mean of 25.2 cigarettes per day. Two hundred fifty-three subjects were classified as adherent. Rates of adherence did not differ significantly between the active and placebo groups (139 [68.1%] and 114 [68.3%], respectively). The likelihood of experiencing an adverse event did not differ significantly between adherent and nonadherent subjects in either group. Among active patch users, 61.5% of nonadherent subjects experienced an adverse event, compared with 59.7% of adherent subjects; among placebo patch users, the corresponding proportions were 41.5% and 43.9%. Among active patch users, the odds of abstinence at 6 weeks were more than 3 times greater for adherent versus nonadherent subjects (53.2% vs 21.5%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 3.25; 95% CI, 1.30-8.09; P = 0.011); no benefit of adherence over nonadherence was seen among users of the placebo patch (16.7% vs 15.1%; adjusted OR = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.16-2.31). The interaction between treatment group and adherence was statistically significant (P = 0.022).

Conclusion

Under conditions simulating over-the-counter use, adherence to daily nicotine patch wear within the first 3 weeks of treatment was associated with an improved likelihood of achieving smoking abstinence at 6 weeks.

### Efficacy of varenicline combined with nicotine replacement therapy vs varenicline alone for smoking cessation: a randomized clinical trial [^b7109380]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Behavioral approaches and pharmacotherapy are of proven benefit in assisting smokers to quit, but it is unclear whether combining nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) with varenicline to improve abstinence is effective and safe.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of combining varenicline and a nicotine patch vs varenicline alone in smoking cessation.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial with a 12-week treatment period and a further 12-week follow-up conducted in 7 centers in South Africa from April 2011 to October 2012. Four hundred forty-six generally healthy smokers were randomized (1:1); 435 were included in the efficacy and safety analyses.

Interventions

Nicotine or placebo patch treatment began 2 weeks before a target quit date (TQD) and continued for a further 12 weeks. Varenicline was begun 1 week prior to TQD, continued for a further 12 weeks, and tapered off during week 13.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Tobacco abstinence was established and confirmed by exhaled carbon monoxide measurements at TQD and at intervals thereafter up to 24 weeks. The primary end point was the 4-week exhaled carbon monoxide-confirmed continuous abstinence rate for weeks 9 through 12 of treatment, ie, the proportion of participants able to maintain complete abstinence from smoking for the last 4 weeks of treatment, as assessed using multiple imputation analysis. Secondary end points included point prevalence abstinence at 6 months, continuous abstinence rate from weeks 9 through 24, and adverse events. Multiple imputation also was used to address loss to follow-up.

Results

The combination treatment was associated with a higher continuous abstinence rate at 12 weeks (55.4% vs 40.9%; odds ratio [OR], 1.85; 95% CI, 1.19-2.89; P=.007) and 24 weeks (49.0% vs 32.6%; OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.25-3.14; P=.004) and point prevalence abstinence rate at 6 months (65.1% vs 46.7%; OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.32-3.43; P=.002). In the combination treatment group, there was a numerically greater incidence of nausea, sleep disturbance, skin reactions, constipation, and depression, with only skin reactions reaching statistical significance (14.4% vs 7.8%; P=.03); the varenicline-alone group experienced more abnormal dreams and headaches.

Conclusions and Relevance

Varenicline in combination with NRT was more effective than varenicline alone at achieving tobacco abstinence at 12 weeks (end of treatment) and at 6 months. Further studies are needed to assess long-term efficacy and safety.

Adolescent tobacco use and treatment—because a significant portion of adolescents currently uses tobacco, both prevention and cessation are public health priorities. In adolescents, bupropion and nicotine replacement therapies—including nicotine patches, gum, and nasal spray—have been studied to a limited extent; trials suggest long-term quitting is difficult, but significant reductions in tobacco consumption have been observed with pharmacotherapy alongside counseling and behavioral interventions. In this population, pharmacotherapy should be considered for adolescent patients, individualized to account for smoking patterns and preferences.
