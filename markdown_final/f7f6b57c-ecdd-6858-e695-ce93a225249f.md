## Question

What does a hemoglobin of 6.6, hematocrit of 20, and mean corpuscular volume of 90 indicate?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a hemoglobin of 6.6 g/dL, hematocrit of 20%, and MCV of 90 fL indicate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and severity of anemia. Then, I should classify the anemia by MCV and consider what that implies for the differential. Next, I will review red flags that mandate urgent action, including transfusion thresholds. After that, I need to outline a prioritized diagnostic workup tailored to normocytic anemia. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a concise clinical interpretation with next steps, making sure I verify each claim against guidelines and key studies as I go.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity. A hemoglobin of 6.6 g/dL is far below adult reference ranges and meets criteria for severe anemia by WHO thresholds, which define anemia as less than 13.0 g/dL in men and less than 12.0 g/dL in women, with severity commonly stratified as moderate when 8.0–10.9 g/dL and severe when less than 8.0 g/dL, so 6.6 g/dL is unequivocally severe and warrants prompt evaluation and stabilization [^6998c52a] [^c261dc6c]. I should double-check that the hematocrit aligns with this severity; a hematocrit around 20% is consistent with profound anemia and supports the hemoglobin value, though I need to remember that hematocrit is a calculated parameter and can be influenced by volume status, so I should interpret it alongside clinical context and, if needed, repeat testing to confirm true anemia before committing to invasive workups [^c329f032] [^fc3a58d4].

> Next, I should review the MCV classification. An MCV of 90 fL sits at the upper end of normal, so this is a normocytic anemia by standard adult reference intervals, which typically span roughly 80–100 fL, although instrument and population specifics can shift the range modestly. Wait, let me verify that I'm not overgeneralizing; yes, most adult labs cite 80–100 fL, and 90 fL falls squarely within normocytic territory, which directs the differential away from isolated iron deficiency or thalassemia and toward mixed or non-microcytic etiologies [^bfa5fd37] [^30d47e7e]. Hold on, I should also note that MCV-guided classification can mislead if used in isolation; a substantial fraction of patients do not fit the expected MCV–etiology pattern, so I need to ensure I do not anchor prematurely on MCV alone [^30d47e7e].

> I will now examine the differential for normocytic anemia. The major categories include acute blood loss, hemolysis, anemia of chronic disease or inflammation, bone marrow failure or suppression, and mixed or early nutritional deficiencies. Let me think about the first branch point: reticulocyte count will separate increased destruction or loss from decreased production, so I should obtain a reticulocyte count and, if elevated, pursue hemolysis labs and sources of bleeding, whereas if low, I should evaluate for chronic disease, marrow failure, or mixed etiologies [^fc3019e4] [^f4ad26bf]. I should confirm that I'm not missing mixed deficiency; early iron deficiency can be normocytic before microcytosis emerges, and combined deficiencies can normalize MCV, so iron studies remain essential even with a normal MCV when clinical suspicion is high [^notfound].

> Now, I need to check for red flags that mandate urgent action. With hemoglobin around 6.6 g/dL, I should assess hemodynamic stability, active bleeding, and ischemic symptoms immediately. In stable, nonbleeding adults, restrictive transfusion thresholds of 7 g/dL are supported by high-quality evidence, while 7.5–8 g/dL may be reasonable in select subgroups such as cardiac surgery or those with cardiovascular disease; in unstable patients or those with active bleeding, transfusion should not be delayed while awaiting further tests [^1225f45d] [^c2d027ca]. But wait, what if the patient is elderly or has comorbid cardiopulmonary disease? Observational and guideline data in older adults suggest that symptomatic patients with hemoglobin 8 g/dL or less may benefit from transfusion, so I should individualize based on symptoms, comorbidities, and ongoing blood loss rather than a single number [^761ab40c] [^f4ad26bf].

> Next, I should review the initial diagnostic workup. I need a reticulocyte count to assess marrow response, a peripheral smear to look for dysplasia, schistocytes, or blasts, iron studies including ferritin and transferrin saturation to evaluate iron deficiency and functional iron restriction, and vitamin B12 and folate to exclude nutritional causes of normocytic or macrocytic anemia. I should also add a direct antiglobulin test and haptoglobin, LDH, and bilirubin if hemolysis is suspected, and consider TSH and renal function given their prevalence and impact on anemia [^f4ad26bf] [^fc3019e4]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not omitting occult blood loss; in men and postmenopausal women with iron deficiency, gastrointestinal evaluation for malignancy is indicated, and in premenopausal women, gynecologic sources should be considered, so I need to tailor the bleeding evaluation to the patient profile [^f4ad26bf].

> Let me consider special populations and modifiers. In older adults, anemia is common and often multifactorial, with chronic kidney disease, inflammation, and occult gastrointestinal bleeding prominent. I should confirm renal function and consider erythropoietin deficiency, and I should remember that age-specific reference intervals for hemoglobin decline with age, which can influence how "severe" a given value appears relative to peers [^6a309496] [^f4ad26bf]. In patients with CKD, I need to check iron indices and consider reticulocyte hemoglobin or percent hypochromic cells to assess iron availability, and I should time hemoglobin measurements around dialysis to avoid volume-related distortion. Pre-dialysis samples underestimate euvolemic hemoglobin, whereas post-dialysis samples overestimate it, so mid-week pre-dialysis values are preferred for monitoring [^43f799cd] [^2169415e]. In pregnancy, physiologic hemodilution lowers hemoglobin thresholds, and iron deficiency is extremely common, so I should apply pregnancy-specific cutoffs and prioritize iron repletion when indicated [^e18df9ac].

> I should double-check for iatrogenic or contextual contributors. Recent phlebotomy can acutely lower hemoglobin and hematocrit; in hospitalized patients, each 100 mL of blood drawn associates with roughly a 7 g/L hemoglobin drop, so I need to account for diagnostic blood loss when interpreting trends and deciding on transfusion thresholds or invasive workups [^bd021b3d]. Medications can also contribute; for example, metformin can reduce B12 absorption and rarely cause anemia, and thiazolidinediones can cause dose-related decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit, so I should review the medication list carefully before attributing causality [^f814d794].

> Let me synthesize the clinical interpretation. These findings indicate severe, normocytic anemia with hemoglobin 6.6 g/dL and hematocrit 20%, which is life-threatening if symptomatic or unstable and requires immediate assessment of bleeding, hemodynamics, and tissue hypoperfusion, with transfusion considered per restrictive strategies and clinical judgment. The normal MCV does not exclude iron deficiency, anemia of chronic disease, hemolysis, or marrow failure, so I should not anchor on morphology alone and must pursue a structured evaluation including reticulocyte count, iron studies, hemolysis labs, and targeted evaluation for blood loss or marrow disorders [^1225f45d] [^f4ad26bf]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the hemoglobin on a repeat CBC if the clinical picture is discordant, because a single value can be spurious or confounded by volume status, and confirmation helps avoid unnecessary interventions [^fc3a58d4].

> Finally, I need to ensure the next steps are explicit. Stabilize the patient first with fluids and transfusion as indicated by symptoms and comorbidities, then proceed with reticulocyte count, iron studies, vitamin B12 and folate, renal and liver function, and a peripheral smear. If iron deficiency is confirmed, evaluate for occult blood loss. If hemolysis is suspected, send haptoglobin, LDH, indirect bilirubin, and DAT. If production is inadequate, consider anemia of chronic disease, endocrine causes, or marrow failure and escalate to bone marrow evaluation as indicated. Throughout, I should reassess hemoglobin trends, bleeding, and response to therapy to refine the diagnosis and management plan [^f4ad26bf] [^fc3019e4].

A hemoglobin of 6.6 g/dL, hematocrit of 20%, and MCV of 90 fL indicate **severe normocytic anemia** [^c261dc6c] — most likely due to acute blood loss, chronic disease/inflammation, or bone marrow suppression — and require **urgent evaluation** to identify the cause and guide therapy [^f4ad26bf]. The normal MCV rules out isolated iron deficiency or thalassemia, so the next steps are to check reticulocytes, iron studies, B12/folate, renal/hepatic function, and consider hemolysis or marrow disorders; transfusion is indicated if symptomatic or if hemoglobin is below 7 g/dL in stable adults [^1225f45d].

---

## Clinical significance of the findings

### Hemoglobin and hematocrit

- **Severity**: Hemoglobin 6.6 g/dL and hematocrit 20% represent severe anemia (WHO: < 8 g/dL in adults) [^c261dc6c].
- **Impact**: This degree of anemia can cause fatigue, dyspnea, tachycardia, and organ ischemia, especially in older adults or those with comorbidities [^f4ad26bf].
- **Urgency**: Severe anemia warrants prompt evaluation and may require transfusion if symptomatic or if hemoglobin is < 7 g/dL in stable adults [^1225f45d].

---

### Mean corpuscular volume (MCV)

An MCV of 90 fL is **normal (80–100 fL)** [^notfound], indicating normocytic anemia. This morphology suggests causes such as acute blood loss, chronic disease/inflammation, bone marrow suppression, hemolysis, or mixed etiologies, and it excludes isolated iron deficiency or thalassemia [^bfa5fd37].

---

## Differential diagnosis of severe normocytic anemia

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Acute blood loss | - Gastrointestinal bleeding <br/> - Trauma <br/> - Surgical blood loss [^c90807d0] |
| Chronic disease/inflammation | - Chronic kidney disease <br/> - Rheumatoid arthritis <br/> - Malignancy <br/> - Chronic infections [^566de21d] |
| Bone marrow suppression | - Aplastic anemia <br/> - Myelodysplastic syndrome <br/> - Leukemia <br/> - Chemotherapy/radiation [^bf5ea6a5] |
| Hemolysis | - Autoimmune hemolytic anemia <br/> - Drug-induced hemolysis <br/> - Mechanical hemolysis (e.g. prosthetic valves) [^notfound] |
| Mixed etiologies | - Combined deficiencies (e.g. iron + B12/folate) <br/> - Chronic disease plus blood loss [^notfound] |

---

## Recommended diagnostic evaluation

- **Confirm anemia**: Repeat CBC to exclude lab error; assess symptoms, bleeding, and comorbidities [^fc3a58d4].
- **Reticulocyte count**: Elevated suggests blood loss/hemolysis; low suggests marrow suppression [^fc3019e4].
- **Iron studies**: Ferritin, transferrin saturation, TIBC to assess iron status and chronic disease [^f4ad26bf].
- **B12/folate**: Rule out nutritional deficiencies [^1713d8a2].
- **Renal/hepatic function**: Evaluate for organ failure contributing to anemia [^notfound].
- **Hemolysis labs**: LDH, haptoglobin, indirect bilirubin, Coombs test if suspected [^notfound].
- **Bone marrow evaluation**: If cytopenias, dysplasia, or suspected marrow failure [^bf5ea6a5].

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Urgency**: Severe anemia can cause cardiovascular stress, ischemia, and decompensation; monitor closely [^f4ad26bf].
- **Transfusion**: Consider if symptomatic or if hemoglobin is < 7 g/dL in stable adults; use a restrictive strategy [^1225f45d].
- **Treat underlying cause**: Address bleeding, inflammation, marrow suppression, or hemolysis [^f4ad26bf].
- **Follow-up**: Track hemoglobin recovery and adjust therapy as needed [^f4ad26bf].

A hemoglobin of 6.6 g/dL, hematocrit of 20%, and MCV of 90 fL indicate **severe normocytic anemia** requiring urgent evaluation for causes such as acute blood loss, chronic disease, or marrow suppression. The normal MCV excludes isolated iron deficiency or thalassemia, so further testing and symptom-guided transfusion are essential [^1225f45d].

### Committee opinion no. 691: carrier screening for genetic conditions [^896a7a30]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hemoglobinopathies — a complete blood count with red blood cell indices should be performed in all women who are currently pregnant to assess not only their risk of anemia but also to allow assessment for risk of a hemoglobinopathy, and ideally, this testing also should be offered to women before pregnancy. A hemoglobin electrophoresis should be performed in addition to a complete blood count if there is suspicion of hemoglobinopathy based on ethnicity (African, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, Southeast Asian, or West Indian descent). If red blood cell indices indicate a low mean corpuscular hemoglobin or mean corpuscular volume, hemoglobin electrophoresis also should be performed.

### The definition of anemia: what is the lower limit of normal of the blood hemoglobin concentration? [^126f9c5e]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of anemia is an important aspect of the practice of hematology. The first step is to decide whether the patient is, in fact, anemic. Unless earlier blood counts are available, and they often are not, the physician must make his or her decision on the basis of the population distribution of hemoglobin values. How likely is it that the patient's hemoglobin value lies below the normal distribution; that is, "the lower limit"?

### Committee opinion no. 691: carrier screening for genetic conditions [^cc2aa24b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hemoglobinopathy and thalassemia screening — pregnancy care includes that a complete blood count with red blood cell indices should be performed in all women who are currently pregnant; if indices indicate a low mean corpuscular hemoglobin or mean corpuscular volume, hemoglobin electrophoresis also should be performed, and it should also be performed when ethnicity raises suspicion, ideally before pregnancy, with repeat testing not necessary if prior results are available. Determination of mean corpuscular volume is recommended to assess risk of α-thalassemia or β-thalassemia; patients with a low mean corpuscular volume (less than 80 fL) may have one of the thalassemia traits and should have hemoglobin electrophoresis, and measurement of serum ferritin levels is recommended. β-thalassemia is associated with elevated hemoglobin F and elevated hemoglobin A2 levels (more than 3.5%). Neither hemoglobin electrophoresis nor solubility testing can identify α-thalassemia trait; if the mean corpuscular volume is below normal, iron deficiency is excluded, and electrophoresis is not consistent with β-thalassemia trait, then DNA-based testing should be used to detect α-globin gene deletions characteristic of α-thalassemia. Solubility tests are inadequate for screening and fail to identify several important traits, and if both partners are identified as carriers of a gene for abnormal hemoglobins, genetic counseling is recommended.

### Evaluation and management of anemia in the elderly [^761ab40c]. American Journal of Hematology (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia is now recognized as a risk factor for a number of adverse outcomes in the elderly, including hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality. What constitutes appropriate evaluation and management for an elderly patient with anemia, and when to initiate a referral to a hematologist, are significant issues. Attempts to identify suggested hemoglobin levels for blood transfusion therapy have been confounded for elderly patients with their co-morbidities. Since no specific recommended hemoglobin threshold has stood the test of time, prudent transfusion practices to maintain hemoglobin thresholds of 9–10 g/dL in the elderly are indicated, unless or until evidence emerges to indicate otherwise.

### Why is my patient anemic? [^7f38d88b]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Anemia is a decreased number of circulating red blood cells and is a common medical condition faced in clinical practice. Anemia is caused by loss of red blood cells, destruction of red blood cells, decreased production of red blood cells, or a combination of these processes. Through a clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation the provider must identify the process by which the patient is anemic. Often the cause of anemia is straightforward; however, the cause can be challenging, requiring a thorough knowledge of both hematology and general medicine.

### Reference intervals for hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume in an ethnically diverse community sample of Canadian children 2 to 36 months [^6074e236]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We have presented age- and sex-specific reference intervals for hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in an ethnically diverse community sample of Canadian children 2 weeks to 36 months of age. Considering that our findings showed no difference between females and males, we also provided reference intervals for the combined population, maximizing sample size, and hence increasing accuracy and precision of our estimates. This is particularly important for partitions involving younger children, for whom sample size is often very small. We considered large age categories (3 months, 6 months) as well as smaller categories (monthly) to explore the hemoglobin and MCV trajectory for young children with respect to age.

For hemoglobin, from 2 months to 36 months of age, our results show a reference interval (from lower to upper limit) of approximately 30 g/L and the 90% confidence intervals indicate that there is little difference across age groups (approximately 2 g/L each year) or according to sex. These findings raise the possibility that a single reference interval could be used for young children in this age group. For children in the age group 2 weeks to 3 months, we had an adequate sample (> 20) of children at 2 months of age to assess the reference interval and did not detect a lower hemoglobin level consistent with the physiologic nadir, as described by others. However, further studies in this very young age group with more data are needed.

### A practical approach to the evaluation of the anemic child [^cc1b531e]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Anemia is a sign of disease and not a final diagnosis. The clinician's goal is to define the underlying cause. The anemia may be due to decreased production or Increased destruction or loss of red blood cells. Integration of the results of the initial CBC. particularly the RBC indices, the peripheral blood smear, the history and the physical examination can help organize the focus of further evaluations and, ultimately, minimize the number of tests needed to make a firm diagnosis.

### Anemia in older adults [^f4ad26bf]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy, although in many patients the etiology is unknown. The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia. In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy. Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement. Lower-dose formulations may be as effective and have a lower risk of adverse effects. Normalization of hemoglobin typically occurs by eight weeks after treatment in most patients. Parenteral iron infusion is reserved for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy.

### Unresolved laboratory issues of the heterozygous state of β-thalassemia: a literature review [^53d7fc4b]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Although considered a mild clinical condition, many laboratory issues of the carrier state of β-thalassemia remain unresolved. Accurate laboratory screening of β-thalassemia traits is crucial for preventing the birth of a β-thalassemia major child. Identification of carriers in the laboratory is affected by factors that influence red cell indices and HbA2 quantification. Silent mutations and co-inheriting genetic and non-genetic factors affect red cell indices which decreases the effectiveness of the conventional approach. Similarly, the type of β mutation, co-inheriting genetic and non-genetic factors, and technical aspects, including the analytical method used and variations in the HbA2 cut-off values, affect the HbA2 results, leading to further confusion. However, the combination of mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and hemoglobin analysis increases the diagnostic accuracy. Diagnostic problems arising from non-genetic factors can be eliminated by carefully screening the patient's clinical history. However, issues due to certain genetic factors, such as Krüppel-like factor 1 gene mutations and α triplication still remain unresolved. Each laboratory should determine the population-specific reference ranges and be wary of machine-related variations of HbA2 levels, the prevalence of silent mutations in the community.

### Evaluation of microcytic anemia [^60d17a1b]. Clinical Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a reduction in red blood cell mass or hemoglobin concentration in blood. It is statistically differentiated from normal states as a hemoglobin concentration or hematocrit 2 SD below the mean for the healthy population adjusted for age and sex. Anemias may be classified based on the morphologic function of red blood cells and their size on a peripheral blood smear. Subcategories are microcytic, normocytic, and macrocytic anemias, but these are not mutually exclusive. In infants and children, the most common form of anemia is microcytic. A detailed history and physical examination with appropriate laboratory test results can help detect the correct cause of anemia in most patients. The objective of this article is to aid physicians taking care of children in conducting a proper evaluation to identify the correct cause of microcytic anemia.

### The complete blood count: a practical tool for the pediatrician [^eec1e953]. Pediatrics in Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Every child should have a baseline hematology evaluation with hemoglobin and hematocrit levels starting at age 12 months, or younger if clinically indicated. Although history and physical examination provide key information needed to diagnose blood disorders, the addition of a complete blood count (CBC) with differential count and reticulocyte count allows the clinician to narrow the differential diagnosis and tailor the subsequent evaluation. The interpretation of CBC results is a skill that requires practice. Every clinician can learn to identify possible diagnoses before consulting a specialist. This review provides a step-by-step approach for CBC interpretation with tools to help the clinician diagnose and interpret the most common blood disorders seen in the general pediatric clinic or inpatient setting.

### Evaluation of anemia in children [^fc3019e4]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Anemia is defined as a hemoglobin level of less than the 5th percentile for age. Causes vary by age. Most children with anemia are asymptomatic, and the condition is detected on screening laboratory evaluation. Screening is recommended only for high-risk children. Anemia is classified as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic, based on the mean corpuscular volume. Mild microcytic anemia may be treated presumptively with oral iron therapy in children six to 36 months of age who have risk factors for iron deficiency anemia. If the anemia is severe or is unresponsive to iron therapy, the patient should be evaluated for gastrointestinal blood loss. Other tests used in the evaluation of microcytic anemia include serum iron studies, lead levels, and hemoglobin electrophoresis. Normocytic anemia may be caused by chronic disease, hemolysis, or bone marrow disorders. Workup of normocytic anemia is based on bone marrow function as determined by the reticulocyte count. If the reticulocyte count is elevated, the patient should be evaluated for blood loss or hemolysis. A low reticulocyte count suggests aplasia or a bone marrow disorder. Common tests used in the evaluation of macrocytic anemias include vitamin B12 and folate levels, and thyroid function testing. A peripheral smear can provide additional information in patients with anemia of any morphology.

### The accuracy of mean corpuscular volume guided anaemia classification in primary care [^30d47e7e]. Family Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Anemia can be categorized into micro-, normo- or macrocytic anemia based on the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). This categorization might help to define the etiology of anemia.

Methods

The cohort consisted of patients newly diagnosed with anaemia in primary care. Seven aetiologies of anaemia were defined, based on an extensive laboratory protocol. Two assumptions were tested: (i) MCV < 80 fl (microcytic) excludes vitamin B12 deficiency, folic acid deficiency, suspected haemolysis and suspected bone marrow disease as anaemia aetiology. (ii) MCV > 100 fl (macrocytic) excludes iron deficiency anaemia, anaemia of chronic disease and renal anaemia as anaemia aetiology.

Results

Data of 4129 patients were analysed. One anaemia aetiology could be assigned to 2422 (59%) patients, more than one anaemia aetiology to 888 (22%) patients and uncertainty regarding the aetiology remained in 819 (20%) patients. MCV values were within the normal range in 3505 patients (85%). In 59 of 365 microcytic patients (16%), the anaemia aetiology was not in accordance with the first assumption. In 233 of 259 macrocytic patients (90%), the anaemia aetiology was not in accordance with the second assumption.

Conclusions

Anaemia aetiologies might be ruled out incorrectly if MCV guided classification is used as a first step in the diagnostic work-up of anaemia. We recommend using a broader set of laboratory tests, independent of MCV.

### Point-of-care versus central testing of hemoglobin during large volume blood transfusion [^c329f032]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Our initial sample population included 98 patients that had MTP activation, and an EPOC® and CBC hemoglobin drawn within 60 min of each other. From these 98 patients, a total of 218 lab comparison points were obtained. We determined a time cutoff when the mean differences between EPOC® and CBC samples are most likely due to actual differences between hemoglobin values rather than random fluctuations around a true value. Time intervals were coded into six categories: 0 (0–1 min); 1 (1–5 min); 2 (5–15 min); 3 (15–30 min); 4 (30–45 min); 5 (45–60 min). ANOVA was performed to assess mean differences between EPOC® and CBC samples over time. Results indicated mean differences were statistically significant at specific time points, F (5, 215) = 3.98, p < 0.01. A Tukey HSD post hoc analysis further specified that time intervals when mean hemoglobin differences were statistically different from samples drawn during time interval 0 (tests that were drawn at the same time) occurred between 30 and 60 min, p < 0.05 respectively. Therefore, further analysis was restricted to only those samples drawn within 30 min of each other. The final sample consisted of a total of 90 individual patients, including 49 cardiac surgery patients, 20 general/trauma surgery patients, and 19 non-surgical patients. Among these patients, 170 lab comparison points were obtained. Table 1 demonstrates the average number of blood products transfused, stratified by each patient population.

Hemoglobin measurements

The medical center core laboratory analyzed samples using a Sysmex-XE 5000™ automated hematology analyzer in which the hemoglobin was directly determined by absorbance spectrophotometry and the hematocrit was calculated as a function of mean corpuscular volume and red blood cell count. The EPOC® Blood Analysis System directly measured hematocrit using AC conductometry and the hemoglobin was calculated as a function of the measured hematocrit, assuming a normal mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCV).

### Eliminating race-based reference ranges in haematology: a call to action [^95ac23b2]. The Lancet: Haematology (2021). High credibility.

In haematology, as in all of medicine, the use of reference intervals for laboratory variables is essential to define disease states and inform treatment decisions. There are many haematological variables, including haemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, absolute neutrophil count, and iron indices, that are often reported to be different on the basis of a person's race or ethnicity. Although there are many haematological conditions with a genetic basis, such that it is appropriate to consider ancestry in the diagnostic algorithm, defining pathology on the basis of a social construct such as race is unacceptable. The inclusion of separate thresholds or simple statements that so-called normal values vary by race further validates the common misperception that there are physiological differences between Black and white patients. These statements might have downstream effects on diagnostic and treatment decisions that exacerbate existing racial health disparities. In this Viewpoint, we argued for the removal of race-based reference intervals across haematology.

### Hematologic differences between African-Americans and whites: the roles of iron deficiency and α-thalassemia on hemoglobin levels and mean corpuscular volume [^0186a6ae]. Blood (2005). Low credibility.

The average results of some laboratory measurements, including the hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), serum transferrin saturation (TS), serum ferritin, and white blood cell count of African-Americans differ from those of whites. Anonymized samples and laboratory data from 1491 African-American and 31 005 white subjects, approximately equally divided between men and women, were analyzed. The hematocrit, hemoglobin, MCV, TS, and white blood cell counts of African-Americans were lower than those of whites; serum ferritin levels were higher. When iron-deficient patients were eliminated from consideration the differences in hematocrit, hemoglobin, and MCV among women were slightly less. The -3.7-kilobase alpha-thalassemia deletion accounted for about one third of the difference in the hemoglobin levels of African-Americans and whites and neither sickle trait nor elevated creatinine levels had an effect. Among all subjects, 19.8% of African-American women would have been classified as "anemic" compared with 5.3% of whites. Among men, the figures were 17.7% and 7.6%. Without iron-deficient or thalassemic subjects, the difference had narrowed to 6.1% and 2.77% and to 4.29% and 3.6%, respectively. Physicians need to take into account that the same reference standards for hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, and TS and the white blood cell count do not apply to all ethnic groups.

### Implementing reticulocyte hemoglobin into current hematology algorithms [^48ae8d8f]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This systematic review investigates reticulocyte hemoglobin's capabilities in screening iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia with and without comorbidities.

Methods

Participant background and laboratory characteristics were extracted from 14 unique studies between 2015 and 2022. Hemoglobin, reticulocyte hemoglobin, and mean cell volume (MCV) values were used in a meta-analysis for iron-deficiency anemia with no secondary conditions. Mean laboratory values for each patient population were calculated and then used to determine sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC) for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia. The ferritin and reticulocyte hemoglobin ranges were calculated using the mean values.

Results

The meta-analysis demonstrates that hemoglobin and MCV values do not significantly differ between studies, unlike reticulocyte hemoglobin values. The reticulocyte hemoglobin range is smaller than ferritin for the controls, iron deficiency, and iron-deficiency anemia. Reticulocyte hemoglobin values less than 26 pg can distinguish iron-deficiency anemia, while 26 to 31.5 pg can distinguish iron deficiency, with an AUC of 0.889. The sensitivity and specificity are 92.3% and 100% for iron-deficiency anemia, 100% and 81.5% for iron deficiency, and 94.4% and 71.4% for both, respectively (reference range, < 31.5 pg).

Conclusions

Reticulocyte hemoglobin is potentially a quick screening test for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia.

### How useful are CBC and reticulocyte reports to clinicians? [^68d94c03]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

We surveyed 1,353 attending and 689 house staff physicians of the University Hospitals of Cleveland to ascertain the parameters of the CBC, leukocyte differential, and reticulocyte reports perceived as useful in clinical practice. The response rate was 33% for attending and 22% for house staff physicians. Only 4 of 11 parameters routinely reported in the CBC battery were selected as frequently or always useful by more than 90% of physicians: hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, and WBC count. Among primary care physicians, the mean cell volume also attained this level of usefulness for the evaluation of anemia. There were no differences between academic physicians and community physicians in the use of RBC indices; however, physicians who had been in practice for fewer than 10 years indicated higher use of the red cell distribution width than physicians practicing for more than 10 years. Most physicians prefer differentials reported as percentages rather than absolute counts. Among physicians who monitor reticulocyte counts, the immature reticulocyte fraction is not widely used. Our results indicate that many physicians do not use much of the data provided in routine CBC/differential and reticulocyte reports. Some modifications of report formats may facilitate physician perception of hematology laboratory results.

### Screening characteristics of hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume for detection of iron deficiency in pregnancy [^e18df9ac]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Of 17,057 patients with 20,550 pregnancies seen in the UCSF obstetrics clinics from 2009 to 2022, 16,547 (80.5%) had a CBC at the time of their first-trimester prenatal laboratory tests. A total of 345 (2.1%) of the 16,547 women had a coincident first-trimester ferritin test, and 1,749 (10.6%) had ferritin results in our electronic health record at any time during pregnancy. The prevalence of anemia and iron deficiency among patients with CBC or ferritin screening rose dramatically throughout gestation; 4.1% of CBCs demonstrated anemia in the first trimester and 30.9% in the third trimester (Fig. 1 A). Similarly, for patients with ferritin levels, iron deficiency rose from 23.7% in the first trimester to 74.7% in the third trimester (Fig. 1 B). Microcytosis was stable throughout pregnancy (Fig. 1 C).

### Emergency medicine evaluation and management of anemia [^c90807d0]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common condition and is diagnosed on laboratory assessment. It is defined by abnormally low hemoglobin concentration or decreased red blood cells. Several classification systems exist. Laboratory markers provide important information. Acute anemia presents with symptoms owing to acute blood loss; chronic anemia may present with worsening fatigue, dyspnea, lightheadedness, or chest pain. Specific treatments depend on the underlying anemia and etiology. Iron is an alternative treatment for patients with microcytic anemia owing to iron deficiency. Hyperbaric oxygen is an option for alternative rescue therapy. Most patients with chronic anemia may be discharged with follow-up if hemodynamically stable.

### Do blood tests cause anemia in hospitalized patients? The effect of diagnostic phlebotomy on hemoglobin and hematocrit levels [^bd021b3d]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether phlebotomy contributes to changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels in hospitalized general internal medicine patients.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

General internal medicine inpatient service at a tertiary care hospital.

Participants

All adult patients discharged from the Toronto General Hospital's internal medicine service between January 1 and June 30, 2001. A total of 989 hospitalizations were reviewed and 404 hospitalizations were included in our analysis.

Measurements and Main Results

Mean (SD) hemoglobin and hematocrit changes during hospitalization were 7.9 (12.6) g/L (P < .0001) and 2.1% (3.8%) (P < .0001), respectively. The mean (SD) volume of phlebotomy during hospital stay was 74.6 (52.1) mL. On univariate analysis, changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit were predicted by the volume of phlebotomy, length of hospital stay, admission hemoglobin/hematocrit value, age, Charlson comorbidity index, and admission intravascular volume status. The volume of phlebotomy remained a strong predictor of drop in hemoglobin and hematocrit after adjusting for other predictors using multivariate analysis (P < .0001). On average, every 100 mL of phlebotomy was associated with a decrease in hemoglobin and hematocrit of 7.0 g/L and 1.9%, respectively.

Conclusions

Phlebotomy is highly associated with changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels for patients admitted to an internal medicine service and can contribute to anemia. This anemia, in turn, may have significant consequences, especially for patients with cardiorespiratory diseases. Knowing the expected changes in hemoglobin and hematocrit due to diagnostic phlebotomy will help guide when to investigate anemia in hospitalized patients.

### Evaluation of anemia [^bfa5fd37]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem in primary care. Classification based on mean cell volume narrows the differential diagnosis and directs testing. A marked macrocytosis is characteristic of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, certain medications, and primary bone marrow disorders. The three most common causes of microcytic anemia are iron deficiency, thalassemia trait, and anemia of inflammation. Additional laboratory testing is required for diagnosis. Determination of the rate of development of anemia and examination of a blood smear may provide diagnostic clues to guide more specialized testing. Diagnosis of iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency mandates determination of the underlying cause.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^a3cf1342]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Anemia is a common sign with protean causes and manifestations. A systematic approach to evaluation and management of anemia ensures appropriate care that may optimize hemoglobin and potentially ameliorate anemia-related morbidity while minimizing unnecessary testing. Nevertheless, further research is necessary because often anemia in older age has no discernible cause or proven therapy.

Cyanosis in adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) — definition, evaluation, and iron management: The definition of cyanosis is "bluish discoloration of the skin and/or mucous membranes resulting from inadequate oxygenation of the blood", and for cyanosis to be visible, at least 5 g/L of unsaturated hemoglobin in tissue is needed. Cyanotic heart disease encompasses a widely heterogeneous group; therefore, an individualized approach is needed for each patient according to the clinical details. Secondary erythrocytosis and polycythemia are fundamentally different conditions that require different treatments. Iron deficiency is frequently encountered in cyanotic individuals; consequences may include stroke and myocardial ischemia, and iron deficiency requires assessment of serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin levels because mean corpuscular volume is not a reliable screening test. Limited data suggest that treatment of transferrin saturation < 20% with iron supplementation until iron stores are replete can be done safely.

### Reference intervals for hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume in an ethnically diverse community sample of Canadian children 2 to 36 months [^2053a5d8]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To establish reference intervals for hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in an ethnically diverse community sample of Canadian children 36 months and younger.

Methods

We collected blood samples from young children at scheduled primary care health supervision visits at 2 weeks, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, and 36 months of age. Samples were analyzed on the Sysmex XN-9000 Hematology Analyzer. We followed the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines in our analysis. Data were partitioned by sex and also combined. We considered large age partitions (3 and 6 months) as well as monthly partitions. Reference intervals (lower and upper limits) and 90% confidence intervals were calculated.

Results

Data from 2106 children were included. The age range was 2 weeks to 36 months, 46% were female, 48% were European and 23% were of mixed ethnicity. For hemoglobin, from 2 to 36 months of age, we found a wide reference interval and the 90% confidence intervals indicated little difference across age groups or according to sex. For MCV, from 2 to 7 months of age there was considerable decrease in the reference interval, which was lowest during the second year of life, followed by a slight increase in the last months of the third year of life.

Conclusion

These findings suggest adoption of a single hemoglobin reference interval for children 2–36 months of age. Further studies in children under 4 months of age are needed.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Perioperative anemia synopsis — Even mild preoperative anemia is an independent risk factor for postoperative morbidity and mortality. The World Health Organization defines anemia as a hemoglobin concentration < 13 g/dL in men and < 12 g/dL in women. Up to 64% of surgical patients have anemia, more than half of which is moderate to severe. Iron deficiency is responsible in 40% to 50% of cases, and ferritin concentration < 100 ng/mL, transferrin saturation < 20%, and/or microcytic hypochromic red cells (mean corpuscular volume < 80 fL, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration < 27 g/dL) are indicative of iron deficiency. Most anemias are correctable within 2 to 4 weeks, and anemia management programs decrease the rate of transfusions, complications, and mortality.

### Blood counts in adult and elderly individuals: defining the norms over eight decades of life [^6a309496]. British Journal of Haematology (2020). Medium credibility.

The blood count is one of the most common tests used for health assessment. In elderly individuals, selection of a 'healthy' reference population for laboratory assessment is difficult due to the high prevalence of chronic morbidities, leading to uncertainty regarding appropriate reference intervals. In particular, age-specific lower haemoglobin reference limits to define anaemia are controversial. Here, we applied a data mining approach to a large dataset of 3 029 904 clinical routine samples to establish blood count reference intervals. We excluded samples from units/specialists with a high proportion of abnormal blood counts, samples from patients with an unknown or decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate, and samples with abnormal test results in selected other analytes. After sample exclusion, 566 775–572 060 samples from different individuals aged 20–100 years were available for analysis. We then used an established statistical algorithm to determine the distribution of physiological test results and calculated age- and sex-specific reference intervals. Our results show substantial trends with age in haematology analytes' reference intervals. Most notably, haemoglobin and red cell counts decline in men with advanced age, accompanied by increases in red cell volume in both sexes. These findings were confirmed in an independent dataset, and suggest an at least partly physiologic cause.

### Testing practices, interpretation, and diagnostic evaluation of iron deficiency anemia by US primary care physicians [^a785eed4]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Interpretation of Laboratory Studies

To assess PCPs' choices for additional laboratory tests to be performed for evaluation of IDA, respondents were presented with a hypothetical scenario of a 65-year-old man reporting generalized fatigue who had a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0) and mean corpuscular volume of 72.3 fL (to convert to μm 3, divide by 1.0). Measurement of ferritin level, the most specific marker of iron deficiency, was the most common laboratory test recommended by respondents (302 of 325 [92.9%]), followed by total iron-binding capacity and transferrin saturation (278 of 325 [85.5%]).

To assess PCPs' interpretation of iron laboratory studies, respondents were presented with a series of laboratory values and asked to determine whether the anemia resulted from iron deficiency or an alternate cause. For scenarios in which ferritin level and transferrin saturation were concordantly low or normal, respondents correctly identified the cause with more than 93% accuracy: 321 of 325 respondents (98.8%) correctly attributed anemia to iron deficiency in the presence of a low transferrin saturation (6%) and a low ferritin level (11 ng/mL), and 303 of 325 (93.2%) correctly attributed anemia to an alternate cause in the presence of a normal transferrin saturation (30%) and a normal ferritin level (150 ng/mL) (Figure 2). However, in scenarios of discordant ferritin and transferrin saturation values, diagnostic accuracy decreased. For example, in a scenario with a normal transferrin saturation (25%) but low ferritin level (6 ng/mL), 44 of 325 respondents (13.5%) misidentified the cause as something other than iron deficiency even though the likelihood ratio for iron deficiency with a ferritin level less than 15 ng/mL is 51.9. In a scenario with a low transferrin saturation (2%) but borderline low ferritin level (40 ng/mL), 86 of 325 respondents (26.5%) did not consider IDA as the cause even though the likelihood ratio for iron deficiency with a transferrin saturation less than 5% is 10.5. In that scenario, 239 of 325 respondents (73.5%) correctly identified the scenario as IDA. There were no statistically significant differences in correct interpretation of these scenarios by academic affiliation status, gender, stage in clinical practice, or practice of ordering ferritin level measurement for anemia evaluation.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^12f4ce03]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

There is little information in literature to guide the approach to CKD patients who show laboratory evidence of iron deficiency. Nevertheless, given the high prevalence of GI blood loss due to variety of causes in this patient population, deciding on a subsequent management plan, including endoscopy, depends on the clinical presentation. This supports the recommendation that CKD patients who present with anaemia and iron deficiency should undergo careful clinical assessment prior to the initiation of anaemia therapy.

Reduced iron availability for erythropoiesis can manifest as low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular Hb (MCH), but given the relatively long lifespan of circulating erythrocyte, this test will not reflect the existing availability of iron at the time of testing. Testing the reticulocytes for their Hb content (CHr or Ret-He) may allow more accurate estimation of iron availability, because reticulocytes are present in the circulation for 4–5 days, so give a discrete population to study. Reduced red cell Hb can be reflective of reduced haem availability or globin. Therefore, the red cell analyte values (%HRC, CHr, Ret-He) may be affected by the presence of haemoglobinopathies.

%HRC < 6% / CHr > 29 pg / ferritin and TSAT (> 100 microgram/L and > 20%).
For Children, aim for a target ferritin level greater than 100 microgram/L for CKD patients on dialysis as well as CKD patients not on ESA Therapy. (ungraded)

### Interventions to prevent iatrogenic anemia: a Laboratory Medicine Best Practices systematic review [^1ea96a60]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Evidence synthesis and meta-analysis

We converted the volume of blood loss to milliliters per patient per day when possible, and decline in hemoglobin to grams per liter per day. Measures reported for the entire length of stay were converted to daily values by dividing the total by the average length of stay, and group totals were converted to patient-level measures by dividing by the total by the number of patients in the group.

Effect size rating was determined a priori based on clinical significance as minimal, 0 to < 10%, moderate, 10 to 30%, and substantial, more than 30%, for all outcomes except the decline in hemoglobin. For the decline in hemoglobin, a relative effect greater than 20% was considered substantial. We synthesized evidence by intervention type and outcome. We rated the body of evidence as high, moderate, suggestive, or insufficient based on the number of studies, the study ratings, and the magnitude of the effect size (Additional file 3) and as described by Christenson et al. In brief, a high level of evidence requires three or more good quality studies with substantial effects; moderate evidence requires two good quality studies with substantial effects or at least three good quality studies with moderate effects; and suggestive evidence requires one good study with substantial effect, two good studies with moderate effects, or at least three fair studies with moderate effects. There must be at least moderate evidence to support the effectiveness of a laboratory practice. (Insufficient evidence does not rule out the potential value of the practice. Frequently, it indicates a need for additional evidence assessing the effect of the practice.) We also considered the consistency of the effect across studies in rating the strength of the evidence.

Meta-analytic estimates were calculated for outcomes for which we had evidence from at least three independent studies with the same type of intervention and outcome. We used the methods of Hedges and Vevea. Fixed effects modeling was used if the studies were homogeneous and random effects modeling if they were heterogeneous, based on the I 2 test for heterogeneity.

### Routine laboratory testing before endoscopic procedures [^ac438e3f]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Hemoglobin/hematocrit testing before endoscopy — routine screening is not advised for minor procedures without anemia symptoms, but selective testing is appropriate for high-risk scenarios. Severe anemia is found in less than 1% of asymptomatic patients, and a hemoglobin level less than 8 mg/dL has been associated with cardiac morbidity and operative death. Although determining a baseline hemoglobin or hematocrit level is recommended before major surgery with anticipated significant blood loss, such testing is not recommended for patients undergoing minor surgeries in the absence of clinical findings suggestive of anemia. Measurement of hemoglobin should be considered for patients with preexisting anemia or risk factors for bleeding, a high risk of adverse events with significant bleeding, advanced liver disease, or a hematologic disorder when undergoing endoscopic procedures in which there is a high risk of bleeding adverse events.

### Differential diagnosis and management of anemia in the newborn [^9d9e8c6f]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Neonatal anemia is a condition with a diverse etiologic spectrum. Therefore, in order to form a focused differential diagnosis, it is important for the caregiver to have some knowledge of the more common causes of low hemoglobin and hematocrit concentrations in the neonate. Proper history taking, physical examination, and interpretation of diagnostic tests can narrow this focus and aid in establishing an accurate diagnosis and in directing the appropriate therapeutic interventions.

Guideline 1.5 - Evaluation of anaemia – Baseline investigations

We recommend that initial clinical and laboratory evaluation of anaemia should be performed prior to initiation of treatment for anaemia in CKD patients. (1A)

We recommend that laboratory evaluation should include the following tests (1B):

- **Full blood count (FBC) including — in addition to the Hb concentration**:

- **Red blood cell indices**:

- mean corpuscular haemoglobin [MCH]

- mean corpuscular volume [MCV]

- mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration [MCHC])

- white blood cell count and differential count

- platelet count

- Absolute reticulocyte count to assess bone marrow responsiveness (if indicated).

- **Test to determine iron status**:

- percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (% HRC), but only if processing of blood sample is possible within 6 h or

- reticulocyte Hb count (CHr) or equivalent tests e.g. reticulocyte Hb equivalent or

- combination of transferrin saturation (TSAT) and serum ferritin if the above tests are not available or the person has thalassemia or thalassemia trait

- Serum ferritin to assess iron stores.

- Plasma/serum C-reactive protein (CRP) to assess inflammation.

Based on the initial assessment we recommend in selected cases, the following tests may be useful to diagnose the cause of anaemia (1B):
Serum B 12 and serum folate concentrations.
Tests for haemolysis (plasma/serum levels of haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, Coombs' test).
Plasma/serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis.
Hb electrophoresis.
Free light chains and bone marrow examination.

### Evaluation of macrocytosis [^1713d8a2]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis, generally defined as a mean corpuscular volume greater than 100 fL, is frequently encountered when a complete blood count is performed. The most common etiologies are alcoholism, vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, and medications. History and physical examination, vitamin B12 level, reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear are helpful in delineating the underlying cause of macrocytosis. When the peripheral smear indicates megaloblastic anemia (demonstrated by macro-ovalocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils), vitamin B12 or folate deficiency is the most likely cause. When the peripheral smear is non-megaloblastic, the reticulocyte count helps differentiate between drug or alcohol toxicity and hemolysis or hemorrhage. Of other possible etiologies, hypothyroidism, liver disease, and primary bone marrow dysplasias (including myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders) are some of the more common causes.

Down syndrome — macrocytosis and interpretation of mean corpuscular volume notes that children have a similar risk for iron-deficiency anemia as the typical population but it may be missed because of macrocytosis; iron insufficiency may precede anemia and have longer term neurologic effects; macrocytosis, which increases mean corpuscular volume, is present in up to one-third of patients, therefore a low mean corpuscular volume is not a useful screen for iron deficiency/insufficiency, lead toxicity, or thalassemia.

### Anemia in children [^958fac0e]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Anemia in children is commonly encountered by the family physician. Multiple causes exist, but with a thorough history, a physical examination and limited laboratory evaluation a specific diagnosis can usually be established. The use of the mean corpuscular volume to classify the anemia as microcytic, normocytic or macrocytic is a standard diagnostic approach. The most common form of microcytic anemia is iron deficiency caused by reduced dietary intake. It is easily treatable with supplemental iron and early intervention may prevent later loss of cognitive function. Less common causes of microcytosis are thalassemia and lead poisoning. Normocytic anemia has many causes, making the diagnosis more difficult. The reticulocyte count will help narrow the differential diagnosis; however, additional testing may be necessary to rule out hemolysis, hemoglobinopathies, membrane defects and enzymopathies. Macrocytic anemia may be caused by a deficiency of folic acid and/or vitamin B12, hypothyroidism and liver disease. This form of anemia is uncommon in children.

### Red blood cell transfusion: 2023 AABB international guidelines [^1225f45d]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

AABB red blood cell (RBC) transfusion guideline — adult good practice and recommendations: For hospitalized adult patients who are hemodynamically stable, the international panel recommends a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy in which the transfusion is considered when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL (Strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence). Remark: in accordance with the restrictive strategy threshold used in most of the trials for subgroups of patients, clinicians may choose a threshold of 7.5 g/dL for patients undergoing cardiac surgery and 8 g/dL for patients undergoing orthopedic surgery or those with preexisting cardiovascular disease. For hospitalized adult patients, the panel suggests a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy in which transfusion is considered when the hemoglobin concentration is less than 7 g/dL in those with hematologic and oncologic disorders (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence). Good practice considerations state clinicians should consider not only the hemoglobin concentration but also symptoms, signs, other laboratory data, patients' values and preferences, and the overall clinical context, and that clinicians should consider alternatives to transfusion, including medical treatment of anemia and blood conservation strategies; the guideline also notes this practice guideline will not apply to all individual RBC transfusion decisions.

### Abnormal ferritin levels predict development of poor outcomes in cirrhotic outpatients: a cohort study [^bd6698b0]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In a large cohort of cirrhotic outpatients, we measured serum ferritin levels and evaluated its association with the development of disease-specific complications and mortality during a 2-year-long follow-up period. We found that ferritin's serum concentration was significantly higher in males and older patients, as it was previously reported. We also observed significantly lower levels in patients, who previously had variceal bleeding while anemia was not associated with such difference in these patients. However, when we investigated correlations of ferritin with other laboratory measures, we found that parameters associated with hematopoiesis and iron homeostasis (hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume) correlated with ferritin in both compensated and decompensated groups, while inflammation markers and disease severity measures did only in the latter group. This result indicates that although in advanced stages of cirrhosis, inflammation and disease severity are important modulators of ferritin level, in earlier stages, ferritin concentration mainly corresponds to the iron homeostasis of the body, much like in the healthy population. Previous studies reported that cirrhosis induced immune-dysfunction predominantly manifests in decompensated stage resulting in systemic inflammatory and compensatory anti-inflammatory responses. This observation is in line with the lack of correlation between ferritin level and inflammatory measures in our compensated outpatients.

### Debate: transfusing to normal haemoglobin levels will not improve outcome [^658c45db]. Critical Care (2001). Low credibility.

Recent evidence suggests that critically ill patients are able to tolerate lower levels of haemoglobin than was previously believed. It is our goal to show that transfusing to a level of 100 g/l does not improve mortality and other clinically important outcomes in a critical care setting. Although many questions remain, many laboratory and clinical studies, including a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT), have established that transfusing to normal haemoglobin concentrations does not improve organ failure and mortality in the critically ill patient. In addition, a restrictive transfusion strategy will reduce exposure to allogeneic transfusions, result in more efficient use of red blood cells (RBCs), save blood overall, and decrease health care costs.

### Practical issues in clinical scenarios involving CKD patients requiring antithrombotic therapy in light of the 2017 ESC guideline recommendations [^d09f297d]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

CKD patients, especially those on hemodialysis, may have lower baseline hemoglobin values since they frequently need therapy with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and guidelines suggest target hemoglobin levels of 9.0–10.0 g/dL to 11.5–12.0 g/dL. Recent reports indicate that following the publication of KDIGO guidelines, mean hemoglobin levels have dropped, with the number of hemodialysis patients with Hb < 10 g/dL increasing from 9% in 2009 to 20% in 2012. Thus, the potential impact of a > 3 g/dL drop in hemoglobin levels (e.g. from 10 to 6 g/dL) may be higher than for individuals without baseline anemia (e.g. from 14 to 10 g/dL). Furthermore, a low hematocrit (below 30%, roughly equivalent to a hemoglobin level below 10 g/dL) favors bleeding in uremia. Thus, severity thresholds based on the fall in hemoglobin levels proposed by the ESC Update to categorize the severity of bleeding may not be appropriate in CKD patients, especially in those with most advanced CKD, and decisions for action should be individualized; however, milder decreases in hemoglobin levels may be considered as thresholds to take action.

### Evaluation of hemoglobin cutoff levels to define anemia among healthy individuals [^1c8bc77d]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are the current World Health Organization (WHO) hemoglobin (Hb) cutoffs to define anemia comparable to statistical and physiological Hb cutoffs calculated using representative surveys from multiple countries collected in the last 20 years?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of 79 950 Hb observations from population-based surveys that covered all WHO geographical regions, the WHO cutoffs for defining anemia were higher than the fifth percentile of nearly all countries except the US. This finding held for children aged 6 to 59 months and nonpregnant women aged 15 to 49 years and was confirmed using a physiological measure of increased red blood cell production.

Meaning

These findings suggest that lower Hb cutoffs based on pooled multinational data can be considered for defining anemia among children and nonpregnant women.

Full blood count (FBC) including — in addition to the Hb concentration:
Red blood cell indices:
Mean corpuscular haemoglobin [MCH]
Mean corpuscular volume [MCV]
Mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration [MCHC])

### Anemia [^056b499a]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Patients with anemia are frequently encountered in the emergency department (ED); emergency physicians (EPs) often play an important role in the evaluation and management of anemia. Although many patients have findings consistent with anemia on routine laboratory tests, only a small percentage will require acute intervention. An understanding of the broader types of anemia and how to manage such patients is important in the practice of an EP, as the presence of anemia will impact treatment plans for a variety of other disorders. This article reviews the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the ED with anemia.

### Using the hemoglobin content of reticulocytes (RET-He) to evaluate anemia in patients with cancer [^6074425e]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Evaluation of anemia, particularly iron deficiency, in patients with cancer is difficult. This study examined using the hemoglobin content of reticulocytes (RET-He) to rule out iron deficiency, as defined by serum iron studies (transferrin saturation < 20%, serum iron < 40 μg/dL, and ferritin < 100 ng/mL), in an unselected cancer patient population.

Methods

Patients were entered into the study based on the existence of concurrent laboratory test requests for CBC and serum iron studies.

Results

Using a threshold of 32 pg/cell, RET-He ruled out iron deficiency with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 98.5% and 100%, respectively, in the study population (n = 209) and in a subpopulation of patients with low reticulocyte counts (n = 19). In comparison, the NPV of traditional CBC parameters (hemoglobin, < 11 g/dL; mean corpuscular volume, < 80 fL) was only 88.5%.

Conclusions

These results support the use of RET-He in the evaluation of iron deficiency in a cancer care setting.

### Efficacy of testosterone replacement therapy in correcting anemia in men with hypogonadism: a randomized clinical trial [^ff452056]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Red Cell Indices

Red cell counts and hematocrit levels increased significantly more in testosterone-treated men than in placebo-treated men among those who had anemia as well as in those without anemia at baseline (eTable 1 in Supplement 2). Mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration decreased more in testosterone-treated men than placebo-treated men without anemia but did not change significantly in either group of men with anemia (eTable 2 in Supplement 2).

Prespecified Subgroup Analyses

The findings of prespecified subgroup analyses by preexisting CVD, baseline testosterone (stratified at 250 ng/dL), age (younger than 65 years, 65 years or older), and race (Black or African American, White) of the effect of TRT on the correction of anemia (eFigure 3 in Supplement 2) and incidence of anemia (eFigure 5 in Supplement 2) were similar to those of the primary analysis. The difference in proportion of men with hemoglobin increase more than 1 g/dL between men without and with CVD was significant (P = 0.04) (eFigure 4 in Supplement 2). Post hoc sensitivity analyses in which the end points were censored 30 days and 365 days after treatment discontinuation yielded similar results for the correction of anemia as well as incident anemia (eFigures 6 and 7 in Supplement 2).

Adverse Events

The adverse events in the TRAVERSE trial have been previously reported. The frequencies of investigator-reported adverse events by treatment group in men with and without anemia were similar to that in the parent trial with trends toward greater frequency of nonfatal cardiac arrythmias and acute kidney injury in the testosterone-treated men, especially in men with anemia (eTable 4 in Supplement 2). Six participants, whose hematocrit level exceeded 54% at the lowest (20.25 mg) testosterone dose, had their study medication discontinued. Time-dependent Cox hazards models did not show an association between change in hematocrit and the risk of MACE (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.92–1.02) or VTE (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.84–1.05) in testosterone-treated men with anemia.

### Biology of anemia, differential diagnosis, and treatment options in human immunodeficiency virus infection [^9d179c97]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Anemia is the most common hematologic manifestation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The causes of HIV-related anemia are multifactorial and include direct and indirect effects of HIV infection. HIV-related anemia generally is due to reduced red blood cell (RBC) production, secondary to a variety of causes, but it may also involve nutritional deficiencies, increased RBC destruction, or a combination of these problems. Evaluation of hemoglobin level, reticulocyte count, bilirubin, and mean corpuscular volume value and review of the peripheral blood smear are necessary for diagnosis. Treatment of HIV-related anemia should address the correctable underlying causes of this disorder, such as modifications of offending medications, nutritional deficiencies, and parvovirus infection. Patients with HIV infection have a blunted erythropoietin response to anemia. Therapeutic modalities for anemia that is not amenable to correction include blood transfusion and recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin alfa).

### Diagnosis and treatment of anemia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^fbf05c15]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Traditionally, the distinction between different causes of anemia is based on a hematological algorithm starting with the interpretation of the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Accordingly, micro-, macro- or normocytic erythrocyte conditions may hint at different causes for anemia. Besides MCV, basic laboratory parameters should include reticulocyte count, differential blood cell count, red cell distribution width, and serum ferritin, TfS and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. In patients with postoperative CD or severe ileitis, serum levels of vitamin B12 and folic acid should also be evaluated. In patients with signs of hemolysis or significant comorbidities, haptoglobin, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, reticulocyte Hb, lactate dehydrogenase, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), creatinine, and urea should be determined accordingly. Some authors have also emphasized a key potential role for early markers of impaired erythropoiesis markers, such as the Hb content in reticulocytes (CHr) or reticulocyte Hb equivalent, measures that are not available as part of conventional laboratory tests and that are further discussed in the outlook section.

### Transfusion thresholds and other strategies for guiding allogeneic red blood cell transfusion [^c2d027ca]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There is considerable uncertainty regarding the optimal haemoglobin threshold for the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in anaemic patients. Blood is a scarce resource, and in some countries, transfusions are less safe than others because of a lack of testing for viral pathogens. Therefore, reducing the number and volume of transfusions would benefit patients.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to compare 30-day mortality and other clinical outcomes in participants randomized to restrictive versus liberal red blood cell (RBC) transfusion thresholds (triggers) for all conditions. The restrictive transfusion threshold uses a lower haemoglobin level to trigger transfusion (most commonly 7 g/dL or 8 g/dL), and the liberal transfusion threshold uses a higher haemoglobin level to trigger transfusion (most commonly 9 g/dL to 10 g/dL).

Search Methods

We identified trials by searching CENTRAL (2016, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1946 to May 2016), Embase (1974 to May 2016), the Transfusion Evidence Library (1950 to May 2016), the Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index (1990 to May 2016), and ongoing trial registries (27 May 2016). We also checked reference lists of other published reviews and relevant papers to identify any additional trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized trials where intervention groups were assigned on the basis of a clear transfusion 'trigger', described as a haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct) level below which a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion was to be administered.

Data Collection and Analysis

We pooled risk ratios of clinical outcomes across trials using a random-effects model. Two people extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. We conducted predefined analyses by clinical subgroups. We defined participants randomly allocated to the lower transfusion threshold as 'restrictive transfusion' and to the higher transfusion threshold as 'liberal transfusion'.

Main Results

A total of 31 trials, involving 12,587 participants, across a range of clinical specialities (e.g. surgery, critical care) met the eligibility criteria. The trial interventions were split fairly equally with regard to the haemoglobin concentration used to define the restrictive transfusion group. About half of them used a 7 g/dL threshold, and the other half used a restrictive transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL to 9 g/dL. The trials were generally at low risk of bias. Some items of methodological quality were unclear, including definitions and blinding for secondary outcomes. Restrictive transfusion strategies reduced the risk of receiving a RBC transfusion by 43% across a broad range of clinical specialties (risk ratio (RR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.65; 12,587 participants, 31 trials; high-quality evidence), with a large amount of heterogeneity between trials (I² = 97%). Overall, restrictive transfusion strategies did not increase or decrease the risk of 30-day mortality compared with liberal transfusion strategies (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.16, I² = 37%; N = 10,537; 23 trials; moderate-quality evidence) or any of the other outcomes assessed (i.e. cardiac events (low-quality evidence), myocardial infarction, stroke, thromboembolism (high-quality evidence)). Liberal transfusion did not affect the risk of infection (pneumonia, wound, or bacteraemia).

Authors' Conclusions

Transfusing at a restrictive haemoglobin concentration of between 7 g/dL to 8 g/dL decreased the proportion of participants exposed to RBC transfusion by 43% across a broad range of clinical specialities. There was no evidence that a restrictive transfusion strategy impacts 30-day mortality or morbidity (i.e. mortality at other points, cardiac events, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, thromboembolism, infection) compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. There were insufficient data to inform the safety of transfusion policies in certain clinical subgroups, including acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, neurological injury/traumatic brain injury, acute neurological disorders, stroke, thrombocytopenia, cancer, haematological malignancies, and bone marrow failure. The findings provide good evidence that transfusions with allogeneic RBCs can be avoided in most patients with haemoglobin thresholds above 7 g/dL to 8 g/dL.

### How I treat anemia in older adults [^5945ef78]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion of case 1

This is a case of an older adult with a long-standing history of normocytic anemia and no overt etiology on routine testing. This is a common consult in hematology clinics and raises the question of both the necessary and sufficient evaluation. A focused history for bleeding or predisposition to bleeding (eg, antiplatelet or anticoagulants); major medical conditions related to inflammation, cancer, or gastrointestinal malabsorption; and personal or family history of anemia are important. The depth and duration of anemia are critical. In older age, a slow decline in hemoglobin of around 1 g/dL over 15 years can be expected.

In the absence of findings to direct the evaluation by history, we embark on a standard laboratory evaluation of anemia when testing has not been recently performed. These include a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, reticulocyte count, and peripheral smear review (Figure 1). The peripheral smear specifically assesses for RBC abnormalities, MDS, and leukemia disorders.

Case presentation

A 44-year-old man with chronic renal failure was admitted to our hospital because of the marked progression of anemia. He had been on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis since 2 years ago for the treatment of end-stage renal failure due to chronic pyelonephritis. He had also been subcutaneously administered C.E.R. A. as a sole ESA once a month at the hospital since 4 years ago for the treatment of renal anemia. At the hospital, C.E.R. A. had been kept refrigerated until it was administered. He was also being subcutaneously administered C.E.R. A. at a dose of 50 μg per month, which controlled his hemoglobin level at 12 g/dl. From 10 months before diagnosis, however, his hemoglobin level suddenly began to decline, reaching as low as 6 g/dl. Increasing the C.E.R. A. dose did not slow the progression of anemia, and frequent transfusions were required (Fig. 1). On admission, his body temperature was 36.8 °C and blood pressure was 110/60 mmHg. His palpebral conjunctiva was serious anemic and bilateral lower leg edema was not observed. He did not present with a symptom of throat infection, and did not have a past infection before admission. Laboratory results were as follows: red blood cell count, 2.29 × 10 6 /μl; hemoglobin, 7.1 g/dl; hematocrit, 20.7%; mean corpuscular volume, 90.4 fl; reticulocyte count, 3.2 × 10 9 /l; white blood cell count, 4830 /μl with normal differentials; platelet count, 1.2 × 10 5 /μl; lactate dehydrogenase, 197 IU/l; total bilirubin, 0.34 mg/dl, which showed a normocytic anemia accompanied with reticulocytopenia and no evidence of active hemolysis. Anti-nuclear antibodies and anti-DNA antibodies were negative. The patient was also negative for IgM antibodies to parvovirus B19. Computed tomography of the chest did not reveal thymoma. Further examination, including of the upper gastrointerstinal tract and a fecal occult blood test, could not detect an apparent bleeding source. The dialysis was adequate and he did not have a significant mineral bone disorder. The ferritin level was more than 500 ng/l, with transferrin saturation at 91.8% thanks to the frequent transfusions, and the folate level was normal. At the peak of the condition, the patient needed packed red blood cell transfusions almost every 2 weeks (Fig. 1).

### NCCN guidelines® insights: myelodysplastic syndromes, version 2.2025 [^bf5ea6a5]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Childhood myelodysplastic syndromes — differential diagnosis and diagnostic thresholds are noted: Differential diagnoses include aplastic anemia (AA) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Compared to AA, children with MDS have a significantly elevated mean corpuscular volume and clonal hematopoiesis is confirmatory, and higher expression of p53, lower expression of survivin, or MDS-related cytogenetic abnormalities can also help differentiate MDS from AA. Compared with AML, low WBC count, multi-lineage dysplasia, and clonal hematopoiesis with numerical rather than structural cytogenetic abnormalities suggest MDS, and a bone marrow blast count of < 20% also suggests MDS, with biologic features more important than a strict blast cutoff value. Monosomy 7 strongly suggests MDS. When patients present with AML, dysplasia does not necessarily indicate antecedent MDS and criteria for MDS diagnosis in a patient who presents with AML are stringent; dysplasia may reflect infection, deficiencies of B12 and copper, drug therapy, or chronic disease, and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, congenital sideroblastic anemia, and Pearson syndrome should also be excluded.

### HbA2 levels in children with β-thalassemia trait associated with iron deficiency: a perspective for pediatricians [^2601d3f1]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

The participants in this study were children with a diagnosis of β-thalassemia trait followed up in the Pediatric Hematology Department of Gazi University Medical Faculty in Turkey. We assessed a cohort of 213 children comprising 106 boys and 107 girls, with a median (min-max) age of 6.0 (1.0–17.0) years.

β-Thalassemia trait was diagnosed based on red blood cell (RBC) indices on CBC and HbA2 level on HPLC, with microcytosis (mean corpuscular volume < 80 fL), hypochromia (mean corpuscular hemoglobin [MCH] < 25 pg/cell), and erythrocytosis (RBCs > 5 × 10 12 /L) on CBC, while body iron status was normal (ferritin ≥ 15 ng/mL and transferrin saturation ≥ 15%); simultaneously increased HbA2 levels (≥ 3.5%) were consistent with the diagnosis. In individuals with similar results but normal HbA2 levels, the diagnosis was achieved by parental study (similar results in either parent were accepted as β-thalassemia trait).

Erythrocyte parameters of hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, MCH, MCH concentration, RBC, and RBC distribution width (RDW); status of serum iron, total iron binding capacity, transferrin saturation ([serum iron / total iron binding capacity] × 100), and ferritin levels; and HPLC results of HbA2 and HbF levels within a specific time interval (from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2019) were obtained from patient medical records.

Automated blood cell counts were performed using a Coulter LH 780 hematology analyzer (Beckman Coulter), biochemical parameters were analyzed using a hormone analyzer and chemiluminescent immunoassay (Immulite 1000 Immunoassay System [Siemens Healthineers]), and hemoglobin analysis was carried out using an HPLC system (VARIANT system [Bio-Rad Laboratories]).

### Haemoglobin thresholds to define anaemia from age 6 months to 65 years: estimates from international data sources [^566de21d]. The Lancet: Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Anaemia develops when the red cell mass is insufficient to meet physiological oxygen-carrying needs and is usually formally diagnosed when the haemoglobin concentration falls below a defined threshold for age and sex. Accurate case definition of anaemia is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment, and for understanding the magnitude and distribution of this condition as a public health problem. WHO's anaemia definitions aim to reflect the lower fifth centile of the haemoglobin distribution of a reference population of healthy individuals. WHO thresholds were initially proposed in 1958, then updated in 1968, and have remained essentially unchanged since.WHO thresholds were based on studies with restricted measurement of biomarkers of iron and other forms of haematinic deficiency and inflammation. There is limited consensus on anaemia definitions, leading to heterogeneous definitions between sources, expert groups, and public health bodies, translating into inconsistent clinical definitions.

Establishing a valid diagnosis of anaemia is crucial for treating patients and detecting the range of diseases that could underlie this condition. Anaemia can cause clinical effects directly (eg, anaemia causes a substantial burden of disease); however, even in the absence of overt clinical effects, haemoglobin-based thresholds for anaemia are used as important triggers for investigation and optimisation of underlying contributors. Haemoglobin concentrations are reduced by acute, recurrent, chronic medical or surgical illness. Inflammation (eg, due to autoimmune disease, infection, cancer, heart failure, and even obesity) suppresses erythropoiesis due to functional iron deficiency and might also reduce red cell survival. Haemoglobin concentrations are reduced in renal impairment due to reduced erythropoietin production and functional iron deficiency. Many medications can reduce haemoglobin concentrations idiosyncratically or in a dose–dependent manner. Anaemia can persist weeks or months beyond an acute illness, and normalisation of acute inflammatory markers. Conversely, hypoxia (eg, smoking, respiratory or cardiac disease, obesity or sleep apnoea, or elevated altitude of residence)can increase haemoglobin concentrations. Diagnosis of anaemia lies at the centre of many clinical pathways, such as investigation of gastrointestinal bleeding, preoperative optimisation, screening for haemoglobinopathy, and eligibility for blood donation. Anaemia is an adverse prognostic factor for multiple conditions, including heart failure, major surgery, cancer, and HIV. Most patients admitted to hospital with critical illness are anaemic in hospital, and about half remain anaemic 6 monthsor even 12 months after hospital admission.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for molecular and haematology methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the haemoglobinopathies [^f9164818]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

First-line haematology methods

All haematological testingshould be carried out on blood samples that are as fresh as possible. The complete blood count (CBC) or full blood count (FBC), haemoglobin pattern analysis and haemoglobin component quantification requires whole blood drawn into anticoagulant (EDTA). If necessary, bloods can be transported and stored at 4 o C.

Complete blood count

Electronic measurement is recommended, especially for MCV (mean cell volume), for which the measurements should be direct. All red cell indices (and other parameters) are important in evaluation, including Hb (haemoglobin), RBC (red blood cell count), MCH (mean corpuscular haemoglobin content), MCV and some labs use RDW (red cell distribution width), which is the standard deviation of the red cell size measurements expressed either as a percentage of the mean or a coefficient of variation.

RDW can potentially discriminate between thalassaemia carriers and iron deficiency and sometimes between thalassaemia carriers and a thalassaemia disorder or other rare causes of microcytosis, as indicated by decreased MCV (see notes below). It is a measure of the degree of anisocytosis and is simpler and faster than performing red cell morphology analysis (see Supplementary Information), although not as comprehensive. RDW alone is not a diagnostic parameter for β -thalassaemia trait.

The RBC count is also a parameter that can potentially distinguish between iron deficiency and thalassaemia. High RBC (erythrocytosis) results from a mechanism that compensates for the chronic low MCH present in thalassaemia carriers. This compensating mechanism needs folic acid levels to be maintained and may restore the Hb level of a markedly microcytic thalassaemia carrier to near normal values, raising RBC to 6–7 (10 12 /l) or higher, without exceeding the normal packed cell volume (PCV) level. On the other hand, RBC compensation might be less evident in case of folic acid deficiency, a vitamin with limited body reserves, which is essential for cell division and thus for erythropoiesis. In case of folic acid deficiency carriers may become more anaemic, and microcytosis may become less evident, even disappearing in cases with coexisting vitamin B12 deficiency. In addition, RBC compensation is less evident in cases when MCH is only moderately reduced.

### Prevalence of appropriate testing for incident anemia in the US department of veterans affairs [^c261dc6c]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Methods

The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is the largest national integrated health care system and has robust laboratory and administrative data. We defined a national retrospective cohort among patients who received regular VA care (≥ 2 primary care visits in 2 years) and had incident anemia, defined by: (1) 2 or more normal hemoglobin (Hb) levels between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2014; and (2) followed by anemia on 2 laboratory studies within 6 months of each other. The World Health Organization criteria were used for Hb levels: less than 12 g/dL for women and less than 13 g/dL for men (to convert Hb to grams per liter, multiply by 10). Patients were excluded if they were hospitalized within the 90 days before the incident date, or had laboratory evidence of anemia in the 5 years before the baseline (last normal) Hb level.

The primary outcome was appropriate testing within 1 year. Testing consisted of iron studies (ferritin, iron saturation, or both) in patients with microcytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume, < 80 μm 3 [to convert to femtoliters, multiply by 1]); vitamin B 12 and folate studies in patients with macrocytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume, > 100 μm 3); iron studies (ferritin, iron saturation, or both); and vitamin B 12 and folate studies in patients with normocytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume, 80–100 μm 3). Anemia was classified as mild, moderate, or severe using World Health Organization criteria (mild, Hb ≥ 11 g/dL; moderate, Hb ≥ 8 but < 11 g/dL; or severe, Hb < 8 g/dL). Iron deficiency anemia was determined using established likelihood ratios of ferritin. For incident IDA among patients who did not undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy in the preceding 2 years, we determined the proportion of patients who underwent endoscopic evaluation within the next year.

The VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System institutional review board approved the study and waived informed consent because the study posed minimal risk to participants and was not feasible without a waiver. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline. Race was reported using patient-reported classifications. A 2-sided P < .05 was considered statistically significant. We used χ 2 and Fisher exact tests for analysis of the categorical variables. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).

### Rosiglitazone maleate and metformin hydrochloride (Avandamet) [^f814d794]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

6.2 Laboratory Abnormalities

Hematologic: Decreases in mean hemoglobin and hematocrit occurred in a dose-related fashion in adult patients treated with rosiglitazone (mean decreases in individual trials as much as 1.0 gram/dL hemoglobin and as much as 3.3% hematocrit). The changes occurred primarily during the first 3 months following initiation of rosiglitazone therapy or following an increase in rosiglitazone dose. The time course and magnitude of decreases were similar in patients treated with a combination of rosiglitazone and other hypoglycemic agents or monotherapy with rosiglitazone. Pre-treatment levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit were lower in patients in metformin combination trials and may have contributed to the higher reporting rate of anemia. In a single trial in pediatric patients, decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (mean decreases of 0.29 g/dL and 0.95%, respectively) were reported with rosiglitazone. White blood cell counts also decreased slightly in adult patients treated with rosiglitazone. Decreases in hematologic parameters may be related to increased plasma volume observed with rosiglitazone treatment.

In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks' duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such a decrease, possibly due to interference with B12absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B12supplementation.

### Anemia in infants and children: evaluation and treatment [^6ff026bf]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Anemia affects more than 269 million children globally, including 1.2 million children in the United States. Although anemia can present with numerous symptoms, children are most often asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Anemia in infants and children most often arises from nutritional iron deficiency but can also be a result of genetic hemoglobin disorders, blood loss, infections, and other diseases. In the United States, newborn screening programs assess for various genetic causes of anemia at birth. The US Preventive Services Task Force notes insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening of asymptomatic children in the first year of life; however, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening all children before 1 year of age. Initial laboratory evaluation consists of a complete blood cell count, with further testing dependent on mean corpuscular volume. Microcytic anemia is the most common hematologic disorder in children, with iron deficiency as the most common cause. A recommended dosage of 2 to 6 mg/kg per day of ferrous sulfate is the most effective oral iron supplementation for patients with iron deficiency anemia. Delayed cord clamping at birth might prevent early iron deficiency, but no clinically relevant outcomes are certain. Normocytic anemia is classified by reticulocyte count and can reflect hemolysis (high reticulocyte count) or bone marrow suppression (low reticulocyte count). Macrocytic anemia is less common in children and is typically a result of nutritional deficiencies or poor absorption of cobalamin (vitamin B12) or folate. Pediatric hematology referral might be beneficial for patients who do not respond to treatment, and referrals are critical for any bone marrow suppression that is diagnosed.

### Brain volumes, RBC status, and hepatic function in alcoholics after 1 and 4 weeks of sobriety: predictors of outcome [^d724c8bd]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors asked if hematological indices of RBC status and hepatic function in newly sober alcoholic men are related to abnormalities in brain morphology, change with normalization of brain function during short-term sobriety, and predict prolonged sobriety.

Method

Alcoholic men received brain magnetic resonance imaging and laboratory assessments on admission and before discharge from an inpatient treatment program. Healthy comparison men were similarly tested.

Results

On admission, RBC count, hemoglobin level, and hematocrit were significantly lower in alcoholic subjects than comparison subjects; mean corpuscular volume, SGOT, SGPT, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase were significantly higher. By discharge, all measures had improved, although RBC count, mean corpuscular volume, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels remained significantly different from those of comparison subjects. Upon admission, alcoholic men had smaller cortical white and gray matter and larger lateral and third ventricle volumes, with reduced lateral ventricle and increased anterior cortical gray matter volumes by discharge. Lower RBC count, hemoglobin level, and hematocrit were associated with lower white matter and higher ventricular volumes at admission. Change in these measures was related to reduction in ventricular volume with treatment. By discharge, associations among RBC count, hemoglobin level, and hematocrit and white matter and ventricular volumes were less marked than at admission. Discharge hemoglobin value and hematocrit discriminated patients who maintained sobriety from those who relapsed. Hepatic function showed limited association with brain measures at admission and discharge.

Conclusions

Hemograms reflect alcohol-related abnormalities in brain morphology, improvement over short-term sobriety, and liability to relapse after treatment.

### Abnormal ferritin levels predict development of poor outcomes in cirrhotic outpatients: a cohort study [^c519434e]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Serum ferritin levels according to different patient characteristics. Ferritin levels were higher in male (a) and older (b) compared to female or younger patients. According to patients' severity, Child–Pugh C stadium was associated with increased ferritin levels only compared to Child–Pugh A stadium (c). There was no difference between groups by the presence of ascites (d), hepatocellular carcinoma ([HCC] e) or alcoholic etiology (f). Patients with a history of variceal bleeding (VB) had significantly lower serum ferritin levels (G), while there was no difference detected between patients with or without anemia (h) determined by low hemoglobin and/or hematocrit levels

Importantly, ferritin levels were significantly lower in patients who had a prior variceal bleeding episode compared to those who did not have such an event (median [IQR]: 43.1 [19.8–125.6] vs. 146.6 [52.7–358.3] μg/L, p < 0.001, Fig. 2 g). However, when we divided our patients according to the presence or absence of anemia as described in the Methods section, we did not find significant differences between the two groups (median [IQR]: 92.5 [31.2–301.4] vs. 132.4 [43.8–320.0] μg/L, respectively; p = 0.144, Fig. 2 h).

Next, we investigated the association between serum ferritin level and other laboratory parameters (i.e. continuous variables). While ferritin levels correlated with markers of hematopoiesis and iron homeostasis in both compensated and decompensated patients, the indicators of inflammation (CRP and white blood cell counts) showed correlation with ferritin levels only in patients with previous decompensation. Similarly, disease severity measures (Child–Pugh score and MELD) correlated with ferritin only in the decompensated group. Non-parametric correlations are summarized in Table 2.

### Point-of-care haemoglobin testing in African hospitals: a neglected essential diagnostic test [^5ad0fc5e]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Current practice

Prior to the meeting we sent out a structured survey enquiring about local guidelines for management of severe anaemia and including two specific questions on haemoglobin testing. Most clinicians reported that their current guidelines and practice aim to follow WHO guidelines. These guidelines include recommendations that restrict routine transfusion to only those with a haemoglobin less than 40 g/l (haematocrit < 12%) or 40–50 g/l if they have additional signs of severity. Nevertheless, the evidence base for the paediatric guidelines is weak, which has led to confusing recommendations within these guidelines and poor adherence. However, the guidelines give no specific guidance on clinical or haematological post-admission monitoring of children to identify those children who subsequently develop new severity criteria warranting transfusion.

We asked about the most common method used for anaemia diagnosis [POC Hb, haematocrit or full blood count (haemogram)] and how long it generally took to get a haemoglobin/haematocrit (or haemogram) result. Most indicated it would take between 1 and 8 h and 10% indicated the following day. Haemoglobin testing was only reliably available in just under 40% of those facilities. A recent publication on transfusion practice in Kenyan hospitals showed that, after adjusting for such features as severe illness, children for whom a transfusion was ordered and given on the same day had lower mortality [Odds Ratio (OR) = 0·58, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0·38–0·87] than those whose transfusion was delayed (≥ 1 day after prescription). Children in whom transfusion was ordered but was never received had a substantially higher in-hospital mortality: 20% vs 12% in those receiving blood (OR = 1·8, 95% CI = 1·3–2·49). Although there may have been other reasons for the worse outcome in those not receiving a transfusion in this study, we have previously shown that many severely anaemic children (< 50 g/l) that could not be transfused in the first 8 h (owing to stocks out at the blood bank) a significant proportion died [54/103 (52%)]; 90% of these deaths occurred within 2·5 h of Hb measurement and 100% had died within 5 h of this timepoint. We therefore conclude that delays in receipt of blood for transfusion are costing lives in those that need it most. The paediatricians involved in national guideline training who attended the meeting were concerned that adherence to the new algorithm would be difficult unless there is a greater focus on getting POC Hb tests onto the hospital wards, as has been done for malaria and HIV, but not for anaemia.

### Point-of-care haemoglobin testing in African hospitals: a neglected essential diagnostic test [^c8ad1ca6]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Alternative methods of estimating haemoglobin

Haematocrit

Measurement of haematocrit count is easy, cheap and can be performed in most rural hospitals.

Haemoglobin is then generally estimated from haematocrit (Hct) using a conversion factor of Hct = 3 x Hb. Thus severe anaemia (Hb < 60 g/l) would equate to a Hct level of < 18% and profound anaemia (Hb < 40 g/l) to a Hct level of < 12%. We note that a number of investigators have reported that this conversion factor/estimation is not very accurate. This includes a community study conducted in healthy children in Tanzania and Mozambique demonstrating a prevalence of mild (80–110 g/l) and moderate anaemia (< 80 g/l) which were 74% and 10%, respectively, when defined by Hb but the rates were lower if defined by Hct (42% and 3% respectively). This implies 72% (206/287) of the samples classified by Hb levels as moderate anaemia were not detected using Hct levels. Others have suggested using a lower conversion factor of 2·6; however, in practice this would be more difficult to calculate and impractical to inform immediate patient management by most health workers.

### Inherited microcytic anemias [^451b8f98]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

Inherited microcytic anemias can be broadly classified into 3 subgroups: (1) defects in globin chains (hemoglobinopathies or thalassemias), (2) defects in heme synthesis, and (3) defects in iron availability or iron acquisition by the erythroid precursors. These conditions are characterized by a decreased availability of hemoglobin (Hb) components (globins, iron, and heme) that in turn causes a reduced Hb content in red cell precursors with subsequent delayed erythroid differentiation. Iron metabolism alterations remain central to the diagnosis of microcytic anemia, and, in general, the iron status has to be evaluated in cases of microcytosis. Besides the very common microcytic anemia due to acquired iron deficiency, a range of hereditary abnormalities that result in actual or functional iron deficiency are now being recognized. Atransferrinemia, DMT1 deficiency, ferroportin disease, and iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia are hereditary disorders due to iron metabolism abnormalities, some of which are associated with iron overload. Because causes of microcytosis other than iron deficiency should be considered, it is important to evaluate several other red blood cell and iron parameters in patients with a reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV), including mean corpuscular hemoglobin, red blood cell distribution width, reticulocyte hemoglobin content, serum iron and serum ferritin levels, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and sometimes reticulocyte count. From the epidemiological perspective, hemoglobinopathies/thalassemias are the most common forms of hereditary microcytic anemia, ranging from inconsequential changes in MCV to severe anemia syndromes.

### Impact of extracorporeal photopheresis on blood and coagulation parameters [^d072967c]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is considered a safe treatment modality. We aimed to assess blood parameters including coagulation during ECP over time. We performed a long-term retrospective single-center chart review (laboratory parameters) of adult patients (n = 172) who had received ECP for any indication. We observed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in erythrocytes, hemoglobin, and leukocytes compared to baseline levels after only one ECP procedure. This decrease persisted after 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-months of ECP. A significant pathological decline of hemoglobin was observed in a higher proportion (26.4% and 25.2%, respectively) of patients after 6 (p = 0.0007) and 12 (p = 0.012) months of ECP. Mean corpuscular volume as well as hematocrit was significantly decreased at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-months of evaluation compared to baseline (p < 0.05). After 9 and 12months of ECP we observed a further decline in lymphocyte counts (p < 0.05). Various coagulation parameters did not change significantly during ECP treatment. Even though not all alterations observed in peripheral blood of ECP patients in the present study were of clinical significance, risk for developing persistent anemia must be considered in patients undergoing ECP.

### Diagnosing and treating diamond blackfan anaemia: results of an international clinical consensus conference [^92122fe4]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Diagnostic and supporting criteria for the diagnosis of DBA are described in Table III. These criteria are subject to future modification as more evidence-based data are accumulated. A diagnosis of "classical" DBA is made if all the diagnostic criteria are met. When there is a positive family history, an otherwise normal individual should be considered as having "non-classical" DBA if a mutation shared by affected family members is present. Anyone suspected of having DBA, but with insufficient diagnostic criteria, should be considered as having sporadic, non-classical DBA if a reported mutation is present. A patient can be assigned as having a "probable" diagnosis, with a decreasing degree of certitude if; three diagnostic criteria are present along with a positive family history; two diagnostic criteria and three minor supporting criteria are present; or, a positive family history and three minor supporting criteria are evident, even in the absence of diagnostic criteria. Of note, macrocytosis may be masked by iron deficiency or thalassemia minor and, in the newborn, can be obscured by residual fetal erythrocytes. The erythrocyte adenosine deaminase (eADA) activity, not influenced by prior transfusions, is elevated (≥ 3 SD) in 80–85% of patients classified as having DBA. In contrast, 90% of patients classified as having TEC have normal eADA activity. Elevated eADA activity, increased fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) are not very strong independent criteria, however, these factors should be seriously considered when evaluating a sibling as a stem cell transplant donor. Steroid responsiveness is not considered a diagnostic criterion and corticosteroids should not be administered until a diagnosis is made. If the first three diagnostic criteria are present, but there is no paucity of red cell precursors in the bone marrow and no supporting criteria, the diagnosis of DBA cannot be made. A bone marrow evaluation should be repeated at a later date as red cell marrow hypoplasia may develop after anaemia and reticulocytopenia. Furthermore, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia are not uncommon findings. Thus the presence of additional cytopenias does not preclude the diagnosis of DBA in a patient with red cell aplasia and may be severe enough to require treatment.

### Empagliflozin effects on iron metabolism as a possible mechanism for improved clinical outcomes in non-diabetic patients with systolic heart failure [^b8b5edd0]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2023). High credibility.

Changes in iron and inflammation markers and in RBC indices

Overall, 69 patients (91%) had a plasma iron level ≤ 13 µmol L −1, and 70 patients (92%) had a transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 20% and were, therefore, classified as having iron deficiency. Plasma ferritin was < 100 µg L −1 in 41 patients (54%). Depending on the definition (hemoglobin < 13/ < 12 g dL −1 or hematocrit < 39%/ < 36% in men/women), anemia was present in 24 (30%) or 20 (25%) patients at baseline. Distribution of patients with iron deficiency and/or anemia was similar across study arms (Table 2).

In patients receiving empagliflozin, there was a 12% increase in soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) after 6 months, whereas mean ferritin and hepcidin had declined to 76% and 68% of baseline values, respectively, and iron and transferrin levels, TSAT and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were unchanged (Table 2 and Fig. 3). In the placebo group, no changes occurred in any of these markers. Figure 3 shows the treatment effects.

Fig. 3
Effect of 6 months' treatment with empagliflozin versus placebo on laboratory markers of iron status and hepcidin and resulting treatment effects.

Data are presented as baseline-adjusted mean differences from baseline with 95% CI, estimated using baseline-adjusted linear regression models for each endpoint with a two-sided significance level of 0.05 and without correction for multiplicity. All analyses are based on data from 80 patients.

Source data

Six months' treatment with empagliflozin was associated with increases in hemoglobin, RBC count and hematocrit, whereas these variables were unchanged in the placebo group (Table 2 and Fig. 4). There were no major changes from baseline in mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) with empagliflozin, whereas all these indices increased in the placebo group (Table 2 and Fig. 4). RBC distribution width tended to increase with empagliflozin and to decrease with placebo. No significant treatment effects on erythropoietin were observed (Table 2 and Fig. 4). Figure 4 shows the treatment effects.

### Red blood cell count and risk of adverse outcomes in patients with mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction [^b1756633]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Three critical parameters related to RBCs

RBC count: This denotes the concentration of RBCs per microliter of blood, typically enumerated in millions. Integral to oxygen transportation, diminished counts may indicate conditions such as anemia, while elevated counts could signal disorders like polycythemia vera.

Hemoglobin: This intracellular protein is responsible for transporting oxygen to tissues and returning carbon dioxide to the lungs. Hemoglobin concentrations, quantified in grams per deciliter, can reflect various health conditions, with lower levels potentially indicative of anemia and higher levels suggestive of polycythemia vera or chronic hypoxia.

Red blood cell specific volume (RBCSV): This parameter represents the volume fraction of RBCs in the blood, also called hematocrit. Normal hematocrit ranges differ by sex. Deviations from normal ranges can indicate various conditions — low levels may suggest anemia, and high levels could indicate dehydration or other disorders.

2.2 RBC count

According to the definition of the standard RBC count in routine blood testing at our hospital, the reference range for men is 4.0 to 5.5 × 10 12 /L and that for women is 3.5 to 5.0 × 10 12 /L. After excluding patients with elevated RBC counts (> 5.5 × 10 12 /L in men and > 5.0 × 10 12 /L in women), the patients were divided into those with reduced RBC counts (< 4.0 × 10 12 /L in men and < 3.5 × 10 12 /L in women) and normal RBC counts (≥ 4.0 × 10 12 /L in men and ≥ 3.5 × 10 12 /L in women). We chose to evaluate RBC count as our primary parameter rather than hemoglobin or RBC specific volume (hematocrit), because RBC count is less affected by hypoxia, dehydration, and volume status, which can be confounding clinical factors within this patient population.

Results

The analysis consisted of a cohort of 395 patients with quantitative BV measurements time‐related clinical laboratory data collections, and who met pre hoc criteria. Median peripheral vHct for the cohort was 37% (interquartile range, 33%–41%) with no difference on the basis of patient sex (men [N = 261]: vHct, 38% [interquartile range, 33%–42%]; mean, 38 ± 6% [range, 21%–62%]; women [N = 134]: vHct, 36% [IQR, 33%–40%]; mean, 36 ± 6% [range, 21%–53%]). Two vHct cut points were selected for analyses to reflect lower‐range hematocrit values relevant to HF cohorts, which commonly have a high prevalence of anemia based on World Health Organization hemoglobin (not hematocrit) concentration criteria. Hematocrit in normal male subjects typically ranges between 40% and 54% and in female subjects 36% to 48%; therefore, the vHct values selected in this analysis were intended to be consistent with observed values common in HF clinical practice. Clinical characteristics and demographics associated with BVA studies stratified by vHcts of 40% and 35% are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively, and include the distributions of vHct cut points based on patient sex. In this cohort, male sex, younger age, higher eGFR, higher hemoglobin concentration and RBC mass, and less PV expansion were more prevalent in patients with vHct above the 2 respective cut points.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^2169415e]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

Although relative erythropoietin deficiency is common among patients with anaemia and CKD, other potential causes should be identified or excluded. A clinical and laboratory evaluation of the cause of anaemia should precede initiation of ESA therapy.

The recommended laboratory evaluation aims at assessing:
The degree and cause of anaemia,
Bone marrow responsiveness, and
Iron stores and iron availability for erythropoiesis.

Anaemia due to causes other than erythropoietin deficiency should be suspected when:
The severity of the anaemia is disproportionate to the deficit in renal function,
There is evidence of iron deficiency,
There is evidence of haemolysis, or
There is evidence of bone marrow disorder as manifest by leucopoenia and/or thrombocytopenia. Assessment of anaemia severity

In CKD patients not yet requiring dialysis and in those on peritoneal dialysis (PD), the timing of the blood sample draw is not critical because plasma volume in these patients remains relatively constant. In haemodialysis (HD) patients one issue remains to be clarified. Haemoglobin concentrations are routinely measured in dialysis patients before dialysis. This potentially leads to lower haematocrit values as a result of dilution from fluid overload prior to ultrafiltration and an underestimate to actual haemoglobin value.

Interdialytic weight gain contributes to a decrease in Hb level, whereas intradialytic ultrafiltration leads to an increase in Hb level. Thus, a pre-dialysis sample underestimates the euvolaemic Hb level, whereas a post dialysis sample over-estimates the euvolaemic Hb. Indeed changes on haematocrit can vary from the start to the end of dialysis by up to 6% depending of the volume of ultrafiltration. In a study of 68 stable HD patients receiving erythropoietin subcutaneously, average mean pre-dialysis Hb was 10 g/L lower than average post dialysis Hb. There was a strong linear inverse correlation between percentage of change in Hb and haematocrit (Hct) values and percentage of change in body weight. In another study of 49 stable HD patients, among all pre-HD and post-HD Hb values, levels measured at the end of short dialysis intervals were closest to the mean Hb value of the week, derived from calculation of the area under the curve for the readings of the week. In unit based haemodialysis patients receiving thrice weekly dialysis, Hb monitoring performed prior to a mid-week haemodialysis session would minimise Hb variability due to the longer inter-dialytic interval between the last treatment of 1 week and the first of the next.

### Iron deficiency and other types of anemia in infants and children [^89912ded]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia, defined as a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below the mean for age, is prevalent in infants and children worldwide. The evaluation of a child with anemia should begin with a thorough history and risk assessment. Characterizing the anemia as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic based on the mean corpuscular volume will aid in the workup and management. Microcytic anemia due to iron deficiency is the most common type of anemia in children. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend routine screening for anemia at 12 months of age; the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to assess the benefits vs. harms of screening. Iron deficiency anemia, which can be associated with cognitive issues, is prevented and treated with iron supplements or increased intake of dietary iron. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend screening or treating pregnant women for iron deficiency anemia to improve maternal or neonatal outcomes. Delayed cord clamping can improve iron status in infancy, especially for at-risk populations, such as those who are preterm or small for gestational age. Normocytic anemia may be caused by congenital membranopathies, hemoglobinopathies, enzymopathies, metabolic defects, and immune-mediated destruction. An initial reticulocyte count is needed to determine bone marrow function. Macrocytic anemia, which is uncommon in children, warrants subsequent evaluation for vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, hypothyroidism, hepatic disease, and bone marrow disorders.

### JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis: current diagnostic approach and therapeutic views [^f0387a4d]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Erythrocytosis refers to either a true or apparent increase in hemoglobin (Hgb)/hematocrit (Hct); distinction requires familiarity with sex-, race- and altitude-adjusted normal values, together with an appreciation of extreme normal values that exceed the 95th percentile (2 SD) of reference range and attention to clinical factors associated with plasma volume depletion (relative erythrocytosis). In 2008, the World Health organization (WHO) proposed Hgb and Hct diagnostic thresholds of 18.5 g/dl/52% and 16.5 g/dl/48% in Caucasian males and females, respectively, for investigation of polycythemia vera (PV). However, in 2016, the WHO classification system revised the Hct/Hct thresholds for PV diagnosis to 16.5 g/dL/49% in males and 16 g/dL/48% in females. In a recent large population-based study, the incidence of erythrocytosis ranged from 0.3% to 3.4% based on the application of the WHO 2008 and 2016 criteria, respectively; importantly increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality was reported only in the context of a higher Hgb threshold (WHO 2008).

The diagnostic workup of JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis lacks uniformity, and often includes investigations for rare hereditary conditions and several acquired entities known to be associated with secondary erythrocytosis. In a substantial proportion (up to 70%) of patients, despite extensive testing, erythrocytosis remains uncharacterized and sometimes labeled as "idiopathic", which is often a diagnosis of exclusion. The complexity and variability of the decision-making processes involved in managing erythrocytosis were underscored by an international survey of 134 myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) physicians evaluating standard practice in erythrocytosis; in this regard, while first-line assessments were relatively consistent (JAK2, EPO testing), second-line investigations were markedly heterogeneous. Equally variable were treatment practices, including the decision to initiate daily aspirin therapy and/or phlebotomy, as well as the desired Hct target, ranging from 48–56%. Some of this variability in management stems from unsubstantiated concern regarding thrombosis risk. The particular issue was further highlighted in a recent retrospective study where as many as one-third of patients with secondary erythrocytosis were subjected to bone marrow examination and 42% to periodic phlebotomy. Herein, we outline our systematic diagnostic and therapeutic approach in JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis; our review also includes illustrative cases and a discussion on underlying pathogenetic mechanisms.

Methods

Sample, setting and interventions

Blood samples were collected from five healthy adult male volunteers (mean age: 33.6 ± 7.40 years, mean height: 172.6 ± 5.26 cm, mean weight: 72.1 ± 3.0 kg), They met the standard blood test of WHO classification (Red blood cell count: 3.87–5.2 × 10 12 /L, White blood cell count: 3.3–8.6 × 10 9 /L, Platelets: 158–348 × 10 9 /L, Hb: 13.7–16.8 g/dl, Hematocrit: 37.4–48.6%, Mean corpuscular volume: 87.2–104.2 fl, Mean hemoglobin content: 29.2–35.3 pg, Mean hemoglobin concentration: 32.0–35.0%) without complications, anemia and hemodyscrasia who provided informed consent to participate in this study. Approximately 18 mL blood per person was collected from the cubitus vein in a vacuum blood vessel using a 21-gauge needle. NaCl solution, DW and hemolysed blood were added to the collected blood from volunteers to create three models, namely, high conductivity, low conductivity and hemolysis, respectively (Fig. 1). Blood tHb value was measured using an ABL 77® (conductivity 77) and ABL 725® (absorbance 725) system for conductivity- and absorbance-based measurements, respectively (both instruments from Radiometer K.K. Tokyo, Japan). For the conductivity change model, 10% NaCl (Otsuka saline 10% solution®; Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) was added to increase the serum Na + level by 30 and 60 mEq/L (Table. 1), whereas DW (PL®; Fuso Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. Tokyo) was added to reduce the serum Na + level by 10 and 20% (Table. 2). DW was added slowly while mixing the sample to prevent hemolysis. Addition of DW did not lead to hemolysis and change mean RBC volume. All samples were stirred to ensure mixing. For the hemolysis model, the collected blood was completely hemolysed by freeze–thawing, and a proportion of this was added to untreated sample. Complete hemolysis was visually confirmed via light microscopy (Table. 3). For the absorbance change model, the clinical spectrophotometer has a measurement range of 478 to 672 nm and uses 128 wavelengths.

### Red blood cell transfusion in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^881620bb]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Implementation — For patients reluctant to accept transfusions based on personal values or religious beliefs, "a thorough discussion with the patient or surrogate should occur before deciding to transfuse". When an RBC transfusion is chosen, "the optimal implementation strategy encompasses a restrictive approach and transfusing one RBC unit at a time". This "threshold and single-unit recommendation does not apply to patients actively bleeding at a rate exceeding the ability to transfuse single units or await hemoglobin test results safely", but "can be applied to patients whose acute bleeding has subsided", and "this approach should be suspended and then reapplied after bleeding is controlled (Fig 1)".

### Evaluation of hemoglobin cutoff levels to define anemia among healthy individuals [^12a0991c]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

On the basis of data from more than 39 000 individuals from 25 countries examined, the current WHO hemoglobin cutoff levels for defining anemia among preschool children and nonpregnant women were found to be significantly higher than the fifth percentile of Hb in apparently healthy individuals from most countries evaluated. Future studies focusing on Hb thresholds associated with functional and clinical health outcomes will improve the understanding of overall disease burden. Until then, revising Hb cutoff level definitions according to pooled multinational data could be considered.

### Efficiency of red cell distribution width in identification of children aged 1–3 years with iron deficiency anemia against traditional hematological markers [^5537cb91]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The high incidence of IDA in children emphasizes the need for the cost effective and reliable tool in diagnosing IDA. A number of different indicators, such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, erythropoietin, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, serum iron, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration have been used to evaluate IDA. But the drawbacks of these tests are that many of them are expensive and require sophisticated laboratories, while others have been found to have a low specificity. It has been seen that anisocytosis occurs, where the erythrocytes produced are of smaller than average size and having a large size variation, due to inadequate iron supply. The morphology and function of erythrocytes at molecular level has been known to be disturbed due to iron deficiency anemia. Therefore, an increase in RDW values may occur in IDA allowing an early detection of ID before reduction in MCV occurs. RDW has been reported to have a high predictive value for IDA and can differentiate beta-thalassemia from other causes of anemia in populations. Our results corroborate the view that RDW evaluated in a large sample performed very well as a screening diagnostic test for identifying iron deficiency anemia. These findings are similar to the findings of earlier studies conducted in other settings and support the usage of RDW as a screening tool for identifying iron deficiency anemia.

### Serum interleukin-6 and hemoglobin as physiological correlates in the geriatric syndrome of frailty: a pilot study [^bf45acf6]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine specific physiological correlates of the geriatric syndrome of frailty that warrant further investigation.

Design

Population-based case-control study.

Setting

General Clinical Research Center at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center.

Participants

Community-dwelling adults aged 74 and older from Baltimore, Maryland.

Measurements

Frailty status was determined using a recently validated screening tool that consists of weight loss, fatigue, low levels of physical activity, and measurements of grip strength and walking speed. Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and standard complete blood count was performed using a Coulter counter.

Results

Eleven frail and 19 nonfrail subjects with mean age ± standard deviation of 84.9 ± 6.7 vs 81.3 ± 4.1 years, respectively, completed the study. The frail subjects had significantly higher serum IL-6 levels and significantly lower hemoglobin and hematocrit than the nonfrail subjects (4.4 ± 2.9 vs 2.8 ± 1.6 pg/mL, 12.1 ± 1.1 vs 13.9 ± 1.0 g/dL, and 35.8% ± 3.1% vs 40.6% ± 2.8%, respectively). No significant difference was observed in mean corpuscular volume, red blood cell distribution width, or white blood cell and platelet counts between the frail and nonfrail groups. Furthermore, there was an inverse correlation between serum IL-6 level and hemoglobin (Pearson's correlation coefficient: -0.46) and hematocrit (-0.48) in the frail group but not in the nonfrail group.

Conclusion

These results suggest that frail subjects have evidence of inflammation and lower hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. This subclinical anemia is normocytic and is hence unlikely due to myelosuppression or iron deficiency and is potentially related to the increased chronic inflammatory state marked by serum IL-6 elevation. Further studies are indicated to better characterize the immune and hematological changes that underlie frailty.

Results of treatment

Hemoglobin and red cell indices

The Hb rose from an initial median of 9.9 g/dl [9.2–10.6] to 12.35 g/dl [11.6–13.0] (p = 0.0005) by one week after the last injection. The Hct similarly increased from 29.9% [28.0–31.5] to 38.1% [35.0–39.4] (p = 0.0005). The median RBC count increased from 3.3 cells/mcL [3.2–3.7] to 3.9 cells/mcL [3.6–4.3] (p = 0.01).

Iron indices

The serum ferritin and %TSat increased significantly by one week after the last dose versus baseline. Serum ferritin from 99 ng/ml [48.6–127.4] to 330.6 ng/ml [243.4–615.2] (p = 0.005) and %TSat from 12.8% [11–19.1] to 24.0% [18.5–27.9] (p = 0.005).

Complete blood cell count

A CBC for diagnostic evaluation of anemia should include the following cell indices: red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), reticulocytes count/production index, red cell distribution width (RDW), thrombocyte count and leucocyte count. In order to differentiate between various forms of anemia, the first step is to look at the MCV and MCH to identify macrocytic/normocytic/microcytic anemia. The next step is to evaluate the reticulocyte count and to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate erythropoiesis. The morphology of red blood cells and the reticulocyte count can help to identify the various causes of anemia, as shown in Table 2.

Table 2.
Causes of anemia and influence on red blood cell morphology and reticulocyte count.

In clinical practice, it has to be considered that multiple causes of anemia can be present in one patient. For example, coexisting IDA and ACD can be microcytic or normocytic. In IDA with concurrent drug-induced anemia (e.g. in the case of treatment with azathioprine), the lab test can be microcytic or even show a macrocytic anemia. This shows that the presence of macrocytic anemia alone should not be mistaken as a reason to exclude iron deficiency. MCH and MCHC are usually decreased in iron deficiency anemia, but are usually normal in ACD.

The RDW shows how much the erythrocytes differentiate in their size. It is commonly increased in IDA and within normal range in thalassemia. However, in patients with IBD, it has to be considered that nutritional deficits and disease activity can also increase the RDW.

Reticulocyte count is reduced (or 'normal', although it should physiologically be upregulated in anemia) in iron deficiency as a sign of inappropriate erythropoiesis. If the reticulocyte count is increased, hemolysis is an important differential diagnosis (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin and haptoglobine are parameters that help to further investigate the presence of hemolysis). The reticulocyte production index (RPI) puts the reticulocyte count in relation to the severity of anemia (RPI = reticulocyte count in % × hematocrit of the patient/ideal hematocrit (= 0.45) × reticulocyte maturation time). As a result of the shorter half-life, reticulocyte indices can reflect changes in the iron homeostasis within 3–10 days, much faster than erythrocyte indices.

### Should we restrict erythrocyte transfusion in early goal directed protocols? [^16ef68f9]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

In the more recent ARISE trial 1,600 patients with early septic shock were randomly assigned to receive either EGDT or usual care. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 90 days after randomization. Again, patients in the EGDT group were more likely to receive vasopressor infusions (66.6% vs. 57.8%; p < 0.001), dobutamine (15.4% vs. 2.6%; p < 0.001), and RBC transfusion (13.6% vs. 7.0%; P < 0.001) again with very similar outcomes as ProCESS.

Both studies confirmed the most important elements in management of sepsis: early administration of antibiotics and early adequate volume resuscitation using clinical parameters ascribed by the protocol. Of note two of the areas questioned here, the indication for dobutamine and transfusion "triggers" of hematocrit < 30% must be reassessed in light of existing evidence.

RBC transfusions are frequently given to patients with septic shock. Few of these transfusions are given to patients who are bleeding and most to non-bleeding patients. However, the use of a high hemoglobin threshold for transfusion as part of an EGDT protocol should be questioned. In this respect, Holst et al. compared two different transfusion strategies and randomized 1,005 patients with septic shock to receive one unit RBC when the hemoglobin level was ≤ 7 g/dl (lower threshold) or when the level was ≤ 9 g/dl (higher threshold) during the ICU stay. Primary endpoint was mortality at 90 days that was similar between both groups. However, the lower-threshold group received a median of 1 unit of blood (interquartile range, 0 to 3) and the higher-threshold group received a median of 4 units (interquartile range, 2 to 7). These authors concluded that RBC transfusion at a hemoglobin threshold of 7 g/dl is safe in septic patients, and a higher threshold was not beneficial and resulted in a 10–20 times higher transfusion adverse events.

### Concepts of blood transfusion in adults [^f1bb492f]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Recent progress has been made in the identification and implementation of best transfusion practices on the basis of evidence-based clinical trials, published clinical practice guidelines, and process improvements for blood use and clinical patient outcomes. However, substantial variability persists in transfusion outcomes for patients in some clinical settings — eg, patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery. This variability could be the result of insufficient understanding of published guidelines; different recommendations of medical societies, including the specification of a haemoglobin concentration threshold to use as a transfusion trigger; the value of haemoglobin as a surrogate indicator for transfusion benefit, even though only changes in concentration and not absolute red cell mass of haemoglobin can be identified; and disagreement about the validity of the level 1 evidence for clinical practice guidelines. Nevertheless, institutional experience and national databases suggest that a restrictive blood transfusion approach is being increasingly implemented as best practice.

### Safety of frequent venous blood sampling in a pediatric research population [^329ed5ae]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To monitor hematological indices in otherwise healthy children with central precocious puberty who underwent frequent venous sampling as part of a longitudinal clinical research study.

Study Design

Thirty-four female subjects underwent frequent venous sampling (every 10–20 minutes for 8–16 hours) every 6 months for ≥ 3 years during and after their treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue. Hemoglobin (Hgb), mean corpuscular volume, and ferritin levels were measured before and after each phlebotomy session.

Results

At baseline, the average Hgb level was 12.5 ± 0.7 g/L. At the conclusion of the first sampling session, the Hgb level fell 1.2 ± 0.1 g/L, remaining within the reference range for age. At the 3-month follow-up, there was complete recovery of Hgb (12.6 ± 0.2 g/L). Longitudinal evaluation every 6 months for as long as 3 years showed no significant differences in Hgb, mean corpuscular volume, or ferritin levels from baseline. No clinically significant adverse effects attributable to phlebotomy were reported.

Conclusion

When appropriate safety guidelines were followed, both acute and long-term frequent venous sampling in a pediatric population was safe. Guidelines include monitoring of hematological indices, phlebotomy volume < 10 mL/kg/24 hours, and iron replacement.

### The normal hematocrit cardiac trial revisited [^2a8a3484]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

The Normal Hematocrit Cardiac Trial (NHCT) was the first large, randomized study of patients receiving hemodialysis to examine the outcomes of treating anemia to a target hematocrit range of 42 ± 3% versus maintaining partial correction in a range of 30 ± 3%. The results of the NHCT and a meta-analysis adding eight subsequent trials of normalization of hematocrit/hemoglobin in chronic kidney disease (CKD) have demonstrated increased thrombovascular events and mortality associated with the higher targets. This article expands and clarifies the results of the NHCT, including data that were edited from the original publication, and highlights findings from more recent studies in the field. Paradoxically, none of the randomized trials has reported an association between higher attained hemoglobin concentration and mortality within randomized groups. Mean platelet count did not increase among the patients in the normal-hematocrit group in the NHCT or in two other large trials, CREATE and CHOIR. Exposure to high doses of erythropoietic stimulating agents and/or intravenous iron could be mediating complications in the CKD anemia-normalization studies, but post-hoc analyses to probe such potential associations have yielded conflicting results and are clearly hindered by the risk of confounding by indication. The mechanisms underlying the deleterious outcomes associated with efforts to correct renal anemia fully remain unproven.

Hemoglobin/hematocrit measurement and complete blood count — among asymptomatic or nonselected patients, abnormal hemoglobin findings were reported in 0.5% to 65.4% of patients and led to cancellations or changes in management in 2.4–28.6% of cases with abnormal findings (Category B2 evidence). For selected or indicated patients, abnormal hemoglobin findings were reported in 54.0% of patients (Category B2 evidence), and changes in clinical management were not reported. In asymptomatic or nonselected patients, abnormal hematocrit findings were reported in 0.2–38.9% of patients and led to delay of surgery in 20.0% of the cases with abnormal findings (Category B2 evidence). In asymptomatic or nonselected patients, abnormal complete blood counts were reported in 2.9–9.0% of patients and led to changes in clinical management in 2.9% of cases with abnormal findings (Category B2 evidence). For selected or indicated patients, abnormal complete blood counts were reported in 6.3–60.8% of patients and led to changes in clinical management in 14.9% of the cases with abnormal findings (Category B2 evidence).

### Iron deficiency in young basketball players: is a 100 μ g / L ferritin cut-off appropriate for iron supplementation? results of a randomized placebo-controlled study [^9e17a5cf]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Study population

A detailed sports cardiology screening was applied in 65 male basketball players (age: 15.8 ± 1.7 years). All the athletes play in the same youth academy; thus, all of them train equally 20 h/week. Baseline characteristics, laboratory, echocardiography, and CPET results are shown according to age groups in the Supplement Table.

3.2 Findings of the sports cardiology screening

During the sports‐specific questionnaire no athlete reported any medical complaint, while positive family history was revealed in 9 (13.8%) cases.

According to the dietary consultation and the FFQ test, there were no vegetarians among the players. They consumed meat every day as well as food with a high iron content at least twice a week: 12% of them consumed fish, 64% whole grain products, 4% bran and sprouts, 27% dried legumes, 16% nuts, and 33% cocoa. All the athletes had diverse and balanced diet with adequate nutritional intake.

Due to high resting or exercise blood pressure values, 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring exams were performed in 11 cases (17%). Hypertension was diagnosed in one case; angiotensin receptor blocker therapy was initiated.

Regarding the laboratory exams, no major alteration was found. In one case thalassemia minor was diagnosed based on laboratory parameters (mildly decreased hemoglobin [121 g/L], hematocrit [0.37], mean corpuscular volume [61.2 fL], and mean corpuscular hemoglobin [20 pg] with elevated red blood cell [6.06 T/L] and red blood cell distribution width [17.3%]). After hematology consultation, lifetime folic acid therapy was initiated.

Anemic iron deficiency (IDA) was not detected, but the frequency of IDNA was high (n = 60, 92%). No athlete had laboratory signs of infection. Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels did not show any difference between the age groups. The ferritin level increased with age. The difference in ferritin levels was significant between the U15 and U19 age groups (U15: 32.3 ± 24.6 vs. U19: 63.2 ± 22.9 μg/L, p < .005). Iron stores are least loaded in the youngest athletes (Supporting Information: Table).

### Transfusion management of severe anaemia in African children: a consensus algorithm [^07ad2453]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Consensus blood transfusion algorithm

Following discussion of all of the above, the meeting participants endorsed the proposed paediatric blood transfusion algorithm based on the evidence provided by the TRACT (Fig 2). The key elements start with triage of a child with suspected severe anaemia, incorporating an assessment of severity (to determine the need for a transfusion), with further management guided initially by an assessment of Hb (or haematocrit if Hb is not possible) and fever status at the time a blood transfusion is ordered from the blood transfusion service, in order to determine whether to request a higher volume of blood (30 ml/kg WB or 15 ml/kg RCC), or standard volume (20 ml/kg WB or 10 ml/kg RCC) if fever is present. Informed by the main time points when first (for children with uncomplicated anaemia) or repeat transfusions occurred, our proposed algorithm also incorporates a minimal number of additional measurements of Hb (or haematocrit) and clinical monitoring.
