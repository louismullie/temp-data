## Question

Treatment of triglycerides 177 in patient with CAD and stents and on crestor 20

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a triglyceride level of 177 mg/dL in a patient with coronary artery disease and prior coronary stenting who is already taking rosuvastatin 20 mg daily. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify the triglyceride level and whether it meets thresholds for intervention. Then, I should verify the patient's cardiovascular risk category and the LDL-C goals that apply. Next, I will review the role of statins in triglyceride lowering and whether the current rosuvastatin dose is appropriate. After that, I need to check for secondary causes of hypertriglyceridemia and confirm adherence. Finally, I will consider whether any add-on therapy is indicated now or if watchful waiting with lifestyle measures is the best course, and I will outline a monitoring plan with targets and timelines.

> Let me first confirm the triglyceride classification and its clinical significance. A fasting triglyceride level of 177 mg/dL falls into the mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia range (generally 150–499 mg/dL), which is not severe enough to mandate triglyceride-specific pharmacotherapy for pancreatitis prevention, and it is below the 200 mg/dL threshold where some guidelines begin to emphasize non–HDL-C targets more explicitly, so the priority remains LDL-C–directed therapy rather than adding a triglyceride-lowering agent right now [^8050065a] [^b42d4e00].

> Next, I should review the patient's risk category and LDL-C goals. With established CAD and coronary stenting, this is clinical ASCVD and typically very high risk. Contemporary guidelines recommend high-intensity statin therapy to achieve at least a 50% LDL-C reduction, with a threshold to add nonstatin therapy if LDL-C remains 70 mg/dL or higher on maximally tolerated therapy, and some European guidance even supports lower LDL-C goals in recurrent events, so I need to ensure the LDL-C is at target before worrying about triglycerides [^a341dbdd] [^906dbd4d] [^e219efa0].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about changing therapy solely for a triglyceride of 177 mg/dL. I should confirm whether rosuvastatin 20 mg is indeed high-intensity and whether it is achieving the expected LDL-C reduction. Rosuvastatin 20 mg is high-intensity and typically lowers LDL-C by about 50% or more, and it also produces a modest triglyceride reduction of roughly 10–30% depending on baseline, so the current regimen is guideline-concordant for secondary prevention and may already be contributing to triglyceride lowering [^d4ed0ce5] [^60ae4690] [^21166450].

> I need to check for secondary causes and adherence before escalating therapy. Let me consider common contributors such as uncontrolled diabetes, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, alcohol intake, hypothyroidism, renal disease, and medications that raise triglycerides; I should also confirm fasting status and repeat a fasting lipid panel if the prior sample was nonfasting, because nonfasting triglycerides can be 20–30% higher and misclassify risk, and I should verify that the patient is actually taking rosuvastatin 20 mg consistently [^721f8dda] [^b42d4e00].

> Now, I should evaluate whether any add-on therapy is indicated now. With triglycerides at 177 mg/dL and presumed LDL-C at or near goal on high-intensity statin, adding a fibrate, omega-3 fatty acid, or niacin is not recommended to reduce cardiovascular events in this setting, and the ACC/AHA guidance specifically advises against adding fibrates or over-the-counter omega-3s for risk reduction in chronic coronary disease; icosapent ethyl is reserved for patients with persistent triglycerides 150–499 mg/dL on maximally tolerated statin with LDL-C less than 100 mg/dL after addressing secondary causes, so I should not add it yet at this triglyceride level without confirming LDL-C status and persistence over time [^a341dbdd] [^011f14ab] [^77a90f4e].

> Let me reconsider the practical next steps. The most appropriate action is to optimize lifestyle measures that lower triglycerides and reinforce adherence to rosuvastatin 20 mg, then recheck a fasting lipid panel in 4–12 weeks to confirm LDL-C reduction and reassess triglycerides; if triglycerides remain 150–499 mg/dL with LDL-C less than 100 mg/dL on maximally tolerated statin after addressing secondary causes, then a conversation about icosapent ethyl can be reasonable, but at 177 mg/dL I would prioritize weight loss, dietary carbohydrate moderation, alcohol limitation, and regular aerobic activity before adding medication [^a341dbdd] [^77a90f4e] [^be85cc6a].

> I should double-check the monitoring cadence and targets to ensure nothing is missed. After any statin initiation or dose change, fasting lipids should be checked in 4–12 weeks, then every 3–12 months once stable; for very high-risk ASCVD, I should aim for LDL-C less than 70 mg/dL if possible and at least a 50% reduction from baseline, and if LDL-C remains 70 mg/dL or higher on maximally tolerated statin, I should add ezetimibe and consider PCSK9 inhibition thereafter, while keeping non–HDL-C in mind as a secondary target when triglycerides are 200 mg/dL or higher [^a341dbdd] [^be85cc6a] [^d9f20374].

> In summary, I should confirm fasting lipids and adherence, address secondary causes, intensify lifestyle therapy, and continue rosuvastatin 20 mg. A triglyceride of 177 mg/dL in this context is not an indication to add triglyceride-specific therapy now, and the focus should remain on achieving LDL-C goals and reassessing triglycerides over time to determine if persistent elevation warrants icosapent ethyl after the LDL-C target is met [^a341dbdd] [^77a90f4e] [^8050065a].

---

For a patient with CAD, stents, and triglycerides at 177 mg/dL on rosuvastatin 20 mg, **no additional triglyceride-lowering therapy is indicated** because 177 mg/dL is only mildly elevated and below the 200 mg/dL threshold where treatment is considered [^8050065a]. The priority remains **LDL-C lowering to < 70 mg/dL or a ≥ 50% reduction** [^a341dbdd] with high-intensity statin therapy [^906dbd4d]; if LDL-C is not at goal, add ezetimibe [^d9f20374] or a PCSK9 inhibitor [^62b43b50]. Address lifestyle factors (weight, diet, alcohol, diabetes control) and recheck fasting lipids in 4–12 weeks [^a341dbdd]; consider icosapent ethyl only if triglycerides remain ≥ 150 mg/dL despite optimized statin therapy and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL [^a341dbdd] [^77a90f4e].

---

## Clinical significance of triglycerides at 177 mg/dL

Triglycerides at 177 mg/dL are **only mildly elevated** and below the 200 mg/dL threshold where triglyceride-specific therapy is considered [^8050065a]. In CAD patients, the main lipid target is **LDL-C** [^a341dbdd]; triglycerides are secondary unless severely elevated (≥ 500 mg/dL) [^8050065a].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

### LDL-C management

- **High-intensity statin**: Rosuvastatin 20 mg is high-intensity and appropriate for secondary prevention [^d4ed0ce5] [^906dbd4d].
- **LDL-C goals**: Aim for < 70 mg/dL or a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline [^a341dbdd] [^083cef36].
- **Add-on therapy**: If LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated statin, add ezetimibe [^d9f20374]; if still ≥ 70 mg/dL, add a PCSK9 inhibitor [^62b43b50].

---

### Triglyceride management

- **Threshold for therapy**: Consider triglyceride-specific therapy only if ≥ 200 mg/dL despite lifestyle and statin therapy [^notfound].
- **Icosapent ethyl**: Consider only if triglycerides remain ≥ 150 mg/dL on statin with LDL-C < 100 mg/dL [^a341dbdd] [^77a90f4e].
- **Fibrates**: Not routinely recommended for mild hypertriglyceridemia in CAD [^a341dbdd].

---

## Role of rosuvastatin 20 mg in triglyceride management

Rosuvastatin 20 mg provides **modest triglyceride lowering** (about 10–30%) [^60ae4690] and is appropriate for secondary prevention; however, triglycerides are not the primary target at 177 mg/dL [^8050065a].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle changes can meaningfully reduce triglycerides:

- **Diet**: Reduce saturated fats, refined carbs, and added sugars; increase omega-3 intake [^notfound].
- **Weight loss**: Aim for 5–10% weight reduction if overweight/obese.
- **Alcohol**: Limit or avoid.
- **Exercise**: ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Reassess fasting lipids in **4–12 weeks** after any therapy change, then every 3–12 months [^a341dbdd]. Monitor for statin intolerance and drug interactions at each visit.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical parameter** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| LDL-C goal | < 70 mg/dL or ≥ 50% reduction [^a341dbdd] [^083cef36] |
| Current therapy | Rosuvastatin 20 mg (high-intensity) [^d4ed0ce5] |

Triglycerides at 177 mg/dL in a CAD patient on rosuvastatin 20 mg **do not require additional triglyceride-lowering therapy** [^8050065a]. Focus on achieving LDL-C goals with high-intensity statin and add-on therapy as needed [^a341dbdd], and address lifestyle factors; consider icosapent ethyl only if triglycerides remain ≥ 150 mg/dL on optimized statin with LDL-C < 100 mg/dL [^a341dbdd] [^77a90f4e].

14.9 Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease

In the J ustification for the U se of Statins in P rimary Prevention: An I ntervention T rial E valuating R osuvastatin (JUPITER) study, the effect of CRESTOR (rosuvastatin calcium) on the occurrence of major cardiovascular (CV) disease events was assessed in 17,802 men (≥ 50 years) and women (≥ 60 years) who had no clinically evident cardiovascular disease, LDL‑C levels < 130 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/l) and hs‑CRP levels ≥ 2 mg/L. The study population had an estimated baseline coronary heart disease risk of 11.6% over 10 years based on the Framingham risk criteria and included a high percentage of patients with additional risk factors such as hypertension (58%), low HDL‑C levels (23%), cigarette smoking (16%), or a family history of premature CHD (12%). Study participants had a median baseline LDL‑C of 108 mg/dL and hsCRP of 4.3 mg/L. Study participants were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 8901) or rosuvastatin 20 mg once daily (n = 8901) and were followed for a mean duration of 2 years. The JUPITER study was stopped early by the Data Safety Monitoring Board due to meeting predefined stopping rules for efficacy in rosuvastatin-treated subjects.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

Primary Prevention of CV Disease

In the Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) study, the effect of CRESTOR on the occurrence of major CV disease events was assessed in 17,802 males (≥ 50 years) and females (≥ 60 years) who had no clinically evident CV disease, LDL‑C levels < 130 mg/dL and hsCRP levels ≥ 2 mg/L. The study population had an estimated baseline coronary heart disease risk of 11.6% over 10 years based on the Framingham risk criteria and included a high percentage of patients with additional risk factors such as hypertension (58%), low HDL‑C levels (23%), cigarette smoking (16%), or a family history of premature CHD (12%). Patients had a median baseline LDL‑C of 108 mg/dL and hsCRP of 4.3 mg/L. Patients were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 8901) or CRESTOR 20 mg once daily (n = 8901) and were followed for a mean duration of 2 years. The JUPITER study was stopped early by the Data Safety Monitoring Board due to meeting predefined stopping rules for efficacy in CRESTOR-treated subjects.

The primary end point was a composite end point consisting of the time-to-first occurrence of any of the following major CV events: CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or an arterial revascularization procedure.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

CRESTOR is a selective and competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3‑hydroxy‑3‑methylglutaryl coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol. In vivo studies in animals, and in vitro studies in cultured animal and human cells have shown rosuvastatin to have a high uptake into, and selectivity for, action in the liver, the target organ for cholesterol lowering. In in vivo and in vitro studies, rosuvastatin produces its lipid-modifying effects in two ways. First, it increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell-surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL. Second, rosuvastatin inhibits hepatic synthesis of VLDL, which reduces the total number of VLDL and LDL particles.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

CRESTOR dose dependently reduces elevated LDL-cholesterol and reduces total cholesterol and triglycerides and increases HDL-cholesterol [see Clinical Studies (14)]. A therapeutic response to CRESTOR is evident within 1 week of commencing therapy and 90% of maximum response is usually achieved in 2 weeks. The maximum response is usually achieved by 4 weeks and is maintained after that. Individualization of drug dosage should be based on the therapeutic response [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

### Treat-to-target or high-intensity statin in patients with coronary artery disease: a randomized clinical trial [^102e724a]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

In patients with coronary artery disease, some guidelines recommend initial statin treatment with high-intensity statins to achieve at least a 50% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). An alternative approach is to begin with moderate-intensity statins and titrate to a specific LDL-C goal. These alternatives have not been compared head-to-head in a clinical trial involving patients with known coronary artery disease.

Objective

To assess whether a treat-to-target strategy is noninferior to a strategy of high-intensity statins for long-term clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized, multicenter, noninferiority trial in patients with a coronary disease diagnosis treated at 12 centers in South Korea (enrollment: September 9, 2016, through November 27, 2019; final follow-up: October 26, 2022).

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either the LDL-C target strategy, with an LDL-C level between 50 and 70 mg/dL as the target, or high-intensity statin treatment, which consisted of rosuvastatin, 20 mg, or atorvastatin, 40 mg.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary end point was a 3-year composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary revascularization with a noninferiority margin of 3.0 percentage points.

Results

Among 4400 patients, 4341 patients (98.7%) completed the trial (mean [SD] age, 65.1 [9.9] years; 1228 females [27.9%]). In the treat-to-target group (n = 2200), which had 6449 person-years of follow-up, moderate-intensity and high-intensity dosing were used in 43% and 54%, respectively. The mean (SD) LDL-C level for 3 years was 69.1 (17.8) mg/dL in the treat-to-target group and 68.4 (20.1) mg/dL in the high-intensity statin group (n = 2200) (P = 0.21, compared with the treat-to-target group). The primary end point occurred in 177 patients (8.1%) in the treat-to-target group and 190 patients (8.7%) in the high-intensity statin group (absolute difference, -0.6 percentage points [upper boundary of the 1-sided 97.5% CI, 1.1 percentage points]; P < .001 for noninferiority).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with coronary artery disease, a treat-to-target LDL-C strategy of 50 to 70 mg/dL as the goal was noninferior to a high-intensity statin therapy for the 3-year composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary revascularization. These findings provide additional evidence supporting the suitability of a treat-to-target strategy that may allow a tailored approach with consideration for individual variability in drug response to statin therapy.

### Medical management of stable coronary artery disease [^a9c80b6e]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

All patients with stable coronary artery disease require medical therapy to prevent disease progression and recurrent cardiovascular events. Three classes of medication are essential to therapy: lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, and antiplatelet agents. Lipid-lowering therapy is necessary to decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to a target level of less than 100 mg per dL, and physicians should consider a goal of less than 70 mg per dL for very high-risk patients. Statins have demonstrated clear benefits in morbidity and mortality in the secondary prevention of coronary artery disease; other medications that can be used in addition to statins to lower cholesterol include ezetimibe, fibrates, and nicotinic acid. Blood pressure therapy for patients with coronary artery disease should start with beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. If these medications are not tolerated, calcium channel blockers or angiotensin receptor blockers are acceptable alternatives. Aspirin is the first-line antiplatelet agent except in patients who have recently had a myocardial infarction or undergone stent placement, in which case clopidogrel is recommended. Anginal symptoms of coronary artery disease can be treated with beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, or any combination of these. Familiarity with these medications and with the evidence supporting their use is essential to reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease.

### Rosuvastatin (Crestor) [^38d4ad65]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CRESTOR significantly reduced the risk of major CV events (252 events in the placebo group vs. 142 events in the rosuvastatin group) with a statistically significant (p < 0.001) relative risk reduction of 44% and absolute risk reduction of 1.2% (see Figure 1). The risk reduction for the primary end point was consistent across the following predefined subgroups: age, sex, race, smoking status, family history of premature CHD, body mass index, LDL‑C, HDL‑C, and hsCRP levels.

Figure 1. Time to First Occurrence of Major CV Events in JUPITER

The individual components of the primary end point are presented in Figure 3. CRESTOR significantly reduced the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and arterial revascularization procedures. There were no significant treatment differences between the CRESTOR and placebo groups for death due to CV causes or hospitalizations for unstable angina.

CRESTOR significantly reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (6 fatal events and 62 nonfatal events in placebo-treated subjects vs. 9 fatal events and 22 nonfatal events in CRESTOR-treated subjects) and the risk of stroke (6 fatal events and 58 nonfatal events in placebo-treated subjects vs. 3 fatal events and 30 nonfatal events in CRESTOR-treated subjects).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

ACC ECDP — treatment targets and intensification after statin initiation: If coronary artery calcium (CAC) is measured, see Figure 6 and Section 5.5. On moderate-intensity statin, a 30% to 49% reduction LDL-C with LDL-C threshold < 100 mg/dL represents goal attainment; if not achieved, increase to high-intensity statin therapy. For high-risk patients, aim for ≥ 50% reduction LDL-C with LDL-C threshold < 70 mg/dL; if not achieved, it may be reasonable to consider ezetimibe. Ongoing management is to monitor adherence to lifestyle, medication if prescribed, and LDL-C response to therapy; for persistent hypertriglyceridemia, refer to the 2021 ACC ECDP on Management of Hypertriglyceridemia, with the footnote defining persistent hypertriglyceridemia as fasting triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL following a minimum of 4–12 weeks of lifestyle intervention and a stable dose of maximally tolerated statin therapy when indicated.

### Managing dyslipidemia in the high-risk patient [^a45e0620]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Lipid-lowering agents have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) in all patients. However, these agents are more cost-effective in high-risk patients whose absolute risk of CAD is greater than that of low-risk patients. Furthermore, from preliminary data, it appears that there is greater risk reduction in those subjects achieving lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (ie, lower is better). The identification and aggressive treatment of these patients should therefore be a high priority for clinicians. Guidelines from medical organizations, such as the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III of the US National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), emphasize that patients with CAD, diabetes, or global risk of CAD > 20% over 10 years and LDL-C levels > 130 mg/dL should receive drug therapy with a goal of reducing LDL-C levels to < 100 mg/dL. The recent results of the United Kingdom's Heart Protection Study (HPS) strongly suggest that even those with CAD or who are at high risk and LDL-C levels > 100 mg/dL would benefit from drug therapy. Although optimal LDL-C levels have been set at < 100 mg/dL for high-risk patients, recent studies show only about 20% of such patients meet these goals. Thus, a large treatment gap remains that needs to be overcome if we are to continue to make significant inroads into preventing further morbidity and mortality in these high-risk subjects. Of therapeutic options available currently and for the near future, statins remain the most effective and well-tolerated form of lipid-lowering therapy. Other therapies include bile acid sequestrants, niacin, and plant stanols. However, none of these is, in general, sufficiently effective as an initial agent to achieve these more aggressive LDL-C goals in the high-risk patient. However, combination therapy with a statin and 1 of these other lipid-lowering agents is useful in patients who are unable to achieve lipid goals on monotherapy. A number of agents for reducing LDL-C levels currently in development may be available in the near future, including 2 new statins: pitavastatin and rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin, which is in the later stages of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process, has been shown to produce significantly greater reductions in LDL-C levels compared with atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin, and allows more patients to meet lipid goals. Ezetimibe, the first of an entirely new class of LDL-C-lowering agents that inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption, also appears to offer significant therapeutic value. It is anticipated that these new options will allow clinicians to optimize the management of dyslipidemia in high-risk patients, thereby further reducing the morbidity and mortality of CAD.

14.8 Slowing of the Progression of Atherosclerosis

In the Measuring Effects on Intima Media Thickness: an Evaluation Of Rosuvastatin 40 mg (METEOR) study, the effect of therapy with CRESTOR on carotid atherosclerosis was assessed by B-mode ultrasonography in patients with elevated LDL‑C, at low risk (Framingham risk < 10% over ten years) for symptomatic coronary artery disease and with subclinical atherosclerosis as evidenced by carotid intimal-medial thickness (cIMT). In this double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study 984 patients were randomized (of whom 876 were analyzed) in a 5:2 ratio to CRESTOR 40 mg or placebo once daily. Ultrasonograms of the carotid walls were used to determine the annualized rate of change per patient from baseline to two years in mean maximum cIMT of 12 measured segments. The estimated difference in the rate of change in the maximum cIMT analyzed over all 12 carotid artery sites between patients treated with CRESTOR and placebo-treated patients was -0.0145 mm/year (95% CI –0.0196, –0.0093; p < 0.0001).

The annualized rate of change from baseline for the placebo group was +0.0131 mm/year (p < 0.0001). The annualized rate of change from baseline for the group treated with CRESTOR was -0.0014 mm/year (p = 0.32).

At an individual patient level in the group treated with CRESTOR, 52.1% of patients demonstrated an absence of disease progression (defined as a negative annualized rate of change), compared to 37.7% of patients in the placebo group.

### High-intensity versus non-high-intensity statins in patients achieving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal after percutaneous coronary intervention [^d911b504]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

High‐intensity statins have demonstrated consistent benefits for secondary prevention of adverse cardiovascular events compared with moderate‐intensity statins in several randomized trials. 1, 2 Therefore, the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline on treatment of blood cholesterol recommends high‐intensity statins, including atorvastatin 40 or 80 mg and rosuvastatin 20 or 40 mg, for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 3 However, whether beneficial effects of high‐intensity statins can be attributable to statin intensity per se or to merely lower low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) level achieved by high‐intensity statins compared with moderate‐intensity statins is uncertain. It has been reported that lowering of LDL‐C with statin therapy reduces major cardiovascular events regardless of types or intensities of statins. 4 Therefore, European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society (ESC/EAS) guidelines for management of dyslipidemia still propose the target goal for LDL‐C of < 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or a reduction of at least 50% from baseline for subjects at very high risk without specific recommendation for type or intensity of statin. 5 The differences between the 2 guidelines have caused many debates and much confusion in daily practice. 6 To date, it remains controversial whether outcomes differ according to statin intensity in patients with similar LDL‐C level. Therefore, we sought to investigate the association between statin intensity and long‐term clinical outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and achieving treatment target for LDL‐C.

### Medical management of stable coronary artery disease… [^14e606cb]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Therapy Statins limit the synthesis of cholesterol and increase the catabolism of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. There is substantial evidence that statins can benefit patients with CAD, as shown in. 8, 9 The National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III recommends using statins to achieve LDL levels of less than 100 mg per dL in patients with CAD. 2 The American College of Cardiology recommends that patients with CAD have a target LDL measurement of less than 100 mg per dL, and for those at very high risk, a goal of less than 70 mg per dL or treatment with intensive statin therapy should be considered. 3, 8. Several studies have examined optimal LDL levels in patients with CAD.

In one trial, patients given intensive therapy with atorvastatin in a dosage of 80 mg per day had significantly lower mortality 30 days after MI than those given standard therapy of pravastatin in a dosage of 40 mg per day. 10 Another study assessed patients with CAD who had an initial LDL level of 130 mg per dL or greater and were treated with atorvastatin to a goal of less than 70 mg per dL or less than 100 mg per dL. To avoid the combined outcome of cardiovascular death or MI, the NNT was 30 over five years in favor of the group with a goal of less than 70 mg per dL. 12 Reducing triglyceride levels and increasing high- density lipoprotein cholesterol levels also should be considered in the management of CAD. However, these are secondary interventions to incorporate after the LDL goal has been achieved.

9, 15 One study compared fenofibrate and placebo in patients with CAD who were already taking statins, and no difference was detected in cardiovascular outcomes. However, the patients with triglyceride levels higher than 200 mg per dL and HDL levels lower than 35 mg per dL after statin therapy did have reduced cardiovascular outcomes with added fenofibrate. 13 American Heart Association guidelines recommend adding fibrates if triglyceride levels are 200 mg per dL or higher after a statin trial in patients with CAD. 3.

The primary end point was a composite end point consisting of the time-to-first occurrence of any of the following major CV events: CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or an arterial revascularization procedure.

Rosuvastatin significantly reduced the risk of major CV events (252 events in the placebo group vs. 142 events in the rosuvastatin group) with a statistically significant (p < 0.001) relative risk reduction of 44% and absolute risk reduction of 1.2% (see Figure 2). The risk reduction for the primary end point was consistent across the following predefined subgroups: age, sex, race, smoking status, family history of premature CHD, body mass index, LDL‑C, HDL‑C, and hsCRP levels.

Figure 2. Time to First Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Events in JUPITER

The individual components of the primary end point are presented in Figure 3. Rosuvastatin significantly reduced the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and arterial revascularization procedures. There were no significant treatment differences between the rosuvastatin and placebo groups for death due to cardiovascular causes or hospitalizations for unstable angina.

Rosuvastatin significantly reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (6 fatal events and 62 nonfatal events in placebo-treated subjects vs. 9 fatal events and 22 nonfatal events in rosuvastatin-treated subjects) and the risk of stroke (6 fatal events and 58 nonfatal events in placebo-treated subjects vs. 3 fatal events and 30 nonfatal events in rosuvastatin-treated subjects).

In a post-hoc subgroup analysis of JUPITER subjects (n = 1405; rosuvastatin = 725, placebo = 680) with a hsCRP ≥ 2 mg/L and no other traditional risk factors (smoking, BP ≥ 140/90 or taking antihypertensives, low HDL‑C) other than age, after adjustment for high HDL‑C, there was no significant treatment benefit with rosuvastatin treatment.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

CRESTOR is an inhibitor of HMG‑CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3‑hydroxy‑3‑methylglutaryl coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by rosuvastatin accelerates the expression of LDL-receptors, followed by the uptake of LDL-C from blood to the liver, leading to a decrease in plasma LDL-C and total cholesterol. Sustained inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the liver also decreases levels of very-low-density lipoproteins. The maximum LDL-C reduction of CRESTOR is usually achieved by 4 weeks and is maintained after that.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

In clinical pharmacology studies in man, peak plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were reached 3 to 5 hours following oral dosing. Both Cmaxand AUC increased in approximate proportion to CRESTOR dose. The absolute bioavailability of rosuvastatin is approximately 20%. The AUC of rosuvastatin does not differ following evening or morning drug administration.

Effect of food

Administration of CRESTOR with food did not affect the AUC of rosuvastatin.

Distribution

Mean volume of distribution at steady-state of rosuvastatin is approximately 134 liters. Rosuvastatin is 88% bound to plasma proteins, mostly albumin. This binding is reversible and independent of plasma concentrations.

Elimination

Metabolism

Rosuvastatin is not extensively metabolized; approximately 10% of a radiolabeled dose is recovered as metabolite. The major metabolite is N-desmethyl rosuvastatin, which is formed principally by cytochrome P450 \ 2C9, and in vitro studies have demonstrated that N-desmethyl rosuvastatin has approximately one-sixth to one-half the HMG‑CoA reductase inhibitory activity of the parent compound. Overall, greater than 90% of active plasma HMG‑CoA reductase inhibitory activity is accounted for by the parent compound.

Excretion

Following oral administration, rosuvastatin and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the feces (90%). After an intravenous dose, approximately 28% of total body clearance was via the renal route, and 72% by the hepatic route. The elimination half-life of rosuvastatin is approximately 19 hours.

### Guidelines for lowering lipids to reduce coronary artery disease risk: a comparison of rosuvastatin with atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin for achieving lipid-lowering goals [^67a3b6bd]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Both the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III and the Second Joint Task Force of European Societies guidelines have established low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals for lipid-lowering treatment to reduce the risk of coronary artery disease. Data from 3 trials that compared rosuvastatin 10 mg (n = 389) with atorvastatin 10 mg (n = 393) and 2 trials that compared rosuvastatin 10 mg (n = 226) with pravastatin 20 mg (n = 252) and simvastatin 20 mg (n = 249) were pooled separately to compare the achievement of LDL cholesterol goals over 12 weeks of treatment in hypercholesterolemic patients. Noncomparative pooling of rosuvastatin 10 mg results from all 5 trials (n = 615) showed that 80% achieved NCEP ATP III goals and 81% achieved the European goal of < 3.0 mmol/L. Compared with atorvastatin 10 mg, significantly more patients treated with rosuvastatin 10 mg achieved their ATP III (76% vs 53%) and European (82% vs 51%) goals (p < 0.001). Also, in comparisons with simvastatin 20 mg and pravastatin 20 mg, 86% of patients treated with rosuvastatin 10 mg achieved ATP III goals, compared with 64% of simvastatin-treated patients and 49% of pravastatin-treated patients (p < 0.001). The proportions of patients who achieved the European goal were 80%, 48%, and 16% for rosuvastatin 10 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, and pravastatin 20 mg, respectively, in this comparison (all p < 0.001). A total of 71% of patients treated with rosuvastatin 10 mg who had triglyceride levels ≥ 200 mg/dL met both their LDL cholesterol and their non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals.

### What are the priorities for managing cholesterol effectively? [^2261d16c]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Many studies have confirmed the risk of coronary artery disease associated with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The precise role of other lipids, however, is still under investigation. The relation between elevated levels of triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is complex, and the results of clinical trials evaluating interventions to lower triglycerides or increase levels of HDL-C have been equivocal. Based on the data currently available, LDL-C remains the primary target for treatment. Ongoing clinical trials will help to answer the question of how low we should set our goals for lowering cholesterol in patients at risk.

1.1 Hyperlipidemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia

CRESTOR is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated Total-C, LDL-C, ApoB, nonHDL‑C, and triglycerides and to increase HDL‑C in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia. Lipid-altering agents should be used in addition to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol when response to diet and nonpharmacological interventions alone has been inadequate.

1.2 Pediatric Patients with Familial Hypercholesterolemia

CRESTOR is indicated as an adjunct to diet to:

reduce Total-C, LDL-C and ApoB levels in children and adolescents 8 to 17 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia if after an adequate trial of diet therapy the following findings are present: LDL-C > 190 mg/dL, or > 160 mg/dL along with a positive family history of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) or two or more other CVD risk factors.
reduce LDL-C, Total-C, nonHDL-C and ApoB in children and adolescents 7 to 17 years of age with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, either alone or with other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g. LDL apheresis).

1.3 Hypertriglyceridemia

### Achievement of 2011 European low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals of either [^0f4b65de]. Atherosclerosis (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Guidelines published in 2011 by the European Atherosclerosis Society and the European Society of Cardiology recommend a goal of either low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 70 mg/dl (~1.8 mmol/l) or ≥ 50% reduction in LDL-C for patients at very high cardiovascular risk. The aim of this study was to determine the percentage of high-risk patients from the VOYAGER individual patient data meta-analysis treated with rosuvastatin 10–40 mg, atorvastatin 10–80 mg or simvastatin 10–80 mg who achieved this goal.

Methods

We analysed 25,075 patient exposures from high-risk patients. Paired comparisons were made between each rosuvastatin dose and an equal or higher dose of either atorvastatin or simvastatin, with a series of meta-analyses that included only randomised studies that directly compared rosuvastatin and its comparator treatments.

Results

As statin dose increased, higher percentages of patients achieved LDL-C < 70 mg/dl or ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction. A greater percentage achieved this goal with rosuvastatin 10–40 mg (43.8–79.0%) than with equal or double milligram doses of atorvastatin (16.1–65.2%) or simvastatin (0–39.7%). Paired comparisons showed statistically significant differences for: rosuvastatin 10 mg vs. atorvastatin 10–20 mg and simvastatin 10–20 mg; rosuvastatin 20 mg vs. atorvastatin 20–40 mg and simvastatin 20–80 mg; and rosuvastatin 40 mg vs. atorvastatin 40–80 mg and simvastatin 40–80 mg (all p < 0.001).

Conclusion

These data from VOYAGER highlight the importance of an effective statin at an appropriate dose to achieve treatment goals for LDL-C in patients with very high cardiovascular risk.

### Achieving LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B target levels in high-risk patients: measuring effective reductions in cholesterol using rosuvastatin therapY (MERCURY) II [^cea71f49]. American Heart Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines for patients at a high risk of coronary heart disease set a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target of < 100 mg/dL. This target can be difficult to attain with diet and current therapy.

Methods

In a 16-week multinational trial, 1993 high-risk patients were randomized to rosuvastatin 20 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 20 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, or simvastatin 40 mg for 8 weeks. Patients either remained on starting treatment or switched to lower or milligram-equivalent doses of rosuvastatin for 8 more weeks.

Results

At 16 weeks, more patients achieved their LDL-C target by switching to rosuvastatin 10 mg than staying on atorvastatin 10 mg (66% vs 42%, P < .001) or simvastatin 20 mg (73% vs 32%, P < .001). Changing to rosuvastatin 20 mg brought more patients to their LDL-C target than staying on atorvastatin 20 mg (79% vs 64%, P < .001) or simvastatin 40 mg (84% vs 56%, P < .001). More very high risk patients achieved an LDL-C target of < 70 mg/dL when changed to rosuvastatin from atorvastatin or simvastatin (within-arm comparisons P < .01). More hypertriglyceridemic patients (triglycerides ≥ 200 mg/dL) met LDL-C, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and apolipoprotein B targets by changing to rosuvastatin. Switching to rosuvastatin produced greater reductions in LDL-C, total cholesterol, non-HDL-C, apolipoprotein B, and lipid ratios. All treatments were well tolerated, with no differences among treatment groups in skeletal muscle, hepatic, or renal toxicity.

Conclusion

Rosuvastatin 10 or 20 mg is an effective and safe therapeutic option for high-risk patients to achieve their lipid and apolipoprotein targets.

### Lipid management beyond the guidelines [^e79e09d9]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

The 2018 AHA/ACC cholesterol guideline builds on the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline statin recommendations to provide more detailed recommendations for the use of nonstatin therapy risk stratification for primary prevention statin use. New information has become available after the development of the 2018 AHA/ACC cholesterol guideline that can further inform clinical practice. Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type-9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies are now a reasonable or even good value following over 60% reductions in their acquisition price, and the identification of high risk patient groups most likely to benefit from further low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering. Meta-analyses and clinical trial data now show that patients with LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dl are more likely to experience progressively greater reductions in the risk of cardiovascular and total mortality and coronary heart disease events for progressively higher LDL-C levels. Icosapent ethyl, a highly concentrated form of modified EPA has been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in high risk patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia on statin therapy. Comparisons with other statin guidelines revealed that statin initiation for those with ≥ 7.5% 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk is the most effective strategy for reducing the most ASCVD events for the proportion of the population treated. Data from younger populations finally became available for coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring (mean age of 51 years) which confirmed the value of CAC > 0 for identifying individuals at increased ASCVD risk most likely to benefit from statin initiation. This analysis also found that statins could keep CAC = 0 in those with risk factors. Epidemiologic pooling studies now clearly show that LDL-C and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in young adulthood confer excess risk for ASCVD later in life. Accumulating data support earlier risk factor intervention trials as the next research priority.

Hypertriglyceridemia in primary prevention — the 2018 AHA/ACC/multisociety cholesterol guideline recommended the use of elevated triglycerides as a "risk-enhancing factor" in primary ASCVD prevention and recommended optimizing diet and lifestyle first, ruling out secondary causes of hypertriglyceridemia, and considering statin therapy in those with moderate hypertriglyceridemia and elevated 10-year ASCVD risk; in those with severe elevation (triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL, and especially ≥ 1,000 mg/dL), primary triglyceride lowering was recommended as a reasonable option to reduce pancreatitis risk, and studies have shown that despite statin therapy, ASCVD event rates remain high in patients with elevated triglycerides.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) risk-based therapies identify persistently elevated triglycerides (nonfasting triglycerides ≥ 175 mg/dl) as a risk-enhancing factor and outline statin thresholds and effects. In primary prevention patients without diabetes mellitus or LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL with an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk 7.5% to < 20%, the presence of persistent hypertriglyceridemia supports a decision to initiate at least moderate-intensity statin therapy, and for 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 5% to < 7.5% patient-clinician discussion is recommended regarding initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. Statins provide a 10% to 30% dose-dependent reduction in triglycerides in patients with elevated triglyceride levels; similarly, statin therapy should be initiated or maximized if such patients have a history of diabetes mellitus or ASCVD, and if triglyceride levels remain elevated at ≥ 500 to 999 mg/dL following initiation of statin therapy, the clinician should consider intensification and monitor adherence to therapy.

### Efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin in patients with hypercholesterolemia and a high risk of coronary heart disease: a randomized, controlled trial [^d3232d73]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

This double-blind, multicenter, randomized trial compared rosuvastatin and atorvastatin for reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in adults with hypercholesterolemia and a high risk of coronary heart disease.

Methods

After a 6-week dietary lead-in period, patients with LDL-C levels ≥ 160 and < 250 mg/dL and triglyceride levels ≤ 400 mg/dL were randomly assigned to 24 weeks' treatment in 1 of 3 groups, each with forced dose titrations at 12 and 18 weeks. Starting and titrated doses for each group were rosuvastatin 5, 20, and 80 mg (n = 127); rosuvastatin 10, 40, and 80 mg (n = 128); and atorvastatin 10, 40, and 80 mg (n = 128).

Results

At 24 weeks, LDL-C was reduced significantly more with 80 mg rosuvastatin (combined rosuvastatin group) than with atorvastatin 80 mg (60% vs 52% [P < .001]). At 12 weeks, rosuvastatin 5 and 10 mg reduced LDL-C significantly more than atorvastatin 10 mg (40% [P < .01], 47% [P < .001] vs 35%). At 18 weeks, LDL-C reductions were also significantly greater in both rosuvastatin groups than in the atorvastatin group (52% [P < .01], 59% [P < .001] vs 47%). Consequently, more patients receiving rosuvastatin achieved LDL-C goals. Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), non-HDL-C, apolipoproteins B and A-I, and all lipid ratios were more favorably modified by rosuvastatin at 24 weeks (P < .01). Effects of the 2 agents on triglycerides were similar.

Conclusions

Rosuvastatin was more efficacious than atorvastatin in modifying lipids in patients with hypercholesterolemia and a high coronary heart disease risk.

National Lipid Association Chart 4 — management of hypertriglyceridemia: For patients with very high triglycerides (≥ 500 mg/dL), the primary objective of therapy is to lower the triglyceride level to < 500 mg/dL to reduce the risk of pancreatitis, whereas for patients with high triglycerides (200–499 mg/dL), the primary objective of therapy is to lower levels of non–HDL-C and LDL-C to reduce risk for an ASCVD event. Lifestyle interventions are key to efforts to reduce triglycerides, and when drug therapy is indicated, an agent that primarily lowers triglycerides should be considered for patients with triglycerides ≥ 1000 mg/dL, a triglyceride-lowering agent or a statin may be reasonable for patients with triglycerides 500–999 mg/dL, and a statin should generally be the first-line drug therapy for patients with triglycerides 200–499 mg/dL.

Clinical ASCVD patients who are not at very high risk should be monitored using lipid-centric outcomes, and persistent hypertriglyceridemia warrants targeted management: Percent LDL-C and absolute LDL-C and non-HDL-C reductions should be the primary treatment outcomes for patients with clinical ASCVD who are not at very high risk; patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia despite adherence to lifestyle modifications and medications should be treated according to the 2021 ACC ECDP on management of hypertriglyceridemia; because hypertriglyceridemia is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and pancreatitis (especially in patients with triglyceride levels ≥ 500 mg/dL), treatment of persistent hypertriglyceridemia beyond statin and nonstatin LDL-C-lowering therapies may be warranted in patients with clinical ASCVD who are not at very high risk.

Chronic coronary disease (CCD) lipid management — In patients with CCD, high-intensity statin therapy is recommended with the aim of achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels to reduce the risk of MACE; in patients in whom high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or not tolerated, moderate-intensity statin therapy is recommended with the aim of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels. Adherence and response should be assessed by measurement of fasting lipids in 4 to 12 weeks after statin initiation or dose adjustment and then every 3 to 12 months thereafter. In very high-risk patients on maximally tolerated statin therapy with an LDL-C level ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L), ezetimibe can be beneficial to further reduce the risk of MACE; in those who have an LDL-C level ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L), or a non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level ≥ 100 mg/dL (≥ 2.6 mmol/L), on maximally tolerated statin and ezetimibe, a PCSK9 monoclonal antibody can be beneficial. In patients on maximally tolerated statin therapy with an LDL-C level < 100 mg/dL (< 2.6 mmol/L) and a persistent fasting triglyceride level 150 to 499 mg/dL (1.7–5.6 mmol/L) after addressing secondary causes, icosapent ethyl may be considered to further reduce the risk of MACE and cardiovascular death. In patients who are not at very high risk and on maximally tolerated statin therapy with an LDL-C level ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L), it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe; in patients with CCD on maximally tolerated statin therapy who have an LDL-C level ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L), and in whom ezetimibe and PCSK9 monoclonal antibody are deemed insufficient or not tolerated, it may be reasonable to add bempedoic acid or inclisiran (in place of PCSK9 monoclonal antibody) to further reduce LDL-C levels. In patients with CCD receiving statin therapy, adding niacin or fenofibrate or dietary supplements containing omega-3 fatty acids, are not beneficial in reducing cardiovascular risk. Cost value statements note that the use of generic formulations of maximally tolerated statin therapy is projected to be cost saving; addition of generic ezetimibe to maximally tolerated statin therapy is projected to be of high economic value at US prices; and the use of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies is projected to be of uncertain economic value at US prices.

### A VOYAGER meta-analysis of the impact of statin therapy on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia [^21166450]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Elevated triglyceride (TG) levels are associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. In patients with mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia, defined by the European Atherosclerosis Society Consensus Panel as a TG level of 177 to 885 mg/dl (2.0 to 10.0 mmol/L), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction remains the primary treatment goal. Using data from the indiVidual patient meta-analysis Of statin therapY in At risk Groups: Effects of Rosuvastatin, atorvastatin and simvastatin (VOYAGER) meta-analysis, we analyzed LDL-C and TG reductions in patients with baseline TG ≥ 177 mg/dl (≥ 2.0 mmol/L). Least squares mean percentage change from baseline in LDL-C and TG was compared using 15,800 patient exposures to rosuvastatin 5 to 40 mg, atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg, and simvastatin 10 to 80 mg in patients with baseline TG ≥ 177 mg/dl (≥ 2.0 mmol/L). Comparisons were made using mixed-effects models with data only from studies directly comparing treatments by randomized design. Mean LDL-C reductions ranged from -26.9% to -55.5%. Rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg resulted in significantly greater LDL-C reductions than equal or double doses of atorvastatin and simvastatin (p < 0.05). Mean TG reductions ranged from -15.1% to -31.3%. Rosuvastatin 10 mg resulted in significantly greater TG reductions than atorvastatin 10 mg (p < 0.05). Rosuvastatin 20 and 40 mg resulted in TG reductions similar to those with equal doses of atorvastatin. Rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg resulted in significantly greater TG reductions than equal or double doses of simvastatin (p < 0.05). In conclusion, in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, LDL-C reduction was substantial and dependent on the choice and dose of statin. TG reduction was numerically less than for LDL-C, and additional TG-lowering therapy may be considered to further reduce residual cardiovascular risk.

### Treatment trends, effectiveness, and safety of statins on lipid goal attainment in Chinese percutaneous coronary intervention patients: a multicenter, retrospective cohort study [^f64a34c5]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Limited data exist on the use of statins in Chinese patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We therefore conducted this study to observe the usage trend and the effectiveness of statins on LDL-C goal attainment and other lipid parameters among PCI-treated patients.

Methods

This multicenter, retrospective, observational, longitudinal cohort study was conducted in PCI-treated patients with CAD between July 1, 2011, and February 28, 2015. Primary study outcomes included statin treatment pattern after PCI and proportion of patients achieving target (LDL-C) levels 1 month after PCI and initiating statin therapy.

Findings

Data were analyzed for 2708 patients (mean age, 59 [10] years; median body mass index, 25.6 [4.0] kg/m 2). From baseline to the end of 1 month, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were the most prescribed statins; 20 mg and 10 mg were the most prescribed doses and therefore chosen for efficacy comparisons. In patients without dose changes, LDL-C reduction with rosuvastatin 10 mg was significantly greater compared with atorvastatin 20 mg (-0.67 mmol/L [from 2.44 mmol/L to 1.77 mmol/L] vs -0.54 mmol/L [from 2.40 mmol/L to 1.86 mmol/L]; P = 0.008). However, there was no difference in HDL-C, triglyceride, or total cholesterol values between groups. Age and LDL-C levels at baseline were significantly associated with target LDL-C achievement.

Implications

In real-world, PCI-treated Chinese patients, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were the most prescribed statins. Compared with atorvastatin 20 mg, rosuvastatin 10 mg was associated with greater LDL-C reductions and achievement of LDL-C targets in a higher percentage of patients. This analysis of real-world data shows that both rosuvastatin and atorvastatin were well tolerated and seemed to be suitable drugs for controlling lipid levels and preventing CVD risk in post-PCI Chinese patients with CAD.

For high-intensity statin therapy, the 2018 ACC/AHA Cholesterol Guidelines recommend atorvastatin 80 mg daily or rosuvastatin 20 mg daily. Very high risk includes a history of multiple major ASCVD events or 1 major ASCVD event and multiple high-risk conditions, with major ASCVD events including symptomatic peripheral arterial disease with ankle-brachial index < 0.85 and high-risk conditions including Age ≥ 65 years and chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate 15–59 mL·min−1.1.73 m2).

### Influence of high-dose highly efficient statins on short-term mortality in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting for acute coronary syndromes [^fe8f1874]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Statins are recommended for prevention of progression of cardiovascular disease after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Although high-dose highly efficient statins are recommended, especially in high-risk patients, clinical data are scarce and further investigation in "real-world" settings is needed. One thousand five hundred twenty-eight consecutive patients, who underwent PCI for acute coronary syndrome, were included in a prospective registry from January 2003 to January 2011. In post hoc analysis, cardiovascular risk factors, co-morbidities, and circulating lipid parameters at the time of intervention were evaluated. As a primary end point, all-cause mortality after a follow-up period of 3 months was investigated. Results were compared between patients receiving high-dose highly effective statins (atorvastatin 80 mg or rosuvastatin 20 mg) versus patients receiving low-dose statins or who were without lipid-lowering therapy at the time of discharge. Nine hundred twenty-six patients (60.6%) received high-dose atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and 602 patients (39.4%) received low-dose statin therapy or were not on statins at discharge. Eight patients (0.9%) receiving high-dose statin therapy and 21 patients (3.5%) taking low-dose statins or no statins at discharge died during the 3-month follow-up (hazard ratio 0.244, 95% confidence interval 0.108 to 0.551, p = 0.001). After propensity score adjustment the results remained significant (adjusted hazard ratio for high-dose statins 0.405, 95% confidence interval 0.176 to 0.931, p = 0.033). In conclusion, in this single-center series of 1,528 real-world patients undergoing PCI for acute coronary syndrome, a significant reduction in short-term all-cause mortality could be demonstrated in patients receiving high-dose highly efficient statins compared with patients receiving low-dose statins or no lipid-lowering therapy.

In patients without diabetes or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and with low-density lipoprotein > 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L), and 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk > 7.5%, or 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk of 5% to 7.4% plus 1 or more risk-enhancing factors, or coronary artery calcium score over the 75th percentile for age, sex, and race, or coronary artery calcium score > 100, the initiation of a statin, as adjunct to diet and exercise, is advised after a discussion of the risks/benefits with the patient.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: opportunities and challenges [^79997b9a]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

When deciding how aggressive an LDL-C-lowering regimen to prescribe, clinicians should be mindful that the absolute risk reduction is a function of both the absolute decrease in LDL-C concentration and the estimated ongoing ASCVD risk. The smaller the absolute drop in LDL-C, the less the relative risk reduction, and so the benefit gained from intervention depends on the risk status of the patient. At low LDL-C levels (eg, patients on statin) further lowering is recommended primarily for those in the highest risk categories. This approach is explored in figure 3 where we present typical patients with ASCVD at high/very high risk, who would fall into three of the categories of LDL-C goals set out in the guidelines.

Figure 3
Patient scenarios. Cases of patients at high ASCVD risk being ascribed to regimens of increasingly intensive LDL-C lowering. LDL-C and triglyceride levels are given in mmol/L (see online supplemental figure 1 for the mg/dL version). The predicted LDL-C reductions of 20% for ezetimibe and 60% for PCSK9i are based on average published responses. Case 1 is a patient with probable FH on the basis of his high LDL-C and sibling with diagnosed FH. Note, the additional 6% reduction on 40 mg rosuvastatin is based on the untreated LDL-C of 5.1 mmol/L; the 20% drop on ezetimibe is calculated from the LDL-C on 20 mg rosuvastatin. Case 2 is a woman with obesity, type 2 diabetes plus other risk factors (hypertension) with symptomatic ASCVD. Case 3 is a man with hypertension with repeat ASCVD events within a short time period (26 months). Note, when LDL-C levels are low — typically < 1.8 mmol/L — laboratory measurement can be problematic especially if lipoprotein(a) or plasma triglyceride levels are high. The guidelines recommend the use of non-HDL-C or apolipoprotein B as secondary measures to assess the need for further lipid-lowering action when LDL-C is low, as discussed in more detail.

Primary prevention with coronary artery calcium (CAC) to guide statin decisions — patient selection and actions: "In adults without diabetes and with LDL-C levels ≥ 70 to 189 mg/dL, at a 10-year ASCVD risk of 7.5% to < 20%, if the decision about statin therapy is uncertain, it is recommended to consider measuring coronary artery calcification". "If the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is 0 AU, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years, as long as higher-risk conditions are absent", whereas "if the CAC score is 1 to 99 AU and less than the 75th percentile for the age/sex/race group, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age", and "if the CAC score is 100 AU or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher for the age/sex/race group, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy".

### Reducing residual risk for patients on statin therapy: the potential role of combination therapy [^78468f41]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Cholesterol-lowering therapy with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, has been established as an effective method of reducing death and myocardial infarction among patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, a significant number of patients receiving statin therapy continue to have high residual risk. An important clinical challenge exists in reducing residual CAD risk with optimal therapies without increasing adverse effects. Combination therapy appears most appropriate for patients with a high rate of events of residual risk despite optimal statin therapy. This article discusses the role of combination therapy in managing CAD and in achieving optional targets in high-risk patient populations.

GUIDANCE FOR CLINICIANS

Based on contemporary evidence and current guidelines(Table), it seems reasonable to state that patients with unprotected LMCA stenosis and high complexity disease benefit more with CABG. On the other hand for individuals with low‐to‐medium anatomic complexity LMCA coronary artery disease, PCI is a reasonable option and may in fact be preferred in many patients. Figure provides a framework for individualized approach to the management of patients with unprotected left main coronary artery stenosis. Finally, individuals with LMCA stenosis are a particularly high risk group who benefit from optimal guideline‐directed medical therapies such as cessation of tobacco abuse, achieving optimal blood pressure goal (< 130/80 mm Hg), lipid‐lowering therapy with statins, and if needed, PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors, physical exercise, and optimal glycemic control.

Lipid guidelines comparison — LDL role, on‑treatment targets, and combination therapy are contrasted as follows: KDIGO states "does not consider LDL in treatment decision", while ACC/AHA specifies "If CVD history, do not consider LDL; if LDL ≥ 190, treat; if LDL 70–189, depends on risk", and 2014 ADA notes "LDL not used for treatment initiation, though there are target LDL levels on treatment", whereas AACE advises "As part of risk assessment, recommend that all adults at risk for CAD to reach optimum lipid values". For treatment targets, ACC/AHA indicates "Reasonable to target 50% reduction if LDL ≥ 190, otherwise no"; 2014 ADA specifies "Without CVD, LDL < 100; with CVD, LDL < 70 is an option; can use reduction by 30%–40% as alternative target if on maximum statin", and AACE lists "LDL < 100 with goal < 70 for very high risk, also targets HDL and triglycerides". For combination pharmacologic therapy, AACE allows "Yes if cholesterol markedly elevated and target not achieved with monotherapy, for mixed dyslipidemia, or to use lower doses of ≥ 2 drugs to decrease toxicity risk".

### Twelve-week, multicenter, randomized, open-label comparison of the effects of rosuvastatin 10 mg / D and atorvastatin 10 mg / D in high-risk adults: a DISCOVERY study [^730fd4ac]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) advocate reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol (TC) levels as the primary goals. However, approximately 50% to 60% of patients fail to reach recommended cholesterol goals.

Objectives

The primary objective of this Direct Statin Comparison of LDL-C Values: An Evaluation of Rosuvastatin Therapy Compared with Atorvastatin (DISCOVERY) trial was to compare the efficacy of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors rosuvastatin calcium and atorvastatin calcium in achieving the 1998 Second Joint Task Force (JTF) of European and Other Societies on Coronary Prevention target for LDL-C. Secondary objectives included comparing the efficacy of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin in achieving the 1998 JTF-recommended goal for TC and modifying other lipid levels, and to compare the tolerability of the 2 statins.

Methods

This 12-week, randomized, open-label, 2-arm, parallel-group trial was conducted at 210 centers in Finland, Iceland, and Ireland. Patients aged ≥ 18 years with a high risk for CHD and primary hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C > 3.5 mmol/L [> 135 mg/dL]) were randomized (2:1) to receive rosuvastatin 10 mg or atorvastatin 10 mg PO OD for 12 weeks. Before randomization, statin-naive patients underwent 6 weeks of dietary counseling, whereas patients receiving treatment with a starting dose of another lipid-lowering therapy but with an LDL-C level > 3.1 mmol/L (> 120 mg/dL) were switched to study drug immediately after they were determined eligible for the study Patients were assessed for fasting lipid levels at weeks 0 and 12, and the proportions of patients attaining 1998 and 2003 JTF lipid goals (1998: LDL-C, < 3.0 mmol/L [< 116 mg/dL]; TC, < 5.0 mmol/L [< 193 mg/dL]; 2003: LDL-C, < 2.5 mmol/L [< 97 mg/dL]; TC, < 4.5 mmol/L [< 174 mg/dL]) were calculated. Tolerability was monitored for the 12-week study and for an additional 36-week optional extension period.

Results

One thousand twenty-four patients were randomized to treatment (568 men, 456 women; mean age, 60.7 years). Patient demographic characteristics were similar between the 2 treatment groups. The efficacy analysis consisted of 911 patients (504 men, 407 women; mean age, 60.7 years; mean body weight, 82.4 kg); 627 received rosuvastatin and 284 received atorvastatin. Compared with atorvastatin, rosuvastatin was associated with significantly greater reductions in LDL-C and TC (both, P < 0.05), and with a significantly greater increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (P < (105). A greater proportion of patients in the rosuvastatin group compared with the atorvastatin group reached the 1998 goals for LDL-C (83.4% vs 683%; P < 0.001) and TC (76.4% vs 59.5%; P < 0.001). Also, compared with the atorvastatin group, greater proportions of patients in the rosuvastatin group achieved the 2003 JTF goals for LDL-C and TC (both, P < 0.001). Both agents were well tolerated: serious drug-related events were observed in ≤ 3.0% of patients in each group, and no clinically significant differences were found between the 2 treatment groups.

Conclusions

In this study of selected patients at high risk for CHD and with primary hypercholesterolemia, rosuvastatin 10 mg/d for 12 weeks was associated with significantly greater reductions in LDL-C and TC levels compared with atorvastatin 10 mg/d. Furthermore, significantly more patients receiving rosuvastatin achieved the 1998 and 2003 JTF-recommended lipid targets compared with those receiving atorvastatin. Both agents were well tolerated.

### Should we treat moderately elevated triglycerides? Yes… [^722fa1fe]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia should begin immediately to reduce the risk of pancreatitis. Usually, a fibrate is tried first with therapeutic lifestyle changes. Treatment of modest hypertriglyceridemia should begin with therapeutic lifestyle changes and a search for underlying causes or contributing factors, such as obesity, hypothyroidism, or diabetes. If triglycerides remain elevated, the NCEP-ATP III guidelines recommend treating the LDL cholesterol first, and then the non-HDL cholesterol to reach goals based on the patient's Framingham risk assessment. Drug therapy in these cases should begin with a statin, which should be titrated accordingly. Combination therapy with a fibrate should follow if needed. It is safest to add fenofibrate, because there is a chance of rhabdomyolysis with gemfibrozil.

Omega-3 fish oil was recently approved for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia and can be added to the statin. Niacin is another therapeutic option and is now available in a combination product with simvastatin. There are no specific guidelines from the NCEP-ATP III about treating isolated moderate hypertriglyceridemia. However, if the triglyceride level remains elevated once LDL and non-HDL cholesterol concentrations are normalized, it may be worthwhile to pursue further triglyceride-lowering treatment, especially in high-risk patients with CHD or type 2 diabetes. In the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 22 trial of patients after acute coronary syndrome, a final triglyceride level less than 150 mg per dL was associated with a 27 percent relative reduction in coronary events.

8 In the Baltimore Coronary Observational Long-Term Study there was an association between increased coronary events and moderate hypertriglyceridemia. 9 Recent findings from the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes study show a 27 percent relative reduction in CHD and a 38 percent relative reduction in nontraumatic leg amputation in patients with diabetes treated using fenofibrate. 10 The NCEP-ATP III final report states that drugs that modify atherogenic dyslipidemia yield moderate reductions in CHD risk. 1.

Chronic coronary disease lipid management — ezetimibe with moderate-intensity statins in patients not at very high risk: In patients not at very high risk, high-intensity statins may be insufficient or not tolerated, and additional LDL-C lowering may be necessary in those on moderate-intensity statin therapy with LDL-C levels ≥ 70 mg/dL; adding ezetimibe to moderate-intensity statin therapy may compensate for reduced LDL-C lowering, and although its net benefit may be less robust, it is preferred before a PCSK9 monoclonal antibody.

### Effect of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin on new-onset diabetes mellitus in patients treated with high-intensity statin therapy for coronary artery disease: a post-hoc analysis from the LODESTAR randomized clinical trial [^e99343c3]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

The intensity of statin treatment was divided into three categories according to the 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the treatment of blood cholesterol. In the treat-to-target strategy group, the target LDL-C level was below 70 mg/dL, and the statin intensity was titrated as follows. For statin-naïve patients, moderate-intensity statin therapy was initiated. For those who were already taking a statin, an equivalent intensity was maintained when LDL-C was below 70 mg/dL at randomization, and the intensity was up-titrated when LDL-C was ≥ 70 mg/dL. During follow-up, there was up-titration for those with LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL, maintenance of the same intensity for those with LDL-C ≥ 50 mg/dL to < 70 mg/dL, and down-titration for those with LDL-C < 50 mg/dL. In the high-intensity statin strategy group, high-intensity statin therapy was maintained without adjustment. In the LODESTAR trial, patients were treated with rosuvastatin 10 mg or atorvastatin 20 mg for moderate-intensity statin therapy, and rosuvastatin 20 mg or atorvastatin 40 mg for high-intensity statin therapy. For other medical treatments, guideline-directed medical therapy was strongly recommended.

Clinical and laboratory findings were assessed at baseline. All patients were scheduled for follow-up visits at 6 weeks and 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. General health status, use of drugs, and the occurrence of clinical endpoints or adverse events were assessed at baseline and during each follow-up visit. The following results were followed serially at 6 weeks and 12, 24, and 36 months: lipid profiles, including total cholesterol, LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. When the dose or type of study medication was changed during follow-up, patients were recommended to present for a laboratory test within 4 to 6 weeks. To monitor adverse effects related to the statin therapy, plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, and creatine kinase levels were assessed.

Atherogenic cholesterol–lowering drug therapy — A moderate- or high-intensity statin should be first-line drug therapy for treatment of elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol, unless contraindicated; if goal not achieved, intensify atherogenic cholesterol–lowering drug therapy or refer to a lipid specialist. In a patient with very high triglycerides (≥ 500 mg/dL), a triglyceride-lowering drug may be considered for the first-line use to prevent pancreatitis. Monitor response and adherence to therapy every 4–12 months, and in most cases goal levels should be achieved in approximately 6 months.

Current Insights and Recommendations on Lipid‐Lowering Therapy After ACS

Large‐scale trials are ongoing to investigate the clinical relevance of lipid particles, such as triglycerides, high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C), apolipoprotein A1, and lipoprotein(a), in reducing the persistent risk of developing CAD and its complications. However, increased levels of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) have irrefutably been shown to be a key causal factor in the development of CAD, and robust clinical evidence shows that reducing LDL‐C blood levels leads to the prevention of atherothrombotic events. 11, 12 Figure 1 provides an overview of the distinct mechanisms of action for the 3 classes of cholesterol‐lowering drugs that are being advocated in current guidelines (ie, statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 [proprotein convertase subtilisin‐kexin type 9] inhibitors).

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^0fdc680a]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy and CAC use: In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), if statin therapy is chosen after a risk discussion, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended; in this group LDL-C should be reduced by 30% or more, and for high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) levels should be reduced by 50% or more. In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated. In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended. In diabetes with multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more. In intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy, and in patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. When coronary artery calcium (CAC) is measured to guide treatment in intermediate-risk or selected borderline-risk adults: if the CAC score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years absent higher-risk conditions; if CAC is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; if CAC is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy.

### Combination therapy for elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: the key to coronary artery disease risk reduction [^28cc8040]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Lowering elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is a key management principle in reducing the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). An aggressive approach to CAD risk reduction requires multiple therapeutic strategies, as no single approach is likely to succeed independently. The use of combination therapy for elevated LDL cholesterol is effective for CAD risk reduction. In fact, the majority of patients with CAD are unlikely to achieve their treatment goals with monotherapy. This article reviews the use of combination therapy for the management of elevated LDL cholesterol, highlighting important therapy considerations.

3 GOALS VS THRESHOLD FOR TREATMENT

3.1 General comments

For patients with ACS, the European guideline recommends a LDL‐C goal of < 55 mg/dL and a LDL‐C reduction by 50% (class I) to guide therapy, whereas the American guideline recommends a high‐intensity statin to achieve a 50% reduction in LDL‐C and a threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL for treatment intensification (Table 1). 1 The approach with goals aims to reduce risks by lowering LDL‐C to levels achieved in large clinical trials, whereas the approach with threshold aims to reduce risks by lowering further LDL‐C when the LDL‐C values are above criteria used in nonstatin trials. 1, 2 Threshold has been evaluated in many randomized clinical trials, with the baseline LDL‐C level predefined by the protocol inclusion criterion. Treatment goals have rarely been studied in randomized trials; therefore, the evidence is weaker and mostly based on postrandomization data (inference based on achieved LDL‐C levels by assigned treatment). The hazards of drawing medical decision from postrandomization data are still a matter of debate, although the data show consistent benefits of reducing LDL‐C below guideline recommendations. 13, 15

3.2 American perspectives

In secondary prevention of patients at very high‐risk for ASCVD, the initiation or continuation of high‐intensity statin is recommended to achieve an LDL‐C reduction of ≥ 50%. 1 If LDL‐C levels remain above the threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL despite maximally tolerated therapy, the guideline recommends adding a nonstatin agent. If the LDL‐C is already < 70 mg/dL, the continuation of the maximally tolerated therapy is recommended with monitoring of LDL‐C. The concept of threshold utilizes an adaptive strategy (ie, addition of nonstatin agent) only if the treatment effect observed with a standard therapy is not satisfactory (eg, LDL‐C levels on maximally tolerated statin still above the threshold). Therefore, once the LDL‐C is below the threshold of 70 mg/dL, the exact value of LDL‐C does not influence further modification of LDL‐lowering therapy (eg, having a value of 30 mg/dL is managed the same as a value of 68 mg/dL).

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^4c46c8d5]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Add-on lipid-lowering therapy with statins — evidence context and panel consensus indicates that lowering atherogenic cholesterol to levels below 70 mg/dL is beneficial, yet major randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of add-on therapy enrolled patients with already low LDL-C before intensification (AIM-HIGH mean LDL-C level < 70 mg/dL; HPS2-THRIVE approximately 64 mg/dL; ACCORD ∼100 mg/dL). The NLA Expert Panel consensus view was that, until RCT data better define benefits and risks in patients whose atherogenic cholesterol remains elevated on the highest tolerated statin dose, consideration may be given to use of combination therapy with agents that further lower non–HDL-C and LDL-C to achieve goal levels, and the recommendation also extends to use of nonstatin drug therapies, alone or in combination, for patients with contraindications or intolerance to statins.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) — screening and statin initiation criteria span childhood to older adulthood: screening can be performed with fasting or nonfasting measurement of lipids. In children, adolescents (10 to 19 years of age), and young adults (20 to 39 years of age), priority should be given to estimation of lifetime risk and promotion of lifestyle risk reduction, and Drug therapy is needed only in selected patients with moderately high LDL-C levels (≥ 160 mg/dL [≥ 4.1 mmol/L]) or patients with very high LDL-C levels (190 mg/dL [4.9 mmol/L]). Three major higher-risk categories are patients with severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C levels ≥ 190 mg/dL [≥ 4.9 mmol/L]), adults 20 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus, and adults 40 to 75 years of age, and Patients with severe hypercholesterolemia and adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus are candidates for immediate statin therapy without further risk assessment. In other adults 40 to 75 years of age, 10-year ASCVD risk should guide therapeutic considerations; when risk is uncertain, it can be helpful to measure coronary artery calcium (CAC), and a CAC score equal to 0 is useful for reclassifying patients to a lower-risk group, often allowing statin therapy to be withheld or postponed unless higher risk conditions are present. For patients > 75 years of age, RCT evidence for statin therapy is not strong, so clinical assessment of risk status in a clinician–patient risk discussion is needed for deciding whether to continue or initiate statin treatment.

### Combination therapy with statins: who benefits? [^d001222e]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Many lipid-lowering drugs improve cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. However, when therapies have been studied in addition to statins, it has been challenging to show an additional clinical benefit in terms of CV event reduction, although overall safety seems acceptable. This debate has been complicated by recent guidelines that emphasize treatment with high-potency statin monotherapy. Combination therapy allows more patients to successfully reach their ideal lipid targets. Further testing of novel therapies may introduce an era of potent low-density lipoprotein decrease without dependence on statins, but until then, they remain the mainstay of therapy.

Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Evidence from meta‐analyses and well‐controlled randomized trials of statin therapy show that reducing LDL‐C is associated with a significant reduction in risk of CV events and mortality. 1, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 Despite the availability of statins and other LLTs, many patients with hypercholesterolemia and high CV risk are not achieving LDL‐C levels < 100 mg/dL or < 70 mg/dL. 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11

In clinical practice, patients tend to be initiated on low‐ to moderate‐intensity statin therapy (a daily dose that provides an approximate < 30% to 30% to 50% LDL‐C reduction, respectively), with up‐titration or switching to a higher‐intensity statin regimen (a daily dose that provides an approximate ≥ 50% LDL‐C reduction) as necessary for individuals not achieving LDL‐C targets or the expected therapeutic response from the initial dose of statin. 12, 13

Adults with high blood cholesterol — risk enhancers and coronary artery calcium (CAC) to guide statin therapy are outlined as follows: In intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy.

3.3 European perspectives

In secondary prevention of very high‐risk patients, an LDL‐C reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline and an LDL‐C goal < 55 mg/dL are both recommended (class I, level A). A reduction in LDL‐C by 50% from baseline with high‐intensity statin is a first common step in both guidelines. However, European guideline recommends intensifying lipid‐lowering treatment even in patients who achieve on LDL‐C < 70 mg/dL, whereas the addition of nonstatin agent is recommended in the US guideline only for those above the threshold ≥ 70 mg/dL. In the European guidelines, patients with ASCVD who experienced a second vascular event within 2 years while taking maximally statin therapy, an LDL‐C goal of < 40 mg/dL (< 1 mmol/L) may be considered (class IIb, level B). Compared to the US guideline, the European guideline supports even lower LDL‐C goals with further intensification of therapy in patients with a recurrent ASCVD event with an LDL‐C of 55 to 70 mg/dL. The concept of goals implies that therapeutic options will be added sequentially to achieve a specific recommended LDL‐C level.

### Efficacy and safety of alirocumab as add-on therapy in high-cardiovascular-risk patients with hypercholesterolemia not adequately controlled with atorvastatin (20 or 40 mg) or rosuvastatin (10 or 20 mg): design and rationale of the ODYSSEY OPTIONS studies [^383b12bd]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Alirocumab (formerly REGN727/SAR236553; Sanofi‐Regeneron) is a fully human monoclonal antibody currently in phase 3 development for LDL‐C lowering. In phase 2 trials in patients receiving concomitant statin or statin + ezetimibe therapy (NCT01288443, NCT01266876, and NCT01288469), alirocumab significantly reduced mean LDL‐C levels by up to 72.4% and also reduced levels of apolipoprotein B, total cholesterol, non–high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (non–HDL‐C), lipoprotein(a), and triglycerides (TG), and moderately increased HDL‐C and apolipoprotein A‐1 levels. 15, 16, 17 The most common treatment‐emergent adverse event (TEAE; defined as an adverse event (AE) occurring in the time period from first study treatment dosing to 70 days following the last study treatment dosing) in phase 2 trials was injection‐site reaction, which was generally of mild intensity and short duration. 15, 16, 17

The OPTIONS I and II studies (NCT01730040 and NCT01730053, respectively) will compare the lipid‐lowering efficacy and safety of alirocumab with various therapeutic choices in patients at high CV risk on atorvastatin 20 mg or 40 mg daily or rosuvastatin 10 mg or 20 mg daily and who had LDL‐C levels above prespecified levels of ≥ 70 mg/dL or ≥ 100 mg/dL. The OPTIONS studies are part of the 14‐study ODYSSEY alirocumab phase 3 program that includes more than 23 500 patients in > 2000 centers globally; this also comprises a large CV outcomes trial evaluating the long‐term impact of alirocumab and lower levels of LDL‐C on the occurrence of CV events in 18 000 patients after a recent (< 52 weeks) acute coronary syndrome event. Here we describe the OPTIONS I and II study designs and discuss how these studies may inform clinical management.

### 2019 ESC / EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias: lipid modification to reduce cardiovascular risk [^1e324a06]. European Heart Journal (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertriglyceridemia, more specifically with respect to fibrates, EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend to consider adding fenofibrate or bezafibrate to statins for primary prevention in patients with triglyceride levels of > 2.3 mmol/L (> 200 mg/dL) achieved LDL-C goal.

### A modern approach to dyslipidemia [^721f8dda]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

A practical approach to elevated cholesterol.

For most individuals, measuring a nonfasting standard lipid profile is the screening test of choice (Fig. 3). If TGs are elevated > 4.5 mmol/L (> 400 mg/dL), repeating the level fasting is advised. Before deciding on treatment course, secondary causes should be ruled out.

Figure 3.
Approach to the patient with high LDL-C.

Treatment with the maximally tolerated dose of a high intensity statin (ie, rosuvastatin or atorvastatin) is recommended as first-line treatment for anyone meeting the following characteristics: (1) LDL-C > 5.0 mmol/L (194 mg/dL) (> 95th percentile) regardless of ASCVD risk; (2) those at high ASCVD risk based on a validated risk calculator; (3) those with known clinical ASCVD; (4) those with statin-indicated conditions, including diabetes, renal impairment, or abdominal aortic aneurysm; (and 5) LDL-C > 3.5 mmol/L (> 135 mg/dL) and intermediate ASCVD risk based on a validated risk calculator.

For patients whose LDL-C levels do not warrant treatment, or if LDL-C cannot be accurately assessed because of high TG levels, alternative thresholds for clinical action based on apo B or non-HDL-C levels may be used instead, as discussed previously. These alternative measurements may also be used to help guide decisions on treatment intensification.

For those who exceed their threshold or target on maximally tolerated statin, adding additional agents, either ezetimibe in primary prevention or when LDL-C levels that are close to target, or PCSK9 inhibitors in those at higher risk or who require greater LDL-C lowering, should be considered. The general principle of managing cholesterol is that "lower is better", with no negative effects seen with even the lowest values of LDL-C obtained from clinical trials. Therefore, there is no need to deintensify treatment in those who attain very low LDL-C levels. An approach to the patient with intolerance to statins is discussed later.

### Rationale for targeting multiple lipid pathways for optimal cardiovascular risk reduction [^33b347dd]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical trials of statin therapy have consistently demonstrated significant reductions in coronary artery disease (CAD) events, yet statin-treated patients remain at risk for CAD despite substantial reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Recent evidence from clinical trials supports reduction of LDL cholesterol to lower targets, and the updated treatment guidelines include optional, more aggressive LDL cholesterol goals for patients at very high and moderately high risk. Achievement of these lower goals will require enhanced treatment strategies. Targeting multiple lipid pathways can provide greater reductions in LDL cholesterol as well as improvements in other lipid parameters. Clinical trials are needed to determine which treatment strategies provide optimal cardiovascular risk reduction.
