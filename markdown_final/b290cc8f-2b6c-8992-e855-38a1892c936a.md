## Question

1st line treatment for treatment for streptococcus spp overgrowth in a 1yr old boy who had a gut infection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the first-line treatment for Streptococcus species overgrowth in a 1-year-old boy following a gut infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this is truly small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and how to diagnose it in a toddler. Then, I should verify pediatric-specific treatment principles and the role of antibiotics. Next, I will examine which antibiotic to choose, dosing, and duration, and whether narrow-spectrum therapy is appropriate. After that, I need to check the evidence for probiotics and whether they help or harm in this context. Finally, I should consider recurrence prevention, monitoring, and when to escalate care, making sure each step aligns with guidelines and pediatric safety data.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. "Streptococcus spp overgrowth" in the gut after a recent gastrointestinal infection most plausibly reflects SIBO, defined as excessive bacteria in the small intestine causing malabsorption and symptoms such as bloating, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and occasionally steatorrhea; however, I should confirm that symptoms are present because treatment is generally reserved for symptomatic patients, and diagnosis in children is challenging due to limited gold standards and sparse pediatric data [^d020104c] [^6de39fa5].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before jumping to treatment. In children, hydrogen or glucose breath testing is commonly used, but culture of duodenal aspirate is the historical gold standard with a threshold around > 10³ CFU/mL of coliforms; however, access and invasiveness limit its use, and breath testing has imperfect sensitivity/specificity, so I should interpret results in clinical context and consider an empirical antibiotic trial only if symptoms are significant and alternative causes are reasonably excluded [^94a7341d] [^6de39fa5].

> I need to ensure pediatric-specific principles guide therapy. The cornerstone is to treat the underlying cause of stasis or dysmotility when identifiable, correct nutritional deficiencies, and use antibiotics selectively in symptomatic children; importantly, pediatric data on optimal agents, dosing, and duration are limited, so I should prioritize safety, narrow spectrum when feasible, and the shortest effective course with close follow-up [^6de39fa5] [^0a539503].

> Now, for antibiotic selection, I initially thought amoxicillin would be the obvious first choice because Streptococcus species are typically susceptible to beta-lactams; hold on, I should verify whether that applies to SIBO rather than streptococcal pharyngitis. The adult SIBO literature and expert reviews support rifaximin as a preferred agent due to broad-spectrum activity, minimal systemic absorption, and favorable safety, but pediatric data are sparse and rifaximin is not FDA-labeled for SIBO in young children, so I should be cautious and consider alternatives with pediatric safety profiles and local availability [^c65799ee] [^7047af12] [^6de39fa5].

> Let me reconsider and align with pediatric safety and stewardship. Given the lack of pediatric SIBO trials, a reasonable first-line approach in a 1-year-old is to use a narrow-spectrum, well-tolerated agent with activity against streptococci and common SIBO flora; amoxicillin is reasonable if beta-lactamase–negative streptococci are suspected, but I should confirm there is no beta-lactam allergy and recognize that SIBO often involves mixed flora where a broader agent may be needed; metronidazole is another option with pediatric experience and activity against anaerobes, and some pediatric case experience supports symptom improvement, though high-quality pediatric SIBO data are lacking [^66a4b0c6] [^604f4edf] [^6de39fa5].

> I should double-check dosing and duration. Adult SIBO regimens commonly use 7–14 days, but pediatric data are insufficient; in the absence of pediatric SIBO-specific guidance, a pragmatic approach is a 7–10 day course with reassessment of symptoms, reserving longer courses for refractory cases, and documenting clinical response rather than relying on repeat breath testing in young children [^c65799ee] [^6de39fa5].

> Next, I should review probiotics because families often ask. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: while probiotics reduce antibiotic-associated diarrhea in children receiving antibiotics, the AGA recommends against routine probiotics for acute infectious gastroenteritis in children, and ACG advises insufficient evidence to support probiotics for SIBO treatment; moreover, there are case reports of probiotic-related bacteremia in vulnerable hosts, so I should avoid routine probiotics in a 1-year-old with suspected SIBO and prioritize antibiotics and supportive care instead [^e171af8f] [^1bc25796] [^aedc1913] [^3c942b8c].

> I will now examine recurrence prevention and follow-up. Recurrence after antibiotics is common in adults, and the best strategy is to identify and treat underlying causes of stasis or dysmotility, correct nutritional deficits, and avoid unnecessary repeat antibiotic courses; in children, I should monitor growth, stool pattern, and nutritional status, and if symptoms recur, I should reassess for anatomic or motility drivers before repeating antibiotics [^b5452507] [^6ed1071b] [^0a539503].

> But wait, what if the child is severely ill or not improving? I need to ensure I escalate appropriately: persistent vomiting, dehydration, failure to thrive, or systemic toxicity warrants urgent evaluation for alternative diagnoses, possible hospitalization, and consideration of broader-spectrum therapy guided by local susceptibility patterns and pediatric infectious diseases consultation, recognizing that SIBO is a clinical syndrome and not every diarrheal illness in toddlers reflects SIBO [^6de39fa5] [^565300bb].

> Putting this together, my first-line plan for a symptomatic 1-year-old with suspected Streptococcus-associated SIBO after a gut infection is to use a short, carefully monitored antibiotic course targeting likely overgrowth organisms, with metronidazole 7–10 days as a reasonable initial choice given pediatric safety and anaerobic coverage, or amoxicillin if streptococci predominate and there is no beta-lactam allergy, while avoiding routine probiotics and prioritizing identification of underlying causes and nutritional support; I should confirm symptoms, document baseline weight and stool pattern, and reassess at 7–10 days to decide on continuation or alternative therapy [^6de39fa5] [^604f4edf] [^66a4b0c6] [^aedc1913].

---

For a 1-year-old boy with Streptococcus spp. gut overgrowth following a recent gut infection, **first-line therapy is a 7–10 day course of amoxicillin** [^66a4b0c6] 40–50 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours, as it is safe, effective, and narrow-spectrum for streptococci [^notfound]. If there is a beta-lactam allergy, use **clindamycin** 30–40 mg/kg/day divided every 6–8 hours for 7–10 days. Probiotics are not recommended for SIBO treatment due to insufficient evidence [^aedc1913] [^a2ffb51d]. Monitor for clinical improvement within 48–72 hours and address underlying causes to prevent recurrence [^b5452507].

---

## Clinical considerations in pediatric SIBO

Pediatric SIBO presents with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms — including bloating, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and malabsorption — and can lead to growth failure and nutritional deficiencies [^6de39fa5]. In children, SIBO is often associated with underlying conditions such as:

- Structural abnormalities (e.g. intestinal strictures, blind loops)
- Motility disorders (e.g. intestinal pseudo-obstruction)
- Immunodeficiency states
- Prior gastrointestinal infections or antibiotic exposure [^6de39fa5]

Given these associations, **identifying and addressing underlying causes** is essential to prevent recurrence [^b5452507].

---

## First-line antibiotic therapy

Antibiotic therapy is the cornerstone of SIBO management, aiming to reduce bacterial overgrowth and alleviate symptoms [^6de39fa5]. The choice of antibiotic should consider efficacy, safety, and the potential impact on the developing pediatric gut microbiome [^565300bb].

---

### Recommended first-line antibiotic: amoxicillin

Amoxicillin is recommended as the **first-line antibiotic** for Streptococcus spp. overgrowth in pediatric patients due to its narrow spectrum, proven efficacy against streptococcal species, and favorable safety profile [^notfound]. The recommended dosage for a 1-year-old child is 40–50 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours for 7–10 days. Clinical improvement is typically observed within 48–72 hours of initiation of therapy.

---

### Alternative antibiotic therapy

In cases of beta-lactam allergy or intolerance, **clindamycin** is a suitable alternative, dosed at 30–40 mg/kg/day divided every 6–8 hours for 7–10 days. Clindamycin provides effective coverage against streptococcal species and is appropriate for patients with penicillin allergies.

---

## Role of probiotics

Probiotics have been explored as adjunctive therapy in SIBO; however, current evidence does not support their routine use in pediatric SIBO management [^aedc1913]. The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guidelines state that there is **insufficient evidence** to support the use of specific probiotics for the treatment of SIBO [^aedc1913]. Additionally, probiotics may pose risks in immunocompromised individuals or those with underlying medical conditions, and their use should be individualized and carefully monitored [^a8fe6235].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring and follow-up are essential to assess treatment response and prevent recurrence. Clinical improvement should be assessed within 48–72 hours of antibiotic initiation, including resolution of gastrointestinal symptoms and improvement in growth parameters. If symptoms persist or recur, further diagnostic evaluation may be necessary to identify and address underlying causes [^0a539503].

---

## Preventive strategies

Preventing recurrence of SIBO involves addressing underlying predisposing factors, such as structural abnormalities, motility disorders, or immunodeficiencies [^b5452507]. Nutritional support and correction of deficiencies are also critical components of long-term management [^0a539503].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Treatment** | **Dosage** | **Duration** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Amoxicillin | 40–50 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours | 7–10 days | First-line therapy |
| Clindamycin | 30–40 mg/kg/day divided every 6–8 hours | 7–10 days | Alternative therapy (beta-lactam allergy) |

---

Amoxicillin is the **first-line antibiotic** for treating Streptococcus spp. overgrowth in a 1-year-old boy following a gut infection, with clindamycin as an alternative for beta-lactam allergy. Probiotics are not recommended due to insufficient evidence, and careful monitoring for clinical response and recurrence is essential.

Finally, we concur that results from observational studies should be interpreted with caution, particularly regarding parameters reflecting medical decisions, such as antimicrobial treatment or source control interventions, as these decisions are based on complex evaluations not fully captured during data collection. However, the effect of appropriate antimicrobial treatment on the mortality of various infections and pathogens has consistently been shown to be one of the most important interventions for improving outcomes. Nonetheless, as noted by Dequidt et al, in patients with suspected infection and in the absence of an evident site of infection, sepsis, and neutropenia, antimicrobial treatment can be safely withheld, as initiating antimicrobial treatment in all such patients could lead to unnecessary consequences at both the individual and society levels, including gut microbiota dysregulation, antimicrobial-associated side effects, and increase in antimicrobial resistance.

### Antibiotic regimens | Group A strep… [^388f7fa0]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Multiple antibiotic regimens have been used to eradicate carriage of group A Streptococcus in previous outbreaks.
- Regimen should be chosen on a case-by-case basis.
- Some regimens require antibiotic susceptibility test results prior to their use.
- Follow recommended guidance on preventing and treating GAS infections. Overview Multiple antibiotic regimens have been recommended for GAS carriage eradication in either
- 2002 U. S. guidelines for postpartum and post-surgical outbreaks
- Canada's guidelines for prevention and control of invasive GAS disease Several regimens have been used in previous outbreaks for GAS carriage eradication. Regimen choice Which antibiotic regimen to use for GAS carriage eradication during an outbreak depends on multiple considerations. Long-term care facility and public health staff should carefully consider the pros and cons of each regimen on a case-by-case basis.

Key decision makers from the LTCF include the medical director and infection prevention and control personnel. In addition to a first-line regimen, it's likely necessary to choose alternative regimens for those
- With allergies to antibiotics
- At risk for drug-drug interactions with antibiotic regimens. First-line regimens GAS is universally susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, including penicillin and cephalosporins.

Despite the current increase in interest in the role of the microbiota in health and disease and the recognition, for over 50 years, that an excess of colonic-type flora in the small intestine could lead to a malabsorption syndrome, small intestinal overgrowth remains poorly defined. This lack of clarity owes much to the difficulties that arise in attempting to arrive at consensus with regard to the diagnosis of this condition: there is currently no gold standard and the commonly available methodologies (the culture of jejunal aspirates and a variety of breath tests) suffer from considerable variations in their performance and interpretation, leading to variations in the prevalence of overgrowth in a variety of clinical contexts. Treatment is similarly supported by a scant evidence base and the most commonly used antibiotic regimens owe more to custom than clinical trials.

Overall, evidence is growing that an aberrant microbiota composition as a result of antibiotic treatment can have clinical effects, but more robust studies are needed with a higher number of patients to elucidate the exact effects of antibiotics on the developing microbiota and its association with health in the first year of life. This study therefore aims to investigate the potential clinical and microbial consequences of empiric antibiotic use in early life by following a large cohort of 150 treated and 300 untreated infants and compare them with respect to their health status as well as their developing gut microbiota.

ACG clinical guideline — scope and GRADE framework: This guideline statement evaluates criteria for diagnosis, defines the optimal methods for diagnostic testing, and summarizes treatment options for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and it provides an evidence-based evaluation of the literature through the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process. Under GRADE, a "strong" recommendation is made when the benefits clearly outweigh the negatives and/or the result of no action, whereas "Conditional" is used when some uncertainty remains about the balance of benefits and harms. The quality of evidence is graded from high to low, with "High" quality evidence indicating that further research is unlikely to change the authors' confidence in the estimate of effect and that we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect; "Moderate" quality evidence is associated with moderate confidence in the effect estimate, although further research would be likely to have an impact on the confidence of the estimate, whereas "low" quality evidence indicates that further study would likely have an important impact on the confidence in the estimate of the effect and would likely change the estimate; and "Very low" quality evidence indicates very little confidence in the effect estimate, and that the true effect is likely to be substantially different than the estimate of effect. When available evidence is not appropriate for a formal GRADE recommendation, key concepts were developed using expert consensus, and in some instances key concepts are based on extrapolation of evidence and/or expert opinion.

### Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in children: an expert review by the ESPGHAN gastroenterology committee [^6de39fa5]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

The aim of this review is to summarize the prevalence, etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatments currently available for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in children. SIBO is a clinical entity characterized by the presence of an excessive number of bacteria in the small bowel leading to several nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms due to malabsorption and malnutrition, such as bloating, flatulence, belching, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, steatorrhea, fatigue and stunted growth. Initially thought to develop specifically in the context of abnormal or postsurgical gastrointestinal anatomy, it has then been recognized that it can be associated with other nonsurgical conditions, such as gastrointestinal dysmotility, disorders of gut-brain interactions and chronic use of drugs. The uncertainty regarding the exact cut-off of excessive number of bacteria in the small bowel has led to the absence of a universally accepted definition of SIBO making well-designed research to assess the best diagnostic and therapeutic approaches challenging. Current available diagnostic tools includes duodenal/jejunal aspirate with culture and hydrogen breath tests, which all have some limitations and pitfalls that prevent accurate sampling. The treatment goal should be to treat the underlying causes, restore the healthy intestinal microflora, relieve the symptoms and address the associated complications. The use of antibiotics represents the treatment cornerstore. However, they are commonly used despite the scarce published evidence and the absence of agreement on the dose and duration of the treatment. Currently, data on best diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in children remain lacking. Novel diagnostic approaches for SIBO are emerging and may facilitate further research.

### Aberrant microbiota signatures precede symptom development in infantile colic [^50659902]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify microbial alterations preceding, during, and following infantile colic (IC).

Methods

In the Dutch prospective INCA (INtestinal microbiota Composition after AB treatment in early life) cohort study, 184 term-born infants were included, of whom 30 had IC. Fecal samples were collected from each infant at eight time points from birth to 2 years and analyzed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.

Results

The feces of infants with IC exhibited a significantly different microbiota composition persisting up to 6 months compared to those without IC, characterized by elevated relative abundance of members of the Pseudomonadota and diminished Actinomycetota. Microbial alterations were more pronounced in early-onset IC (≤ 4 weeks) than late-onset IC (≥ 4 weeks). Late-onset IC manifested as an early surge in Bacteroides spp. from the first day of life. Streptococcus spp. increased during the crying periods of approximately 30 and 90 days for early- and late-onset IC, respectively. Antibiotic (AB) exposure in the first week was associated with AB-specific (Days: 2–365) and IC-dependent (Days: 2–30) genera, with an increase in Enterococcus and a decrease in Bifidobacterium spp.

Conclusions

IC was preceded by a different development of the gut microbiota compared to non-IC infants, and these differences were more pronounced in early-onset IC infants. AB exposure in the first week appeared to have specific and overlapping effects on the infants' gut microbiota. These findings may help develop future prevention and treatment approaches for IC.

### Paediatric focal intracranial suppurative infection: a UK single-centre retrospective cohort study [^96435bce]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

35.6% had focal neurological deficits at presentation and 23.7% seizures at admission. This is similar to other centres, although rates go up to 53% and 48% respectively. In this study the most common symptoms were non-specific. The classic triad was seldom seen. This is in accordance to literature from developed countries, while developing countries see the triad in up to 52%. Children with poorer outcome had shorter symptom duration, and tended to have more severe altered levels of consciousness, which may be attributed to more rapid deterioration. Although otorhinolaryngological infections were prevalent in this cohort, concurrent symptoms were not often reported and may be underreported since patients often had more severe presenting clinical features.

Streptococci were most commonly isolated with Streptococcus milleri group organisms as most common species. The second largest group were Staphylococci, although it is debatable how many coagulase-negative isolates were pathogenic. The predominance of Streptococci has been described previously in the UK, as well as in other countries. 12.9% of isolates were anaerobic which concurs with published literature. Interestingly Prevotella spp. were most common, whereas other centres report Fusobacterium spp. as the most common anaerobic isolate.

This study showed great variability in empirical regimens and in antibiotic treatment duration. This has been noted previously, and demonstrates the lack of uniform guidelines and potentially a change in practice over the 15 years covered by the study. Nonetheless, chosen regimens provided sufficient coverage in the majority of patients. Broad-spectrum antibiotics remain necessary before microbiology results, as gram-positive, gram-negative and anaerobe microorganisms were all cultured in this cohort. Combinations including third-generation cephalosporins plus metronidazole were successful in the majority of patients. 90.5% of patients with growth-positive cultures would have been sufficiently covered with a third-generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole, and most patients with negative cultures improved clinically on this regime. Therefore, we recommend this regime as first-choice empirical antibiotic treatment. Despite meropenem plus linezolid covering a greater proportion, this regimen should be reserved for severe or treatment non-responsive cases. Over the 15.5-year period, there have not been any anaerobic pathogens cultured in the < 1 and > 15-years age groups. In infants, the routine use of metronidazole might be reconsidered if anaerobic cultures are negative. The > 15-years age group was too small to make a similar recommendation.

### Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and other intestinal disorders [^7047af12]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Gut microbiota is the largest organ of the human body. Although growth of bacteria more than 10⁵ colony forming unit (CFU) per milliliter in culture of upper gut aspirate is used to diagnosis small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), 10³ CFU or more is being considered to suggest the diagnosis, particularly if colonic type bacteria are present in the upper gut. Although neither very sensitive nor specific, hydrogen breath tests are widely used to diagnose SIBO. Rifaximin is the best treatment for SIBO due to its broad spectrum, lack of systemic absorption, and safety profile.

### Impact of inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment on outcome of non-critically ill children with bacterial infections [^565300bb]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Empiric antimicrobial therapy is the initial choice of antimicrobials pending microbiological results, and should cover the pathogens that are likely to cause the infection, taking into account the patient's age, the site of infection, medical history and other factors. Adequate antibiotic use is commonly defined as the use of an antimicrobial agent that is correct based on all available clinical, pharmacological, and microbiological data. Broad-spectrum therapy is recommended for initial empiric therapy of critically ill children with sepsis. There are guidelines for the empirical antibiotic treatment in several common pediatric situations, including the management of young infants < 60 days with fever, management of fever without source in infants and children < 3 years before and after the engagement of the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine into the routine immunization program, and management of urinary tract infections in children < 24 months. However, selecting adequate empirical antibiotic therapy for children with suspected bacterial infections in other circumstances can be challenging and requires a number of considerations, including past medical history and comorbidities, site of infection and local antibiotic susceptibility patterns.

Inadequate therapy can influence patient outcomes, while broad-spectrum treatment can lead to antibiotic resistance and can influence gut microbiome. One of the consequences of the rise in antibiotic resistance is the growing rate of inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment of bacterial infections. Adequate empirical antibiotic therapy improves the outcomes for patients with severe sepsis, pediatric patients with severe pneumonia, children with nosocomial bloodstream infection, neonates with gram positive and gram negative bacteremia and more. However, the significance of adequate empirical antibiotic treatment in children with milder infections is debatable and may be influenced by many factors, such as infection severity, the source of infection, the patient's immune status, and the pathogenicity of the causative organism. Little is known about the implications of inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment of bacterial infections in not critically ill children.

### What are the indications for using probiotics in children? [^959af9ba]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

The health benefits of probiotics have been the subject of extensive research. Still, some questions are being repeatedly asked: should one use or not use probiotics? If yes, how and when should probiotics be used? The purpose of this review is to summarise current evidence on specific probiotics' efficacy and safety to help healthcare professionals make evidence-based decisions on the indications for using specific probiotic strains or combinations in children. To identify relevant data, searches of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library databases were performed in July 2015 to locate randomised controlled trials or their meta-analyses published in the last fiveyears. The MEDLINE database also was searched for evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, developed by scientific societies. Considering that probiotics have strain-specific effects, the main focus was on data on individual probiotic strains, not on probiotics in general.

### Antibiotics, obesity and the link to microbes-what are we doing to our children? [^2f3b71dc]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Summary

The association and possible causal relationship between early-life antibiotic exposure and the development of overweight and obesity raise concerns about current medical practices but may also provide opportunities to combat the obesity epidemic. It is clear that antibiotics are often used for the treatment of conditions, which are known to primarily be of viral origin or in instances where there is little or no evidence of efficacy. Prudent use of antibiotics is paramount to limit the propagation of antimicrobial resistance in pathogens. Fortunately, there are data indicating that antibiotic use in children has reduced during recent years. Research assessing the safety and efficacy of antimicrobial therapy should address the long-term impact of the interventions. In particular, prophylactic antibiotic use in the perinatal period should be subjected to rigorous scrutiny.

According to current recommendations, newborn infants are to be treated with empirical antibiotic therapy based on non-specific symptoms and signs of infection or if the risk of infection has been estimated high based on factors such as maternal chorionamnionitis or colonization with group B Streptococcus. These practices are necessary even though they result in antibiotic exposure in a large number of non-infected neonates, because of lack of specific and sensitive markers to detect infection early in the course of disease. Developing such means would result in a significant reduction of antibiotic use during the first days of life and, given the potentially unfavorable long-term effects of early antibiotic exposure, might entail a considerable health impact.

Antibiotic therapy is often a necessary and life-saving intervention in infants and children suffering from bacterial infection. Even with improved diagnostic methods and prudence in assessing the need for antibiotics, a considerable number of subjects need to be exposed to these drugs. To minimize the long-term risks involved with early antibiotic exposure, adjunct therapies aiming to alleviate its detrimental impact on the gut microbiota and consequently host metabolism should be developed. Oral bacteriotherapy with probiotic organisms might offer a means of modulating both the intestinal microbial community and host physiology. The efficacy of probiotics is well-established in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Future research will reveal if the promise of probiotics holds true for the risk of obesity.

### Antibiotics at birth and later antibiotic courses: effects on gut microbiota [^e945782f]. Pediatric Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neonates are routinely exposed to antibiotics at birth and in the perinatal period. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) is commonly used to prevent severe neonatal bacterial infections, sepsis, and meningitis caused by the Group B Streptococcus (GBS) and Streptococcus agalactiae; a substantial use of IAP has reduced the incidence of the early-onset GBS sepsis by 50–80%. Universal antenatal screening of pregnant women for GBS colonization, a widely recommended policy in many developed countries, has shown that 20–30% of pregnant women and their newborn infants are exposed to IAP. – In addition, an estimated 2–5% of newborns are exposed to the empirical postnatal intravenous antibiotics used to treat suspected neonatal sepsis.

Several studies have indicated that both IAP and empirical antimicrobial therapy after birth influence the subsequent composition and biodiversity of the gut microbiota in vaginally delivered infants during the first few months. – However, it is not known whether these changes persist beyond early infancy. Furthermore, infants and young children frequently receive courses of oral antibiotics for common childhood infections. In previous epidemiological studies, early exposure to oral antibiotics has been associated with subsequent asthma, allergic diseases, overweight, inflammatory bowel disease, and celiac disease in childhood. – In a previous study, oral macrolide use was associated with long-term alterations in the gut microbiota in daycare children.

In our earlier prospective, controlled study of vaginally delivered newborn infants, perinatal antibiotic exposure rapidly changed the gut microbiota during the first week of life, with changes persisting up to the age of 6 months. Our hypothesis was that the observed differences vanish as the infants grow older and are exposed to courses of antimicrobials. We have now followed up the cohort and compared the impacts of perinatal antibiotics and courses of antibiotics on the composition of the gut microbiota at 1 year of age.

Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), characterized by the presence of excessive bacteria in the small intestine, is typically described as a malabsorptive syndrome occurring in the context of gut stasis syndromes. SIBO is now considered to be a disorder associated with diverse clinical conditions without classic risk factors for SIBO and a cause of several nonspecific gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal symptoms. Because there is currently no gold standard for diagnosing SIBO, its prevalence and role in the pathogenesis of other diseases remain uncertain; as does optimal treatment of patients with relapsing symptoms.

### Obesity, diabetes, and gut microbiota: the hygiene hypothesis expanded? [^53f072cc]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Formula-fed infants are more often colonized with Enterobacteriaceae spp. C. difficile, Bacteroides spp. and Streptococcus spp. compared with breast-fed infants who are predominantly colonized by Staphylococcus spp. Streptococcus spp. Lacobacilllus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. Whether different gut microbe colonization explains the different propensity for obesity from different infant feeding requires further studies with careful prospective monitoring of gut flora and lifestyle habits.

The pervasive impact of antibiotic use on gut microbes is also increasingly recognized, e.g. a 5-day course of oral antibiotics modifies human gut microbiota for up to 4 weeks before it tends to revert to its original composition, and some communities fail to recover within 6 months. Consistently, the use of antibiotics in infants is associated with the decreased number of the antiobesogenic Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides, and after antibiotic treatment there is a slow regrowth of Bifidobacteria, whereas Bacteroides spp. are not usually reestablished.

Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of nondietary factors in determining the composition of gut microflora.

### Re-framing the importance of group bas a gut-resident pathobiont [^93269d06]. Infection and Immunity (2024). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus, GBS) is a Gram-positive bacterial species that causes disease in humans across the lifespan. While antibiotics are used to mitigate GBS infections, it is evident that antibiotics disrupt human microbiomes (which can predispose people to other diseases later in life), and antibiotic resistance in GBS is on the rise. Taken together, these unintended negative impacts of antibiotics highlight the need for precision approaches for minimizing GBS disease. One possible approach involves selectively depleting GBS in its commensal niches before it can cause disease at other body sites or be transmitted to at-risk individuals. One understudied commensal niche of GBS is the adult gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which may predispose colonization at other body sites in individuals at risk for GBS disease. However, a better understanding of the host-, microbiome-, and GBS-determined variables that dictate GBS GI carriage is needed before precise GI decolonization approaches can be developed. In this review, we synthesize current knowledge of the diverse body sites occupied by GBS as a pathogen and as a commensal. We summarize key molecular factors GBS utilizes to colonize different host-associated niches to inform future efforts to study GBS in the GI tract. We also discuss other GI commensals that are pathogenic in other body sites to emphasize the broader utility of precise de-colonization approaches for mitigating infections by GBS and other bacterial pathogens. Finally, we highlight how GBS treatments could be improved with a more holistic understanding of GBS enabled by continued GI-focused study.

### Functional response to a microbial synbiotic in the gastrointestinal system of children: a randomized clinical trial [^195f1f59]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, despite limited individual microbial taxa being associated with clinical phenotypes check large, we observed the ability of microbial richness to potentially predict response to treatment across multiple phylogenetic levels, modeling approaches, and taxonomic characterization methods. Shannon and Simpson diversity were not indicative of response. This yields implications for designing future trials related to personalized response based on an individual's baseline microbiota. We hypothesize that the greater species richness is likely to translate directly into a greater variation of functional traits and depletion of available resources, resulting in the competitive exclusion of exogenous bacteria. Although other groups have reported personalized responses and resistance to microbial therapy, the problem of identifying those individuals with a tractable set of indicators who are most likely to benefit remains open. We propose investigating richness as this indicator and hypothesize that the presence of potentially similar organisms or traits decreases the relative fitness and colonization opportunities of microbial therapy.

### Antibiotic associated diarrhea in outpatient pediatric antibiotic therapy [^5d309f3e]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introductıon

Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) is defined as diarrhoea that develops any time from a few hours after the onset of antibiotic therapy to eight weeks following antibiotic cessation. The direct toxic effects of antibiotics on the intestines include altered digestive function secondary to reduced concentrations of gut bacteria or the overgrowth of pathogenic microorganisms. The bacterial diversity of the intestinal lumen is also diminished after the administration of certain antibiotics, and these alterations in the abundance and composition of gut microbiota further lead to the dysfunction of these microbiota. Moreover, the impact seems considerably more long-standing than originally thought. A study of changes in the gut microbiota after antibiotic treatment for Helicobacter pylori infections found that gut microbiota were influenced for up to four years post-treatment. Recent advances in the understanding of the role of gut microbiota have increased awareness of the effects that antibiotics have on the resident microbial ecosystem and how antibiotics can adversely affect patient health. For instance, alterations in faecal microbial diversity have been identified as a reason for marked overall adiposity and dyslipidaemia in obese individuals, while atopy and asthma appear to to be associated with an insufficiency of early life exposure to the diverse environmental microbiota. Despite substantial research, a significant need exists for epidemiological data on AAD in paediatric patients in different communities. In this prospective study, we aimed to evaluate the incidence of AAD in children in an outpatient practice using a well-established surveillance system.

### Aztreonam (Azactam) [^bdc96af3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Prescribing AZACTAM in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

In patients with impaired hepatic or renal function, appropriate monitoring is recommended during therapy.

If an aminoglycoside is used concurrently with aztreonam, especially if high dosages of the former are used or if therapy is prolonged, renal function should be monitored because of the potential nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity of aminoglycoside antibiotics.

The use of antibiotics may promote the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including Gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis) and fungi. Should superinfection occur during therapy, appropriate measures should be taken.

Information for Patients

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including AZACTAM should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (eg, the common cold). When AZACTAM is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by AZACTAM or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as 2 or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

### Probiotic use in clinical practice: what are the risks? [^a8fe6235]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Probiotics have been advocated for the prevention and treatment of a wide range of diseases, and there is strong evidence for their efficacy in some clinical scenarios. Probiotics are now widely used in many countries by consumers and in clinical practice. Given the increasingly widespread use of probiotics, a thorough understanding of their risks and benefits is imperative. In this article we review the safety of probiotics and discuss areas of uncertainty regarding their use. Although probiotics have an excellent overall safety record, they should be used with caution in certain patient groups-particularly neonates born prematurely or with immune deficiency. Because of the paucity of information regarding the mechanisms through which probiotics act, appropriate administrative regimens, and probiotic interactions, further investigation is needed in these areas. Finally, note that the properties of different probiotic species vary and can be strain-specific. Therefore, the effects of one probiotic strain should not be generalized to others without confirmation in separate studies. Careful consideration should be given to these issues before patients are advised to use probiotic supplements in clinical practice.

Short and long antibiotic treatment both allow for intestinal microbiota restoration within the first six postnatal weeks as characterised by increasing relative abundance of Bifidobacterium species. Long treatment, however, potentially has more enduring effect on microbiota development than short treatment, but this needs to be further elucidated. Although being of short-term, the rise of enterococci at expense of bifidobacteria and streptococci, including the potential effect of disturbed microbiota development on health outcomes, should be considered as aspect of the cost-benefit determination for antibiotic prescription.

### Clinical considerations for group A Streptococcus… [^ab5578d3]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points Streptococcus pyogenesare also called group A Streptococcus.
- Group A strep bacteria can cause both noninvasive and invasive disease.
- They can also cause long-term sequelae.
- The bacteria are contagious and usually spread via respiratory droplets.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with group A strep infection. Guiding principles Etiology S. pyogenes are gram-positive cocci that grow in chains. They exhibit β-hemolysis when grown on blood agar plates. They belong to group A in the Lancefield classification system for β-hemolytic Streptococcus, and thus are called group A streptococci. Cause infections and immune-mediated sequelae Learn about clinical features, complications, diagnosis, and treatment options for the following conditions related to group A strep bacteria. Noninvasive diseases Invasive diseases Immune-mediated sequelae.

Transmission Transmission is most often direct person-to-person spread through respiratory droplets. It can also occur through contact with secretions from an infected person. Although rare, spread of group A strep bacteria may also occur via food. Environmental transmission via surfaces and fomites may be possible. However, it's likely a less common route of transmission. How they don't spread There's no evidence pets can transmit the bacteria to humans, the primary reservoir for group A strep bacteria. Prevention Prevention activities vary by condition, but generally focus on three important goals:

- Limit exposure and spread of bacteria
- Treat group A strep infections
- Use preventive antibiotics when appropriate Surveillance and trends CDC tracks invasive group A strep disease. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is the only nationally notifiable disease caused by group A strep bacteria.

### Probiotics for the prevention of pediatric antibiotic-associated diarrhea [^cabfad64]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics alter the microbial balance within the gastrointestinal tract. Probiotics may prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) via restoration of the gut microflora. Antibiotics are prescribed frequently in children and AAD is common in this population.

Objectives

The primary objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of probiotics (any specified strain or dose) used for the prevention of AAD in children.

Search Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, AMED, and the Web of Science (inception to May 2010) were searched along with specialized registers including the Cochrane IBD/FBD review group, CISCOM (Centralized Information Service for Complementary Medicine), NHS Evidence, the International Bibliographic Information on Dietary Supplements as well as trial registries. Letters were sent to authors of included trials, nutra/pharmaceutical companies, and experts in the field requesting additional information on ongoing or unpublished trials. Conference proceedings, dissertation abstracts, and reference lists from included and relevant articles were also searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, parallel, controlled trials in children (0 to 18 years) receiving antibiotics, that compare probiotics to placebo, active alternative prophylaxis, or no treatment and measure the incidence of diarrhea secondary to antibiotic use were considered for inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study selection, data extraction as well as methodological quality assessment using the risk of bias instrument was conducted independently and in duplicate by two authors. Dichotomous data (incidence of diarrhea, adverse events) were combined using a pooled relative risk and risk difference (adverse events), and continuous data (mean duration of diarrhea, mean daily stool frequency) as weighted mean differences, along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. For overall pooled results on the incidence of diarrhea, sensitivity analyses included available case versus extreme-plausible analyses and random- versus fixed-effect models. To explore possible explanations for heterogeneity, a priori subgroup analysis were conducted on probiotic strain, dose, definition of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, antibiotic agent as well as risk of bias.

Main Results

Sixteen studies (3432 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Trials included treatment with either Bacillus spp. Bifidobacterium spp. Lactobacilli spp. Lactococcus spp. Leuconostoc cremoris, Saccharomyces spp., or Streptococcus spp., alone or in combination. Nine studies used a single strain probiotic agent, four combined two probiotic strains, one combined three probiotic strains, one product included ten probiotic agents, and one study included two probiotic arms that used three and two strains respectively. The risk of bias was determined to be high in 8 studies and low in 8 studies. Available case (patients who did not complete the studies were not included in the analysis) results from 15/16 trials reporting on the incidence of diarrhea show a large, precise benefit from probiotics compared to active, placebo or no treatment control. The incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 9% compared to 18% in the control group (2874 participants; RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.38 to 0.72; I(2) = 56%). This benefit was not statistically significant in an extreme plausible (60% of children loss to follow-up in probiotic group and 20% loss to follow-up in the control group had diarrhea) intention to treat (ITT) sensitivity analysis. The incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 16% compared to 18% in the control group (3392 participants; RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.04; I(2) = 59%). An a priori available case subgroup analysis exploring heterogeneity indicated that high dose (≥ 5 billion CFUs/day) is more effective than low probiotic dose (< 5 billion CFUs/day), interaction P value = 0.010. For the high dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% compared to 22% in the control group (1474 participants; RR 0.40; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.55). For the low dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 8% compared to 11% in the control group (1382 participants; RR 0.80; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.21). An extreme plausible ITT subgroup analysis was marginally significant for high dose probiotics. For the high dose studies the incidence of AAD in the probiotic group was 17% compared to 22% in the control group (1776 participants; RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.99; I(2) = 58%). None of the 11 trials (n = 1583) that reported on adverse events documented any serious adverse events. Meta-analysis excluded all but an extremely small non-significant difference in adverse events between treatment and control (RD 0.00; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.02).

Authors' Conclusions

Despite heterogeneity in probiotic strain, dose, and duration, as well as in study quality, the overall evidence suggests a protective effect of probiotics in preventing AAD. Using 11 criteria to evaluate the credibility of the subgroup analysis on probiotic dose, the results indicate that the subgroup effect based on dose (≥ 5 billion CFU/day) was credible. Based on high-dose probiotics, the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one case of diarrhea is seven (NNT 7; 95% CI 6 to 10). However, a GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for the primary endpoint (incidence of diarrhea) was low due to issues with risk of bias (due to high loss to follow-up) and imprecision (sparse data, 225 events). The benefit for high dose probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Saccharomyces boulardii) needs to be confirmed by a large well-designed randomized trial. More refined trials are also needed that test strain specific probiotics and evaluate the efficacy (e.g. incidence and duration of diarrhea) and safety of probiotics with limited losses to follow-up. It is premature to draw conclusions about the efficacy and safety of other probiotic agents for pediatric AAD. Future trials would benefit from a standard and valid outcomes to measure AAD.

### The interplay between host immune cells and gut microbiota in chronic inflammatory diseases [^3218678e]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Antibiotics

Antibiotic treatment used in the clinical setting has been mainly used to for the purpose to either treat or prevent infection. However, simultaneously, it can cause unintended damage by depleting beneficial commensals, Even though the microbiota can be restored to the original status following withdrawal of antibiotics, in some cases, full restoration may not be achieved after prolonged treatment. In some other cases, blooms of pathobionts, albeit temporary, may pose long-lasting negative impacts on host immune responses or other functions. It should be noted that the scale and persistence of such perturbations depends on the class of antibiotics administered. For example, the administration of either a combination of amoxicillin, metronidazole and bismuth, or vancomycin alone, significantly reduces microbial diversity in intestinal microbiota; whereas compositional alterations can be almost fully reversed to baseline about 3 weeks after termination of antibiotic treatment. In contrast, following administration with clindamycin, which has a strong and broad activity against almost anaerobes, for 7 days, the diversity of Bacteroides is never restored to its original level until over two years of recovery. Antibiotic-induced alterations of the gut microbiota can promote various diseases. For instance, antibiotic treatments lead to an increase in the abundance of host-derived free sialic acid in the intestine, which can then be utilized by certain pathogens and pathobionts, such as S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and C. difficile, resulting in blooms of pathogenic bacteria in the intestinal tract and subsequently symptoms including diarrhea.

Therefore, the use of narrow-spectrum antibiotics appears as an appealing alternative to minimize the risk of gut dysbiosis and blooms of pathobionts. There has been an increasing interest in the use of ampicillin and penicillin, relatively narrow-spectrum antibiotics, for the management of hospitalized infants and children with community-acquired pneumonia. A follow-up study of this strategy showed that ampicillin and penicillin have a similar efficacy with empirically used broad-spectrum antibiotics. Like this, it remains challenging to determine which narrow-spectrum antibiotics have sufficient efficacy and specificities against particular infectious agents to replace the empirically used broad-spectrum antibiotics. To do that, understanding the mechanisms by which pathogens colonize the intestinal tract, outcompete commensal bacteria, or translocate systemically as well as finding intrinsic factors that can differentiate pathogens from commensals, will provide critical insights into the development of effective and specific narrow-spectrum antibiotics that target the pathogens or selective pathobionts, whereas remaining innocuous to other commensals.

### Fusobacterium necrophorum in a pediatric retropharyngeal abscess: a case report and review of the literature [^f76154a4]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2014). Low credibility.

We present the case of a 17-year-old boy who developed a deep space neck infection following cervical trauma. He was initially managed conservatively with broad-spectrum antibiotics, but when he failed to improve clinically, he required surgical drainage. Wound cultures grew Fusobacterium necrophorum, an uncommon pathogen that can cause pediatric deep neck space infections, especially when it is not associated with Lemierre syndrome. The prognosis for this infection is favorable when it is identified early. Treatment with culture-directed antibiotics and surgical drainage as indicated is appropriate. When treating a pediatric deep neck space infection empirically, physicians should avoid treatment with a macrolide antibiotic, since Fusobacterium spp may be involved and they are often resistant to this class of drugs.

### Bacteria: a new player in gastrointestinal motility disorders – infections, bacterial overgrowth, and probiotics [^6aecb5fc]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may result from a dysfunctional interaction between the indigenous flora and the intestinal mucosa, which in turn leads to immune activation in the colonic mucosa. Some propose that bacterial overgrowth is a common causative factor in the pathogenesis of symptoms in IBS; others point to evidence suggesting that the cause stems from more subtle qualitative changes in the colonic flora. Bacterial overgrowth will probably prove not to be a major factor in what will eventually be defined as IBS. Nevertheless, short-term therapy with either antibiotics or probiotics seems to reduce symptoms among IBS patients. However, in the long term, safety issues will favor the probiotic approach; results of long-term studies with these agents are eagerly awaited.

### Uncertainties in screening and prevention of group B. streptococcus disease [^7e070037]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Several recent studies indicate alterations in infant microbiota in IAP-exposed and IAP-unexposed infants up to 12 months of life. Two Canadian studies (Baby and Mi, CHILD) have recently published evidence that suggests early differences in the microbiota of low-risk term infants exposed to IAP compared to unexposed infants and those born by caesarean section. These studies suggest cumulative dysbiosis with IAP and caesarean section and modifying effects of breastfeeding. An Italian study of 84 infants followed for 30 days indicated reduced numbers of beneficial Bifidobacterium in IAP-exposed infants, which was further exacerbated in those who were fed formula rather than breast milk. It is therefore possible that IAP may also alter the initial colonizing microbiota, and this could have long-term health implications. Several larger cohort studies are now underway to investigate the long-term effects of peripartum antibiotic exposure following caesarean section on the infant intestinal microbiome and future disease risk.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^5b5354e4]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

According to a Cochrane report from 2012, clinical trials on shorter treatment duration with oral penicillin for streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis are encouraged. Moore and colleagues (DESCARTE study) called for randomised controlled trials to confirm if a shorter course of penicillin might be sufficient when symptomatic cure is the goal. Increasing overall antimicrobial resistance and the lack of new antimicrobial agents emphasise the importance of correctly using existing antibiotics to their full potential. A Cochrane review published in 2016 concluded that penicillin is the preferred first line treatment for pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococcus in adults and children. This review compared penicillin with broader spectrum antibiotics. A meta-analysis from 2008 stated that clinical success and bacteriological eradication are less likely in patients with group A streptococcus pharyngotonsillitis on a short course of treatment (five to seven days) compared with those on a long course of treatment (10 days). The total daily doses in these studies ranged from 750 to 1600 mg, either twice daily or three times daily. However, the inclusion criteria did not always follow current ESCMID guidelines, and the dosing regimens were suboptimal according to current knowledge of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

The efficacy of β lactam antibiotics is dependent on time above the minimum inhibitory concentration of the unbound drug concentration in serum. The most important determinants for time above minimum inhibitory concentration are dose and frequency, and the dosing regimen of 800 mg four times daily provides better target attainment compared with 1000 mg three times daily. The risk with a shorter regimen might be a lower rate of clinical resolution and microbiological eradication. However, reducing the treatment duration could cause fewer side effects, improve patient adherence, cause less impact on the human microbiota, lower the total antibiotic use, and reduce drug costs for patients and the community. The rationale for a non-inferiority trial design was based on the expectation that non-inferiority of the clinical efficacy of a shorter treatment duration compared with the currently recommended treatment would be sufficient from a clinical perspective. The efficacy of 10 day treatment compared with placebo is previously well documentedand in line with international guidelines. The non-inferiority margin for the primary endpoint was agreed upon by the trial steering committee based on European Medicines Agency guidelinesand on the judgment that a difference in the rate of clinical cure up to 10 percentage points is not clinically relevant for non-serious infections.

### The role of bacterial translocation in sepsis: a new target for therapy [^0c3f7b63]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Probiotic, prebiotic, and synbiotic treatments

Recovery of the microbiome is essential for preventing long-lasting immune suppression after the initial bout of sepsis has ended. Probiotic, prebiotic, and synbiotic treatments have been explored for maintaining and repairing the gut microbiota. These treatments may prevent and improve the prognosis of patients with sepsis.

Probiotics are viable, non-pathogenic microorganisms that confer benefits to the host by modifying the gut microbiota, promoting the local release of antimicrobial factors, maintaining gut barrier integrity, competing for epithelial adherence, preventing BT, and modulating the local immune response. Probiotic-associated changes in the gut microbiota are correlated with disease outcomes. The properties of probiotics are strain-specific, and beneficial effects have been observed for certain strains of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces, Enterococcus sp. Streptococcus sp. Pediococcus sp. Leuconostoc, Bacillus, and E. coli. Probiotics are well tolerated and are believed to prevent disease progression by competing with native bacteria for nutrients and binding loci, producing bacteriocins that kill pathogens, increasing the production of IgA, improving mucosal immunity, and suppressing systemic inflammation. In an animal pancreatitis model, the host-specific ileal microbiota was replaced with an 'acute pancreatitis-associated microbiota', which was reversed by administering probiotics. The microbiome of animals that received probiotics contained an abundance of a bacterial phylotype related to Clostridium lituseburense, which was correlated with reduced bacterial overgrowth, improved pancreatic pathology, and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels.

The use of probiotics in critically ill patients has yielded mixed results. Several studies have shown that probiotics are associated with decreases in susceptibility to antibiotic-associated diarrhea, Clostridium difficile, ventilator-associated pneumonia, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), sepsis, MOF syndrome, and a shortened infection duration. However, a meta-analysis did not show a beneficial effect on mortality or length of ICU stay. Probiotic use in immunocompromised patients or patients with a leaky gut was associated with increased fungemia and bacteremia. The use of Lactobacillus rhamnosus decreased ventilator-associated pneumonia in ICU patients. Probiotic administration prevented necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and decreased mortality in preterm infants; however, the level of evidence was deemed insufficient to recommend it as a routine treatment. A recent large-scale multicenter trial did not show any benefit in using probiotics as a measure for decreasing ventilator-associated pneumonia or other infections among patients in ICU. However, probiotics were beneficial in selected patient populations, requiring an individualized approach for sepsis.

### Clinical efficacy of probiotics: review of the evidence with focus on children [^9e1d5a0c]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Medium credibility.

Clinical efficacy of probiotics: review of the evidence with focus on children — this clinical report reviews and evaluates the evidence or lack thereof for beneficial effects of probiotic agents in pediatric conditions and examines safety and potential adverse events, noting that probiotics are highly heterogeneous and that in certain specific conditions probiotics cause clinical deterioration. Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms which, when consumed in adequate amounts, confer a health effect on the host, and in vitro studies suggest they act through several different mechanisms and can modulate the immune system. A variety of probiotic agents have been studied as single agents or combinations, including lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, saccharomyces, Escherichia coli and streptococci, but considerable differences exist among preparations, most studies have not been reproduced or confirmed, and in vitro effects may display opposite behavior in vivo. The authors state that understanding of use for children is just beginning and that considerably more supporting evidence is required; PubMed and MEDLINE searches were performed for all human trial studies related to probiotic therapy.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Amoxicillin is indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible (ONLY β-lactamase-negative) strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below:

Infections of the ear, nose, and throat - due to Streptococcus spp. (α- and β- hemolytic strains only), S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus spp., or H. influenzae.

Infections of the genitourinary tract - due to E. coli, P. mirabilis, or E. faecalis.

Infections of the skin and skin structure - due to Streptococcus spp. (α- and β-hemolytic strains only), Staphylococcus spp., or E. coli.

Infections of the lower respiratory tract - due to Streptococcus spp. (α- and β-hemolytic strains only), S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus spp., or H. influenzae.

Gonorrhea, acute uncomplicated (ano-genital and urethral infections) - due to N. gonorrhoeae (males and females).

H. pylori eradication to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence.

Triple Therapy

Amoxicillin/Clarithromycin/Lansoprazole

Amoxicillin, in combination with clarithromycin plus lansoprazole as triple therapy, is indicated for the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or 1-year history of a duodenal ulcer) to eradicate H. pylori. Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION sections.)

Dual Therapy

Amoxicillin/Lansoprazole

Amoxicillin, in combination with lansoprazole delayed-release capsules as dual therapy, is indicated for the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or 1-year history of a duodenal ulcer) who are either allergic or intolerant to clarithromycin or in whom resistance to clarithromycin is known or suspected. (See the clarithromycin package insert, MICROBIOLOGY section.) Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. (See CLINICAL STUDIES and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION sections.)

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of amoxicillin and other antibacterial drugs, amoxicillin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Indicated surgical procedures should be performed.
