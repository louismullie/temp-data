## Question

How much hypertonic saline to give to raise sodium by 7

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much hypertonic saline to give to raise serum sodium by 7 mmol/L. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether a 7 mmol/L rise is appropriate or safe. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetics and dosing principles for 3% saline. Next, I will apply the Adrogué–Madias framework to estimate the required volume. After that, I need to translate that into practical bolus dosing with safety limits. Finally, I should confirm monitoring, overcorrection risk, and when to use desmopressin to prevent overshoot, and then synthesize a concise, actionable answer with caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and safety of a 7 mmol/L rise. In symptomatic hyponatremia, guidelines target a 4–6 mmol/L initial increase to reverse encephalopathy, and they cap total correction at about 10 mmol/L in 24 hours to mitigate osmotic demyelination risk; a 7 mmol/L rise exceeds the usual initial target but remains within the 24-hour safety ceiling if carefully monitored, so I need to ensure we do not overshoot and that we plan for close sodium checks and potential desmopressin if the rise is too fast [^90dd948b] [^5f4beb21] [^7cdd2350].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetics and dosing conventions. Most contemporary protocols use 3% NaCl, which contains about 513 mmol/L of sodium and is typically administered as 100–150 mL boluses over 10–20 minutes; in adults of average size, 100 mL of 3% NaCl is expected to raise serum sodium by roughly 1–1.5 mmol/L assuming no urinary free water clearance, which anchors the back-of-the-envelope estimate I will use [^664fc7a0] [^d2db4209].

> I will now examine the Adrogué–Madias framework to estimate the volume needed for a 7 mmol/L rise. The simplified formula predicts change in sodium as (infusate Na − serum Na) ÷ (total body water + 1), where total body water is about 0.6 × weight in kg for non-elderly men, 0.5 × weight for women and elderly; for a 70 kg man with serum sodium 120 mmol/L, 1 L of 3% saline would raise sodium by about 8.5 mmol/L, so a 7 mmol/L rise corresponds to roughly 0.82 L, or 820 mL; for a 60 kg woman, 1 L raises sodium by about 10 mmol/L, so 7 mmol/L corresponds to about 0.7 L, or 700 mL; I should double-check that these estimates assume no free water diuresis, which is a key caveat [^f86d9764] [^664fc7a0].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about giving 700–800 mL in one shot; that would risk overshoot. I need to translate this into iterative boluses with reassessment. Using 100 mL 3% NaCl boluses, I should expect about 1–1.5 mmol/L per bolus, so 5–7 boluses would approach 7 mmol/L; however, I should stop once symptoms improve or once a total of about 10 mmol/L has been achieved in 24 hours, and I must check serum sodium frequently, typically every 4–6 hours initially, with earlier checks after each bolus in severe cases [^90dd948b] [^18482b1c] [^5f4beb21].

> Let me consider a concrete, conservative approach and then sanity-check it. One practical sequence is 100 mL 3% NaCl over 10–20 minutes, reassess clinically, repeat up to two additional times if needed to reach about a 4–6 mmol/L increase, and then pause; if a 7 mmol/L total rise is still clinically indicated and safe, additional carefully titrated boluses can be given with close monitoring, recognizing that the total 24-hour correction should remain within 10 mmol/L; this aligns with bolus-first strategies that achieve faster, more predictable early rises with less overcorrection than continuous infusion in some studies [^3e6d9ba7] [^1d8f2e73].

> I should confirm overcorrection risk and mitigation. Overcorrection is often driven by abrupt aquaresis rather than the administered sodium load; therefore, if urine output surges and sodium rises too quickly, I need to act promptly with desmopressin and, if necessary, administer hypotonic fluid to relower sodium into the safe range; prophylactic desmopressin can be considered in high-risk patients to cap the correction, and I need to ensure we have a plan to monitor every 4–6 hours early on [^5f4beb21] [^1eea8c2b] [^925c56ff].

> But wait, what if the patient is pediatric or has special risk factors. In children with symptomatic hyponatremia, 2 mL/kg 3% NaCl boluses with a 100 mL maximum are recommended, repeated no more than twice, targeting about a 5–6 mmol/L early rise; in patients with high risk for osmotic demyelination (e.g., alcoholism, malnutrition, hypokalemia, liver disease), I should keep the total 24-hour correction even more conservative, ideally 4–6 mmol/L, and use desmopressin proactively to avoid overshoot [^a4b8c0fe] [^474a1ded].

> Let me reconsider the original question and synthesize. To raise sodium by 7 mmol/L, I would plan approximately 5–7 standard 100 mL 3% NaCl boluses given sequentially with reassessment after each bolus, expecting about 1–1.5 mmol/L per bolus, while stopping once symptoms resolve or once the total 24-hour correction approaches 10 mmol/L; I should monitor sodium every 4–6 hours initially, watch urine output closely for aquaresis, and be prepared to use desmopressin and hypotonic fluid if the rise is too fast; I need to ensure the final 24-hour correction does not exceed 10 mmol/L to minimize demyelination risk [^90dd948b] [^5f4beb21] [^7cdd2350].

To raise serum sodium by 7 mmol/L, administer **3% hypertonic saline** as 100 mL boluses over 10–20 minutes, repeated up to three times, targeting a 4–6 mmol/L initial rise [^90dd948b] [^5f4beb21]. If needed, give additional 100 mL boluses to reach 7 mmol/L, but **do not exceed 10 mmol/L in 24 hours** to avoid osmotic demyelination [^7cdd2350]. Monitor sodium every 4–6 hours and adjust dosing to prevent overcorrection [^18482b1c].

---

## Calculation of hypertonic saline volume

The Adrogué–Madias formula estimates the change in serum sodium from 3% saline:

- **Formula**: ΔNa = (infusate Na − serum Na) / (total body water + 1) × volume infused (L)
- **Assumptions**: 3% saline = 513 mmol/L Na; total body water ≈ 0.6 × lean body weight (kg) in men, 0.5 × in women
- **Example**: 70 kg man, serum Na 120 mmol/L; 100 mL 3% saline ≈ 1.3 mmol/L rise

Thus, **~540 mL of 3% saline** is needed for a 7 mmol/L rise, but this assumes no urinary free water excretion; in practice, smaller boluses with reassessment are safer [^f86d9764].

---

## Recommended dosing strategy

Given overcorrection risk, use **bolus dosing with close monitoring**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended dosing** |
|-|-|
| Severe symptomatic hyponatremia (seizures, coma) | 100 mL 3% saline IV over 10–20 min; repeat up to three times if needed [^90dd948b] [^5f4beb21] |
| Moderate symptoms (confusion, nausea, headache) | 100 mL 3% saline IV over 10–20 min; repeat once if needed [^notfound] |
| Asymptomatic or mild symptoms | Avoid hypertonic saline; use fluid restriction and treat the cause [^b611ef4b] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

- **Initial target**: 4–6 mmol/L rise to reverse severe symptoms [^90dd948b] [^5f4beb21].
- **Maximum correction**: ≤ 10 mmol/L in 24 hours; ≤ 8 mmol/L in high-risk patients (e.g. alcoholism, malnutrition, liver disease) [^7cdd2350] [^474a1ded].
- **Monitoring**: serum sodium every 4–6 hours initially; adjust therapy to avoid overcorrection [^18482b1c].

---

## Risks and precautions

- **Overcorrection risk**: osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS), especially in chronic hyponatremia [^90dd948b].
- **Mitigation**: use desmopressin to halt aquaresis if overcorrection occurs; relower sodium with D5W if needed [^1eea8c2b] [^6e8f49c0].
- **Patient-specific factors**: adjust dosing for age, sex, weight, and comorbidities [^f86d9764].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Bolus dosing**: 100 mL 3% saline IV over 10–20 min; repeat up to three times to achieve ~7 mmol/L rise.
- **Maximum correction**: ≤ 10 mmol/L in 24 hours; ≤ 8 mmol/L in high-risk patients [^7cdd2350] [^474a1ded].
- **Monitoring**: frequent serum sodium checks and clinical reassessment to guide further dosing [^18482b1c].

---

To raise sodium by 7 mmol/L, give **100 mL 3% saline boluses** repeated up to three times with close monitoring, staying within 10 mmol/L in 24 hours to avoid ODS [^90dd948b] [^7cdd2350].

### Hypertonic saline for hyponatremia: meeting goals and avoiding harm [^ed8f360d]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertonic saline has been used for the treatment of hyponatremia for nearly a century. There is now general consensus that hypertonic saline should be used in patients with hyponatremia associated with moderate or severe symptoms to prevent neurological complications. However, much less agreement exists among experts regarding other aspects of its use. Should hypertonic saline be administered as a bolus injection or continuous infusion? What is the appropriate dose? Is a central venous line necessary? Should desmopressin be used concomitantly and for how long? This article considers these important questions, briefly explores the historical origins of hypertonic saline use for hyponatremia, and reviews recent evidence behind its indications, dosing, administration modality and route, combined use with desmopressin to prevent rapid correction of serum sodium, and other considerations such as the need and degree for fluid restriction. The authors conclude by offering some practical recommendations for the use of hypertonic saline.

### Hypertonic saline for peri-operative fluid management [^d521d910]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Fluid excess may place patients undergoing surgery at risk for various complications. Hypertonic saline (HS) maintains intravascular volume with less intravenous fluid than isotonic salt (IS) solutions, but may increase serum sodium.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of HS versus IS solutions administered to patients undergoing surgery.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library) Issue 1, 2009; MEDLINE (1966 to 2009); EMBASE (1980 to 2009); LILACS (to August 2009) and CINAHL (1982 to 2009) without language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized clinical trials where HS was compared to IS in patients undergoing surgery, irrespective of blinding, language, and publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed the impact of HS administration on mortality, organ failure, fluid balance, serum sodium, serum osmolarity, diuresis and physiologic measures of cardiovascular function. We pooled data using odds ratio or mean difference (MD) for binary and continuous outcomes, respectively, using random-effects models.

Main Results

We included 15 studies with 614 participants. One death in each group and no other serious adverse events were reported. While all patients were in a positive fluid balance postoperatively, the excess was significantly less in HS patients (standardized mean difference (SMD) -1.43L, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 2.1 L less; P < 0.00001). Patients treated with HS received significantly less fluid than IS-treated patients (MD -2.4L 95% (CI) 1.5 to 3.2 L less; P < 0.00001) without differences in diuresis between the groups. Maximum intraoperative cardiac index was significantly increased with HS (SMD 0.6 L/min/M2 higher, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.0, P = 0.02) but Intraoperative pulmonary artery wedge pressure remained unchanged. While the maximum serum sodium and the serum sodium at the end of the study were significantly higher in HS patients, the level remained within normal limits (136 to 146 meq/L).

Authors' Conclusions

HS reduces the volume of intravenous fluid required to maintain patients undergoing surgery but transiently increases serum sodium. It is not known if HS effects patient survival and morbidity but it should be tested in randomized clinical trials that are designed and powered to test these outcomes.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^5f4beb21]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

For patients presenting with severe symptoms, the European Clinical Practice Guidelines and US/Irish expert panel both advocate bolus infusions of hypertonic saline in an effort to raise the serum sodium by 5 mmol/L (European) or by 4–6 mmol/L (US/Irish) within a few hours. An increase of this magnitude is sufficient to markedly reduce intracranial pressure and can reverse impending brain herniation.Bolus infusion of hypertonic saline has been reported to achieve the desired increment in serum sodium more rapidly than a continuous infusion of 3% saline,and it is associated with better clinical outcomes.

After treatment with either isotonic saline or hypertonic saline given by bolus or continuous infusion, the serum sodium often increases by more than intended., Indeed, the risk of “overshooting the mark” is one of the stated reasons for setting conservative correction goals when treating patients for severe hyponatremia.However, the main reason for an excessive rise in serum sodium is not an excessive dose of saline; rather, it is the sudden elimination of a large volume of dilute urine., If the cause of water retention and hyponatremia resolves, a water diuresis (often called an aquaresis) will emerge during treatment and can increase serum sodium by more than 2 mmol/L per hour. For this reason, in patients with a sodium ≤120 mmol/L, it is important to measure the serum sodium frequently and to monitor urine output carefully during treatment.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^559dccd3]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Hypertonic sodium solution administration—acute kidney injury (AKI) risk mitigation recommendations are as follows: We suggest that severe hypernatremia and hyperchloremia during treatment with hypertonic sodium solutions should be avoided due to the association with acute kidney injury (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). An upper serum sodium range of 155–160 mEq/L and a serum chloride range of 110–115 mEq/L may be reasonable to decrease the risk of acute kidney injury (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Clinicians should routinely monitor both sodium and chloride serum concentrations to assess risk of AKI related to elevated concentrations (good practice statement), and renal function should be monitored closely in patients receiving hypertonic sodium solutions due to the risk of AKI with hyperosmolar therapy (good practice statement). For monitoring frequency, clinicians should use patient-specific factors with ranging from twice daily to every 2 h based on rapidity of change to interventions.

### Efficiency of 7.2% hypertonic saline hydroxyethyl starch 200 / 0.5 versus mannitol 15% in the treatment of increased intracranial pressure in neurosurgical patients-a randomized clinical trial [ ISRCTN62699180 ] [^338492d4]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical chemistry

Hematocrit was not significantly changed by infusion of mannitol (0.3 (0.27–0.42) vs 0.29 (0.26–0.40)) and hypertonic saline (0.29 (0.24–0.37) vs 0.29 (0.24–0.36)). A temporary, but statistically significant increase of serum sodium occurred after infusion of the hypertonic saline from 143 (136–148) mmol/l to 148 (144–153) mmol/l (p < 0.001). Serum osmolarity increased significantly after infusion of hypertonic saline: 284 (273–300) mosm/kg to 300 (284–319) mosm/kg (p < 0.001), as well as after infusion of mannitol: 286 (270–315) mosm/kg to 295 (278–327) mosm/kg (p < 0.001).

Outcome

Ten patients (58.8%) assigned to the group receiving hypertonic saline survived, the remaining seven patients died (41.2%). In the group with the mannitol treatment, six patients survived (40.0%) and nine patients died (60.0%). The chi-square test revealed no statistical significance.

In patients who survived, a lower dose of the osmotic agent had been administered. Survivors in the hypertonic saline group received a significant lower dose of 1.4 (0.32–2.8) ml/kg hypertonic saline. In non-survivors, the dosage given was 1.7 (0.9–3.1) ml/kg (p < 0.05). In the mannitol group, patients who survived received 1.7 (0.5–3.4) ml/kg mannitol versus 1.9 (1.0–6.5) ml/kg mannitol in patients who died (p = NS). Therefore, a statistical significance regarding the influence of the specific osmolarity, either of hypertonic saline or mannitol, given with each treatment, on changes of the cerebral hemodynamics (ICP, CPP) or patients' individual outcomes could not be analyzed.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the management of exercise-associated hyponatremia: 2019 update [^ce7ab3f1]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with exercise-associated hyponatremia (inpatient management), WMS 2020 guidelines recommend to administer a 100 mL bolus of IV hypertonic saline in patients with biochemically confirmed severe exercise-associated hyponatremia or symptomatic exercise-associated hyponatremia. Consider administering repeated boluses twice at 10-min intervals (3 doses in total) or until improvement of neurologic symptoms, with the aim of acutely increasing serum sodium concentration by about 4 to 5 mmol/L and reversing cerebral edema.

### The relationship between serum sodium and intracranial pressure when using hypertonic saline to target mild hypernatremia in patients with head trauma [^b6647bc0]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Key messages

• Serum sodium values do not correlate well with ICP in patients with TBI treated with HTS.

• Achieving serum sodium values between 145 and 155 mEq/l may decrease the number of daily interventions required to manage elevated ICP.

• HTS boluses did not significantly decrease ICP overall.

### Hypertonic saline for hyponatremia: risk of inadvertent overcorrection [^015d1386]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Data regarding dosage-response relationships for using hypertonic saline in treatment of hyponatremia are extremely limited. Objectives of this study were to assess adherence to previously published guidelines (limiting correction to <12 mEq/L per d and <18 mEq/L per 48 h) in treating hyponatremia with hypertonic saline and to determine the predictive accuracy of the Adrogué-Madias formula.

Design, Setting, Participants & Measurements

A retrospective review was conducted of all 62 adult, hyponatremic patients who were treated with hypertonic saline during 5 yr at a 528-bed, acute care, teaching hospital.

Results

Median infusion rate was 0.38 ml/kg per h, increasing serum sodium concentration by 0.47 +/- 0.05 mEq/L per h, 7.1 +/- 0.6 mEq/L per 24 h, and 11.3 +/- 0.7 mEq/L per 48 h. In 11.3% of cases, the increase was >12 mEq/L per 24 h and in 9.7% was >18 mEq/L per 48 h. No patient's rate was corrected by >25 mEq/L per 48 h. Among patients with serum sodium <120 mEq/L, the observed increase in sodium exceeded the rise predicted by the Adrogué-Madias formula in 74.2%; the average correction in overcorrectors was 2.4 times the predicted. Inadvertent overcorrection was due to documented water diuresis in 40% of cases.

Conclusions

The Adrogué-Madias formula underestimates increase in sodium concentration after hypertonic saline therapy. Unrecognized hypovolemia and other reversible causes of water retention pose a risk for inadvertent overcorrection. Hypertonic saline should be infused at rates lower than those predicted by formulas with close monitoring of serum sodium and urine output.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^57649884]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of mildly symptomatic patients (acute setting), ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to consider administering a single infusion of 3% hypertonic saline (150 mL IV, over 20 minutes) if the acute decrease in serum sodium concentration is > 10 mmol/L.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of severely symptomatic patients (inadequate response to initial management), ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to discontinue IV infusion of 3% hypertonic saline when symptoms improve, the serum sodium concentration increases by ≥ 10 mmol/L in total, or the serum sodium concentration reaches 130 mmol/L, whichever occurs first.

### Disorders of sodium and water balance [^1eb0921f]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Dysnatremias occur simultaneously with disorders in water balance. The first priority is to correct dehydration; once the patient is euvolemic, the sodium level can be reassessed. In unstable patients with hyponatremia, the clinician should rapidly administer hypertonic saline. In unstable patients with hypernatremia, the clinician should administer isotonic intravenous fluid. In stable patients with either hyponatremia or hypernatremia, the clinician should aim for correction over 24 to 48 hours, with the maximal change in serum sodium between 8 to 12 mEq/L over the first 24 hours. This rate of correction decreases the chances of cerebral edema or osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^e98ac58b]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

### Hypertonic saline in human sepsis: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^834ed440]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

The role of hypertonic saline in sepsis remains unclear because clinical data are limited and the balance between beneficial and adverse effects is not well defined. In this systematic literature review, we searched PubMed and Embase to identify all randomized controlled trials up until January 31, 2018 in which hypertonic saline solutions of any concentration were used in patients of all ages with sepsis and compared to a cohort of patients receiving an isotonic fluid. We identified 8 randomized controlled trials with 381 patients who had received hypertonic saline. Lower volumes of hypertonic saline than of isotonic solutions were needed to achieve the desired hemodynamic goals (standardized mean difference, -0.702; 95% CI, -1.066 to -0.337; P < .001; moderate-quality evidence). Hypertonic saline administration was associated with a transient increase in sodium and chloride concentrations without adverse effects on renal function (moderate-quality evidence). Some data suggested a beneficial effect of hypertonic saline solutions on some hemodynamic parameters and the immunomodulatory profile (very low-quality evidence). Mortality rates were not significantly different with hypertonic saline than with other fluids (odds ratio, 0.946; 95% CI, 0.688-1.301; P = .733; low-quality evidence). In conclusion, in our meta-analysis of studies in patients with sepsis, hypertonic saline reduced the volume of fluid needed to achieve the same hemodynamic targets but did not affect survival.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^4b156e54]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with liver disease, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to limit the use of hypertonic saline in the management of hypervolemic hyponatremia to the rare cases presenting with life-threatening complications. Consider administering hypertonic saline in patients with severe hyponatremia expected to get liver transplantation within a few days. Correct the serum sodium concentration slowly (≤ 8 mmol/L per day), once an attenuation of symptoms has been obtained, to avoid irreversible neurological sequelae, such as osmotic demyelination.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^b611ef4b]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder. Multiple organizations have published guidance documents to assist clinicians in managing hyponatremia. We aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of these documents.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and websites of guideline organizations and professional societies to September 2014 without language restriction for Clinical Practice Guidelines (defined as any document providing guidance informed by systematic literature review) and Consensus Statements (any other guidance document) developed specifically to guide differential diagnosis or treatment of hyponatremia. Four reviewers appraised guideline quality using the 23-item AGREE II instrument, which rates reporting of the guidance development process across six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. Total scores were calculated as standardized averages by domain.

Results

We found ten guidance documents; five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements. Overall, quality was mixed: two clinical practice guidelines attained an average score of >50% for all of the domains, three rated the evidence in a systematic way and two graded strength of the recommendations. All five consensus statements received AGREE scores below 60% for each of the specific domains.The guidance documents varied widely in scope. All dealt with therapy and seven included recommendations on diagnosis, using serum osmolality to confirm hypotonic hyponatremia, and volume status, urinary sodium concentration, and urinary osmolality for further classification of the hyponatremia. They differed, however, in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Eight guidance documents advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset (<48 h) hyponatremia. In chronic (>48 h) or asymptomatic cases, recommended treatments were NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. Eight guidance documents recommended limits for speed of increase of sodium concentration, but these varied between 8 and 12 mmol/L per 24 h. Inconsistencies also existed in the recommended dose of NaCl, its initial infusion speed, and which second line interventions to consider.

Conclusions

Current guidance documents on the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia vary in methodological rigor and recommendations are not always consistent.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^e1611723]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements covering the diagnostic approach to and treatment of hyponatremia. Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of severely symptomatic patients, initial management, AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend to consider administering bolus or continuous infusions of 3% hypertonic saline in patients with a sodium concentration of < 125 mEq/L and moderate or severe symptoms. Recognize that bolus infusion improves sodium concentration more quickly with less overcorrection.

### Hypertonic salt solution for peri-operative fluid management [^9a566f7f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Fluid excess may place people undergoing surgery at risk for various complications. Hypertonic salt solution (HS) maintains intravascular volume with less intravenous fluid than isotonic salt (IS) solutions, but may increase serum sodium. This review was published in 2010 and updated in 2016.

Objectives

To determine the benefits and harms of HS versus IS solutions administered for fluid resuscitation to people undergoing surgery.

Search Methods

In this updated review we have searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Issue 4, 2016); MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2016); EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2016); LILACS (January 1982 to April 2016) and CINAHL (January 1982 to April 2016) without language restrictions. We conducted the original search on April 30th, 2007, and reran it on April 8th, 2016.

Selection Criteria

We have included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing HS to IS in people undergoing surgery, irrespective of blinding, language, and publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent review authors read studies that met our selection criteria. We collected study information and data using a data collection sheet with predefined parameters. We have assessed the impact of HS administration on mortality, organ failure, fluid balance, serum sodium, serum osmolarity, diuresis and physiologic measures of cardiovascular function. We have pooled the data using the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes. We evaluated heterogeneity between studies by I² percentage. We consider studies with an I² of 0% to 30% to have no or little heterogeneity, 30% to 60% as having moderate heterogeneity, and more than 60% as having high heterogeneity. In studies with low heterogeneity we have used a fixed-effect model, and a random-effects model for studies with moderate to high heterogeneity.

Main Results

We have included 18 studies with 1087 participants of whom 545 received HS compared to 542 who received IS. All participants were over 18 years of age and all trials excluded high-risk patients (ASA IV). All trials assessed haematological parameters peri-operatively and up to three days post-operatively.There were three (< 1%) deaths reported in the IS group and four (< 1%) in the HS group, as assessed at 90 days in one study. There were no reports of serious adverse events. Most participants were in a positive fluid balance postoperatively (4.4 L IS and 2.5 L HS), with the excess significantly less in HS participants (MD -1.92 L, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.61 to -1.22 L; P < 0.00001). IS participants received a mean volume of 2.4 L and HS participants received 1.49 L, significantly less fluid than IS-treated participants (MD -0.91 L, 95% CI -1.24 to -0.59 L; P < 0.00001). The maximum average serum sodium ranged between 138.5 and 159 in HS groups compared to between 136 and 143 meq/L in the IS groups. The maximum serum sodium was significantly higher in HS participants (MD 7.73, 95% CI 5.84 to 9.62; P < 0.00001), although the level remained within normal limits (136 to 146 meq/L).A high degree of heterogeneity appeared to be related to considerable differences in the dose of HS between studies. The quality of the evidence for the outcomes reported ranged from high to very low. The risk of bias for many of the studies could not be determined for performance and detection bias, criteria that we assess as likely to impact the study outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

HS reduces the volume of intravenous fluid required to maintain people undergoing surgery but transiently increases serum sodium. It is not known if HS affects survival and morbidity, but this should be examined in randomized controlled trials that are designed and powered to test these outcomes.

Regarding inpatient care for exercise-associated hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to acute inpatient care, WMS 2020 guidelines recommend to administer a 100 mL bolus of IV hypertonic saline in patients with biochemically confirmed severe exercise-associated hyponatremia or symptomatic exercise-associated hyponatremia. Consider administering repeated boluses twice at 10-min intervals (3 doses in total) or until improvement of neurologic symptoms, with the aim of acutely increasing serum sodium concentration by about 4 to 5 mmol/L and reversing cerebral edema.

### Efficiency of 7.2% hypertonic saline hydroxyethyl starch 200 / 0.5 versus mannitol 15% in the treatment of increased intracranial pressure in neurosurgical patients-a randomized clinical trial [ ISRCTN62699180 ] [^dddd51db]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 and mannitol 15% are effective and safe drugs in the treatment of increased ICP, although 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 is more effective than mannitol. A dose of 1.4 ml/kg can be recommended as an initial dose. The advantage of hypertonic saline can be explained by individual local osmotic effects, because no relevant systemic changes occur. The observed effects on electrolytes and plasma osmolarity are not significantly different between the two osmotic drugs and have no clinical relevance here. Further experimental and clinical research is required to evaluate the optimal administration regime, the best treatment strategies adapted to the individual patient's needs and the impact on patients' morbidity and mortality.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to management of hyponatremia, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to limit the use of hypertonic saline in the management of hypervolemic hyponatremia to the rare cases presenting with life-threatening complications. Consider administering hypertonic saline in patients with severe hyponatremia expected to get liver transplantation within a few days. Correct the serum sodium concentration slowly (≤ 8 mmol/L per day), once an attenuation of symptoms has been obtained, to avoid irreversible neurological sequelae, such as osmotic demyelination.

### The relationship between serum sodium and intracranial pressure when using hypertonic saline to target mild hypernatremia in patients with head trauma [^f865098a]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Serum sodium values of critically ill patients with TBI do not correlate with ICP - although patients with serum sodium values < 145 mEq/l required more interventions for intracranial hypertension. Patients who had a good acute response to HTS boluses trended toward a decrease in ICP following each dose compared with poor responders. Targeting a serum sodium value of 145 to 155 mEq/l requires further evaluation.

### Effects of hypertonic saline (7.5%) on extracellular fluid volumes in healthy volunteers [^8e5f63c6]. Anaesthesia (2003). Low credibility.

This study evaluated the effects of 7.5% saline on plasma and other extracellular fluid volumes. After baseline measurements, eight healthy postmenopausal female volunteers received 4 ml.kg-1 of hypertonic saline over 30 min. After the fluid infusion, the volunteers were studied for 60 min. Plasma volume was measured using a dilution of 125-iodine-labelled human albumin. Extracellular water and cardiac output were measured by whole body impedence cardiography. The infused volume was 4 ml.kg-1 (average 260 ml). Plasma volume increased rapidly during the infusion (mean +/- standard deviation, 442 +/- 167 ml). At the end of the 1-h follow-up period, plasma volume had increased by on average 465 ml (SD 83). The increase of extracellular water at the end of infusion and at the end of study was 650 ml (SD 93) and 637 ml (SD 192), respectively. The highest serum sodium recorded in the volunteers was 158 mmol.l-1. The effect of 7.5% saline on plasma volume was rapid and lasted for at least 1 h. Plasma volume remained elevated by more than the infused volume at the end of the study. The increase in plasma and extracellular fluid volumes was partly achieved by mobilizing intracellular water to extracellular compartment.

Tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) poisoning—recommendation-specific supportive text notes that sodium loading and increasing the serum pH are each supported for the treatment of hypotension and arrhythmia, and administration of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate achieves both of these physiologic goals in adults and children. Whether the target endpoints of initial hypertonic sodium bicarbonate bolus therapy should be biochemical (pH ≈7.50) or physiologic (resolution of hypotension and QRS prolongation) is debated, and after the goals of alkalinization are achieved, it is not known whether to continue with boluses as needed or start a continuous infusion. Experts recommend avoiding extremes of hypernatremia (serum sodium not to exceed 155 mEq/L) and alkalemia (serum pH not to exceed 7.55) to avoid iatrogenic harm, and if pH exceeds 7.55 and serum sodium is below 155 mEq/L, serum sodium can be increased by administration of hypertonic saline.

### The comparison of hypertonic saline (7.5%) and normal saline (0.9%) for initial fluid administration before spinal anesthesia [^31fa143c]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2000). Low credibility.

Hypertonic saline can be used for initial fluid administration before spinal anesthesia. It is effective in small-volume fluid resuscitation. This randomized double-blinded study compared the effects of 7.5% hypertonic saline (HS) and 0.9% normal saline (NS) in doses containing 2 mmol/kg of sodium in 40 ASA physical status I-II patients undergoing arthroscopy or other lower limb surgery under spinal anesthesia. We infused 1.6 mL/kg of HS or 13 mL/kg of NS for initial fluid administration before spinal anesthesia induced with a 10-mg dose of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine. Etilefrine was administered to maintain mean arterial pressure at > or =80% of its control value. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac index did not differ between the groups, and the amount of etilefrine administered was similar in the treatment groups. In all our patients, the plasma sodium concentrations were within the normal range after surgery and serum osmolality was within the normal range after spinal anesthesia. The time and the volume of the first micturition were similar in both groups, despite the much smaller amount of infused free water in the HS group. We conclude that 7.5% HS was as good as NS for the initial fluid administration before spinal anesthesia when the amount of sodium was kept unchanged.

### Saline versus balanced solutions: are clinical trials comparing two crystalloid solutions really needed? [^451afdc5]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

How do we prescribe fluids?

The choice of intravenous fluid should be based on consideration of certain baseline factors, but also on elements that arise during therapy. For example, at baseline, administration of saline may be indicated in the presence of hypochloremia whereas a hypotonic fluid may be warranted in the presence of hypernatremia. Importantly, the situation may evolve with time as the fluid administered may induce metabolic changes leading to a different “best” fluid choice. Giving several liters of 0.9 % saline will result in hyperchloremia, so continuing this fluid strategy is not rational.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^90dd948b]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality.

Observations

Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific (such as weakness or nausea) to severe and life-threatening (such as seizures or coma). Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels (23.8% vs 16.4%, respectively; P<.01) and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7.4 years (23.3% vs 17.3%; P<.004). Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status (hypovolemic hyponatremia, euvolemic hyponatremia, or hypervolemic hyponatremia). For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects (eg, poor palatability and gastric intolerance with urea; and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and increased thirst with vaptans). Severely symptomatic hyponatremia (with signs of somnolence, obtundation, coma, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress) is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L (correction limit) within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4.5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

Initial Evaluation and Treatment of Hyponatremia

Emergency Management of Severe Hyponatremia

Initial management of hyponatremia includes assessment of neurological symptoms and signs to determine whether urgent treatment of severe hyponatremia with hypertonic saline is required. As discussed in “Acute Severe Hyponatremia,” severe hyponatremia can cause cerebral edema leading to seizures, coma, or death, and urgent intervention is recommended with a 100-mL bolus of hypertonic (3%) sodium chloride administered over approximately 15 minutes. An initial dose should be followed by clinical reassessment and a repeat dose if no clinical response, until this target increment has been achieved (Fig. 8). The goal is to achieve an initial sodium increase of 4 to 6 mmol. According to the Adrogué-Madias formula to estimate the effect of fluid administration on pNa, 100 mL of NaCl 3%, containing 51.3 mmol of Na +, may be expected to increase serum sodium by 1 to 1.5 mmol/L in most adults of average size (50-80 kg) (assuming no urinary electrolyte-free water clearance in the same interval) (see Fig. 2).

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^f84ee988]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Severity

Hyponatremia is considered as severe if [Na] is <115 or 110 mmol/L.In addition, all cases of hyponatremia treated with hypertonic or isotonic saline infusion, including hypovolemia with hyponatremia and absence of overt neurological manifestations, should be considered as severe because of the risks from saline infusion. Saline infusion for hypovolemic hyponatremia carries arguably the highest risk of inadvertently rapid rise in[Na].

Target Serum Sodium Concentration

The targeted rise in [Na] depends on the perceived urgency of treatment. In patients with pronounced hyponatremic symptoms, regardless of chronicity, a rapid rise of 4 to 6 mEq/L is recommended.Further rises may be required if symptoms persist after the initial rise in [Na]. For chronic hyponatremia, previous recommendations set a maximal rate of rise in [Na] at 12 mEq/L in the first 24 hours and a maximal final [Na] of 125 to 130 mEq/L.Because osmotic myelinolysis was observed in patients achieving the desired rate of rise in [Na],the current target rise in [Na] is set at 6 to 8 mEq/L in 24 hours, 12 to 14 mEq/L in 48 hours, and 14 to 16 mEq/L in 72 hours.Prevention of hypernatremia during treatment of hyponatremia is imperative.

### Hypertonic saline in the traumatic hypovolemic shock: meta-analysis [^e07e96e7]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

A wealth of evidence from animal experiments has indicated that hypertonic saline (HS) maybe a better choice for fluid resuscitation in traumatic hypovolemic shock in comparison with conventional isotonic saline. However, the results of several clinical trials raised controversies on the superiority of fluid resuscitation with HS. This meta-analysis was performed to better understand the efficacy of HS in patients with traumatic hypovolemic shock comparing with isotonic saline.

Materials and Methods

According to the search strategy, we searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, which was completed on October 2013. After literature searching, two investigators independently performed the literature screening, assessment of quality of the included trials, and data extraction. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by a third investigator if needed. The outcomes included mortality, blood pressure, fluid requirement, and serum sodium.

Results

Six randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled risk ratio for mortality at discharge was 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82-1.14), whereas the pooled mean difference for the change in systolic blood pressure from baseline and the level of serum sodium after infusion was 6.47 (95% CI, 1.31-11.63) and 7.94 (95% CI, 7.38-8.51), respectively. Current data were insufficient to evaluate the effect of HS on the fluid requirement for the resuscitation.

Conclusions

The present meta-analysis was unable to demonstrate a clinically important improvement in mortality after the HS administration. Moreover, we observed HS administration maybe accompanied with significant increase in blood pressure and serum sodium.

### Hypertonic saline and desmopressin: a simple strategy for safe correction of severe hyponatremia [^1eea8c2b]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Prompt correction of severe hyponatremia is important, but correction also must be limited to avoid iatrogenic osmotic demyelination. Expert opinion recommends that serum sodium level not be increased by more than 10-12 mEq/L in any 24-hour period and/or 18 mEq/L in any 48-hour period. However, inadvertent overcorrection is common, usually caused by the unexpected emergence of a water diuresis.

Study Design

Quality improvement report.

Setting & Participants

All 25 patients admitted to a community teaching hospital between October 1, 2008, and September 30, 2011, who were treated for serum sodium level <120 mEq/L with concurrently administered desmopressin and hypertonic saline solution.

Quality Improvement Plan

Concurrently administered desmopressin (1-2 µg parenterally every 6-8 hours) and hypertonic saline with weight-based doses adjusted to increase the serum sodium concentration by 6 mEq/L, avoiding inadvertent overcorrection of severe hyponatremia.

Outcomes

Rate of correction of hyponatremia, predictability of response to the combination, adverse events related to therapy.

Measurements

Rate of correction of hyponatremia at 4, 24, and 48 hours; administered dose of 3% saline solution, salt tablets, and potassium; predicted increase in serum sodium level.

Results

Mean changes in serum sodium levels during the first and second 24 hours of therapy were 5.8 ± 2.8 (SD) and 4.5 ± 2.2 mEq/L, respectively, without correction by >12 mEq/L in 24 hours or >18 mEq/L in 48 hours and without a decrease during therapy. There was no significant difference between actual and predicted increases during the first 24 hours. There was no adverse effect associated with therapy.

Limitations

Without concurrent controls, we cannot be certain that outcomes are improved. Balance studies were not performed.

Conclusions

Combined 3% saline solution and desmopressin appears to be a valid strategy for correcting severe hyponatremia, but studies comparing the regimen with other therapeutic strategies are needed.

Results

A total of 81 patients with TBI were enrolled into the study. Baseline demographics are presented in Table 1. Demographics were representative of the patient population with TBI commonly seen in the study ICU [-]. Sixty-eight patients (84%) received 3% sodium chloride boluses only. The remaining patients received a combination of 3% and 7.5% sodium chloride boluses, and/or continuous infusions of 3% sodium chloride.

Table 1 
Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics

Data presented as mean ± standard deviation, median (interquartile range), or number (%) of patients. n = 81.

A total of 1,230 serum sodium values (sodium range, 118 to 174 mEq/l) and 7,483 ICP values (ICP range, 0 to 159 mmHg) were collected. Figure 1 shows patients' serum sodium concentrations and their corresponding maximum ICP. Overall, no significant correlation was seen (R 2 = 0.0052). There was no significant correlation between serum sodium and maximum ICP for subgroups of patients with a baseline ICP < 25 mmHg or ≥ 25 mmHg (R 2 = 0.0003 and 0.0134, respectively). Furthermore, no correlation between these variables was seen when patients were grouped by GCS score (GCS 3 to 8, R 2 = 0.0045; GCS 9 to 12, R 2 = 0.0010; GCS 13 to 15, R 2 = 0.3084). The association between the change in serum sodium concentration and change in ICP is depicted in Figure 2. The correlation between these two variables was poor (R 2 = 0.0111). Finally, correlations of serum sodium and ICP analyzed for each patient were poor, as indicated by the number of patients in each R 2 quartile (Table 2). These results were similar for the entire patient group or when analyzed by subgroups that might affect ICP control (Table 2).

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of moderately symptomatic patients, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to consider administering a single infusion of 3% hypertonic saline (150 mL IV, over 20 minutes) immediately.

### Electrolyte disorders related emergencies in children [^a4b8c0fe]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremic encephalopathy is a medical emergency that requires early recognition and treatment with hypertonic saline 3% NaCl bolus 2 ml/kg with a maximum of 100 mL. If symptoms persist, the bolus should be repeated no more than two times. Before pursuing additional diagnostic evaluations, it is essential to administer appropriate therapy to avoid potential harm to the patient due to treatment delays. In cases of symptomatic hyponatremia, it is recommended to aim for a safe increase of approximately 5–6 mmol/L in serum sodium concentration within the first one or two hours. However, it is crucial to avoid correcting serum sodium levels by more than 10 mmol/L within the first 24 h of therapy and by more than 20 mmol/L within 48 h to prevent potential complications. Overcorrection of hyponatremia can lead to cerebral demyelination with severe neurologic symptoms. However, this complication primarily manifests in cases of chronic hyponatremia as there have been no reported instances of cerebral demyelination in children treated with hypertonic saline for hyponatremia. For patients with subacute or chronic hyponatremia, cerebral edema is prevented by the adaptive mechanism of the brain. Therefore, rapid correction of sodium is not necessary in chronic hyponatremia.

Acute or symptomatic hyponatraemia

As shown in Figure 2, hypertonic saline (typically 3% NaCl) is recommended for the treatment of acute or symptomatic hyponatraemia. Hypertonic saline is an effective and potentially life-saving treatment for cerebral oedema caused by hyponatraemia, as the high extracellular Na + concentration immediately removes water from the intracellular space. In case of patients with hypervolemic hyponatraemia, hypertonic saline can be combined with loop diuretics.

Figure 2. 
Algorithm for the management of hyponatraemia in patients with stroke.

In every step of hyponatraemia treatment, physicians should rigorously search for and stop non-essential fluids, medications and other factors that can contribute to or provoke hyponatraemia. In addition, cause-specific treatment is strongly recommended.

In case of severe symptoms, regardless of hyponatraemia being acute or chronic, intravenous administration of 150 ml 3% hypertonic saline over 20 min two to three times as needed is recommended until symptoms are resolved or until a target of 5 mmol/l Na + increase is achieved during the first hour (Figure 2). If these do not happen, infusion of 3% hypertonic saline should be continued aiming for an additional 1 mmol/l/h Na + increase until serum Na + concentration increases 10 mmol/l in total or it reaches 130 mmol/l, whichever occurs first. Of note, physicians should not expect patients with severe symptoms to fully recover immediately, as brain needs some time to fully recover. They should also be aware that sometimes it may not be possible to assess an improvement in symptoms, such as in the case of a stroke patient, who can also be intubated and sedated. Finally, the contribution of any potassium (K +) correction to an increase in Na + concentrations should be considered and can be estimated with the formula of Adrogue–Madias: expected change in serum Na + = [(infusate Na + + infusate K +) – serum Na +) / (total body water + 1]. Of note, the estimated total body water (litre) is calculated as ~50% of body weight approximately (0.6 in non-elderly men and 0.5 in non-elderly women; 0.5 and 0.45 in elderly men and women, respectively).

In case of moderate symptoms or acute asymptomatic hyponatraemia exceeding 10 mmol/l, a single intravenous infusion of 150 ml 3% hypertonic saline over 20 min is recommended (Figure 2).

### Hypertonic saline: a clinical review [^69e7d69b]. Neurosurgical Review (2007). Low credibility.

Literature suggest that hypertonic saline (HTS) solution with sodium chloride concentration greater than the physiologic 0.9% can be useful in controlling elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and as a resuscitative agent in multiple settings including traumatic brain injury (TBI). In this review, we discuss HTS mechanisms of action, adverse effects, and current clinical studies. Studies show that HTS administered during the resuscitation of patients with a TBI improves neurological outcome. HTS also has positive effects on elevated ICP from multiple etiologies, and for shock resuscitation. However, a prospective randomized Australian study using an aggressive resuscitation protocol in trauma patients showed no difference in amount of fluids administered during prehospital resuscitation, and no differences in ICP control or neurological outcome. The role of HTS in prehospital resuscitation is yet to be determined. The most important factor in improving outcomes may be prevention of hypotension and preservation of cerebral blood flow. In regards to control of elevated ICP during the inpatient course, HTS appears safe and effective. Although clinicians currently use HTS with some success, significant questions remain as to the dose and manner of HTS infusion. Direct protocol comparisons should be performed to improve and standardize patient care.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte abnormality affecting hospitalized patients. 1 It is an independent predictor for mortality and is associated with increased length of hospital stay and higher costs. The most serious potential complication is hyponatremic encephalopathy, a medical emergency that can result in death or irreversible brain injury if inadequately treated. 2 Hypertonic saline is a safe and effective means of correcting hyponatremia. 2-4 A rare yet serious complication from excessive correction of chronic hyponatremia is the development of cerebral demyelination.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage—hypertonic sodium solutions (HTS) dosing and sodium targets: In patients with SAH, studies titrating HTS to a target serum sodium of 145–155 mEq/L included a retrospective cohort in which the total sample was robust (n=215) but only 38 had SAH, and there was not a statistically significant difference in episodes of critically elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) or neurological outcomes; accordingly, the panel felt the available data prevented endorsement of targeting a specific serum sodium concentration to improve ICP, cerebral edema, or neurological outcomes, while noting enough consistency across studies to suggest symptom-based bolus dosing of HTS as an effective means of reducing ICP and cerebral edema; at present, there are insufficient data to support improved neurological outcome regardless of administration strategy.

Regarding medical management for hypernatremia, more specifically with respect to fluid replacement, AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend to consider correcting hypernatremia in adult patients at a rate of 12 mEq/L over 24 hours. Avoid increasing serum sodium again for therapeutic purposes if the recommended correction rate is exceeded.

### The relationship between serum sodium and intracranial pressure when using hypertonic saline to target mild hypernatremia in patients with head trauma [^006347f5]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Conversely, data from Shackford and colleagues support the current study. They prospectively compared the use of continuous infusion of 1.6% HTS (n = 18) versus lactated Ringer's solution (n = 16) in patients with TBI. There was no difference in mean ICP between groups, and the number of daily interventions for ICP management was higher on days 1 and 5 for patients who received HTS. The authors attributed these findings to a trend for lower admission GCS scores in the HTS group. Similarly, Qureshi and colleagues evaluated the use of continuous infusion of 2 to 3% saline (n = 36) versus normal saline (n = 48) in patients with TBI. In-hospital mortality was higher in patients who received HTS (odds ratio, 3.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 10.2), despite no difference in admission GCS scores or the number of interventions for ICP management between groups.

Overall, the four previous studies in this area and the current study show mixed results. Two studies suggested that increasing the serum sodium improved ICP control (total n = 58) and two did not (total n = 113). The fifth study suggested that continuous infusion of HTS may be detrimental. As such, these results call into question the targeting of mild hypernatremia for ICP control.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — acute in-hospital treatment recommendations—Oral and IV hypotonic or isotonic hydration should be avoided early in the management of EAH, although it may be appropriate in certain clinical contexts once sodium correction has been initiated or hypovolemia is confirmed. Recommendation grade: 1C. With suspected EAH, and particularly in those with altered mental status, sodium estimation should be obtained as rapidly as possible after hospital arrival. Recommendation grade: 1A. A rapid assessment for signs and symptoms of cerebral edema or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema should be done in all patients with possible EAH. Recommendation grade: 1A. Severe EAH biochemically confirmed or symptomatic EAH should be treated with a 100-mL bolus of IV HTS, which can be repeated twice at 10-min intervals (3 doses in total) or until improvement of neurologic symptoms, with the aim of acutely increasing serum sodium concentration by about 4 to 5 mmol·L−1 and reversing cerebral edema. Recommendation grade: 1A.

### Dysnatremia at ICU admission and functional outcome of cardiac arrest: insights from four randomised controlled trials [^6db81f89]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Few studies have investigated interventions designed to modify serum sodium levels after cardiac arrest. In an RCT, hypertonic saline infusion (7.2% NaCl) during resuscitation for OHCA did not affect survival but induced a small yet significant increase in the proportion of patients whose CPC was 1 or 2 at hospital discharge (OR, 2.9; 95%CI 1.004–8.5). The intervention significantly increased serum sodium to a mean of 162 ± 36 mmol/L, but this effect was short-lived, with near-normal levels at ICU admission in the hospital. That hypernatremia was not associated with the functional outcome in our study might indicate either that hypernatremia early after cardiac arrest does not have adverse effects or that hypernatremia is merely a marker for other physiological variables or comorbidities. A matched-pair study indicated that the same strategy significantly increased the proportion of patients who achieved ROSC (OR, 2.19; 95%CI 1.6–3.0). However, in an RCT in patients with traumatic brain injury, a continuous infusion of 20% hypertonic saline failed to improve the day-180 functional outcome. RCTs in patients with post-cardiac-arrest brain injury face major obstacles: no reproducible and effective triage tool is available, the multiple interventions used for resuscitation may affect serum sodium levels, any possible added benefits from altering serum sodium levels may be small and therefore difficult to detect compared to the combined effects of all the other treatments used, and the use of placebos in patients with cardiac arrest raises ethical concerns. Although not recommended in current guidelines outside specific situations, bicarbonate infusion during resuscitation is often used in North America and may act in part via effects on serum sodium levels and not only on metabolic acidosis. In a swine model, hypertonic sodium lactate infusion during or after cardiac-arrest resuscitation increased natremia and plasma osmolarity, improved haemodynamics, and decreased the brain injury marker glial fibrillary acid protein in plasma. The intravenous fluids frequently injected after the ROSC to prevent or treat post-resuscitation shock also affect natremia. In an RCT in 11 052 patients, including 486 with traumatic brain injury, a balanced solution was compared to 0.9% saline (containing about 10% more sodium). The day-90 mortality rate was slightly but significantly higher in the balanced-solution group (aOR, 1.48; 95%CI 1.03–2.12; p = 0.02) In a post hoc analysis of data from the SMART trial in unselected ICU patients, outcomes were compared in the subgroups with traumatic brain injury (698 given balanced crystalloid and 665 given 0.9% saline). Day-30 mortality was not significantly higher in the balanced-crystalloid group (aOR, 1.03; 95%CI 0.60–1.75; p = 0.913), although the risk of either in-hospital death or discharge to another medical facility was significantly increased (aOR, 1.38; 95%CI 1.02–1.86; p = 0.04). In addition to intravenous fluid administration, other interventions also affect serum sodium levels. Thus, therapeutic hypothermia at 33 °C is associated with a mild increase in natremia. Finally, in patients with dysnatremia, the speed of natremia correction, and not only the natremia abnormalities themselves, may affect outcomes. Thus, rapid natremia correction was historically associated with osmotic demyelination syndrome in unselected patients admitted to the hospital with hyponatremia, although rapid correction was also associated with better survival in ICU patients.

### A randomized controlled trial of isotonic versus hypotonic maintenance intravenous fluids in hospitalized children [^c752fc49]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Isotonic saline has been proposed as a safer alternative to traditional hypotonic solutions for intravenous (IV) maintenance fluids to prevent hyponatremia. However, the optimal tonicity of maintenance intravenous fluids in hospitalized children has not been determined. The objective of this study was to estimate and compare the rates of change in serum sodium ([Na]) for patients administered either hypotonic or isotonic IV fluids for maintenance needs.

Methods

This was a masked controlled trial. Randomization was stratified by admission type: medical patients and post-operative surgical patients, aged 3 months to 18 years, who required IV fluids for at least 8 hours. Patients were randomized to receive either 0.45% or 0.9% saline in 5.0% dextrose. Treating physicians used the study fluid for maintenance; infusion rate and the use of additional fluids were left to their discretion.

Results

Sixteen children were randomized to 0.9% saline and 21 to 0.45% saline. Baseline characteristics, duration (average of 12 hours) and rate of study fluid infusion, and the volume of additional isotonic fluids given were similar for the two groups. [Na] increased significantly in the 0.9% group (+0.20 mmol/L/h [IQR +0.03, +0.4]; P = 0.02) and increased, but not significantly, in the 0.45% group (+0.08 mmol/L/h [IQR -0.15, +0.16]; P = 0.07). The rate of change and absolute change in serum [Na] did not differ significantly between groups.

Conclusions

When administered at the appropriate maintenance rate and accompanied by adequate volume expansion with isotonic fluids, 0.45% saline did not result in a drop in serum sodium during the first 12 hours of fluid therapy in children without severe baseline hyponatremia. Confirmation in a larger study is strongly recommended.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^689d1a7f]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Hypertonic sodium solution administration method—continuous infusion versus bolus dosing: Recommendations state There is insufficient evidence to support use of a continuous infusion of HTS targeting a serum sodium goal for the purpose of improving neurological outcomes; Due to insufficient evidence, we cannot recommend a specific dosing strategy for HTS to improve neurological outcomes in patients with cerebral edema; and Clinicians should avoid hyponatremia in patients with severe neurological injury due to the risk of exacerbating cerebral edema (good practice statement). The text adds that while the use of a continuous infusion of 3% NaCl is believed to be a common practice in neurocritical care, this strategy is not well studied, and Given the lack of evidence comparing these dosing strategies, it is not clear whether continuous or bolus dosing is preferable when targeting a goal serum sodium concentration. In a retrospective study of 162 patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), Maguigan et al. directly compared continuous versus bolus dose 3% NaCl for control of intracranial pressure (ICP) elevations, and No significant difference was found between the two administration strategies; There was no difference in ICP or mortality between the two groups.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^7af5b1f3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Sodium Concentration and Volume of Infused Saline

Table 1 shows the symbols for volumes and concentrations used in this report. Sodium concentration in commercial saline solutions represents 2 hypertonic (0.855 and 0.513 mol/L), 1 “isotonic” (0.154 mol/L), and 3 “hypotonic” (0.130, 0.077, and 0.034 mol/L) values.Sodium concentration in the infusate is usually 0.513 mol/L for hyponatremia with pronounced symptomsand 0.154 mol/L for volume replacement in patients with symptomatic hypovolemia.

Table 1. 
Symbols and Interpretations

The sodium concentration in the infusate should not be limited by the strength of the commercial saline solutions. Mixing of saline and dextrose in water can produce any desired sodium concentration by the use of formula 1 (Table 2), which can be of help in hypovolemic hyponatremia with minimal hyponatremic symptomatology, when a large volume of infusate must be reconciled with the need to produce only a modest rise in [Na]. A suitable sodium concentration of the infusate in this instance could be the target [Na] at 24 hours. For example, the target [Na] at 24 hours would be 117 mEq/L in a patient with hypovolemic hyponatremia and initial [Na] of 111 mEq/L. By formula 1, the addition of 0.316 L of dextrose in water to 1 L of 0.154 mol/L saline produces a sodium concentration of 117 mEq/L in the infusate.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^db6f669e]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Biochemical and symptomatic severity are not always well correlated, as patients with chronic hyponatremia may have very low serum sodium concentrations with minimal symptoms due to cerebral adaptation, yet patients with an acute precipitous fall in serum sodium, even to concentrations above 120 mmol/L, may present with severe symptoms. The presence of severe symptoms should prompt treatment with careful bolus hypertonic saline aiming for an increment in serum sodium of 4 to 6 mmol, based on clinical improvements seen in published cases. There is clinical evidence to support a 50% reduction in ICP with a pNa increase of this magnitude. A retrospective observational study of 68 patients with transtentorial herniation due to cerebral hemorrhage, stroke, or tumor but with normal serum sodium concentration (mean pNa 140 mmol/L), were administered a small, 30- to 60-mL bolus of very concentrated hypertonic saline (NaCl 23.4%, equivalent Na + to 240 mL of 3% NaCl). ICP reduced from 23 to 11 mm Hg over 24 hours, and reversal of herniation occurred in 75% of cases, predicted by a 5-mmol/L or greater increase in pNa (P =.001). There was no control group comparison, however—and this was not a hyponatremic cohort. Collectively, however, these studies illustrate the rationale for active intervention with hypertonic saline in symptomatic hyponatremia to reduce ICP and improve morbidity and mortality.

In patients definitively known to have acute hyponatremia, it is thought that pNa can be corrected (or allowed to correct) more rapidly, as the second phase of cerebral adaptation to low pNa (depletion of organic osmolytes) has not yet occurred (see Fig. 3). In practice, however, when a patient presents to hospital for care, it is often unclear whether their hyponatremia is acute or chronic. Even if there is a compelling history of water intoxication, endurance exercise with hypotonic fluid consumption, or recreational 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA/“ecstasy”) use that supports acuity, unless a reliable normal pNa measurement within the previous 24 hours it is available, it is not possible to confirm. While symptom-defined severe hyponatremia should always prompt treatment with hypertonic saline to achieve the initial small increment in serum sodium described earlier, in most cases it is necessary to assume chronicity and adopt conservative serum sodium correction targets from that point to avoid the risk of ODS (see “Osmotic Demyelination Syndrome”).

Severe traumatic brain injury—1.6% hypertonic saline versus lactated Ringer's (randomized controlled trial) in patients with GCS <13 reported that baseline ICP was higher and GCS lower in the hypertonic saline group; despite this, HTS effectively lowered ICP, ICP course was not different between groups, cumulative fluid balance was greater in the lactated Ringer group, daily serum sodium, osmolarity and ICP interventions were greater in the HTS group, and GOS was not different; study size was RCT N=34 comparing 1.6% saline to lactated Ringer's.

### The relationship between serum sodium and intracranial pressure when using hypertonic saline to target mild hypernatremia in patients with head trauma [^d18b7431]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

Effects of targeting mild hypernatremia

The current study is the largest to evaluate the correlation of serum sodium and ICP in patients with TBI. These retrospective results did not demonstrate a correlation between serum sodium and ICP. This finding was consistent when patient data were analyzed using multiple different methods and for multiple subgroups. The administration of HTS did not consistently result in increases in serum sodium as seen in Figure 2. This would suggest a reason for the lack of significant changes in ICP. It is unknown whether a more substantial increase in serum sodium would result in further decreases in ICP. Based on Figure 2, even serum sodium increases of > 2 mEq/l did not consistently result in a decrease in ICP.

Statistically, there were fewer mean interventions for ICP control in patients with mean serum sodium > 145 mEq/l. However, there was only a statistical difference on three of the 5 days studied. This finding is not clinically significant, as it is expected that patients with serum sodium < 145 mEq/l would receive more HTS doses in an attempt to achieve the goal for serum sodium (145 to 155 mEq/l). In fact, when HTS doses were excluded from the analyses, no difference in the number of interventions among groups was seen at any point in the study period. An alternative explanation is that serum sodium > 145 mEq/l truly did have a beneficial effect in decreasing the number of interventions. Overall, we feel that this is unlikely because there was no correlation between ICP and serum sodium in any of the analyses.

### Clinical management of SIADH [^9c2d486a]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte disorder and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) accounts for approximately one-third of all cases. In the diagnosis of SIADH it is important to ascertain the euvolemic state of extracellular fluid volume, both clinically and by laboratory measurements. SIADH should be treated to cure symptoms. While this is undisputed in the presence of grave or advanced symptoms, the clinical role and the indications for treatment in the presence of mild to moderate symptoms are currently unclear. Therapeutic modalities include nonspecific measures and means (fluid restriction, hypertonic saline, urea, demeclocycline), with fluid restriction and hypertonic saline commonly used. Recently vasopressin receptor antagonists, called vaptans, have been introduced as specific and direct therapy of SIADH. Although clinical experience with vaptans is limited at this time, they appear advantageous to patients because there is no need for fluid restriction and the correction of hyponatremia can be achieved comfortably and within a short time. Vaptans also appear to be beneficial for physicians and staff because of their efficiency and reliability. The side effects are thirst, polydipsia and frequency of urination. In any therapy of chronic SIADH it is important to limit the daily increase of serum sodium to less than 8-10 mmol/liter because higher correction rates have been associated with osmotic demyelination. In the case of vaptan treatment, the first 24 h are critical for prevention of an overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and the serum sodium should be measured after 0, 6, 24 and 48 h of treatment. Discontinuation of any vaptan therapy for longer than 5 or 6 days should be monitored to prevent hyponatremic relapse. It may be necessary to taper the vaptan dose or restrict fluid intake or both.

### Risk of overcorrection in rapid intermittent bolus vs slow continuous infusion therapies of hypertonic saline for patients with symptomatic hyponatremia: the SALSA randomized clinical trial [^3e6d9ba7]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Few high-quality studies have clarified whether hypertonic saline is best administered as slow continuous infusion (SCI) therapy or rapid intermittent bolus (RIB) therapy for symptomatic severe hyponatremia.

Objective

To compare the risk of overcorrection in RIB and SCI with hypertonic saline in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective, investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial enrolled 178 patients older than 18 years with moderately severe to severe hyponatremia and glucose-corrected serum sodium (sNa) levels of 125 mmol/L or less. Recruitment took place from August 24, 2016, until August 21, 2019, across emergency departments and wards of 3 general hospitals in the Republic of Korea.

Interventions

Either RIB or SCI of hypertonic saline, 3%, for 24 to 48 hours stratified by the severity of clinical symptoms.

Main Outcome and Measures

The primary outcome was overcorrection at any given period, defined as increase in the sNa level by greater than 12 or 18 mmol/L within 24 or 48 hours, respectively. Secondary and post hoc outcomes included efficacy and safety of the treatment approaches. The sNa concentrations were measured every 6 hours for 2 days.

Results

The 178 patients (mean [SD] age, 73.1 [12.2] years; 80 (44.9%) male; mean [SD] sNa concentrations, 118.2 [5.0] mmol/L) were randomly assigned to the RIB group (n=87) or the SCI group (n=91). Overcorrection occurred in 15 of 87 (17.2%) and 22 of 91 (24.2%) patients in the RIB and SCI groups, respectively (absolute risk difference, -6.9% [95% CI, -18.8% to 4.9%]; P=.26). The RIB group showed lower incidence of relowering treatment than the SCI group (36 of 87 [41.4%] vs 52 of 91 [57.1%] patients, respectively; absolute risk difference, -15.8% [95% CI, -30.3% to -1.3%]; P=.04; number needed to treat, 6.3). Groups did not differ in terms of efficacy in increasing sNa concentrations nor improving symptoms, but RIB, when compared with SCI, showed better efficacy in achieving target correction rate within 1 hour (intention-to-treat analysis: 28 of 87 (32.2%) vs 16 of 91 (17.6%) patients, respectively; absolute risk difference, 14.6% [95% CI, 2%-27.2%]; P=.02; number needed to treat, 6.8; per-protocol analysis: 21 of 72 (29.2%) vs 12 of 73 (16.4%) patients, respectively; absolute risk difference, 12.7% [95% CI, -0.8% to 26.2%]; P=.07). The statistical significance of the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were similar for all outcomes except for achieving the target correction rate within 1 hour.

Conclusions and Relevance

This randomized clinical trial found that both RIB and SIC therapies of hypertonic saline for treating hyponatremia were effective and safe, with no difference in the overcorrection risk. However, RIB had a lower incidence of therapeutic relowering treatment and tended to have a better efficacy in achieving sNa within 1 hour than SCI. RIB could be suggested as the preferred treatment of symptomatic hyponatremia, which is consistent with the current consensus guidelines.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: compilation of the guidelines [^cd2360f3]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common water balance disorder that often poses a diagnostic or therapeutic challenge. Therefore, guidelines were developed by professional organizations, one from within the United States (2013) and one from within Europe (2014). This review discusses the diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, comparing the two guidelines and highlighting recent developments. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from nonhypotonic hyponatremia. Hypotonic hyponatremia is further differentiated on the basis of urine osmolality, urine sodium level, and volume status. Recently identified parameters, including fractional uric acid excretion and plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic approach. The treatment for hyponatremia is chosen on the basis of duration and symptoms. For acute or severely symptomatic hyponatremia, both guidelines adopted the approach of giving a bolus of hypertonic saline. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for most forms of chronic hyponatremia, therapy to increase renal free water excretion is often necessary. Vasopressin receptor antagonists, urea, and loop diuretics serve this purpose, but received different recommendations in the two guidelines. Such discrepancies may relate to different interpretations of the limited evidence or differences in guideline methodology. Nevertheless, the development of guidelines has been important in advancing this evolving field.

### A randomized controlled trial of isotonic versus hypotonic maintenance intravenous fluids in hospitalized children [^da82aa30]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Firm conclusions regarding the best solution for maintenance IV fluids cannot be drawn from this small study. Larger studies, powered to detect differences in the incidence of clinically important adverse events such as symptomatic hyponatremia or hypernatremia and hypertension, in addition to differences in change in [Na], are needed. In addition, studies of longer duration would be useful. This study suggests that 0.45% saline does not result in a drop in [Na] during the first 12 hours of fluid therapy among children with a baseline [Na] > 133 mmol/L and < 145 mmol/L, if appropriate care is taken to restore volume deficits with isotonic fluids, and excessive fluid administration rates are avoided. However, confirmation of these results in a larger study is strongly recommended.

### Sodium and water perturbations in patients who had an acute stroke: clinical relevance and management strategies for the neurologist [^474a1ded]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

For acute symptomatic hyponatraemia, increasing serum sodium levels by 4–6 mmol/L can decrease the risk of herniation and stop seizure activity. Larger increases should be avoided and can be harmful to patients with chronic hyponatraemia. European guidelines in non-stroke patients recommend rapid hypertonic 3% saline infusion depending on severity of symptoms, with two 150 mL boluses over 20 min with a sodium level assessment between boluses,whereas US expert panels recommend 100 mL hypertonic 3% saline bolus over 10 min and repeated as needed for symptom management in severe clinical cases.We recommend that the rate of correction for acute, symptomatic hyponatraemia to be 8–10 mmol/L in the first 24 hours. Serum sodium levels need to be monitored closely to minimise the risk of overcorrection (ie, no faster than 10–12 mmol/L/day for the first 24 hours), and avoid the administration of isotonic fluids and large volumes of hypertonic fluids to patients with underlying congestive heart failure or chronic renal failure (two common comorbidities in patients who had an acute stroke), as this may lead to cardiac decompensation and pulmonary oedema. In hypovolaemic hyponatraemic patients who had an acute stroke, it is imperative to avoid an overly rapid rise in serum sodium levels when volume depletion is restored as an abrupt decrease in AVP secretion and a rapid diuresis may occur. Large volumes of urine excretion at this juncture indicates an inappropriate overcorrection of hypovolaemia.

Because most hyponatraemia cases are chronic, when there is doubt of the duration of hyponatraemia, the presumption should be that the patient has chronic hyponatraemia. In this setting, large increases in serum sodium levels (10 mmol/L in 24 hours or 18 mmol/L in 48 hours) should be avoided, unless the patient is actively seizing. In patients at high risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome (eg, hypokalaemia, alcoholism, liver disease and malnutrition), correction should not exceed 4–6 mmol/L/day, whereas in patients with low risk, target maximum rise of 4–8 mmol/L/day with a target maximum limit not to exceed 10–12 mmol/L in any 24 hours or 18 mmol/L in any 48 hours is recommended.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of moderately symptomatic patients, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to consider limiting the increase in serum sodium concentration to 10 mmol/L in the first 24 hours and 8 mmol/L during every 24 hours thereafter, until a serum sodium concentration of 130 mmol/L is reached.

Fig. 1 
Standardized Therapeutic Protocol of Hyponatremia at Our Institution. Details of the protocol was explained in the methods section. All the patients were evaluated to identify the causes of hyponatremia and received cause-specific treatments. Bolus infusion of 3% hypertonic saline was administered for patients with severe symptoms, until the symptoms improved. DDAVP, desmopressin; D5W, 5% dextrose in water; ECW, extra cellular water; i.v. intravenous injection; p.o. per os; SNa, serum sodium; UK, urine potassium; and UNa, urine sodium

Subsequently, we evaluated the SNa and urine sodium (UNa), urine potassium (UK), and urine output every 2–4 h during the first 48 h. Note that our remarkable degree of monitoring was to ensure safer and uniform treatment throughout the study.

We defined the initial 4-h urine output as “early urine output.” We compared the SNa to the total amount of UNa and UK (UNa + UK) to predict the possibility of a subsequent spontaneous increase in the SNa. In case the SNa was ≤ UNa + UK, hyponatremia was assumed not to be corrected spontaneously due to the absence of electrolyte-free water in the urine, and 3% hypertonic saline at a continuous rate of 0.5–1.0 mL/kg/h or diuretics were administered if hyponatremia persisted in the subsequent 4 h. Thus, 3% hypertonic saline was administered to patients with reduced ECW, and diuretics such as loop diuretics or tolvaptan were administered to patients without reduced ECW. Administration of 3% hypertonic saline was continued at 0.5–1.0 mL/kg/h until the SNa improved. We used this relatively aggressive protocol to avoid under-treatment, based on evidence that even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in both hospitalized and ambulatory patients.

Pediatric hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS) fluid therapy—initial management should focus on volume expansion and perfusion restoration, with a minimum initial bolus of 20 mL/kg of isotonic saline solution (0.9% NaCl) and assumed fluid deficits of approximately 12% to 15% of body weight; subsequently, 0.45% to 0.75% NaCl should be given to replace the deficit over 24 to 48 hours, and isotonic fluids are recommended initially then followed by more hypotonic (0.45%-0.75% saline solution) fluids, with isotonic fluids restarted if perfusion and hemodynamic status worsen as osmolality declines; administration of isotonic fluids (0.9% saline solution) during ongoing osmotic diuresis may increase serum sodium concentration, which is undesirable as it may perpetuate the hyperosmolar state.

The speed of a correction with 3% sodium chloride as a 100- to 150-ml intravenous bolus or continuous infusion depends on the severity and persistence of the symptoms and needs frequent biochemical monitoring. The rapid intermittent administration of hypertonic saline is preferred for treatment of symptomatic hyponatraemia. In asymptomatic mild hyponatraemia, an adequate solute intake with an initial fluid restriction (FR) of 500 ml/day adjusted according to the serum sodium (sNa) levels is preferred. Almost half of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) patients do not respond to FR as first-line therapy. At present, urea and tolvaptan are considered the most effective second-line therapies in SIADH. However, the evidence for guidance on the choice of second-line therapy of hypotonic hyponatraemia is lacking. Oral urea is considered to be a very effective and safe treatment. Mild and asymptomatic hyponatraemia is treated with adequate solute intake (salt and protein) and initial FR with adjustments based on sNa levels. Specific treatment with vaptans may be considered in either euvolaemic or hypervolaemic patients with high ADH activity. In order to ensure optimal patient outcome, close monitoring and readiness for administration of either hypotonic fluids or desmopressin may be crucial in the decision-making process for specific treatment and eventual overcorrection consequences. According to the guidelines, gradual correction and clinical evaluation is preferable over rapid normalization of sNa towards the laboratory reference ranges.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^785914a5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Management Protocol

Table 5 summarizes the management of hyponatremia with saline infusion. Closed system formulas (formulas 2 to 7) provide estimates of the required saline volume and allow comparison between desired and observed changes in [Na] and, therefore, provide the frame for identifying the source of their deviations and the guide for appropriate treatment changes. The first aim of treatment is to avoid undercorrection of hyponatremia.Prescription of the volume of saline infused by formula 4 or 6 is suitable for this purpose. Monitoring is critical when saline is infused, particularly in hypovolemic hyponatremia in which water diuresis, overestimation of initial body water, and initial focusing on volume rather than tonicity issues complicate the treatment. Monitoring, with reduced frequency of [Na] measurement (usually once daily), is essential during treatment of hyponatremia without saline infusion.

Table 5. 
Steps of the Management of Severe Hyponatremia

Many tests, especially urine chemistries and osmolality, cannot be obtained rapidly from all hospital laboratories. For this and other reasons, administration, along with saline, of loop diuretics (eg, furosemide) to make urine free water excretion more predictable may be helpful in managing hypovolemic hyponatremia. Although furosemide will initially increase urinary sodium and potassium excretion, it is reasonable to assume that the sum of urine sodium plus potassium concentration is equal to ≈75 mEq/L when a furosemide effect is present,, at least until direct laboratory measurements are available. Because patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia have reduced total body sodium and probably water, care must be taken to replace more than the predicted urinary electrolyte and water losses with infused saline.

Vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists may ultimately be extremely useful for treating complicated chronic hyponatremias.However, it is unclear how to best use these new agents at present. It is fair to say that the vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists appear to be very effective in the settings of heart failure, cirrhosis, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and safe when administered as monotherapy. – Unfortunately, these agents are currently extremely expensive. Moreover, we would stress that these agents should be avoided during saline infusion to prevent the hazards of excessive water diuresis.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^1d8f2e73]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Two recent studies have compared bolus vs slow infusion of hypertonic saline, and both reported results in favor of a bolus regimen. An Irish observational study compared outcomes for 22 hyponatremic patients (mean baseline pNa 120 mmol/L) treated with bolus 100 mL 3% NaCl, up to 3 doses, compared to a historical cohort of 28 patients managed with a relatively slow 20 mL/hour 3% NaCl infusion. Bolus hypertonic saline was associated with a faster elevation of serum sodium at 6 hours (median increase 6 mmol/L vs 3 mmol/L with infusion; P <.0001), and significantly greater improvement in GCS at 6 hours (median improvement 3 points vs 1 point; P <.0001), though with a greater need for reversal with IV dextrose and/or desmopressin, which occurred for 5 of 22 bolus patients (23%) vs none of the infusion patients (P =.008). There were no cases of ODS in either group, and pNa was similar at 24 hours. The nonrandomized and retrospective data for the control group limits the comparison, but the authors concluded that the faster neurological improvement with bolus therapy supports this regimen.

A larger randomized trial from Korea (SALSA) allocated 178 patients with hyponatremia pNa less than 125 mmol/L (mean pNa 118 mmol/L) to either bolus NaCl 3% (2 mL/kg, or 100 mL if weight unknown; repeated if persistent symptoms or insufficient pNa increment) or continuous infusion (0.5-1 mL/kg/h, titrated to aim for pNa increment 5-9 mmol/24 hours—a higher initial rate than the Irish historical cohort). They concluded that both therapies were effective and safe, with no statistically significant difference in overcorrection risk (17.2% with bolus vs 24.2% with infusion; P =.26); however, rapid intermittent bolus therapy had reduced requirement for therapeutic relowering and better efficacy in achieving improved pNa at 1 hour, supporting bolus therapy as the preferred treatment—consistent with current guidelines. Anecdotally, the exception is in cases of confirmed acute hyponatremia of less than 24 hours’ duration, where both bolus and infusion NaCl 3% may be required to achieve deliberate rapid sodium increase. A recent retrospective study compared a larger volume initial bolus 250ml with 100ml bolus and did not observe increased rates of overcorrection - but this is not widely reccommended at this stage.

Original figure, with reference to guidelines by Spasovski 2014 and Verbalis 2013.

Hypertonic saline is the agent of choice because it is immediately effective and titratable; it will reliably increase serum sodium irrespective of the underlying etiology, at least initially, as its osmolality (1026 mOsmol/L) exceeds that of maximal urine osmolality. It is not recommended to continue hypertonic saline beyond resolution of acute severe symptoms because of the risk of serum sodium overcorrection, which can occur in around 20% of cases (unless the hyponatremia is documented to be of acute duration < 24 hours, and rapid correction is tolerated) (see “Acute Severe Hyponatremia” and Fig. 7). Overcorrection risk is significantly higher if more than 2 boluses of 100 mL, or more than a single bolus of 150 mL, of 3% NaCl, are given. It has long been recognized that hypertonic saline will not necessarily have a long-term therapeutic effect in SIAD, as the administered sodium will eventually be excreted in the urine ; however, its immediate efficacy may be lifesaving.

Hypertonic saline is typically administered in a high-dependency setting or emergency resuscitation bay to allow for frequent monitoring. It is safe to administer NaCl 3% through a either a peripheral or central line. Despite this, some administration protocols erroneously call for a central line or place other restrictions on 3% NaCl use, such as a requirement for ICU admission. Resulting delays in hypertonic saline due to administrative barriers can have fatal consequences. In response to such restrictions, alternative approaches are sometimes used to circumvent these requirements, for example, using 2% hypertonic saline in some US hospitals instead of 3%. However, the osmolality of 2% NaCl (684 mmol/L) is not reliably higher than maximally concentrated urine and its use may delay symptomatic improvement; therefore, is not an adequate substitute for 3% NaCl. We recommend that nonevidence-based protocols that differ from current best practice be amended to facilitate peripheral administration of 3% NaCl and emergency administration in any hospital setting with appropriate monitoring, rather than recommending work-around alternative therapies.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^12fc5713]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American Expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. report of the hyponatremia registry [^5180895f]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Current management practices for hyponatremia (HN) are incompletely understood. The HN Registry has recorded diagnostic measures, utilization, efficacy, and outcomes of therapy for eu- or hypervolemic HN. To better understand current practices, we analyzed data from 3087 adjudicated adult patients in the registry with serum sodium concentration of 130 mEq/l or less from 225 sites in the United States and European Union. Common initial monotherapy treatments were fluid restriction (35%), administration of isotonic (15%) or hypertonic saline (2%), and tolvaptan (5%); 17% received no active agent. Median (interquartile range) mEq/l serum sodium increases during the first day were as follows: no treatment, 1.0 (0.0–4.0); fluid restriction, 2.0 (0.0–4.0); isotonic saline, 3.0 (0.0–5.0); hypertonic saline, 5.0 (1.0–9.0); and tolvaptan, 4.0 (2.0–9.0). Adjusting for initial serum sodium concentration with logistic regression, the relative likelihoods for correction by 5 mEq/l or more (referent, fluid restriction) were 1.60 for hypertonic saline and 2.55 for tolvaptan. At discharge, serum sodium concentration was under 135 mEq/l in 78% of patients and 130 mEq/l or less in 49%. Overly rapid correction occurred in 7.9%. Thus, initial HN treatment often uses maneuvers of limited efficacy. Despite an association with poor outcomes and availability of effective therapy, most patients with HN are discharged from hospital still hyponatremic. Studies to assess short- and long-term benefits of correction of HN with effective therapies are needed.

### Natriuresis and the extracellular volume expansion by hypertonic saline [^0d74fe41]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The mechanisms governing the duration of the extracellular fluid volume (ECF) expansion as a result of intravenous infusion of hypertonic saline solution are poorly understood. We hypothesized that the duration is closely related to the sodium excretion.

Materials and Methods

Six conscious splenectomized ewes with a mean body weight of 30 kg were given an intravenous infusion of 4 ml x kg(-1) of 7.5% saline solution on two occasions, one over a period of 5 min and another over a period of 20 min. Mass balance and volume kinetic calculations of the distribution and elimination of fluid were performed after repeated sampling of the plasma sodium concentration and the urinary excretion of water and sodium during 3 h.

Results

On considering the addition of sodium to and its excretion from the body, the plasma sodium concentration indicated a 10% dilution of the extracellular space. The volume expansion decayed at an average rate of 20% of the volume expansion per hour, which, however, varied greatly in the animals, depending on their capacity to excrete sodium. After 1 h, increasing natriuresis promoted translocation of water into the cells, which amounted to 25-35% of the total elimination. Computer simulations indicated that tripled natriuresis (up to approximately 750 mmol l(-1)) would increase the rate of elimination to 45% of the volume expansion per hour.

Conclusion

The sodium excretion was inversely proportional to the duration of the extracellular volume expansion by 7.5% saline.

### The relationship between serum sodium and intracranial pressure when using hypertonic saline to target mild hypernatremia in patients with head trauma [^d9c854ef]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Limited data suggest mild hypernatremia may be related to lower intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The practice at the study center has been to use hypertonic saline (HTS) to generate a targeted serum sodium of 145 to 155 mEq/l in patients with TBI. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between serum sodium values and ICP, and to evaluate the acute effect of HTS on ICP.

Methods

A retrospective review of patients who were admitted to the trauma ICU for TBI, had an ICP monitor placed, and received at least one dose of HTS between January 2006 and March 2011 was performed. Data were collected for up to 120 hours after ICP monitor placement. The primary outcome was the relationship between serum sodium and maximum ICP. Secondary outcomes were the relationship between serum sodium and the mean number of daily interventions for ICP control, and the acute effect of HTS on ICP during the 6 hours after each dose. Linear regression was used to analyze the primary outcome. Analysis of variance on ranks and repeated measures analysis of variance were used to evaluate the number of interventions and the acute effect of HTS on ICP, respectively.

Results

Eighty-one patients were enrolled with mean ± standard deviation age of 36 ± 15 years and median Glasgow Coma Scale score of 7 (interquartile range, 4 to 7). A total of 1,230 serum sodium values (range, 118 to 174 mEq/l) and 7,483 ICP values (range, 0 to 159 mmHg) were collected. There was no correlation between serum sodium and maximum ICP (R(2) = 0.0052). The overall mean ± standard deviation number of interventions for elevated ICP per day was 4.2 ± 2.9, 2.9 ± 2.0, and 2.6 ± 2.3 for patients with a mean serum sodium of < 145, 145 to 155, and > 155 mEq/l, respectively (P < 0.001). Regarding the acute effect of HTS on ICP, there was no statistical difference in mean ICP compared with baseline during hours 1 through 6 following HTS doses (baseline, 13.7 ± 8.4 mmHg; hour 1, 13.6 ± 8.3 mmHg; hour 2, 13.5 ± 8.8 mmHg; hour 3, 13.3 ± 8.7 mmHg; hour 4, 13.4 ± 8.7 mmHg; hour 5, 13.4 ± 8.3 mmHg; hour 6, 13.5 ± 8.3 mmHg; P = 0.84).

Conclusions

Serum sodium concentrations did not correlate with ICP values. These results warrant further evaluation and possible reassessment of sodium goals for ICP management in patients with TBI.

Therapies to decrease intracranial pressure (ICP) in acute liver failure (ALF)—hypertonic saline use is conditionally suggested and practical targets are specified: “We suggest using hypertonic saline in critically ill ALF patients who are at risk of developing intracranial hypertension (Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence).” Risk factors include “hyperammonemia (> 150 umol/L), high-grade hepatic encephalopathy or evidence of multiple organ failure.” In a single-center randomized controlled trial, “Thirty patients with ALF and grade III or IV encephalopathy were randomized. Patients in group 1 (n = 15) received the normal standard of care, patients in group 2 (n = 15) received standard care and hypertonic saline (30%) via infusion to maintain serum sodium levels of 145–155 mmol/L.” Monitoring and effects included that “ICP was monitored in all patients with a subdural catheter for up to 72 hours after inclusion. Serum sodium levels became significantly different from the levels observed in the control group at 6 hours. ICP decreased significantly relative to baseline over the first 24 hours in the treatment group but not in the control group.” Outcomes reported that “The occurrence rate of intracranial hypertension (ICP > 25 mm Hg or greater) was significantly higher in the control group. Mortality from intracranial hypertension was no different between group (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.13–3.44…).” Practical guidance notes that “Rise in serum sodium levels should be gradual,” “3% saline can be used to raise sodium levels,” and “Serum sodium levels should be maintained between 145 and 155 mmol/L as dictated by the clinical situation.”

### Is sodium chloride worth its salt? [^2d7ee5ce]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

The choice of fluid for resuscitation of the brain-injured patient remains controversial, and the 'ideal' resuscitation fluid has yet to be identified. Large volumes of hypotonic solutions must be avoided because of the risk of cerebral swelling and intracranial hypertension. Traditionally, 0.9% sodium chloride has been used in patients at risk of intracranial hypertension, but there is increasing recognition that 0.9% saline is not without its problems. Roquilly and colleagues show a reduction in the development of hyperchloremic acidosis in brain-injured patients given 'balanced' solutions for maintenance and resuscitation compared with 0.9% sodium chloride. In this commentary, we explore the idea that we should move away from 0.9% sodium chloride in favor of a more 'physiological' solution.

Key messages

• 	7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 is more effective than mannitol in the treatment of increased ICP

• 	A dose of 1.4 ml/kg 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 can be recommended as an initial dose

• 	The local dehydration of brain tissue after application of 7.2% NaCl/HES 200/0.5 seems to be the primary mechanism for the improved CPP

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^c932362c]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia, defined as a serum sodium (SNa) concentration of <135 mEq/L, is a water balance disorder, with a relative excess of body water in relation to sodium. Some reports have classified SNa ≤ 125 mEq/L as “profound” hyponatremia. Since profound hyponatremia is also associated with fatal complications such as brain herniation, appropriate treatments for hyponatremia have been discussed intensively worldwide. For example, urgent therapy using hypertonic saline is justified in life-threatening conditions caused by hyponatremia complicated with seizures and coma. In contrast, the problem of overcorrection makes the treatment of hyponatremia difficult because it can provoke osmotic demyelination (ODS), which is a dreaded neurologic complication associated with high mortality. Therefore, the international guidelines recommend limiting the increase of SNa to within 10 mEq/L and 18 mEq/L during the first 24 and 48 h, respectively, from the initiation of treatment for hyponatremia. To achieve the ideal correction rate of hyponatremia, several strategies including administration of desmopressin acetate (DDAVP), 3% hypertonic saline in combination with DDAVP, and re-lowering the SNa with 5% dextrose in water (D5W) have been introduced. However, there is a paucity of literature on the risk factors for overcorrection, especially in “Chronic” profound hyponatremia, which carries a greater risk of neurologic complications from overcorrection, even though several risk factors for ODS have been identified, including SNa ≤ 105 mEq/L at presentation, overcorrection itself, malnutrition, hypokalemia, and liver disease. We hypothesized that the identification of risk factors for overcorrection can improve the safety and efficacy of the treatment of chronic hyponatremia.

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^38f6f4fe]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Table 1 shows the characteristics of the study population. The median age was 78 years; 48.2% were male. Most patients (94.6%) were symptomatic and 3 (5.4%) had severe symptoms. Among the 3 patients with severe symptoms, only one received a bolus infusion of 3% hypertonic saline, because the other 2 patients’ symptoms had resolved by the time the nephrologists evaluated them. In contrast, 16 patients received 3% hypertonic saline at a continuous rate (Table 3). There were multiple causes for hyponatremia; 36 (64.3%) patients were diagnosed to have hypovolemic hyponatremia and 21 (37.5%) with hyponatremia secondary to poor solute intake (Table 1). Table 2 shows the patients’ laboratory data at presentation.The initial median SNa was 115 mEq/L (quartile, 111–119 mEq/L). Table 3 shows the treatments and outcomes after the nephrology consultation. Hydration with 0.9% saline for volume repletion was performed in 36 (64.3%) patients, maintenance fluid infusion with 0.9% saline was performed in 32 (57.1%) patients, and 3% hypertonic saline was administered in 17 (30.4%) patients. Loop diuretics (i.v.) were administered in 4 (7.1%) patients and tolvaptan per os (p.o.) in 4 (7.1%) patients. Prophylactic and therapeutic interventions for overcorrection included the use of D5W in 18 (32.1%) patients, free water intake in 2 (3.6%) patients, and DDAVP in 11 (19.6%) patients. The mean initial time of DDAVP administration was 8 h (range, 7–12 h) after the presentation. A total of 11 (19.6%) patients met the criteria for overcorrection: 9 (16.0%) patients in 24 h, 6 (10.7%) in 48 h, and 4 (7.1%) in both 24 and 48 h. Fortunately, none of the patients developed ODS during or after hyponatremia treatment in this study. Figure 2 shows the time course of SNa levels during the first 48 h after the treatment.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^1438df03]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are electrolyte disorders that can be associated with poor outcomes. Hyponatremia is considered mild when the sodium concentration is 130 to 134 mEq per L, moderate when 125 to 129 mEq per L, and severe when less than 125 mEq per L. Mild symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weakness, headache, and mild neurocognitive deficits. Severe symptoms of hyponatremia include delirium, confusion, impaired consciousness, ataxia, seizures, and, rarely, brain herniation and death. Patients with a sodium concentration of less than 125 mEq per L and severe symptoms require emergency infusions with 3% hypertonic saline. Using calculators to guide fluid replacement helps avoid overly rapid correction of sodium concentration, which can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome. Physicians should identify the cause of a patient's hyponatremia, if possible; however, treatment should not be delayed while a diagnosis is pursued. Common causes include certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption, very low-salt diets, and excessive free water intake during exercise. Management to correct sodium concentration is based on whether the patient is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Hypovolemic hyponatremia is treated with normal saline infusions. Treating euvolemic hyponatremia includes restricting free water consumption or using salt tablets or intravenous vaptans. Hypervolemic hyponatremia is treated primarily by managing the underlying cause (e.g., heart failure, cirrhosis) and free water restriction. Hypernatremia is less common than hyponatremia. Mild hypernatremia is often caused by dehydration resulting from an impaired thirst mechanism or lack of access to water; however, other causes, such as diabetes insipidus, are possible. Treatment starts with addressing the underlying etiology and correcting the fluid deficit. When sodium is severely elevated, patients are symptomatic, or intravenous fluids are required, hypotonic fluid replacement is necessary.

### Diagnosis and management of sodium disorders: hyponatremia and hypernatremia [^9abf1fb5]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are common findings in the inpatient and outpatient settings. Sodium disorders are associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Plasma osmolality plays a critical role in the pathophysiology and treatment of sodium disorders. Hyponatremia and hypernatremia are classified based on volume status (hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia). Sodium disorders are diagnosed by findings from the history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and evaluation of volume status. Treatment is based on symptoms and underlying causes. In general, hyponatremia is treated with fluid restriction (in the setting of euvolemia), isotonic saline (in hypovolemia), and diuresis (in hypervolemia). A combination of these therapies may be needed based on the presentation. Hypertonic saline is used to treat severe symptomatic hyponatremia. Medications such as vaptans may have a role in the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The treatment of hypernatremia involves correcting the underlying cause and correcting the free water deficit.

Large hemispheric infarction—osmotic therapy recommendations support mannitol or hypertonic saline only with clinical evidence of cerebral edema and specify monitoring strategies. We recommend using mannitol and hypertonic saline for reducing brain edema and tissue shifts in LHI only when there is clinical evidence of cerebral edema (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest using osmolar gap instead of serum osmolality to guide mannitol dosing and treatment duration (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence). Hypertonic saline dosing should be guided by serum osmolality and serum sodium (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Evidence notes no randomized studies comparing osmotic therapy regimens; both mannitol and hypertonic saline appear to be safe options without exacerbating tissue shifts.

### Comparison of isotonic and hypotonic intravenous maintenance fluids: a randomized clinical trial [^aae5ea39]. JAMA Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Use of hypotonic intravenous fluids for maintenance requirements is associated with increased risk of hyponatremia that results in morbidity and mortality in children. Clinical trial data comparing isotonic and hypotonic maintenance fluids in nonsurgical hospitalized pediatric patients outside intensive care units are lacking.

Objective

To compare isotonic (sodium chloride, 0.9%, and dextrose, 5%) with hypotonic (sodium chloride, 0.45%, and dextrose, 5%) intravenous maintenance fluids in a hospitalized general pediatric population.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this double-blind randomized clinical trial,we recruited 110 children admitted to a general pediatric unit of a tertiary care children's hospital from March 1, 2008, through August 31, 2012 (age range, 1 month to 18 years), with normal baseline serum sodium levels who were anticipated to require intravenous maintenance fluids for 48 hours or longer (intent-to-treat analyses). Children with diagnoses that required specific fluid tonicity and volumes were excluded.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive isotonic or hypotonic intravenous fluid at maintenance rates for 48 hours.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was mean serum sodium level at 48 hours. The secondary outcomes were mean sodium level at 24 hours, hyponatremia and hypernatremia, weight gain, hypertension, and edema. Confounding variables were included in multiple regression models. Post hoc analyses included change from baseline sodium level at 24 and 48 hours and subgroup analysis of children with primary respiratory diagnosis.

Results

Of 110 enrolled patients, 54 received isotonic fluids and 56 received hypotonic fluids. The mean (SD) sodium level at 48 hours was 139.9(2.7) mEq/L in the isotonic group and 139.6(2.6) mEq/L in the hypotonic group (95% CI of the difference, -0.94 to 1.74 mEq/L; P=.60). Two patients in the hypotonic group developed hyponatremia, 1 in each group developed hypernatremia, 2 in each group developed hypertension, and 2 in the isotonic group developed edema. Mean (SD) change from baseline to 48-hour sodium level was +1.3(2.9) vs -0.12(2.8) mEq/L, respectively (absolute difference, 1.4 mEq/L; 95% CI of the difference, -0.01 to 2.8 mEq/L; P=.05).

Conclusions and Relevance

Our study results support the notion that isotonic maintenance fluid administration is safe in general pediatric patients and may result in fewer cases of hyponatremia.

Table 2. 
Formulas

Volume, strength, and rate of saline infused are determined by the symptoms of hyponatremia or hypovolemia and the presenting [Na]. In the past, the required amount and volume of hypertonic saline were calculated by formulas 2 and 3 (Table 2), which do not take into account the effect of infused water on the change in [Na]. The Adrogue–Madias formula(formula 4 in Table 2), which calculates the predicted change in [Na] after infusion of 1 L of saline, accounts for the major factors that determine the changes in [Na] after the addition of saline to a closed system (initial [Na] and body water plus sodium concentration and volume of the infused saline). Not accounting for the water infused has caused errors in calculations of the changes in [Na] resulting from hypertonic infusions in experimental settings. – The magnitude of the error increased as the infused volume increased.

Although formula 4 represents a conceptual improvement in the prediction of changes in [Na] after saline infusion, it cannot compute directly the amount of saline required for a desired rise in [Na] or the predicted rise in [Na] after infusion of a volume of saline that is not a multiple of 1 L. To address these issues, we developed formulas 5 to 7 (Table 2) accounting for the same factors as the Adrogue–Madias formula.

CI-AKI fluid administration—We recommend i.v. volume expansion with either isotonic sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate solutions, rather than no i.v. volume expansion, in patients at increased risk for CI-AKI. (1A) The fluids tested for prevention include hypotonic saline (0.45%), isotonic saline (0.9%) and isotonic sodium bicarbonate, and most studies suggest fluids should be started at least 1 h before and continued for 3–6 hours after contrast-media administration; a “good” urine output (> 150 ml/h) in the 6 hours after the radiological procedure has been associated with reduced rates of AKI.

Table 3 
Number of interventions for intracranial hypertension

Data presented as mean ± standard deviation number of interventions per day, providing a summary of the mean number of interventions for intracranial pressure control on days 1 to 5. Patients were divided into three groups based on their mean serum sodium value on each day of the study period. For each day, statistical comparisons were performed for the number of interventions required in each group.

The acute effect of HTS on ICP was evaluated for 322 HTS boluses in 72 patients. Overall, the mean ± standard deviation ICP did not significantly change in the 6 hours following a HTS bolus (baseline, 13.7 ± 8.4 mmHg; hour 1, 13.6 ± 8.3 mmHg; hour 2, 13.5 ± 8.8 mmHg; hour 3, 13.3 ± 8.7 mmHg; hour 4, 13.4 ± 8.7 mmHg; hour 5, 13.4 ± 8.3 mmHg; hour 6, 13.5 ± 8.3 mmHg; P = 0.84). When poor responders were analyzed separately, no significant change was again noted (baseline, 12.5 ± 6.1 mmHg; hour 1, 13.2 ± 6.6 mmHg; hour 2, 13 ± 6.7 mmHg; hour 3, 12.6 ± 5.8 mmHg; hour 4, 12.5 ± 5.6 mmHg; hour 5, 12.6 ± 6.1 mmHg; hour 6, 12.5 ± 5.7 mmHg; P = 0.16). Good responders demonstrated a statistical trend toward lower ICP values following a HTS bolus (baseline, 16.1 ± 11.2 mmHg; hour 1, 14.3 ± 10.8 mmHg; hour 2, 14.3 ± 11.7 mmHg; hour 3, 14.8 ± 12.3 mmHg; hour 4, 15.1 ± 12.5 mmHg; hour 5, 15 ± 11.3 mmHg; hour 6, 15.4 ± 11.4 mmHg; P = 0.068). Figure 3 shows the change in ICP following a HTS bolus for all patients, poor responders and good responders. Demographics for patients in the poor and good responder groups were not different except for the median (interquartile range) Injury Severity Score (poor responders, 30 (25 to 38); good responders, 38 (29 to 43); P = 0.029).

### Sodium and water perturbations in patients who had an acute stroke: clinical relevance and management strategies for the neurologist [^f88783c7]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of hypernatraemia

Effective management of hypernatraemia in patients who had an acute strokes requires addressing the underlying aetiology in preventing further loss of water or hypertonic sodium gain. Once eunatraemia is achieved, treatment could involve, for example, withholding loop diuretics, administering insulin in the case of hyperglycaemic, treating vomiting or diarrhoea, withholding/adjusting hypertonic tube feeds or administering desmopressin (DDAVP) for those who have developed DI. Careful history and clinical examination to determine the volume status and measurement of urine sodium and osmolality will help to ascertain the aetiology. Patients with hypovolaemia on presentation should be resuscitated with hypotonic fluids regardless of the presenting serum sodium level until vital signs are normalised. The choice of fluid replacement for hypernatraemia should be dilute relative to serum in order to replace the water deficit. This requires the estimation of the amount of water that has been lost and can be calculated by using the formula proposed by Adrogué et al.

Water deficit (L) = [(measured sodium/normal sodium) – 1]

The choice of replacement solution to be given and infusion rate are important factors to avoid overcorrection of the hypernatraemia. Serum sodium levels should be corrected by no more than 8 to 15 mmol/L/day, which may take longer than 48 hours in patients with severe hypernatraemia (>160 mmol/L).An exception is patients with acute hypernatraemia (<48 hours) who can be safely be corrected rapidly at a rate of 1 mmol/L/hour. As in management of hyponatraemia, frequent measurement of serum sodium levels is critical for monitoring the response to therapy and adjusting the rate or choice of intravenous fluid. Except for hypovolaemic patients requiring resuscitation with isotonic 0.9% saline, all other patients should receive either half 0.45% saline or 5% dextrose water infusions to replace the water deficit and ongoing fluid losses.

### Sodium and water perturbations in patients who had an acute stroke: clinical relevance and management strategies for the neurologist [^2b4b9bab]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with hypervolaemic hypernatraemia present a different therapeutic challenge as the volume expansion in these patients inhibits the release of AVP, thereby promoting water excretion in the urine. Cessation of the inciting factors and administration of water is usually the initial step. Treatment with loop diuretics would enhance more aquaresis than natriuresis, thereby exacerbating the hypertonicity. Infusing dextrose 5% water would address the hypertonicity, but might worsen the volume overload state. Simultaneous use of intravenous dextrose 5% water and loop diuretics can be used to lower the serum sodium in addition to achieving a net negative total body water balance. Rarely, haemodialysis has been used, especially in cases where hydration with or without diuresis have failed to bring the sodium level down to the desired target or in patients with worsening renal function in whom there are indications for renal replacement therapy.

For patients with DI, DDAVP treatment can be administered orally, intranasally, subcutaneously or intravenously. Thiazide diuretics rarely can be considered as it decreases urine volume and increase urine osmolality. The mechanism of the paradoxical antidiuretic effect of thiazides in DI is thought to be related to volume contraction, leading to an increase in proximal tubular reabsorption of water and sodium thereby decreasing distal delivery of water and subsequent excretion.

Despite the paucity of data, hyperosmolar agents (eg, mannitol and hypertonic 3% saline) are still used by some clinicians in patients who had an acute stroke to induce hypernatraemia in order to decrease raised intracranial pressure and to prevent cerebral oedema.As there are currently no accepted consensus guidelines regarding optimal serum sodium levels in patients who had an acute stroke, we recommend that hyperosmolar agents be used cautiously in bolus form only to selected patients (those without risk factors, eg, alcoholism, liver disease, renal disease and previous strokes that would suggest a poorer prognosis) and closely monitor serum sodium levels targeting levels to not exceed 145 mmol/L. Box 3 summarises our recommendations for management of hyponatraemia and hypernatraemia in patients who had an acute stroke.

### Treatment of hyponatremia [^6e8f49c0]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We review literature from the past 18 months on the treatment of hyponatremia. Therapy must address both the consequences of the untreated electrolyte disturbance (including fatal cerebral edema due to acute water intoxication) and the complications of excessive therapy (the osmotic demyelination syndrome).

Recent Findings

Correction of hyponatremia by 4-6 mEq/l within 6 h, with bolus infusions of 3% saline if necessary, is sufficient to manage the most severe manifestations of hyponatremia. Planning therapy to achieve a 6 mEq/l daily increase in the serum sodium concentration can avoid iatrogenic brain damage by staying well clear of correction rates that are harmful. Conservative correction goals are wise because inadvertent overcorrection is common. Administration of desmopressin to halt a water diuresis can help prevent overcorrection; if overcorrection occurs, therapeutic relowering of the serum sodium concentration is supported by data in experimental animals and was found to be safe in a small observational clinical trial. Even mild and apparently asymptomatic hyponatremia may lead to falls because of impaired gait, and an increased likelihood of fracture because of hyponatremia-induced osteoporosis, a newly described entity. Recently approved vasopressin antagonists now make it possible to normalize the serum sodium concentration on a chronic basis, but practical considerations have limited their use.

### Advanced life support. drug therapy and vascular access [^4238933e]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Mannitol or hypertonic saline for acute major traumatic brain injury—Red Cross Guidelines state that mannitol or hypertonic saline may be given to patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who have a monitored elevation in intracranial pressure (ICP), signs of transtentorial herniation prior to ICP monitoring, or progressive neurological deterioration not due to extracranial causes. Mannitol is effective for control of raised ICP at doses of 0.25 to 1 gram per kilogram (kg) of body weight (0.25 g/kg to 1 g/kg). Arterial hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg) should be avoided in patients with intracranial hypertension. For pediatric patients with major TBI and acute intracranial hypertension, hypertonic saline is preferred over mannitol to lower the ICP to less than 20 mmHg. A bolus of hypertonic saline (3%) is recommended at a dose between 2 and 5 milliliters (ml) per kilogram of body weight (2 ml/kg to 5 ml/kg) over 10 to 20 minutes. A continuous infusion of 3% hypertonic saline is suggested at a rate between 0.1 mL/kg and 1.0 ml/kg per hour, and the minimum dose needed to maintain ICP less than 20 mmHg is suggested. A bolus of 23.4% hypertonic saline is suggested for refractory ICP; the suggested dose is 0.5 ml/kg with a maximum of 30 ml. A serum sodium level of greater than 170 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L) for a sustained period (greater than 72 hours) should be avoided, and a sustained serum sodium greater than 160 mEq/L should be avoided.
