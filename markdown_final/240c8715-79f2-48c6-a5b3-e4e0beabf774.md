## Question

How can active tuberculosis be ruled out?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to rule out active tuberculosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about pretest probability from symptoms and risk factors. Then, I should review first-line imaging and when to escalate to CT. Next, I will examine NAAT-based diagnostics and specimen choices, including when to repeat testing. After that, I need to consider special populations such as people living with HIV, the immunocompromised, and children. Then, I should confirm the role and timing of culture as the gold standard and clarify what immunologic tests can and cannot do. Finally, I will integrate decision thresholds, likelihoods, extrapulmonary workflows, and infection control and public health steps before summarizing key principles and cautions in probabilistic "rule-out" decisions [^113TaV49] [^1177QJon].

> Let me first confirm how to set pretest probability, because everything hinges on that. I need to screen for cardinal symptoms such as cough for two or more weeks, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and hemoptysis, and incorporate risk factors like HIV, immunosuppression, recent exposure, residence in high-incidence settings, homelessness, and incarceration, while remembering the WHO-recommended four-symptom screen (W4SS) that is validated in people living with HIV to triage further testing, since a negative W4SS lowers immediate suspicion but does not by itself exclude TB in high-risk hosts [^116r5AsX] [^111qqcEm]. Hold on, I should verify the principle here: asymptomatic individuals with no risk factors have very low pretest probability, whereas symptomatic high-risk patients have higher pretest probability that will demand more aggressive evaluation and a lower threshold for additional testing or empiric therapy [^1177QJon].

> Next, I will examine the initial radiologic evaluation, but I need to be careful not to over-interpret it. Chest radiography is the appropriate first-line study for suspected pulmonary TB, and I should escalate to chest CT if the radiograph is non-diagnostic but clinical suspicion remains or I need to better delineate subtle parenchymal disease, cavitation, or lymphadenopathy; however, I must remember that normal imaging cannot definitively rule out TB, particularly in immunocompromised hosts or very early disease, so a normal CXR should not falsely reassure me if pretest probability is high [^115atxPC] [^1177QJon] [^111ApEth].

> I will now examine nucleic acid amplification testing because it is the primary diagnostic tool in most patients with suspected pulmonary TB. The WHO recommends Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra as the initial diagnostic test for adults and children with signs and symptoms or abnormal chest imaging, given its rapid turnaround and ability to detect rifampin resistance, which aids early management and infection control planning [^113TaV49] [^115mG3qM] [^1139pGZL]. Wait, let me verify that I am not sidelining culture; I'll come back to culture as the definitive test for confirmation and susceptibility, recognizing that NAAT is the initial test, not the only test [^1177QJon].

> Let me think about specimen selection and test repetition because missed details here can derail the workup. For pulmonary disease, sputum is preferred, including induced sputum if necessary; for extrapulmonary disease, I should test specimens from the involved site, and for suspected TB meningitis specifically, Xpert on CSF is recommended as an initial test because it outperforms smear and can sometimes be faster than culture for actionable information [^114bT1Xi] [^113TaV49]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost generalized pediatric recommendations on repeat testing to all patients; the WHO specifically recommends avoiding repeat Xpert in children when pretest probability is less than 5% and the initial test is negative, whereas repeat testing can be considered in children if pretest probability is at least 5% and the initial test is negative, so I should not over-apply pediatric guidance to adults without evidence [^1174Uuq2] [^1133fvYB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single negative NAAT, especially in paucibacillary disease. I need to ensure I recognize that NAAT sensitivity is lower in smear-negative disease, in people living with HIV, in children, and in many extrapulmonary sites, which means that a negative NAAT does not categorically rule out active TB when pretest probability is high and further testing and cultures remain necessary [^113TaV49] [^1177QJon].

> For people living with HIV, I should confirm the screening and diagnostic sequence because the algorithm differs by immune status. I should apply the W4SS first and proceed to Xpert when the screen is positive or imaging is abnormal, and I need to add urine LF-LAM in adults and adolescents with advanced immunosuppression (for example, CD4 count less than 100 cells/mm³) or serious illness to improve case detection; conversely, LF-LAM is not recommended in asymptomatic patients with CD4 counts of 200 cells/mm³ or higher or when CD4 is unknown without symptoms, and I should consider Xpert as an initial diagnostic for disseminated TB in symptomatic HIV-positive patients [^111qqcEm] [^111csCWg] [^111rQHnU] [^116r5AsX]. Wait, let me verify I am not missing inpatient severity cues; serious illness in HIV should further lower thresholds for testing, empiric therapy, and admission with airborne precautions until TB is reasonably excluded [^111qqcEm].

> For immunocompromised hosts without HIV, I should double-check that immune-based tests can be misleading. Because T-cell responses can be blunted by corticosteroids, anti-TNF agents, chemotherapy, or other immunosuppressants, a negative IGRA or tuberculin skin test does not rule out active TB and should not delay microbiologic evaluation or treatment when clinical suspicion is high, and a lower threshold for empiric therapy while cultures are pending may be warranted in select high-risk scenarios [^1177QJon] [^111p6aJp]. Let me reconsider whether a positive IGRA helps here; it can support the presence of infection but still cannot distinguish latent from active disease, so it cannot by itself confirm the diagnosis of active TB or obviate the need for bacteriologic testing [^1177QJon].

> In children, I need to ensure I choose feasible specimens and interpret results with the context of paucibacillary disease. When sputum is unobtainable, gastric aspirates or nasopharyngeal aspirates and, in some settings, stool can provide material for Xpert testing, and I should avoid repeating Xpert if pediatric pretest probability is under 5% with an initial negative result, while considering repeat testing if pretest probability is 5% or higher with an initial negative, always integrating clinical judgment and imaging [^1139pGZL] [^1174Uuq2] [^1133fvYB]. Hold on, I should verify I'm not deferring culture unnecessarily; despite delays, culture remains indispensable when suspicion persists or drug resistance is possible [^1177QJon].

> Now, I should confirm the role of culture as the gold standard and its timing. Mycobacterial culture on liquid and solid media is required for definitive diagnosis, complete drug susceptibility testing, and epidemiologic purposes, but it can take one to six weeks to yield results, so I must send cultures whenever suspicion is significant or NAAT results are discordant with the clinical picture, recognizing that clinical decisions often cannot await culture confirmation [^1177QJon] [^113TaV49]. Wait, let me verify the implications; if pretest probability is high with negative NAATs, I should consider empiric therapy while awaiting cultures rather than risking delays in care and transmission control [^1177QJon].

> Next, I should review what tests cannot rule out active TB, to avoid false reassurance. IGRA and tuberculin skin tests detect immune sensitization and cannot distinguish latent infection from active disease, and both can be negative in immunocompromised patients; therefore, neither a negative IGRA nor a negative TST excludes active TB, and these tests are better framed as tools for latent tuberculosis screening in at-risk but asymptomatic populations rather than as rule-out tests for disease [^1138JD5d] [^113imv8J] [^114mnVks]. But wait, what if I see a positive IGRA in a symptomatic patient; I still need bacteriologic testing because the positive result could reflect coincident latent infection rather than the cause of current symptoms [^1138JD5d].

> I will now integrate the data points into a composite diagnostic strategy with decision thresholds. When pretest probability is high and any microbiologic test is positive, I should treat for active TB; when pretest probability is high but tests are negative, I should consider empiric therapy pending culture and possibly repeat NAATs depending on the clinical trajectory; when pretest probability is low and NAAT plus imaging are negative, active TB is effectively ruled out and the patient can be assessed for latent infection if indicated, while remembering programmatic trade-offs and the risk of false-positive diagnoses if algorithms are applied indiscriminately in very low-prevalence settings [^1177QJon] [^113TaV49] [^1113TsDN]. Hold on, I should verify that I am balancing harms; overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis both carry significant clinical and public health consequences that must be weighed in context [^112ziBqJ].

> I need to check the negative predictive value implications, because "rule out" is inherently probabilistic. A negative Xpert result substantially lowers the odds of TB but does not eliminate the possibility in high pretest probability settings, so with a pretest probability around 10% a negative test can reduce post-test probability to near 1% whereas with a 50% pretest it remains clinically meaningful, and thus test interpretation must be anchored to baseline risk rather than used as a binary arbiter [^113TaV49]. Let me reconsider quoting precise likelihood ratios here; estimates vary by setting and specimen quality, and I should emphasize the Bayesian principle over a fixed number to avoid overprecision that could mislead clinical decisions [^1177QJon].

> For extrapulmonary TB, I will verify site-specific pathways and their limitations. Suspected TB meningitis warrants Xpert on CSF as an initial test, whereas lymph node, pleural, or osteoarticular disease requires targeted sampling for AFB smear and culture and, when available, Xpert on the involved specimen, complemented by CT, MRI, or ultrasound depending on the site to guide sampling and assess disease extent [^114bT1Xi] [^115raUpR] [^115atxPC]. I need to ensure I maintain a high index of suspicion despite negative NAATs at these sites because of frequent paucibacillary disease and rely on composite clinical, radiographic, and microbiologic correlation [^1177QJon].

> I should confirm infection control and public health actions while ruling out TB. Inpatients with a credible suspicion for pulmonary TB need airborne isolation until the disease is reasonably excluded, and suspected or confirmed cases must be reported to public health for contact investigation; critically, I must exclude active disease before initiating preventive therapy for latent TB to avoid functional monotherapy and selection of resistance, and I should arrange follow-up to reassess if new symptoms or findings emerge [^1177QJon] [^114FQHQk] [^1169veSK]. Wait, let me verify the sequencing for LTBI therapy; documentation that active TB has been ruled out is a prerequisite before starting preventive regimens per CDC and NTCA guidance [^114FQHQk].

> Finally, I will summarize the overarching principle so I do not overstate diagnostic certainty. Ruling out active TB is a probabilistic synthesis of clinical probability, imaging, and microbiology, tempered by host factors and disease spectrum, and not a single test result; the emerging consensus frameworks highlight a continuum of infection and disease states beyond the binary "latent" versus "active" paradigm, reinforcing why judgment and context remain paramount in deciding when TB is truly ruled out versus merely less likely [^115t2f6N] [^1123GmrN] [^1177QJon]. Hold on, I should double-check that this principle is clear to the end-user; even with modern molecular tests, high-risk, symptomatic patients need culture, close follow-up, and sometimes empiric therapy while results mature to safely reach a "rule-out" conclusion [^113TaV49].

---

To rule out active tuberculosis (TB), use a stepwise approach: **clinical assessment** (symptoms, risk factors), **chest radiography** (CXR), and **microbiological testing** (sputum smear, culture, NAAT) [^1177QJon]. A negative NAAT plus negative culture on two high-quality sputum samples, with a normal CXR and no symptoms, **effectively excludes active TB**. In immunocompromised or high-risk patients, add urine LAM, CT, or bronchoscopy as needed [^111qqcEm] [^115atxPC]. TST/IGRA are **not used** to rule out active TB [^114rYSDH]. If suspicion remains despite negative tests, **repeat or escalate testing** and monitor closely [^1177QJon].

---

## Clinical assessment

Clinical assessment focuses on **symptoms** [^1177QJon] such as cough ≥ 2 weeks, hemoptysis, fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, chest pain, and dyspnea. It also assesses **risk factors** [^1177QJon], including recent exposure, prior TB, immunosuppression (HIV, diabetes, corticosteroids, anti-TNF), incarceration, homelessness, and travel to high-burden areas [^113imv8J].

---

## Radiological evaluation

Radiological evaluation begins with **chest radiography** as the **first-line** test [^1177QJon]; a normal CXR without symptoms makes active TB unlikely. Chest CT is indicated if the **CXR is nondiagnostic** or **suspicion remains high** [^115atxPC].

---

## Microbiological testing

### Sputum smear microscopy

Sputum smear microscopy (AFB smear) provides rapid results but is insensitive; a negative smear **does not exclude active TB** [^1177QJon].

---

### Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs)

Nucleic acid amplification tests, such as Xpert MTB/RIF or Xpert Ultra, are the **preferred initial tests** for their high sensitivity, specificity, and rapid results [^1139pGZL] [^113TaV49]. If the initial NAAT is negative but suspicion remains, repeat testing to a total of two tests is recommended [^1133fvYB].

---

### Mycobacterial culture

Mycobacterial culture is the **diagnostic gold standard**; negative cultures from two high-quality sputum samples strongly suggest no active TB [^1177QJon].

---

## Special considerations

### Immunocompromised patients

In immunocompromised patients, **urine LAM** should be considered for HIV-positive individuals with CD4 < 100 or serious illness [^111qqcEm]. Use **bronchoscopy** if sputum is unobtainable or suspicion remains high [^1177QJon].

---

### Extrapulmonary tuberculosis

For extrapulmonary tuberculosis, obtain **site-specific samples** for NAAT and culture [^114bT1Xi] [^115raUpR].

---

## Role of TST and IGRA

TST and IGRA **detect latent infection** and are not used to rule out active TB [^1177QJon].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

If clinical suspicion persists, **repeat or escalate testing** and **monitor closely** [^1177QJon].

---

## Summary of diagnostic algorithm

| **Step** | **Diagnostic tool** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Clinical assessment | No symptoms = unlikely active TB [^1177QJon] |
| 2 | Chest radiography | Normal CXR = unlikely active TB |
| 3 | Sputum smear microscopy | Negative smear = does not exclude TB [^1177QJon] |
| 4 | NAAT (Xpert MTB/RIF) | Negative NAAT = unlikely active TB [^113TaV49] |
| 5 | Mycobacterial culture | Negative culture = no active TB |
| 6 | Special tests (LAM, bronchoscopy) | Use if immunocompromised or extrapulmonary TB suspected [^111qqcEm] [^114bT1Xi] |

---

To rule out active TB, combine clinical assessment, radiology, and microbiology; a negative NAAT plus negative cultures from two high-quality sputum samples, with a normal CXR and no symptoms, **effectively excludes active TB**. Use additional tests in high-risk patients, and do not rely on TST/IGRA for this purpose [^1177QJon] [^113TaV49].

Individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) may develop symptoms and signs of disease (tuberculosis disease) or may have no clinical evidence of disease (latent tuberculosis infection [LTBI]). Tuberculosis disease is a leading cause of infectious disease morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet many questions related to its diagnosis remain.

- **Methods**: A task force supported by the American Thoracic Society, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Infectious Diseases Society of America searched, selected, and synthesized relevant evidence. The evidence was then used as the basis for recommendations about the diagnosis of tuberculosis disease and LTBI in adults and children. The recommendations were formulated, written, and graded using the Grading, Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

- **Results**: Twenty-three evidence-based recommendations about diagnostic testing for latent tuberculosis infection, pulmonary tuberculosis, and extrapulmonary tuberculosis are provided. Six of the recommendations are strong, whereas the remaining 17 are conditional.

- **Conclusions**: These guidelines are not intended to impose a standard of care. They provide the basis for rational decisions in the diagnosis of tuberculosis in the context of the existing evidence. No guidelines can take into account all of the often compelling unique individual clinical circumstances.

### Meta-analysis: New tests for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection: Areas of uncertainty and recommendations for research [^116mwske]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Until recently, the tuberculin skin test was the only method for detecting latent tuberculosis (TB) infection. However, two ex vivo interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) are now commercially licensed.

- **Purpose**: To estimate the sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of IGRAs (commercial or research versions of QuantiFERON [QFT] and Elispot) for diagnosing latent TB infection in healthy and immune-suppressed individuals.

- **Data sources**: The authors searched MEDLINE and reviewed citations of all original articles and reviews for studies published in English.

- **Study selection**: Studies evaluated IGRAs using Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigens (RD1 antigens) and overnight (16- to 24-hour) incubation times. Reference standards were clearly defined without knowledge of test results.

- **Data extraction and quality assessment**: Specific criteria for quality assessment were developed for sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility.

- **Data synthesis**: When newly diagnosed active TB was used as a surrogate for latent TB infection, the sensitivity of all tests was suboptimal, although it was higher with Elispot. No test could distinguish active TB from latent TB. Sensitivity of the tuberculin skin test and IGRAs was similar in individuals categorized into clinical gradients of exposure. Pooled specificity was 97.7% (95% CI, 96% to 99%) for QFT and 92.5% (CI, 86% to 99%) for Elispot. Both assays were more specific than the tuberculin skin test in samples vaccinated with bacille Calmette-Guérin. Elispot was more sensitive than the tuberculin skin test in three studies.

### WHO consolidated guidelines on tuberculosis: Module 6: Tuberculosis and comorbidities [Internet] [^111csCWg]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for pulmonary tuberculosis, especially concerning patients with HIV infection, the WHO 2024 guidelines recommend against obtaining the lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan assay to assist in the diagnosis of active tuberculosis in the outpatient setting for HIV-positive adult, adolescent, and pediatric patients:

- **Without assessing tuberculosis symptoms**: In patients without symptoms, the assay is not recommended regardless of CD4 cell count or when the CD4 cell count is unknown.

- **Without tuberculosis symptoms and unknown CD4 cell count or with CD4 cell count ≥ 200 cells/mm³**: The assay should not be used in these instances.

- **Without tuberculosis symptoms and with a CD4 cell count of 100–200 cells/mm³**: Even with this CD4 range, the assay is not advised.

### Classification of early tuberculosis states to guide research for improved care and prevention: an international Delphi consensus exercise [^115hxnP3]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

While identifying diagnostic criteria for the states was a desired outcome of the ICE-TB meeting, the lack of validated tools for some states meant this was not feasible. However, acknowledging the limitations, it was agreed that tools across the expanding diagnostic landscape could be used to classify an individual's TB state according to the relevant disease dimensions, particularly in a research context. Establishment of appropriate reference standards for the new states and subsequent development of new diagnostic tools will be necessary to define the TB states more accurately.

- **Diagnostic considerations**: The issue of imperfect reference standards has long been a challenge for the TB field, especially for extrapulmonary TB, pediatric TB, and TB in people living with HIV, due to the paucibacillary nature of the samples usually available for diagnosis. However, many research groups have designed and validated composite reference standards with predetermined rules, consisting of multiple con- or sequential tests and applying statistical methods to correct for the imperfect nature of the existing reference standards, such as for TB meningitis. Additionally, applying Bayesian approaches, such as latent class analysis where imperfect reference standards exist, can help minimize misclassification when conducting accuracy trials.

Following the development of a consensus-driven reference standard, it will be imperative to have robust study designs to evaluate.

### Viewpoint: Challenges and opportunities in tuberculosis research [^1117Dioh]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Despite these successes, many questions remain in all aspects of tuberculosis research, ranging from fundamental pathogenesis to programmatic implementation. These challenges are compounded by the complexity of the disease and its chronic nature. Compared with other infections, Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection does not elicit clinically relevant disease in the majority of subjects. Many who are infected carry asymptomatic, paucibacillary disease for decades, complicating the definition and evaluation of early infection events, initial host responses, and the characterization of infecting bacillary populations.

The clinical definition of latent infection is limited to positive responses to the injection of purified mycobacterial components (i.e. the tuberculosis skin test) or to T-cell recall responses measured through the production of interferon γ. Unlike viral infections, latent tuberculous infections cannot be identified based on stable antibody titers. Progression to active disease is not a clear unidirectional process; it is prolonged, with many individuals able to clear the infection, while others progress to active disease.

The spectrum of active tuberculosis is complex. Although adult pulmonary tuberculosis is considered of greatest relevance for public health, extrapulmonary disease occurs in a significant portion of subjects. Pediatric manifestations of tuberculosis may be mistaken for other pulmonary infections, posing diagnostic challenges. Treatment of active disease is complicated by the fact that the standard of care is continually evolving to address drug resistance and other clinical challenges.

### Update on latent tuberculosis infection [^111bmnAW]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Latent tuberculosis infection refers to an asymptomatic, non-transmissible infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, carrying a 5% to 10% lifetime risk of progressing to active disease. Half of this risk occurs within the first two years after infection. High-risk groups include recent immigrants from high-incidence countries, healthcare professionals, persons living or working in institutional settings, and homeless persons.

Risk factors for progression to active disease include immunodeficiency, recent exposure to tuberculosis, and chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis. Tuberculin skin testing has several limitations, including the need for multiple office visits and the potential for false-positive results in patients who have received the bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine or been exposed to environmental mycobacteria.

Interferon-gamma release assays address these deficiencies but are limited by their cost and requirement for blood processing. They are preferred in immigrants exposed to bacillus Calmette-Guérin and in patients who are not likely to return for interpretation of skin test results. Tuberculin skin testing is preferred for children younger than five years. Active disease should be excluded before initiating treatment.

The newest treatment option of 12 weekly doses of isoniazid and rifapentine has similar or better effectiveness than standard nine-month therapy with daily isoniazid. A four-month regimen of daily rifampin is another alternative.

### How should I interpret an interferon gamma release assay result for tuberculosis infection [^114rYSDH]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) are the first new diagnostic tests for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI) since the century-old tuberculin skin test (TST). They are cell-mediated immune-based blood tests that have revolutionized LTBI diagnosis and are increasingly recommended by national guidelines.

- **Objectives**: With the rapid expansion of the IGRA evidence base in recent years, the limitations of IGRA and uncertainties in the clinical interpretation of IGRA results have increasingly come into focus. In LTBI diagnosis, these include the prognostic power of IGRAs relative to TST for quantifying the risk of progression to active disease, false-negative rates in immunocompromised patients, the clinical meaning of IGRA reversion, and the significance of the size of the IGRA response. Furthermore, the role of IGRAs in the diagnostic work-up of active TB is unclear, and there is little evidence supporting the use of the tests in anti-TB treatment monitoring.

- **Methodological approach**: Ongoing large prospective longitudinal clinical endpoint cohort studies of active and latent TB will tackle some of the uncertainties regarding IGRAs. Here we discuss clinical practice and guidance in light of the uncertainties, based on existing evidence.

- **Conclusions and impact**: Planned clinical research will fill the gaps in the evidence base, narrowing the areas of uncertainty and informing future policy. Translational research into next-generation IGRAs and new T cell-based diagnostic platforms will likely overcome the limitations of IGRAs in the near future.

### Tuberculosis: Common questions and answers [^11592vQU]. American Family Physician (2022). Low credibility.

Approximately 10 million people worldwide were infected with tuberculosis (TB) in 2019, resulting in 1.4 million deaths. In the United States that same year, there were nearly 9,000 reported cases of TB disease, and up to 13 million people were living with latent TB infection (LTBI), which is an asymptomatic, noncommunicable infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Without treatment, LTBI will progress to active TB disease in approximately 5% to 10% of affected people. Individuals with symptoms of TB disease warrant testing.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends testing individuals at increased risk of LTBI with an interferon-gamma release assay or tuberculin skin testing. Because the incidence of LTBI in healthcare professionals is similar to that of the general population, periodic retesting is not recommended. After a positive test result, chest radiography should be performed, and in patients with suspected pulmonary TB disease, sputum should be collected for diagnosis. Both suspected and confirmed cases of LTBI and TB disease must be reported to local or state health departments.

Preferred treatment regimens for LTBI include isoniazid in combination with rifapentine or rifampin, or rifampin alone for a duration of three and four months, respectively. Treatment of drug-susceptible TB disease includes an eight-week intensive phase with four drugs (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol), followed by a continuation phase lasting 18 weeks or more, with two drugs based on susceptibility testing results. Consultation with a TB expert is necessary if therapy adjustment is required due to drug resistance or treatment complications.

### Symptom- and chest-radiography screening for active pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative adults and adults with unknown HIV status [^111ApEth]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). High credibility.

The electronic database search identified 9,473 titles and abstracts (Figure 2). Through expert consultation, we identified 31 reports on national tuberculosis prevalence surveys as eligible for inclusion, of which eight were already captured in the search of the electronic databases. Additionally, we identified 957 potentially relevant articles through reference checking. After the removal of duplicates, we assessed 10,415 titles and abstracts, identifying 430 (4%) for full‐text review.

During the full‐text assessment, 364 articles were excluded. The most common reasons for exclusion were that the study design did not allow evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of a screening test, typically because only one screening method was used (often symptoms) and only screen-positive individuals were further evaluated by a reference standard. In 175 (48%) publications, the data required to construct a diagnostic two‐by‐two table were not or insufficiently reported. In total, 66 publications and reports provided data on 59 studies. Two publications provided data on multiple studies (Claassens 2017a; Morishita 2017a), either in different geographic areas or different populations.

### Spevigo [^113upQxH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Evaluate patients for active or latent tuberculosis (TB) infection. Spevigo initiation is not recommended in patients with active TB infection. Consider initiating treatment of latent TB prior to initiation of Spevigo [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Complete all age-appropriate vaccinations according to immunization guidelines prior to initiating Spevigo for treatment of GPP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Important administration information**: Spevigo prefilled syringes are for subcutaneous use for the treatment of GPP when not experiencing a flare. If required, the 600 mg subcutaneous loading dose of Spevigo is to be administered by a healthcare professional [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. For subsequent 300 mg doses, if the healthcare professional determines that it is appropriate, a patient 12 years of age and older may self-inject or the caregiver may administer Spevigo after proper training in subcutaneous injection technique. In pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age, administer Spevigo under the supervision of an adult. If a patient experiences a GPP flare while receiving subcutaneous Spevigo, the GPP flare may be treated with intravenous Spevigo [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

- **Intravenous use for treatment of GPP flare**: Spevigo vials are for intravenous use for treatment of GPP flare. Intravenous infusion of Spevigo is only to be administered by a healthcare professional in a healthcare setting.

### Cibinqo [^115kAJjj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Recommended testing, evaluations, and procedures prior to treatment initiation**: Perform the following tests and evaluations prior to Cibinqo initiation:

	- **Tuberculosis (TB) infection evaluation**: Cibinqo initiation is not recommended in patients with active TB. For patients with latent TB or those with a negative latent TB test who are at high risk for TB, start preventive therapy for latent TB prior to initiation of Cibinqo [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

	- **Viral hepatitis screening in accordance with clinical guidelines**: Cibinqo initiation is not recommended in patients with active hepatitis B or hepatitis C [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

	- A complete blood count (CBC): Cibinqo initiation is not recommended in patients with a platelet count < 150,000/mm3, an absolute lymphocyte count < 500/mm3, an absolute neutrophil count < 1,000/mm3, or a hemoglobin value < 8 g/dL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

### Is tuberculin skin testing reliable during anti-tumor necrosis factor-alfa therapy? A case report and review of the literature [^111p6aJp]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

The increased risk to patients on anti-tumor necrosis factor-alfa therapy of developing active tuberculosis supports screening of these patients for latent tuberculosis infection. The practice of determining the presence of latent tuberculosis infection primarily, and often entirely, depends on the use of tuberculin skin testing (TST). We report a patient with psoriasis on long-term etanercept therapy who had a negative TST result and a positive interferon-gamma release assay result. Similar cases have also been found through a review of the literature. These findings suggest that TST might be unreliable during long-term anti-tumor necrosis factor-alfa therapy. QuantiFeron-TB Gold testing may be a more appropriate primary test in patients with risk factors for false-negative TST results.

### Latent tuberculosis infection-associated immunodiagnostic test responses as biomarkers of incipient tuberculosis: Fruitful or futile [^113AdXFN]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The study by Gupta and coworkers in this issue of the journal provides answers to some of these questions. Their findings were based on the results of the prospective UK PREDICT (UK Prognostic Evaluation of Diagnostic IGRAs Consortium) study that evaluated three immunodiagnostic tests (T-SPOT.TB, QFT-GIT, and TST) in almost 10,000 participants who were at high risk for LTBI (close contacts of active TB cases or recent migrants) sequentially recruited from 54 centers in the United Kingdom. They found that although the magnitude of the IGRA (both QFT-GIT and T-SPOT.TB) and the TST response was a biomarker of incipient TB, the threshold-specific positive predictive value for all three immunodiagnostic tests for active TB over a median follow-up of approximately three years was poor at less than 5%. This is because there were many non-progressors who had a magnitude of response at or above the threshold identifying incipient TB. Moreover, using this higher threshold in clinical practice would result in a substantial drop in test sensitivity to detect active TB cases, making the usefulness of such an approach redundant because IGRAs and TSTs are simply poor tests of incipient TB. This is not surprising, as only a small proportion of those with LTBI (approximately 5%) will progress to active disease.

The authors must be commended on undertaking such a challenging study both in terms of recruitment and analysis. The findings are helpful to clinicians and public health physicians who are using immunodiagnostic tests in screening programs. It suggests that alternative biomarkers of incipient TB are urgently needed.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for extrapulmonary tuberculosis, more specifically with respect to screening for latent tuberculosis, the ATS/CDC/IDSA 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining an IGRA rather than a tuberculin skin test in patients aged ≥ 5 years who meet the following criteria:

- **Likely to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis**: The patient is deemed to have a likelihood of infection with the bacterium.

- **Low or intermediate risk of disease progression**: The risk of the tuberculosis disease progressing is considered low or intermediate.

- **Testing warranted**: It has been determined that testing for latent tuberculosis infection is warranted in the patient's case.

- **History of BCG vaccination or unlikely to return for TST reading**: The patient has a history of BCG vaccination, or it is anticipated that the individual is unlikely to return to have the TST read.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pulmonary tuberculosis, particularly nucleic acid amplification testing, the ATS/CDC/IDSA 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining rapid molecular drug susceptibility testing for rifampin, with or without isoniazid, on respiratory specimens obtained from AFB smear- or NAAT (Hologic)-positive patients meeting one of the following criteria:

- **Have been treated for tuberculosis in the past**: Testing should be considered due to potential drug resistance.

- **Were born in or have lived for at least 1 year in a foreign country**: These countries should have at least a moderate tuberculosis incidence (≥ 20 per 100,000) or a high primary MDR-TB prevalence (≥ 2%).

- **Are contacts of patients with MDR-TB**: Contact with such patients increases the risk of drug-resistant tuberculosis.

### Sensitivity, specificity, and safety of a novel ESAT6-CFP10 skin test for tuberculosis infection in China: 2 randomized, self-controlled, parallel-group phase 2b trials [^1121zvZF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Diagnostics to identify tuberculosis infection are limited. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy and safety of the ESAT6-CFP10 (EC) skin test for tuberculosis infection in Chinese adults. The methods involved two randomized, parallel-group clinical trials in healthy participants and tuberculosis patients. All participants were tested with the T-SPOT.TB test, then received an EC skin test and tuberculin skin test (TST). The diameter of skin indurations and/or redness at injection sites were measured at different time periods. A Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) model was established to assess the diagnosis of tuberculosis infection using an EC skin test.

In total, 777 healthy participants and 96 tuberculosis patients were allocated to receive the EC skin test at 1.0 μg/0.1 mL or 0.5 μg/0.1 mL. At 24–72 hours, the area under the curve was 0.95 (95% confidence interval, 0.91–0.97) for the EC skin test at 1.0 μg/0.1 mL. Compared to the T-SPOT.TB test, the EC skin test demonstrated similar sensitivity (87.5, 95% CI, 77.8–97.2 vs. 86.5, 95% CI, 79.5–93.4) and specificity (98.9, 95% CI, 96.0–99.9 vs. 96.1, 95% CI, 93.5–97.8). Among BCG-vaccinated participants, the EC skin test displayed high consistency with the T-SPOT.TB test (96.3, 95% CI, 92.0–100.0). No serious adverse events related to the EC skin test were observed.

The EC skin test demonstrated both high specificity and sensitivity at a dose of 1.0 μg/0.1 mL, comparable to the T-SPOT.TB test. The diagnostic accuracy of the EC skin test was not impacted by BCG vaccination.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^113imv8J]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

In the US, tuberculosis remains an important preventable disease, including active tuberculosis, which may be infectious, and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), which is asymptomatic and not infectious but can later progress to active disease. The precise prevalence rate of LTBI in the US is difficult to determine; however, estimated prevalence is about 5.0%, or up to 13 million persons. Incidence of tuberculosis varies by geography and living accommodations, suggesting an association with social determinants of health.

To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on LTBI screening and treatment in asymptomatic adults seen in primary care, as well as the accuracy of LTBI screening tests.

Asymptomatic adults 18 years or older at increased risk for tuberculosis were the focus of this review. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit in preventing active tuberculosis disease by screening for LTBI in persons at increased risk for tuberculosis infection.

The USPSTF recommends screening for LTBI in populations at increased risk (B recommendation).

### Diagnostic 'omics' for active tuberculosis [^112EvYxm]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Alternatively, it may be more suitable to use -omics-based tests as triage tests to rule out TB when a high sensitivity can be reached but with lower specificity. The suggested minimum requirements for a TB triage test have been set out as > 90% sensitivity and > 70% specificity. Again, these requirements have been met by some of the published studies. However, substantial technical progress is needed to reduce price, equipment requirements, and time for sample analysis to make -omics tests adequate for field use.

- **Biomarker signatures**: While signatures containing multiple biomarkers (proteins, metabolites, or transcripts) are more likely to be successful in identifying active TB, it is still worth exploring strategies that can reduce these to facilitate translation into diagnostic tests. For example, a minimal set of genes with high diagnostic accuracy could be measured by more conventional techniques (e.g. PCR) in the field, as demonstrated by Maertzdorf et al. It is unlikely, however, that one signature will be adequate to diagnose active TB in all clinical settings. It is more conceivable that different combinations of biomarkers will confer diagnostic value in different settings, such as one set of markers for differentiating between active and latent TB, and another to diagnose TB in comparison to other diseases.

### Beyond latent and active tuberculosis: a scoping review of conceptual frameworks [^112mARyu]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Developing diagnostics that are able to differentiate between states will be essential for a novel framework to be clinically meaningful. In particular, tests that can discriminate between States 0, I, II, and III identified in our review — clarifying the clearance of infection, the presence of viable bacilli, the containment of infection, and the breakdown of immune control — have critical clinical and public health significance.

Similarly, approaches towards treatment based on a binary paradigm will need to be adapted, potentially including novel regimens or varying durations of existing regimens. Outcomes of vaccinology studies may require reconsideration with a clearer understanding of which states are being targeted and prevented through the administration of a vaccine. While the First International Symposium on New Concepts in Early TB Disease aimed to develop consensus around a novel framework with consistent definitions and terminologies, it is important that this framework is regularly updated with advancements in our understanding of the disease process. This can potentially include states for post-TB lung disease that were not a part of this review.

### What if they don't have tuberculosis? The consequences and trade-offs involved in false-positive diagnoses of tuberculosis [^112ziBqJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

To find the millions of missed tuberculosis (TB) cases, national TB programs are under pressure to expand TB disease screening and to target populations with lower disease prevalence. Together with imperfect performance and application of existing diagnostic tools, including empirical diagnosis, broader screening risks placing individuals without TB on prolonged treatment. These false-positive diagnoses have profound consequences for TB patients and prevention efforts, yet are usually overlooked in policy decision-making.

In this article, we describe the pathways to a false-positive TB diagnosis, including trade-offs involved in the development and application of diagnostic algorithms. We then consider the wide range of potential consequences for individuals, households, health systems, and the reliability of surveillance data. Finally, we suggest practical steps that the TB community can take to reduce the frequency and potential harms of false-positive TB diagnosis and to more explicitly assess the trade-offs involved in the screening and diagnostic process.

### Global health 2050: The path to halving premature death by mid-century [^112j9aaN]. Lancet (2024). Low credibility.

Diagnosis is a crucial component in tuberculosis (TB) care and control. Pai and colleagues describe it as "the weakest aspect of TB care and control", emphasizing that without diagnosis, the disease cannot be treated. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 2.9 million people annually had tuberculosis without being diagnosed. This diagnostic gap expanded to 4.2 million during the pandemic. Utilizing new diagnostics along the case finding "cascade" — which includes individuals with subclinical tuberculosis, those with symptoms who have not sought care, and those who have sought care but remain undiagnosed — could offer significant benefits.

New molecular diagnostics have become available for use at the point of care (POC) in decentralized settings. The World Health Organization (WHO) now recommends molecular diagnosis over sputum smear microscopy as the preferred frontline testing option. This shift is due to the limitations of sputum use, especially in children and people with HIV. Consequently, efforts are focused on developing molecular diagnostics based on tongue swabs, urine, blood, and stool, as well as multi-disease tests.

Pai et al. state, "A simple, non-sputum sample combined with an affordable, multi-disease POC molecular technology, deployed in decentralized settings, would reach a much larger population, close the case detection gap, and curb TB transmission at the population level". The screening for tuberculosis and latent tuberculosis is now more feasible with the introduction of interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs). These assays offer many advantages over the traditional tuberculin skin tests, including the C-tb skin test. The C-tb test is currently being mass-produced by the Serum Institute of India and has demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity.

- **Certainty of evidence and search date**: After completing the review based on the above search, we explored whether adding an updated search would potentially reach a higher certainty of evidence and therefore lead to more firm conclusions. We conducted an updated search in MEDLINE and Embase on 2 July 2021 and restricted the search to records that included tuberculosis terms, DTA terms, and terms for our reference standard in the title or abstract. This set would most likely include studies of high quality. We then assessed the restricted set using the review's eligibility criteria. Of the studies eligible for inclusion, we assessed risks of bias and applicability concerns in the QUADAS‐2 domains.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently published updated guidelines for the use of interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This document provides a balanced analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of IGRAs. At the time of writing, these assays have not been widely adopted in the United States by clinical laboratories. We have asked two experts, Thomas Alexander of Summa Health Care, who has adopted an IGRA for M. tuberculosis detection in his laboratory, and Melissa Miller of UNC Hospitals, who has evaluated one but has not chosen to adopt it, to explain how each reached this decision based on their experience with the test and the data that have been published concerning IGRA.

Individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) may develop symptoms and signs of disease (tuberculosis disease) or may have no clinical evidence of disease (latent tuberculosis infection [LTBI]). Tuberculosis disease is a leading cause of infectious disease morbidity and mortality worldwide, yet many questions related to its diagnosis remain.

- **Methods**: A task force supported by the American Thoracic Society, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Infectious Diseases Society of America searched, selected, and synthesized relevant evidence. The evidence was then used as the basis for recommendations about the diagnosis of tuberculosis disease and LTBI in adults and children. The recommendations were formulated, written, and graded using the Grading, Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

- **Results**: Twenty-three evidence-based recommendations about diagnostic testing for latent tuberculosis infection, pulmonary tuberculosis, and extrapulmonary tuberculosis are provided. Six of the recommendations are strong, whereas the remaining 17 are conditional.

- **Conclusions**: These guidelines are not intended to impose a standard of care. They provide the basis for rational decisions in the diagnosis of tuberculosis in the context of the existing evidence. No guidelines can take into account all of the often compelling unique individual clinical circumstances.

### What if they don't have tuberculosis? The consequences and trade-offs involved in false-positive diagnoses of tuberculosis [^1113TsDN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

The pathway toward false-positive TB diagnosis is complex. Figure 1 outlines the screening and diagnostic pathway for tuberculosis (TB). A screening population is composed of individuals with and without TB. Some individuals without TB may have an underlying illness that presents with similar symptoms to those of TB. A diagnostic algorithm, with imperfect sensitivity and specificity, is then applied to the screening population. All those diagnosed with TB, correctly or not, are eligible to start treatment and should be notified as part of national and global surveillance.

- **Screening and diagnostic pathway for tuberculosis (TB)**: From a general population, a screening population is formed from individuals with (orange) and without (green) TB. The diagnostic algorithm is applied to the screening population, categorizing individuals into those recommended for TB treatment (following a true-positive or false-positive diagnosis) or not. The contribution of false-positive TB diagnoses is mostly driven by the prevalence of TB in the screening population and the specificity of the diagnostic algorithm. The dashed arrows on the right highlight the two processes that new screening or diagnostic strategies aim to achieve (orange indicates converting false-negative diagnoses into true-positive diagnoses; green indicates converting false-positive diagnoses into true-negative diagnoses).

### Revisiting the timetable of tuberculosis [^111RYBns]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Appreciating the natural history of infection and disease should help us to strategize for the global eradication of TB and to design vaccine efficacy trials. Furthermore, the natural history of TB does not support the many terms currently used to describe the various phases of TB infection. These terms are not only confusing but even misleading. We suggest using just three simple terms — tuberculous reactivity, primary infection, and active TB.

- **Suggested simplified terms**:
	- **Tuberculous reactivity**: Indirect evidence of present or past infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis as inferred by a detectable adaptive immune response to M. tuberculosis antigens (on tuberculin skin test or interferon gamma release assay) in an asymptomatic person.
	- **Primary infection**: Evidence of new tuberculous infection, obtained with a tuberculin skin test conversion or a new positive interferon gamma release assay, which may be asymptomatic or accompanied by transient fever, erythema nodosum, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or characteristic roentgenographic abnormalities.
	- **Active tuberculosis**: Evidence of progressive disease of the lung and/or other organs generally accompanied by a positive culture for M. tuberculosis and/or roentgenographic findings and/or histopathology consistent with TB.

### New diagnostics to infer risk in tuberculosis: Is the term "latent tuberculosis infection" obsolete [^114mnVks]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Accurate diagnosis and estimation of risk in latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) remain major clinical and global health challenges. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection reflects a continuum between LTBI and active tuberculosis (TB). LTBI is the most common form of Mtb infection, affecting one-quarter of the world's population and resulting in approximately 2,000,000 deaths annually. Immunocompetent individuals with LTBI have a 5–10% risk of developing active TB during their lifetime, most commonly within the first two years after exposure. Treatment of LTBI is effective in reducing the risk of developing subsequent active TB disease; however, identifying patients most at risk of developing active TB and ensuring successful LTBI treatment remain significant challenges.

Available laboratory tests for the detection of LTBI have serious diagnostic limitations, including a poor predictive value (< 5%) for identifying subjects with LTBI who will actually develop active TB. Tuberculin skin testing and IFN-γ release assays can detect cell-mediated immune reactivity in Mtb infection. However, none of these tests can differentiate LTBI from active TB, nor can they distinguish between those who achieve subsequent bacterial clearance and/or effective infection containment from others who have silent and persistent infections at high risk of developing TB. Therefore, improvements in TB diagnostics are urgently needed not only to enhance both sensitivity and specificity of Mtb infection detection but also to more accurately determine the risk of progression or reactivation into active TB.

### Classification of early tuberculosis states to guide research for improved care and prevention: An international Delphi consensus exercise [^115t2f6N]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The active-latent paradigm of tuberculosis largely neglects the documented spectrum of disease. Inconsistency with regard to definitions, terminology, and diagnostic criteria for different tuberculosis states has limited progress in research and product development needed to achieve tuberculosis elimination. We aimed to develop a new framework of classification for tuberculosis that accommodates key disease states but is sufficiently simple to support pragmatic research and implementation.

Through an international Delphi exercise that involved 71 participants representing a wide range of disciplines, sectors, income settings, and geographies, consensus was reached on a set of conceptual states, related terminology, and research gaps. The International Consensus for Early TB (ICE-TB) framework distinguishes disease from infection by the presence of macroscopic pathology and defines two subclinical and two clinical tuberculosis states based on reported symptoms or signs of tuberculosis, further differentiated by likely infectiousness. The presence of viable Mycobacterium tuberculosis and an associated host response are prerequisites for all states of infection and disease. Our framework provides a clear direction for tuberculosis research, which will, in time, improve tuberculosis clinical care and elimination policies.

### Tuberculosis screening among ambulatory people living with HIV: A systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis [^116r5AsX]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

The WHO-recommended tuberculosis screening and diagnostic algorithm for ambulatory people living with HIV involves a four-symptom screen (known as the WHO-recommended four-symptom screen [W4SS]), followed by a WHO-recommended molecular rapid diagnostic test (e.g. Xpert MTB/RIF, hereafter referred to as Xpert) if W4SS is positive. To inform updated WHO guidelines, we aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of alternative screening tests and strategies for tuberculosis in this population.

- **Methods**: In this systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis, we updated a search of PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, the Cochrane Library, and conference abstracts for publications from January 1, 2011, to March 12, 2018, done in a previous systematic review to include the period up to August 2, 2019. We screened the reference lists of identified pieces and contacted experts in the field. We included prospective cross-sectional, observational studies and randomised trials among adult and adolescent (age ≥ 10 years) ambulatory people living with HIV, irrespective of signs and symptoms of tuberculosis. We extracted study-level data using a standardized data extraction form and requested individual participant data from study authors. We aimed to compare the W4SS with alternative screening tests and strategies and the WHO-recommended algorithm (i.e. W4SS followed by Xpert) with Xpert for all, in terms of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity), overall and in key subgroups (e.g. by antiretroviral therapy [ART] status). The reference standard was culture.

### An update on the diagnosis of tuberculosis infection [^113rdoJp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Targeted testing and treatment of individuals with latent tuberculosis infection who are at increased risk of progression to active disease is a key element of tuberculosis control. This strategy is limited by the poor specificity of the tuberculin skin test in populations vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Guérin, and its low sensitivity in immunosuppressed persons who are at the highest risk of progression.

Two blood tests, T-SPOT.TB and QuantiFERON-TB Gold, which detect IFN-gamma released by T cells in response to M. tuberculosis-specific antigens, may offer an improvement on the skin test. However, validation is challenging due to the lack of a diagnostic gold standard. This critical appraisal of published evidence summarizes the diagnostic accuracy of the new tests.

- **Operational advantages**: The blood tests have significant operational advantages over the skin test because no return visit is required, results are available by the next day, and repeated testing does not cause boosting.
- **Specificity and sensitivity**: Both tests are significantly more specific than the skin test in populations vaccinated with Bacille Calmette-Guérin. The data suggest that T-SPOT.TB may be more sensitive than the skin test.

Although data in groups at high risk of progression to disease are scarce and more research is needed, it is clear that T-SPOT.TB performs better than the skin test in young children and HIV-infected people with active tuberculosis. Incorporation of these tests into programs for targeted testing of latent tuberculosis infection will reduce the false-positive and false-negative results inherent in tuberculin testing.

### WHO consolidated guidelines on tuberculosis: Module 3: diagnosis – rapid diagnostics for tuberculosis detection [Internet] [^111XyQsn]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pulmonary tuberculosis, particularly in relation to nucleic acid amplification testing, the WHO 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining Xpert Ultra rather than smear microscopy, culture, and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing. This is advised as an initial diagnostic test for tuberculosis and rifampin resistance detection in sputum for adult patients exhibiting signs and symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis without a prior history of tuberculosis (≤ 5 years) or with a remote history of tuberculosis treatment (> 5 years since the end of treatment).

### Beyond latent and active tuberculosis: A scoping review of conceptual frameworks [^1123GmrN]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

There is growing recognition that tuberculosis (TB) infection and disease exist as a spectrum of states beyond the binary classification of latent and active TB. Our aim was to systematically map and synthesize published conceptual frameworks for TB states. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and EMcare for review articles from 1946 to September 2023. We included 40 articles that explicitly described more than two states for TB.

We identified that terminology, definitions, and diagnostic criteria for additional TB states within these articles were inconsistent.

- **Broad conceptual themes**:
	- **State 0**: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) elimination with innate immune response (n = 25/40, 63%)
	- **State I**: Mtb elimination by acquired immune response (n = 31/40, 78%)
	- **State II**: Mtb infection not eliminated but controlled (n = 37/40, 93%)
	- **State III**: Mtb infection not controlled (n = 24/40, 60%)
	- **State IV**: Bacteriologically positive without symptoms (n = 26/40, 65%)
	- **State V**: Signs or symptoms associated with TB (n = 39/40, 98%)
	- **State VI**: Severe or disseminated TB disease (n = 11/40, 28%)
	- **State VII**: Previous history of TB (n = 5/40, 13%)

Consensus on a non-binary framework that includes additional TB states is required to standardize scientific communication and to inform advancements in research, clinical, and public health practice.

### Classification of early tuberculosis states to guide research for improved care and prevention: an international Delphi consensus exercise [^117AHSRh]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The active/latent paradigm of tuberculosis (TB) largely neglects the documented spectrum of disease. Lack of consistency in definitions, terminology, and diagnostic criteria for different TB states constrains progress in research and product development required to achieve TB elimination.

Consensus was reached on a set of conceptual states, related terminology, and research gaps through a Delphi process involving 64 experts representing a wide range of disciplines, sectors, income settings, and geographies.

The resulting International Consensus for Early TB (ICE-TB) framework distinguishes disease from infection by the presence of macroscopic pathology. It defines two subclinical and two clinical tuberculosis states based on reported symptoms or signs of TB, further differentiated by likely infectiousness. The presence of viable M. tuberculosis and an associated host response are prerequisites for all infection and disease states.

The framework provides clear direction for TB research which, in time with scientific progress, will improve TB clinical care and elimination policies.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pulmonary tuberculosis, more specifically with respect to indications for testing, the ACCP 2018 guidelines recommend considering obtaining Xpert MTB/RIF testing, where available, instead of sputum microscopy. This is advised for patients with cough and suspected pulmonary tuberculosis who are at high risk of drug-resistant tuberculosis (such as those with a prior history of treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis, contacts of drug-resistant tuberculosis cases, and/or living in countries with a high drug-resistant tuberculosis prevalence). Obtain sputum mycobacterial cultures, drug susceptibility testing, and a chest X-ray (CXR) when feasible and where resources allow.

### Guidelines on interferon-γ release assays for tuberculosis infection: concordance, discordance or confusion [^112hKrFk]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Identification of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection and preventive therapy is important for TB control, especially in high-risk populations. Since the advent of interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs), many studies have evaluated their role in the diagnosis of active and latent TB. With the growing evidence base, many guidelines now include IGRAs. We surveyed the literature and contacted experts to identify 33 guidelines and position papers from 25 countries and two supranational organizations. The results show considerable diversity in the recommendations on IGRAs, with four approaches commonly proposed:

- **Approach one**: A two-step approach of tuberculin skin test (TST) first, followed by IGRA either when the TST is negative (to increase sensitivity, mainly in immunocompromised individuals), or when the TST is positive (to increase specificity, mainly in Bacillus Calmette-Guérin-vaccinated individuals).
- **Approach two**: Either TST or IGRA, but not both.
- **Approach three**: IGRA and TST together (to increase sensitivity).
- **Approach four**: IGRA only, replacing the TST.

Overall, the use of IGRAs is increasingly recommended, but most of the guidelines do not use objective, transparent methods to grade evidence and recommendations, and do not disclose conflicts of interest. Future IGRA guidelines must aim to be transparent, evidence-based, periodically updated, and free of financial conflicts and industry involvement.

### Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection [^116v4Ey4]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

This review describes the major developments in the rationale for treating latent tuberculosis infection, new approaches to identifying persons with latent infection who are most likely to progress to active disease, and the development of novel short-course regimens for the treatment of latent tuberculosis.

As many as one-third of the world's population has a latent infection with *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. Models demonstrate that tuberculosis will not be eliminated without large-scale treatment of persons with latent TB. Tools for identifying persons at risk for active tuberculosis disease include the tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA), which have poor positive predictive values.

Newer approaches using gene expression profiling show promise and are currently being studied in ongoing trials. The development of short-course regimens is a major advance in the treatment of latent TB. Three months of rifapentine with isoniazid, four months of rifampin, and one month of rifapentine with isoniazid have been found to be noninferior to the standard nine months of isoniazid.

Progress towards TB elimination can be accelerated by instituting public health measures that take into account new developments in identifying and treating persons with latent tuberculosis infection who are most likely to progress to active disease.

### Diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection: The potential role of new technologies [^117NLC2x]. Respiratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. TB control programs require improvement in the diagnosis of latent TB infection. The tuberculin skin test (TST) is far from a 'gold' standard because it frequently produces false results. Interferon-gamma assays are newly available tests for detecting latent TB infection; however, they are not yet used routinely. These assays are based on immune responses to purified protein derivative (PPD) or region of difference 1 (RD1) specific antigens. Assays based on RD1 specific antigens outperform both PPD-based assays and TST. They correlate better with TB exposure and are less likely to produce false results in cases of non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease, Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination, and immunosuppression. More accurate diagnosis of latent TB infection with RD1 specific antigen-based interferon-gamma assays may enable targeted chemoprophylaxis, reducing the burden of active TB while decreasing the wastage of healthcare resources due to the false results associated with TST. Nevertheless, further research and development are necessary to verify that the new tests can predict the risk of subsequent active TB development and to ensure that these tests can be performed reproducibly and affordably, particularly in developing countries.

### Early diagnosis of subclinical multidrug-resistant tuberculosis [^116wbSae]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis control hinges on prompt diagnosis of active cases and screening of contacts by tuberculin skin testing. Rapid blood tests for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection are a new alternative to the tuberculin skin test, but whether they improve clinical outcomes is unknown.

- **Objective**: To describe how a novel T-cell-based test for M. tuberculosis infection helped diagnose tuberculosis in an asymptomatic, immunosuppressed adult with a negative result on a tuberculin skin test.

- **Design**: Case report.

- **Setting**: Household contact.

- **Patients**: Asymptomatic man receiving maintenance azathioprine therapy for Crohn disease whose wife had multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis.

- **Measurements**: Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, computed tomography, and bronchoalveolar lavage cultures.

- **Results**: The man had a negative tuberculin skin test result and a positive ELISPOT assay result. High-resolution computed tomography of the chest showed consolidation with early cavitation. Bronchoalveolar lavage and culture confirmed multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

- **Limitations**: This single case report is a proof of concept and is not a formal evaluation of clinical utility.

- **Conclusions**: A positive ELISPOT assay result helped diagnose subclinical active tuberculosis in an immunosuppressed patient with a false-negative tuberculin skin test result. Large prospective studies that compare benefits and costs of this alternative to tuberculin skin testing are needed.

### Defining the role of cellular immune signatures in diagnostic evaluation of suspected tuberculosis [^116VVA7a]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

In high-income, low-incidence regions, including Europe and North America, the proportion of active tuberculosis (TB) cases that are paucibacillary and/or extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) is large and rising. These clinical presentations usually necessitate invasive sampling, typically bronchoalveolar lavage for paucibacillary pulmonary TB and biopsies for EPTB. Moreover, clinical samples are commonly Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) culture-negative and acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear-negative, which makes diagnosis clinically challenging, prolongs the duration of hospital admission, and delays treatment initiation. Hence, there is an important unmet clinical need for a rapid, noninvasive blood test with sufficient specificity to rule in paucibacillary and EPTB.

A rational approach to detect TB infection in paucibacillary cases is to use tests measuring the Mtb-specific adaptive immune response, which provides an amplified signal of a low bacillary burden infection. Measuring such responses is possible from blood samples, obviating the need for invasive sampling.

- **Available immune tests**: Available immune tests for TB include the interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), which are commonly used in the diagnostic work-up of active TB. Indeed, the sensitivity of currently available and next-generation IGRAs far exceeds that of culture. However, IGRAs lack specificity for diagnosing active TB because they also score positive in patients with non-TB illness who have incidental, concomitant latent TB infection (LTBI). More sophisticated tests measuring additional aspects of cell-mediated immune response are needed.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^117PdHD8]. JAMA (2016). Low credibility.

Tuberculosis remains an important preventable disease in the United States. An effective strategy for reducing the transmission, morbidity, and mortality of active disease is the identification and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) to prevent progression to active disease.

- **Objective**: To issue a US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for LTBI.

- **Evidence review**: The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on screening for LTBI in asymptomatic adults seen in primary care, including evidence dating from the inception of searched databases.

- **Findings**: The USPSTF found adequate evidence that accurate screening tests for LTBI are available, treatment of LTBI provides a moderate health benefit in preventing progression to active disease, and the harms of screening and treatment are small. The USPSTF has moderate certainty that screening for LTBI in persons at increased risk for infection provides a moderate net benefit.

- **Conclusions and recommendation**: The USPSTF recommends screening for LTBI in populations at increased risk (B recommendation).

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for extrapulmonary tuberculosis, specifically concerning the screening for latent tuberculosis, the ATS/CDC/IDSA 2017 guidelines recommend considering an IGRA rather than a tuberculin skin test in all patients aged 5 years and older who meet the following criteria:

- **Likely to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis**: Individuals in this category should be prioritized for IGRA testing.

- **Low or intermediate risk of disease progression**: In these cases, the IGRA is preferred due to its specificity and likelihood of providing a more accurate assessment.

- **Testing for latent tuberculosis infection is warranted**: Testing should be conducted when it is deemed necessary to evaluate the risk of latent tuberculosis infection.

The 2005 CDC guidelines for preventing Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission in health care settings include recommendations for baseline tuberculosis (TB) screening of all U.S. health care personnel and annual testing for health care personnel working in medium-risk settings or settings with potential for ongoing transmission. Using evidence from a systematic review conducted by a National Tuberculosis Controllers Association (NTCA) work group and following methods adapted from the Guide to Community Preventive Services, the 2005 CDC recommendations for testing U.S. health care personnel have been updated and now include:

- **Tb screening and risk assessment**: TB screening with an individual risk assessment and symptom evaluation at baseline (preplacement).
- **Tb testing methods**: TB testing with an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) or a tuberculin skin test (TST) for persons without documented prior TB disease or latent TB infection (LTBI).
- **Routine serial tb testing**: No routine serial TB testing at any interval after baseline in the absence of a known exposure or ongoing transmission.
- **Treatment encouragement**: Encouragement of treatment for all health care personnel with untreated LTBI, unless treatment is contraindicated.
- **Annual symptom screening**: Annual symptom screening for health care personnel with untreated LTBI.
- **Annual tb education**: Annual TB education of all health care personnel.

### What if they don't have tuberculosis? The consequences and trade-offs involved in false-positive diagnoses of tuberculosis [^114MwQ5G]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

As outlined in the previous section, false-positive TB diagnoses arise from the trade-off between potential positive and negative effects of real-life screening and diagnostic processes. We propose that, rather than focusing solely on the positive potential of new screening strategies, these strategies should be evaluated through a comprehensive conceptual framework that acknowledges the potential negative consequences of false-positive diagnoses.

Any change in screening strategies should be assessed in terms of delivering the correct diagnosis for all individuals evaluated for TB, including those without TB. In settings where a more sensitive screening test is being considered, programs could explicitly focus on increasing the number of individuals who receive a true-positive diagnosis instead of a false-negative diagnosis. This must be balanced against the number of individuals who may receive a false-positive rather than a true-negative diagnosis. When more specific confirmatory testing is being considered, it is crucial to evaluate the number of false-positive diagnoses that could be averted and balance this against the number of true-positive diagnoses that may be missed.

The practical consequences of these choices are illustrated in Figure 2 and the final three columns in Table 1. As the prevalence of disease changes, the balance between additional true-positive and true-negative diagnoses shifts notably, an observation that is masked by simply counting the number of additional TB diagnoses.

### Clinical utility of existing and second-generation interferon-γ release assays for diagnostic evaluation of tuberculosis: An observational cohort study [^111Ex5Ty]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

The clinical utility of interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis is unclear, although they are commonly used in countries with a low incidence of tuberculosis. We aimed to resolve this clinical uncertainty by determining the accuracy and utility of commercially available and second-generation IGRAs in the diagnostic assessment of suspected tuberculosis in a low-incidence setting.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective cohort study of adults with suspected tuberculosis in routine secondary care in England. Patients were tested for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection at baseline with commercially available (T-SPOT.TB and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube [QFT-GIT]) and second-generation (incorporating novel M tuberculosis antigens) IGRAs and were followed up for 6–12 months to establish definitive diagnoses. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and predictive values of the tests were determined.

- **Findings**: Of the 1060 adults enrolled in the study, 845 were included in the analyses, and 363 were diagnosed with tuberculosis. Sensitivity of T-SPOT.TB for all tuberculosis diagnoses, including culture-confirmed and highly probable cases, was 81.4% (95% CI 76.6–85.3), which was higher than QFT-GIT (67.3% [62.0–72.1]). Second-generation IGRAs had a sensitivity of 94.0% (90.0–96.4) for culture-confirmed tuberculosis and 89.2% (85.2–92.2) when including highly probable tuberculosis, giving a negative likelihood ratio for all tuberculosis cases of 0.13 (95% CI 0.10–0.19). Specificity ranged from 86.2% (95% CI 82.3–89.4) for T-SPOT.

### Guidance for studies evaluating the accuracy of biomarker-based nonsputum tests to diagnose tuberculosis [^1144vwEY]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization's (WHO) "End TB" strategy calls for the development and implementation of novel tuberculosis (TB) diagnostics. Sputum-based diagnostics are challenging to implement and often less sensitive in high-priority populations. Nonsputum, biomarker-based tests may facilitate TB testing at lower levels of the healthcare system, accelerate treatment initiation, and improve outcomes.

We provide guidance on the design of diagnostic accuracy studies evaluating nonsputum, biomarker-based tests within the context of WHO's target product profile for such tests. Study designs should account for the intended use when choosing the study population, setting, and reference standards. Although adults with respiratory symptoms may be an initial target population, other high-priority populations regardless of symptoms — including people living with human immunodeficiency virus, those unable to produce sputum samples or with extrapulmonary TB, household contacts, and children — should be considered. Studies beyond diagnostic accuracy that evaluate feasibility and population-level impacts are also needed. A biomarker-based diagnostic may be critical to ending the TB epidemic, but requires appropriate validation before implementation.

### WHO consolidated guidelines on tuberculosis: Module 3: diagnosis – rapid diagnostics for tuberculosis detection [^1133fvYB]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pulmonary tuberculosis, specifically concerning nucleic acid amplification testing, the WHO 2021 guidelines recommend considering repeated testing with Xpert MTB/RIF. This involves conducting a total of two tests in sputum, gastric fluid, nasopharyngeal aspirate, or stool specimens. This recommendation is targeted at pediatric patients who show signs and symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis in settings where the pretest probability is ≥ 5% and the initial Xpert MTB/RIF result is negative.
