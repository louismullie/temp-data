## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many sides a rhombus has. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal definition of a rhombus. Then, I should verify the etymology and whether it implies a specific number of sides. Next, I will consider whether any of the provided references contain geometric definitions that could contradict or confirm the standard answer. Finally, I will select the correct option and briefly justify it with core geometric reasoning.

> Let me first confirm the definition. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all four sides of equal length, which by definition has four sides, and it is a special case of a parallelogram where adjacent sides are equal and opposite angles are equal, though I don't need to over-specify the angle properties to answer the question about side count [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the etymology to ensure I'm not missing a nuance. The word "rhombus" comes from Greek and historically referred to a spinning top or lozenge shape, which in plane geometry corresponds to a four-sided figure; none of the classical or modern geometric usages imply more than four sides, so the etymology supports the four-side conclusion rather than contradicting it [^notfound].

> I should double-check whether any of the supplied references provide conflicting geometric definitions. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; scanning the documents, I see no source that redefines a rhombus as having 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 12 sides, and there are no geometry textbooks or mathematical papers in the set that would override the standard definition, so the absence of contradictory sources reinforces the canonical answer [^notfound].

> Let me consider the answer choices carefully. Options A through I list numbers other than four, while option J is four; given the definition and the lack of conflicting references, the correct choice is J, which corresponds to four sides [^notfound].

> Final answer: J. 4.

A rhombus has **4 sides**. By definition, a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all four sides equal in length. The correct answer is **J. 4**.

---

## Geometric definition of a rhombus

A rhombus is a **quadrilateral** — a polygon with four sides — characterized by the following properties:

- **Equal side lengths**: All four sides are of equal length.
- **Opposite sides parallel**: Opposite sides are parallel, making it a parallelogram.
- **Opposite angles equal**: Opposite angles are equal in measure.
- **Diagonals bisect each other**: The diagonals intersect at right angles and bisect each other.

---

## Verification of the number of sides

To verify the number of sides, we can refer to the **definition of a quadrilateral**, which states that a quadrilateral is a polygon with four sides. Since a rhombus is a specific type of quadrilateral, it inherently has four sides. Additionally, the prefix "quad-" in quadrilateral literally means "four", further confirming that a rhombus has four sides.

---

## Common misconceptions

Some individuals may confuse a rhombus with other polygons, such as a hexagon (six sides) or an octagon (eight sides). However, these are entirely different geometric shapes with distinct properties. A rhombus is specifically a **four-sided polygon** with equal side lengths and opposite sides parallel.

---

## Conclusion

A rhombus has **four sides** of equal length, with opposite sides parallel and opposite angles equal. The correct answer is **J. 4**.

### Continued treatment with tirzepatide for maintenance of weight reduction in adults with obesity: the SURMOUNT-4 randomized clinical trial [^a87e4834]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study SURMOUNT-4 was published by Louis J Aronne and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the SURMOUNT-4 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of continued treatment with tirzepatide in adults with obesity or overweight? In the SURMOUNT-4 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SURMOUNT-4 study, the population was: 670 patients (473 female, 197 male). The inclusion criteria were adults with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² and a weight-related complication. The key exclusion criteria were diabetes; prior or planned surgical treatment for obesity; treatment with a medication that promotes weight loss within 3 months prior to enrollment. In the SURMOUNT-4 study, the interventions were: n = 335 tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks to a maintenance dose of 10–15 mg once weekly, and continued for a total of 52 weeks after a lead-in 36-week period of receiving tirzepatide) n = 335 placebo (matching placebo once weekly for 52 weeks after a lead-in 36-week period of receiving tirzepatide). In the SURMOUNT-4 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in mean reduction in weight from week 36 to 88 (5.5% vs. -14%; ARD 19.4, 95% CI 17.7 to 21.2). In the SURMOUNT-4 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in body weight from week 36 to 88 (4.7 kg vs. -11.1 kg; AD 15.8 kg, 95% CI 14.3 to 17.3) Significant increase in reduction in waist circumference from week 36 to 88 (4.3 cm vs. -7.8 cm; AD 12.1 cm, 95% CI 10.6 to 13.5) Significant increase in maintenance of ≥ 80% body weight reduction during 36-week lead-in at week 88 (89.5% vs. 16.6%; AD 44%, 95% CI 24.9 to 77.5). In the SURMOUNT-4 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse and serious adverse events. In the SURMOUNT-4 study, the conclusion was: in adults with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² and a weight-related complication, tirzepatide was superior to placebo with respect to mean reduction in weight from week 36 to 88.

### Controlling network ensembles [^0fba599f]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Table 1
The distributions from which the edge weights are drawn for the graph in Fig. 4 A.

The edge weights may be constant, δ, drawn from a uniform distribution, drawn from a triangular distribution, or drawn from a truncated normal distribution.

For this network, we choose nodes 1 and 2 to be driver nodes and nodes 5 and 6 to be target nodes so thatand C = [O 2×4 7D1 I 2]. The final vector value is chosen to be y f = [17D11] T and t f is chosen to be large enough such thatis sufficiently close to zero to be ignored. The largest eigenvalue, μ 0, and associated values, as a function of N, are shown in Fig. 4 B, C where we see the linear increase required by Assumptions 1 and 2. For N = 50, all of the eigenvalues, μ k, and associated values, for 25 realizations, are shown in Figs. 4 D, E, respectively. Again, it is apparent that the behavior agrees with the requirements laid out in Assumptions 1 and 2. As both assumptions hold, we can be sure that D N (b)/ N p, E N (b), and J N (b) all approach constant values in the N → ∞ limit. The particular values approached in this limit depend on the choice of b. The deviation is shown in Fig. 4 F and the control energy is shown in Fig. 4 G. We see that, since, as b grows, the slope of the deviation decreases. Similarly, since, as b grows, so does the control energy. Finally, the total cost is shown in Fig. 4 H, where the different growth rates are due to the coefficientthat appears in the approximate expressions derived in Supplementary Note 1.4.

### AIDS-related kaposi sarcoma, version 2.2019, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^1fdd7fba]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

Kaposi sarcoma — advanced disease management (NCCN v2.2026) directs that patients eligible for systemic therapy receive "Systemic therapy p or Clinical trial q and Continue or initiate ART j, k, l for PWH", with response leading to "Observe (KS-4) and Continue ART j, k for PWH"; if "Relapsed or progressive disease e", proceed to relapsed/refractory therapy: "Continue ART j, k for PWH and Clinical trial q or Relapsed/Refractory Disease Therapy s (KS-F) or RT o, u". Patients "Not immediately eligible for systemic therapy u" should undergo "Medical optimization u and Consider RT o, u and Continue or initiate ART j, k, l for PWH", then "Reassess eligibility for systemic therapy"; if "Not eligible for systemic therapy", "Consider RT or Best supportive care". Advanced disease is defined as "T1 disease, extensive T0 cutaneous disease, or nodal disease". Additional guidance states "Glucocorticoids in any formulation should be avoided due to their association with KS progression. However, in cases of life-threatening conditions, their use may be considered", that "Patients who are only on ART should be reassessed within 4 weeks", and that "Initiation of ART may result in IRIS within 3–6 months". For disseminated disease, "Systemic therapy should be considered over RT… whenever systemic therapy is feasible". Note: "All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated".

### Direct experimental observation of the molecular J = 3 / 2 ground state in the lacunar spinel GaTaSe [^3e6a3352]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Establishing the molecular J eff = 3/2 nature of GaTa 4 Se 8 does not only just provide the opportunities for investigating J eff physics but also elucidates the current important issues in GaTa 4 Se 8 and its close cousins such as GaNb 4 X 8 and GaMo 4 X 8 (X = Se, Te). In GaTa 4 Se 8, for example, the underlying mechanism is not clearly understood for the 'paramagnetic' insulator to metal transition and the superconductivity under pressure –. Furthermore, the magnetic behavior of this material at low temperatures does not seem to support a simple 'paramagnetic' Mott phase. It should be emphasized that the relativistic J eff state has not been identified in the previous studies, since it is a recent theoretical findingand is experimentally established in this study. On the basis of the current spectroscopic evidence, one can consider the ground state of GaTa 4 Se 8 as the manifestation of the frustrated magnetic phase emerging from the non-trivial interactions among the relativistic J eff = 3/2 moments. Moreover, we speculate that the superconductivity reported in this material is also related to this phase. We note that the other related lacunar spinel compound, GaNb 4 Se 8 which is also expected to have the molecular J eff = 3/2 nature, exhibits a quite similar low-temperature behavior and becomes superconducting. On the other hand, the molecular J eff = 1/2 material with basically the same structure, GaMo 4 X 8 (X = S, Se), is well understood as a ferromagnetand does not exhibit superconductivity. Our total energy calculation shows that the molecular J eff = 3/2 moments of the Ta 4 cluster are in fact antiferromagnetically coupled between neighboring clusters (E AFM-FM = −7.4 meV per cluster). Considering the fcc arrangement of this cluster unit, this strongly suggests magnetic frustration. In this regard, our current study may indicate that the molecular J eff moments are frustrated in this material. This is compatible with recent experimental observations of the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility, interpreted as a formation of dimerization and a spin singlet state.

### Effects of tirzepatide versus insulin glargine on kidney outcomes in type 2 diabetes in the SURPASS-4 trial: post-hoc analysis of an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial [^26198145]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

The study SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) was published by Hiddo J L Heerspink and colleagues in 2022 in the journal Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the trial question was: is tirzepatide superior to insulin glargine in patients with T2DM with regard to renal outcomes? In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the population was: 1995 patients. The inclusion criteria were adult patients with inadequately controlled T2DM on oral diabetes medication and high cardiovascular risk. The key exclusion criteria were T1DM mellitus, chronic or acute pancreatitis, acute or chronic hepatitis, diabetic retinopathy requiring urgent treatment, heart attack or stroke in the past 2 months. In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the interventions were: n = 995 tirzepatide (initiated at 2.5 mg SC once weekly and increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks until the randomly assigned maintenance dose of 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg once weekly was reached, and continued for a total of 104 weeks) n = 1000 insulin glargine (titrated to 100 U/mL SC once daily). In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in estimated glomerular filtration decline (1.4 mL/min/1.73 m² vs. 3.6 mL/min/1.73 m²; AD -2.2 mL/min/1.73 m², 95% CI -1.6 to -2.8). In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in urine albumin-creatinine ratio reduction (6.8% vs. -36.9%; AD 31.9%, 95% CI 25.7 to 37.7). In the SURPASS-4 (post-hoc analysis) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with inadequately controlled T2DM on oral diabetes medication and high cardiovascular risk, tirzepatide was superior to insulin glargine with respect to estimated glomerular filtration decline.

Association between TST and step count the following day

Table 4 and Fig. 2a presents a positive within-individual association between TST and step count the following day. The association was marginally non-significant in Model 2 (0.54 × 10 −3 steps per thousand; 95% CI: −4.05 × 10 −7, 1.08 × 10 −3) but became significant and slightly strengthened in Model 3 (0.55 × 10 −3 steps per thousand; 95% CI: 4.96 × 10 −6, 1.08 × 10 −3). In Model 4, the association was strengthened further (0.77 × 10 −3 steps per thousand; 95% CI: 0.26 × 10 −3, 1.27 × 10 −3). The between-individual association was significant and inverse in all models. The coefficient was gradually strengthened between Model 1 (−1.28 × 10 −2 steps per thousand; 95% CI: −2.13 × 10 −2, −0.43 × 10 −2), Model 2 (−1.29 × 10 −2 steps per thousand; 95% CI: −2.14 × 10 −2, −0.44 × 10 −2) and Model 3 (−1.48 × 10 −2 steps per thousand; 95% CI: −2.30 × 10 −2, −0.65 × 10 −2). The association was attenuated but remained significant in Model 4 (−1.27 × 10 −2 steps per thousand; 95% CI: −2.01 × 10 −2, −0.55 × 10 −2).

### Direct experimental observation of the molecular J = 3 / 2 ground state in the lacunar spinel GaTaSe [^c5fd8b5d]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Strong spin-orbit coupling lifts the degeneracy of t 2g orbitals in 5d transition-metal systems, leaving a Kramers doublet and quartet with effective angular momentum of J eff = 1/2 and 3/2, respectively. These spin-orbit entangled states can host exotic quantum phases such as topological Mott state, unconventional superconductivity, and quantum spin liquid. The lacunar spinel GaTa 4 Se 8 was theoretically predicted to form the molecular J eff = 3/2 ground state. Experimental verification of its existence is an important first step to exploring the consequences of the J eff = 3/2 state. Here, we report direct experimental evidence of the J eff = 3/2 state in GaTa 4 Se 8 by means of excitation spectra of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering at the Ta L 3 and L 2 edges. We find that the excitations involving the J eff = 1/2 molecular orbital are absent only at the Ta L 2 edge, manifesting the realization of the molecular J eff = 3/2 ground state in GaTa 4 Se 8. The strong interaction between electron spin and orbital degrees of freedom in 5d oxides can lead to exotic electronic ground states. Here the authors use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering to demonstrate that the theoretically proposed J eff = 3/2 state is realised in GaTa 4 Se 8.

### Development of an equine herpesvirus type 4-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a B-cell epitope as an antigen [^07410dad]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

The equine herpesvirus type 4 (EHV-4)-specific region of glycoprotein G has served as an antigen for serodiagnosis and seroepizootic studies of EHV-4 infection (B. S. Crabb and M. J. Studdert, J. Virol. 67:6332–6338, 1993; S. Yasunaga, K. Maeda, T. Matsumura, K. Kai, H. Iwata, and T. Inoue, J. Vet. Med. Sci. 60:1133–137, 1998; S. Yasunaga, K. Maeda, T. Matsumura, T. Kondo, and K. Kai, J. Vet. Med. Sci. 62:687–691, 2000). Here we identified a major B-cell epitope in the type-specific region of EHV-4 and applied it as an antigen in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). A 24-amino-acid repeat sequence expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein specifically reacted as well as the type-specific region with sera from foals infected with EHV-4. Five synthetic peptides (12-mer peptides) in the repeat sequence were included as ELISA antigens. The results indicated that the 12-mer peptide MKNNPIYSEGSL contained a major B-cell epitope specific for EHV-4 infection. Inclusion of this 12-mer peptide in ELISAs for an epidemiological study specifically detected EHV-4 infection in the field. These results indicated that the 12-mer epitope was responsible for the type-specific antibody response and therefore is useful for seroepizootic studies and serodiagnosis of EHV-4 infection.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of tofogliflozin as add-on to insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes: results from a 52-week, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, open-label extension, phase 4 study in Japan (J-STEP / INS) [^2f59edb7]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Mean insulin dose ± SD at baseline was 26.71 U ± 17.69 and 28.50 U ± 19.40 in the tofo‐tofo and pla‐tofo groups, respectively. Overall, the insulin dose slightly decreased from baseline to Week 52 (mean change ± SE, −1.27 U ± 0.615 and −0.58 U ± 0.915 in the tofo‐tofo and pla‐tofo groups, respectively) (Figure 2 B).

As observed with the HbA1c and FPG levels, body weight reduced after tofogliflozin add‐on to insulin treatment in the tofo‐tofo and pla‐tofo groups and this reduction was maintained throughout the study. Mean body weight ± SD at baseline, Week 16 and Week 52 was 68.84 kg ± 13.24, 67.41 kg ± 13.02 and 67.73 kg ± 13.50 in the tofo‐tofo group and was 72.24 kg ± 11.12, 72.37 kg ± 11.57 and 70.29 kg ± 11.73 in the pla‐tofo group, respectively. Mean change ± SE from baseline to Week 52 was −1.52 kg ± 0.207 and −2.13 kg ± 0.313 in the tofo‐tofo and pla‐tofo groups, respectively (Figure 2 C).

Mean changes in HbA1c, FPG, insulin dose and body weight from baseline to Week 52 by each insulin regimen (basal‐bolus, bolus, premix [low and high] and basal) are summarized in Table S2. Figure S3 shows mean HbA1c change ± SE from baseline through the follow‐up visits for each regimen. In the tofo‐tofo group, HbA1c mean change ± SE from baseline to Week 52 was −0.39% ± 0.116, −0.55% ± 0.187, −0.57% ± 0.155 and −1.03% ± 0.121 for patients with basal‐bolus, bolus, premix (low and high) and basal insulin, respectively. We observed a slight decrease in insulin doses in most regimens from baseline to Week 52 except in the basal‐bolus and basal regimens in the pla‐tofo group (Table S2).

### FOLFIRINOX versus gemcitabine for metastatic pancreatic cancer [^85a93953]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

The study PRODIGE 4 ACCORD 11 was published by Conroy T and colleagues in 2011 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Pancreatic cancer. In the PRODIGE 4 ACCORD 11 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of leucovorin, fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin regimen as first-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer? In the PRODIGE 4 ACCORD 11 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the PRODIGE 4 ACCORD 11 study, the population was: 342 patients (131 female, 211 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer and an ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1. The key exclusion criteria were age ≥ 76 years; endocrine or acinar pancreatic carcinoma; previous radiotherapy for measurable lesions; cerebral metastases; history of another major cancer; active infection; chronic diarrhea; clinically significant history of cardiac disease; pregnancy or lactation. In the PRODIGE 4 ACCORD 11 study, the interventions were: n = 171 FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin, 85 mg per square meter of body-surface area; irinotecan, 180 mg per square meter; leucovorin, 400 mg per square meter; and fluorouracil, 400 mg per square meter given as a bolus followed by 2400 mg per square meter given as a 46-hour continuous infusion, every 2 weeks) n = 171 gemcitabine (at a dose of 1,000 mg per square meter weekly for 7 of 8 weeks and then weekly for 3 of 4 weeks). In the PRODIGE 4 ACCORD 11 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in overall survival (11.1 months vs. 6.8 months; HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.22). In the PRODIGE 4 ACCORD 11 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in median progression-free survival (6.4 vs. 3.3; HR 2.13, 95% CI 1.69 to 2.7) Significant increase in objective response (31.6% vs. 9.4%; RR 3.36, 95% CI 1.37 to 5.35). In the PRODIGE 4 ACCORD 11 study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in adverse events, including febrile neutropenia (5.4% vs. 1.2%, p = 0.03) and definitive degradation of QoL (31% vs. 66%, p < 0.001; HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30–0.70). In the PRODIGE 4 ACCORD 11 study, the conclusion was: in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer and an ECOG performance status score of 0 or 1, FOLFIRINOX was superior to gemcitabine with respect to overall survival.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^7596719a]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Practice Point 2.2.4 — Note that risk prediction equations developed for use in people with CKD G3a–G5 may not be valid for use in those with CKD G1–G2. The Work Group recognizes that the progression of CKD can occur at all severities, and that in earlier stages of disease (G1–G3), large declines in eGFR can occur in 2- to 5-year time frames without reaching kidney failure, and risk prediction models developed in populations with later stages of CKD are not accurate in CKD G1–G2.

### Contribution of extra-cardiac cells in murine heart valves is age-dependent [^13dcaee4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

To complement studies utilizing young eGFP bone marrow cell donors, experiments were repeated to determine the fate of eGFP cells from aging (> 12 months) donors in young and old recipients. Similar to young donors, aged eGFP bone marrow cells were > 98% positive for CD45 (data not shown); however, significantly fewer aging eGFP donor cells costained with CD11b (Figure 4 J) when compared with young donors (Figure 3 J). In addition, unlike findings using bone marrow cells from young donor mice, there were no significant differences in the percentage of GFP and CD11b double‐positive cells in young and aging recipients receiving bone marrow cells from aging donors (Figure 4 B, 4 F, and 4 J). This pattern of insignificant differences between young and aging recipient mice following transplantation with aging eGFP donor cells was also true for F4/80 (Figure 4 C, 4 G, and 4 J), CD31 (Figure 4 D, 4 H, and 4 J), and Vimentin (Figure 4 E, 4 I, and 4 J). Although only few eGFP donor cells from young mice coexpressed F4/80 in young and aging recipient (Figure 3 J), coexpression was not detected in donor cells from aging mice (Figure 4 J). However, aging donor cells did coexpress CD31 and Vimentin at levels similar to younger eGFP bone marrow cells when transplanted into young recipients. However, CD31/ eGFP coexpression was undetected in aging donor cells transplanted into aging recipients (Figure 4 J). These findings indicate that transplanted bone marrow cells from aging mice have lower potential toward myeloid and valve cell phenotypes and this is independent of age of the recipient.

### Improving empiric antibiotic selection for patients hospitalized with abdominal infection: the INSPIRE 4 cluster randomized clinical trial [^12fa866e]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

The study INSPIRE 4 was published by Shruti K Gohil and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA Surg. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute appendicitis, Acute cholecystitis, Acute cholangitis, Acute diverticulitis and Intra-abdominal abscess. In the INSPIRE 4 study, the trial question was: what is the role of computerized provider order entry stewardship bundle in noncritically ill patients hospitalized with abdominal infection? In the INSPIRE 4 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the INSPIRE 4 study, the population was: 105004 patients (62101 female, 42903 male). The inclusion criteria were noncritically ill patients hospitalized with abdominal infection. The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years; ordered to receive extended-spectrum antibiotics for abdominal infection. In the INSPIRE 4 study, the interventions were: n = 50620 CPOE stewardship bundle (computerized patient order entry prompts recommending standard-spectrum antibiotics coupled with clinician education and feedback) n = 54384 routine stewardship (educational materials and quarterly coaching calls to maintain stewardship activities per national guidelines). In the INSPIRE 4 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reduction in extended-spectrum days of therapy (169.3 days per 1,000 empiric days vs. 19.8 days per 1000 empiric days; RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.4 to 1.66). In the INSPIRE 4 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in reduction in vancomycin days of therapy (29.7 days per 1,000 empiric days vs. 11.8 days per 1000 empiric days; RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.37) Significant increase in reduction in antipseudomonal days of therapy (131.8 days per 1,000 empiric days vs. 5.6 days per 1000 empiric days; RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.49 to 1.78). In the INSPIRE 4 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in length of stay, days to ICU transfers. In the INSPIRE 4 study, the conclusion was: in noncritically ill patients hospitalized with abdominal infection, CPOE stewardship bundle was superior to routine stewardship with respect to reduction in extended-spectrum days of therapy.

### Observing network dynamics through sentinel nodes [^535cd88c]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The reason is that in order to capture the behavior of the average, we must balance nodes from different groups in the network. For example, in Fig. 1 f, the n = 4 nodes selected for S have degrees 1, 6, 7, and 8. Thevalues for these four nodes, shown by the four blue lines, illustrate precisely this balance: some appear aboveand some below, depending on whether their degrees are large or small. As a result, the average over these four selected nodes offers an accurate approximation of. Qualitatively, we observe the same effect also for n = 2 and 3, as shown in Fig. 1 d, e, respectively.

In Fig. 3 f–j, we repeat the same analysis for a Barabási-Albert (BA) network with N = 10 3 nodes. Here, the largest hub nodes, with k i = 38, 40, 66, 76, and 81, appear as discrete peaks in the inset of Fig. 3 f. By examining the optimized sentinel node sets in Fig. 3 g–j, we find that this inset is empty, implying that our optimization algorithm does not select these hub nodes under all values of n ∈ {1, 2, 3, 6}, in any of the 100 runs. Instead, we observe that S comprises a mixture of nodes with both small and moderately large degrees in all cases, however, avoiding the largest hubs. This result further strengthens our observation above, pertaining to individual nodes, that S tends to exclude the hubs (Supplementary Section S7; see Fig. S14).

### Physical therapy management of older adults with hip fracture [^9df28b6a]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Hip fracture: clinical practice guidelines — Appendix J details weight-bearing exercise programs. Oldmeadow et al initiated walking within 4 d of surgery with task timing by ambulation status: early ambulators day 1 or 2 and delayed ambulators day 3 or 4. Sherrington and Lord recruited subjects an average of 7 mo after a fall-related hip fracture for 1 mo once per day; testing described a block task assessed for each leg using both a 5.5-cm and a 10.5-cm block. Sherrington et al reported participants where 82% lived in the community; programs were delivered for 4 mo once per day using sit-to-stand, step-ups, forward foot taps, and a stepping grid, progressed by increased repetitions, decreased support, increasing height of blocks, and decreasing the height of the surface patients were standing up from, with sets based on patient's ability.

### Semaglutide improves cardiometabolic risk factors in adults with overweight or obesity: STEP 1 and 4 exploratory analyses [^8785ac70]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

The methodology of STEP 1 and 4 has been described previously.

2.1 Study designs

STEP 1 (NCT03548935) was a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial (Figure S1). Participants were randomized 2:1 to once‐weekly s.c. semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo, with lifestyle intervention for 68 weeks. STEP 4 (NCT03548987) was a randomized withdrawal trial in which all participants received semaglutide during a 20‐week run‐in period (Figure S2). Participants reaching the once‐weekly s.c. semaglutide 2.4 mg target maintenance dose at week 20 were randomized 2:1 to continue semaglutide or switch to placebo for 48 weeks. All participants received lifestyle intervention throughout the 68 weeks.

Both trials were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Protocols were approved by independent ethics committees or institutional review boards at each study site. All participants provided written informed consent.

2.2 Study population

Participants in both trials were aged ≥ 18 years with one or more self‐reported unsuccessful dietary effort to lose weight and body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m 2 or ≥ 27 kg/m 2 with one or more weight‐related comorbidity without diabetes.

2.3 Outcomes and assessments

The endpoints assessed are detailed below, with information on how they were measured in the Supporting Information.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, more specifically with respect to noninvasive assessment of fibrosis, EASD/EASL/EASO 2024 guidelines recommend to use a multi-step approach in adult patients with MASLD:

- obtain an established non-patented blood-based score, such as the fibrosis-4 index, as the first step

- obtain established imaging techniques, such as liver elastography, as the second step to further clarify the fibrosis stage if fibrosis is still suspected or in high-risk groups.

### Clinical safety and efficacy of rotational atherectomy in Japanese patients with peripheral arterial disease presenting femoropopliteal lesions: the J-SUPREME and J-SUPREME II trials [^0678e080]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of the J-SUPREME (J-S) and J-SUPREME II (J-SII) trials was to evaluate the performance of the Jetstream Atherectomy System for the treatment of Japanese patients with symptomatic occlusive atherosclerotic lesions in the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries.

Materials and Methods

The J-S and J-SII trials were both prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical trials. Patients in J-S underwent Jetstream atherectomy followed by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), whereas those in J-SII had adjunctive drug-coated balloon (DCB) treatment following atherectomy. Patients were adults with Rutherford category 2, 3, or 4 and had stenotic, restenotic, or occlusive lesion(s) with a degree of stenosis ≥ 70 in the superficial femoral artery and/or proximal popliteal artery. In J-S, lesions were required to be calcified, and in J-SII lesions were required to be severely calcified.

Results

A total of 50 patients were enrolled in J-S (mean age 72.3 ± 8.7years, lesion length 82.0 ± 41.5mm, 36% calcification PACSS Grade 3, 22% Grade 4) and 31 patients in J-SII (mean age 72.5 ± 7.7years, lesion length 122.6 ± 55.6mm, 19.4% calcification PACSS Grade 3, 77.4% Grade 4). No bailout stenting or bypass conversions were required. No major adverse events (MAEs) were reported for either trial through 1month. The 6-month primary patency for J-S, with PTA alone following atherectomy, was 40.4% (19/47). The 6-month primary patency for J-SII, with DCB treatment following atherectomy, was 96.7% (29/30). At 6-month post-procedure, 79.2% (38/48) of patients in J-S, and 100% (30/30) of patients in J-SII had improved by at least 1 Rutherford category.

Conclusion

J-SUPREME trial results demonstrate procedural safety and efficacy of the Jetstream Atherectomy System and J-SII showed sustained patency through 6months following combination treatment with Jetstream atherectomy and DCB.

### Two-year effects of semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 5 trial [^9a062698]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease that requires continuous effort to control. With all nonsurgical interventions and to some extent with bariatric surgery, weight regain after initial weight loss is common –. In contrast to findings with behavioral – and other pharmacological interventions, the similar mean weight loss achieved with semaglutide 2.4 mg in STEP 5 at weeks 52 and 104 (–15.6% and –15.2%, respectively) suggests that, on average, there is minimal weight regain over 104 weeks when once-weekly semaglutide therapy is continued. When interpreted together with the findings of the STEP 4 withdrawal trial and STEP 1 off-treatment extension study, which both showed weight regain after semaglutide discontinuation (after 20 weeks' treatment in STEP 4 and 68 weeks' treatment in STEP 1), these results support the benefit of continued semaglutide treatment for sustained weight loss.

Prior 68-week trials in adults with overweight or obesity have reported cardiometabolic improvements with semaglutide 2.4 mg (refs.). Consistent with these findings, in STEP 5 semaglutide treatment improved a range of cardiometabolic risk parameters, including waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, HbA 1c levels, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. Collectively, these results indicate a beneficial effect of treatment on overall patient health. In addition, semaglutide treatment reduced C-reactive protein levels, a marker of systemic inflammation that is known to be elevated in patients with obesity. The reduction in fasting insulin and glucose with semaglutide is indicative of an increase in insulin sensitivity. Similar to the findings of other studies in the STEP trial program, exploratory outcomes showed that in the semaglutide group 80% of participants with prediabetes at baseline reverted to normoglycemia by the end of the trial (compared with 37% of those receiving placebo), while 99% of participants with normoglycemia at baseline maintained normoglycemia at the end of the trial (compared with 86% with placebo). These findings suggest a potential beneficial effect of semaglutide on glycemic status, but whether semaglutide treatment delays or prevents progression to type 2 diabetes requires confirmation. In the 68-week trials, reductions in weight, waist circumference, blood pressure and HbA 1c appeared to plateau around week 60 with semaglutide. STEP 5 shows that the changes in these parameters were sustained through 104 weeks' treatment.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^edb40f61]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Complaint systems (Section 4.3) — case finding via passive community reports is described and operational steps are outlined. The guideline states, "In complaint systems, public health agencies receive, triage, and respond to reports from the community about possible foodborne disease events. Reporting is passive and falls into two basic categories:" "Reports from an individual or group who observes a pattern of illness affecting a group of people, usually after a common exposure (e.g., event or venue); and" "Multiple independent reports about illness in single individuals (4.3.3)". Process steps are: "Health-care provider reports and reports from other community members of unusual disease clusters are triaged; occurrence of the same disease is confirmed; cases are interviewed; data are analyzed; and investigations are initiated". For event- or venue-associated group illness, "the investigation generally involves obtaining lists of attendees, confirming ill persons have the same disease, obtaining menus from the event (and other possible group exposures), interviewing cases, performing a cohort or case–control study, and collecting food and patient specimens". For independent complaints, "individuals are interviewed about their illness and exposures at the time of the report", exposure information "generally is limited and biased toward exposures shortly before onset of symptoms", and "Two or more persons with a common exposure identified through interview of independent complaints are used to identify clusters of illness in much the same manner as".

### Between synchrony and turbulence: intricate hierarchies of coexistence patterns [^78640145]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

If we initialize the N /2 − N /2 solution at a point in the c 2 − η parameter plane were it is stable and from there on gradually change c 2 and/or η appropriately, one of the two clusters will break up into two smaller clusters. A possible outcome is shown in Fig. 1 i, j. The trajectory of the two new clusters is no longer simply periodic, but period-2, with a small and a large loop. The N /2 − N /2 solution has thus become unstable in a symmetry-breaking period-doubling bifurcation, giving rise to a stable N /2 − N /4 − N /4 three-cluster solution. This bifurcation also destabilizes less balanced two-cluster solutions, such as the 3 N /4 − N /4 solution in Fig. 1 g, h. In these cases, the smaller of the two clusters is split. The position of of the period-doubling bifurcation in parameter space depends on the relative sizes of the clusters, as shown by the blue line in Fig. 1 k, which tracks the value of c 2 at which this bifurcation occurs as a function of N 1 / N for η = 0.67.

For very unbalanced solutions N 1 / N > 0.8, the smallest cluster is destroyed in a subcritical pitchfork bifurcation (green line). This results in several smaller clusters and/or single oscillators, depending on the relative sizes of the initial two clusters. In some cases, a few oscillators originally in the smaller cluster are also absorbed by the larger one. As the transition is subcritical, these outcome states are not directly related to the initial two-cluster solution, but rather belong to a different, coexisting solution branch. They will not concern us further here.

### Semaglutide improves cardiometabolic risk factors in adults with overweight or obesity: STEP 1 and 4 exploratory analyses [^5b1b4bb9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

Evaluate the effects of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg on cardiometabolic risk factors in people with overweight/obesity without diabetes in the STEP 1 and 4 trials.

Materials and Methods

STEP 1 and 4 were phase III, 68-week, placebo-controlled trials of once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg combined with lifestyle intervention; STEP 4 had a 20-week semaglutide run-in and 48-week randomized withdrawal period. Participants had a body mass index ≥ 30kg/m 2 or ≥ 27kg/m 2 with one or more weight-related comorbidity, without diabetes. Pre-specified endpoints were changes in waist circumference, systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP), lipids, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting serum insulin and antihypertensive/lipid-lowering medication use. Post-hoc assessments included non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; STEP 1 only), atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association algorithm; STEP 1 only) and cardiometabolic risk factors by weight loss achieved (< 5%, 5% to < 10%, 10% to < 15%, or ≥ 15%) (STEP 1 only).

Results

Of the 1961 participants in STEP 1 and 803 in STEP 4, most had one or more complication/comorbidity at baseline, with dyslipidaemia and hypertension most prevalent. In STEP 1, reductions in waist circumference, SBP, DBP, FPG, fasting serum insulin, lipids and HOMA-IR were greater with semaglutide versus placebo (p ≤ .001). Reductions in SBP, non-HDL cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and FPG were generally greater with semaglutide than placebo within weight-loss categories. Non-significant ASCVD risk reductions were observed with semaglutide versus placebo (p > .05). In STEP 4, improvements in waist circumference, SBP, FPG, fasting serum insulin and lipids during the semaglutide run-in (week 0–20) were maintained over week 20–68 with continued semaglutide, but deteriorated following the switch to placebo (p < .001 [week 20–68]). Net reductions in antihypertensive/lipid-lowering medication use occurred with semaglutide versus placebo (both trials).

Conclusions

Semaglutide may improve cardiometabolic risk factors and reduce antihypertensive/lipid-lowering medication use versus placebo in adults with overweight/obesity without diabetes. These potential benefits were not maintained after treatment discontinuation.

### The 4.2 ka event is not remarkable in the context of holocene climate variability [^1b6bfcbc]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Results and Discussion

Meta-analysis of the "4.2 ka event" in peer-reviewed literature

We reviewed the literature on the 4.2 ka event to characterize how this interval is described across different archive types and regions by searching for peer-reviewed articles that contain the term "4.2 ka event" using the Web of Science bibliographic database (see Methods). This helped to characterize the climate variables that have been used to document an event, its prominence in different regions, and identify the minimum resolution of proxy records that would likely capture the event, thereby narrowing the search criteria for paleoclimate datasets to include in this study.

The search returned 88 articles (Supplemental Table S1), of which, 73% were published during the past five years (2018 and after). To expand the collection, we also included an additional 21 articles which Railsback et al.identified as including the 4.2 ka event that were not found in our literature search. Among the 109 articles, evidence of the 4.2 ka event was described by the original authors and we could visibly recognize changes in timeseries of most of the records (99/109 = 91%). However, the type and timing of abrupt change varied substantially between these studies. We found excursions to be the most common (48/109 = 44%), followed by shifts in the long-term mean (21/109 = 19%). The remaining studies report a wide variety of different types of change (Table S1), and include many that tacitly or explicitly assumed a climatic deterioration had occurred at 4.2 ka and then used their data to evaluate its effect on human or natural systems. The timing of the 4.2 ka excursions in these records also varied substantially, beginning as early as 4.6 ka (median = 4.2 ka) and ending as recently as 3.4 ka (median = 4.0 ka), with an average duration of 325 ± 170 (± 1 SD) years (Fig. 1). These results informed our choice to focus on climate excursions, as well as the parameters used in our excursion detection approach (Methods).

The safety of tocilizumab-IV was studied in 188 pediatric patients 2 to 17 years of age with PJIA who had an inadequate clinical response or were intolerant to methotrexate. The total patient exposure in the tocilizumab-IV all exposure population (defined as patients who received at least one dose of tocilizumab-IV) was 184.4 patient years. At baseline, approximately half of the patients were taking oral corticosteroids and almost 80% were taking methotrexate. In general, the types of adverse drug reactions in patients with PJIA were consistent with those seen in RA and SJIA patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.7)].

Infections

The rate of infections in the tocilizumab-IV all exposure population was 163.7 per 100 patient years. The most common events observed were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections. The rate of serious infections was numerically higher in patients weighing less than 30 kg treated with 10 mg/kg tocilizumab (12.2 per 100 patient years) compared to patients weighing at or above 30 kg, treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab (4.0 per 100 patient years). The incidence of infections leading to dose interruptions was also numerically higher in patients weighing less than 30 kg treated with 10 mg/kg tocilizumab (21%) compared to patients weighing at or above 30 kg, treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab (8%).

Infusion Reactions

In PJIA patients, infusion-related reactions are defined as all events occurring during or within 24 hours of an infusion. In the tocilizumab-IV all exposure population, 11 patients (6%) experienced an event during the infusion, and 38 patients (20.2%) experienced an event within 24 hours of an infusion. The most common events occurring during infusion were headache, nausea and hypotension, and occurring within 24 hours of infusion were dizziness and hypotension. In general, the adverse drug reactions observed during or within 24 hours of an infusion were similar in nature to those seen in RA and SJIA patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1 and 6.7)].

No clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions associated with tocilizumab and requiring treatment discontinuation were reported.

### Cross-cultural comparison of the scoliosis research society outcomes instrument between American and Japanese idiopathic scoliosis patients: are there differences? [^e7ef4beb]. Spine (2007). Low credibility.

Study Design

A comparative study.

Objective

To report a preliminary evaluation of the Scoliosis Research Society Outcomes Instrument (SRS-24) and determine whether differences in baseline scores exist between American and Japanese patients with idiopathic scoliosis.

Summary Of Background Data

Because the SRS outcomes instrument was primarily introduced for the American population, baseline scores in the Japanese population might differ from the American population. A comparative study using the SRS instrument between American and Japanese patients with idiopathic scoliosis has not been reported.

Methods

Two comparable groups of 100 idiopathic scoliosis patients before spinal fusion were separated into American (A) and Japanese (J). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups for gender (A: 9 men/91 women vs. J: 13 men/87 women), age (A: 15.0 ± 2.4 vs. J: 14.9 ± 3.8), main curve location (A: 77 thoracic/23 lumbar, J: 76 thoracic/24 lumbar), main curve Cobb angle (A: 50.5 ± 5.2 vs. J: 51.1 ± 8.7), and thoracic kyphosis (A: 20.9 ± 14.3 vs. J: 19.9 ± 12.1) (P > 0.05, for all comparisons). Patients were evaluated using the first section of the SRS-24 which was divided into 4 domains: total pain, general self-image, general function, and activity. SRS-24 scores were statistical compared in individual domains and questions using the Mann-Whitney U test.

Results

American patients had significantly lower scores in pain (P < 0.0001, A: 3.7 ± 0.8 vs. J: 4.3 ± 0.4), function (P < 0.01, A: 3.9 ± 0.6 vs. J: 4.2 ± 0.5), and activity (P < 0.0001, A: 4.5 ± 0.8 vs. J: 4.9 ± 0.3) domains compared with Japanese patients. Japanese patients had significantly lower scores in the self-image (P < 0.0001, A: 4.0 ± 0.7 vs. J: 3.5 ± 0.5) domain. With regard to individual questions, there were significant differences in the scores between the 2 groups for all questions except 5 and 13 (P < 0.05, for all comparisons).

Conclusion

SRS-24 scores in the Japanese idiopathic scoliosis population differed from that of the American population. Japanese patients had less back pain, a negative self-image regarding back deformity, higher general physical function, and daily activity. It is highly probable that patient's perceptions differ due to cultural differences, which affect SRS-24 scores so a cross-cultural comparison of the SRS instrument content is necessary in the future.

### Semaglutide 2.4 mg for the treatment of obesity: key elements of the STEP trials 1 to 5 [^ebad60f3]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

In the sustained WM trial (STEP 4, NCT03548987), 902 participants with obesity or overweight, without T2D, are being treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly. Those completing a 20‐week run‐in period are being randomly assigned in a 2:1 manner to receive continued semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo for an additional 48 weeks to assess WL (Figure 4, Table 1). Approximately 750 eligible participants will be randomly assigned. In addition, it has a withdrawal trial design to assess the change in weight after switching from semaglutide to placebo.

Figure 4
Sustained weight management trial design (Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity 4). This is a 68‐week, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, two‐armed, multicenter, multinational withdrawal clinical trial, with 7 weeks of follow‐up without treatment for safety assessments, comparing semaglutide 2.4 mg (subcutaneously, once weekly) with placebo, as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention, in people with obesity or overweight. *During the 20‐week run‐in period, participants start a dose escalation (visit 2 [week 0]) with semaglutide 2.4 mg (subcutaneously, once weekly) as an adjunct to a reduced‐calorie diet and increased physical activity for 20 weeks. The run‐in period includes 4 weeks at the target dose (semaglutide subcutaneously, 2.4 mg once weekly).

In the long‐term WM trial (STEP 5, NCT03693430), 304 participants with obesity or overweight, without T2D, are being randomly assigned in a 1:1 manner to receive semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo to assess WL (Figure 5, Table 1) over a 2‐year period.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^8a14a86b]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury staging — AKIN and RIFLE criteria specify parallel thresholds for serum creatinine (SCr), urine output, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Stage 1 requires an SCr change of "Increase of more than or equal to 0.3 mg/dl (≥ 26.5 μmol/l) or increase to more than or equal to 150% to 200% (1.5 to 2-fold) from baseline" with urine output "Less than 0.5 ml/kg/h for more than 6 hours", corresponding to RIFLE "Risk Increase in serum creatinine × 1.5 or GFR decrease ≥ 25%". Stage 2 is "Increased to more than 200% to 300% (> 2 to 3-fold) from baseline" with urine output "Less than 0.5 ml/kg per hour for more than 12 hours", corresponding to RIFLE "Injury Serum creatinine × 2 or GFR decrease > 50%". Stage 3 is "Increased to more than 300% (> 3-fold) from baseline, or more than or equal to 4.0 mg/dl (≥ 354 μmol/l) with an acute increase of at least 0.5 mg/dl (44 μmol/l) or on RRT" with urine output "Less than 0.3 ml/kg/h for 24 hours or anuria for 12 hours", corresponding to RIFLE "Failure Serum creatinine × 3, or serum creatinine > 4.0 mg/dl (> 354 μmol/l) with an acute rise > 0.5 mg/dl (> 44 μmol/l) or GFR decreased ≥ 75%". For application, "only one criterion (creatinine rise or urine output decline) needs to be fulfilled", and timing differs: "For AKIN, the increase in creatinine must occur in < 48 hours. For RIFLE, AKI should be both abrupt (within 1–7 days) and sustained (more than 24 hours)". A unit note states "For conversion of creatinine expressed in S. I units to mg/dl, divide by 88.4".

### Definition and classification of dystonia [^20a4923b]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We propose here a revision of the definition and classification of dystonia that considers published observations as well as the panel's direct experience since the original publication. The double‐axis structure is retained, as it has greatly contributed to a logical systematization of the varied clinical expressions of dystonia and has been also implemented in classifications of other movement disorders. The primary aim of this revision was to make the classification utilizable by nonexperts (including non‐clinicians) and experienced neurologists.

This revision introduces a few changes to the originally proposed clinical characteristics (Axis I) and etiopathogenesis (Axis II), with the intention of facilitating an improved systematic collection of clinically meaningful data and more explicit recognition of the heterogeneity of biological processes associated with dystonia (Table 4). Compared to the previous classification, Axis I now contains more information. Temporal dimensions are a key feature for the proper systematic grouping of the clinical characteristics of dystonia. This Axis I category is now described in greater detail and also includes dystonia onset. Phenomenology has been added as a new Axis I category to describe relevant phenomenological features, especially the relationship to voluntary action. Finally, the associated features now better differentiate isolated dystonia from combined forms. Axis II provides refinement of increased knowledge regarding the complex etiology and pathogenesis of dystonia.

TABLE 4
Main changes introduced by this revision of the dystonia classification

Although the general structure has not been dramatically altered, all the nomenclature items have been reviewed in detail and better defined. In addition, this revision provides practical examples to facilitate an unequivocal implementation of the classification. These examples also show that many Axis I characteristics may provide a hint to selected etiologies listed under Axis II. For example, an early age of onset may suggest a genetic origin, whereas a focal or segmental distribution with an adult onset may suggest an idiopathic etiology, such as cranial‐cervical dystonia. Connecting Axis I and II features should guide appropriate diagnostic testing.

This revision also more explicitly addresses the phenomenological relationship between dystonia, tremor, and myoclonus. The definition and Axis I recognize the tremulous and jerky appearance of dystonia, as well as the need to distinguish when myoclonus and tremor represent separate entities.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^47ace4c5]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy guideline — evidence-based statement categories and clinician implications define four levels: A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms, and clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. A recommendation means the benefits exceed the harms but the quality of evidence is not as strong; clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. An option means that either the quality of evidence that exists is suspect or that well-done studies show little clear advantage to one approach vs another; clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives, and patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. No recommendation means there is both a lack of pertinent evidence and an unclear balance between benefits and harms; clinicians should feel little constraint in their decision making and be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit vs harm, and patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

### Guidelines for foodborne disease outbreak response. 2nd ed [^2a5bfc1b]. CDC (2014). Medium credibility.

Foodborne disease surveillance and outbreak detection — actions to strengthen reporting, laboratory practices, exposure assessment, cluster detection, and communication are specified as follows: "Increase reporting and isolate submission by clinical laboratories and health-care providers through education, modification of reporting rules, laboratory audits, and simplification of the reporting process (4.2.10.1)". Actions include "Amend reporting rules to expand the definition of required clinical materials for submission to include patient specimens (e.g., stools, urine, blood), because isolates, currently specified in most reporting rules, may not be available due to culture-independent diagnostics (4.2.10.2)", "Undertake subtyping of isolates as specimens are submitted, and post results to national databases as quickly as possible (4.2.10.2)", and "Interview cases by using a standardized questionnaire for exposure information (consistent with the incubation period of the pathogen) as soon as possible, when patient recall and motivation to cooperate is the greatest". Interview methods state to "Construct the interview to include a mix of question types (i.e., specific close-ended questions, broad open-ended questions, questions that elicit additional details) to collect the desired exposure information (4.2.10.3)" and "At a minimum, collect information about limited high-risk exposures specific to the pathogen at the time of the initial report and re-interview cases with a detailed exposure questionnaire if a cluster becomes apparent (4.2.10.3)". For cluster detection and coordination, agencies are directed to "use daily, automated reporting and analysis systems to compare disease agent frequencies at multiple levels of specificity with historical frequencies and national trends (4.2.10.4)" and "Establish and use routine procedures for communicating among epidemiology, laboratory, and environmental health branches within an agency and among local, state, and federal agencies (4.2.10.5)".

 Effectiveness in Partial-Onset Seizures in Pediatric Patients 1 Month to < 4 Years of Age

The effectiveness of levetiracetam for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in pediatric patients was established in one multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Study 5), conducted at 62 sites in North America, South America, and Europe in pediatric patients 1 month to less than 4 years of age with partial seizures, uncontrolled by standard epileptic drugs (AEDs). Eligible patients on a stable dose of 1 to 2 AEDs, who experienced at least 2 partial-onset seizures during the 48-hour baseline video EEG were randomized to receive either levetiracetam or placebo. The enrolled population included 116 patients (levetiracetam N = 60, placebo N = 56) with refractory partial-onset seizures, whether or not secondarily generalized. Randomization was stratified by age range as follows: 1 month to less than 6 months of age (N = 4 treated with levetiracetam), 6 months to less than 1 year of age (N = 8 treated with levetiracetam), 1 year to less than 2 years of age (N = 20 treated with levetiracetam), and 2 years to less than 4 years of age (N = 28 treated with levetiracetam). The study consisted of a 5-day evaluation period which included a 1-day titration period followed by a 4-day maintenance period. Levetiracetam dosing was determined by age and weight as follows: children 1 month to less than 6 months old were randomized to a target dose of 40 mg/kg/day, and children 6 months to less than 4 years old were randomized to a target dose of 50 mg/kg/day. The primary measure of effectiveness was the responder rate (percent of patients with ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in average daily partial-onset seizure frequency) assessed by a blinded central reader using a 48-hour video EEG performed during the last two days of the 4-day maintenance period. A total of 109 patients were included in the efficacy analysis. A statistically significant difference between levetiracetam and placebo was observed (see Figure 5). The treatment effect associated with levetiracetam was consistent across age groups.

### Transcatheter aortic-valve replacement in low-risk patients at five years [^967c4dcb]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study PARTNER 3 (5-year follow-up) was published by Michael J Mack and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Aortic stenosis. In the PARTNER 3 (5-year follow-up) study, the trial question was: what is the role of TAVR in low-risk patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis? In the PARTNER 3 (5-year follow-up) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the PARTNER 3 (5-year follow-up) study, the population was: 950 patients (292 female, 658 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis at low surgical risk. The key exclusion criteria were native aortic annulus size unsuitable for sizes 20, 23, 26, 29 mm transcatheter heart valve; evidence of acute myocardial infarction ≤ 30 days before randomization; aortic valve unicuspid, bicuspid, or noncalcified; severe aortic regurgitation; complex coronary artery disease. In the PARTNER 3 (5-year follow-up) study, the interventions were: n = 496 TAVR (TAVR with a SAPIEN 3 valve) n = 454 surgery (SAVR with a commercially available bioprosthetic valve). In the PARTNER 3 (5-year follow-up) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in death, stroke, or rehospitalization related to the valve, procedure, or HF at 5 years (22.8% vs. 27.2%; HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.02). In the PARTNER 3 (5-year follow-up) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death, disabling stroke, nondisabling stroke, and rehospitalizations at 5 years (221% vs. 19%; WR 1.17, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.51) No significant difference in death from any cause at 5 years (10% vs. 8.2%; HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.9) No significant difference in stroke at 5 years (5.8% vs. 6.4%; HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.48). In the PARTNER 3 (5-year follow-up) study, the conclusion was: in patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis at low surgical risk, TAVR was not superior to surgery with respect to death, stroke, or rehospitalization related to the valve, procedure, or HF at 5 years.

### The 4.2 ka event is not remarkable in the context of holocene climate variability [^fd33aae3]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Much of the variety in proposed causes of the 4.2 ka event is likely attributable to varying definitions of the phenomenon, ranging in timescales from decades to millennia, occurring in different locations, and in differing aspects of the climate systems. These studies also characterize the climate changes occurring at 4.2 ka as climatologically coherent changes occurring on spatial scales ranging from large regionsto hemispheric, which is inconsistent with our results. Our finding that climate excursions ca. 4.2 ka are comparable to those throughout the Holocene suggests that the difficulty in identifying a mechanism driving the event is likely because the changes that occurred at the interval were driven by a mix of long and short-term forcings, feedbacks and internal variability, which has been typical for the Holocene, rather than a pronounced forcing comparable to the 8.2 ka event.

Finally, it is important to recognize that although we find no evidence to support a large-scale excursion in climate that is significant in the context of Holocene climate variability, we do find many sites and some regions that experienced significant excursions in climate around this time. These changes in climate may still have been highly impactful, even if the occurrence of these events is typical in the context of the Holocene.

### Enantioselective three-component aminomethylation of α-diazo ketones with alcohols and 1, 3, 5-triazines [^44b1413c]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Mechanistic studies

To gain some insights into the pathway of this transformation, two control experiments were conducted. First, the O–H insertion product 7 derived from 1j and 2b was allowed to react with 3a under the optimal conditions, and the Mannich-type product 5j was not detected (Fig. 7a). This result indicated that a stepwise O–H insertion/Mannich reaction pathway is unlikely involved in current transformation. On the other hand, the [4 + 1] cycloaddition product 8 derived from 2b and 3a, which has been observed as the major product when Rh(II) alone was used as the catalyst, failed to react with 1j under the optimal reaction conditions (Fig. 7b), thus extruding the involvement of 8 as the intermediate for this transformation.

a Control reaction to exclude the formation of product 5j from insertion product 7. b Control reaction to exclude the formation of product 5j from cycloaddition product 8. c, d Control reactions to verify the involvement of enol intermediate with diazo ketone 2e and 2e'.

In previously reported O–H insertion and rearrangement transformations between α -diazo ketones and alcohols, an enol intermediate has been proposed and characterized as the key intermediate. Recent related DFT studies also supported the involvement of an enol intermediate in these processes –. To verify whether an enol intermediate was also involved for the current transformation, parallel experiments starting from 2-diazo-1-tetralone (2e) or 1-diazo-2-tetralone (2e') were conducted. For both reactions, the same three-component product 9 whose tertiary carbon was located at the 2-position were obtained as the major product (Fig. 7c, d), indicating that an enol intermediate, rather than an oxonium ylide, might be involved for this transformation.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^ecd6a65a]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation strength interpretation — language cues and definitions: Strong and moderate recommendations are associated with "should" and "should not" statements, whereas a weak recommendation may be recognized by "may" or "need not". A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or, for a strong negative recommendation, the harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the supporting evidence quality is excellent; clinicians are advised to follow such guidance unless a clear and compelling rationale for acting in a contrary manner is present. A moderate recommendation means the committee believes benefits exceed harms (or harms exceed benefits for a negative recommendation) but the evidence on which the recommendation is based is not as strong, and clinicians are encouraged to follow such guidance while remaining alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. A weak recommendation means the existing evidence quality is suspect or well-designed, well-conducted studies have shown little clear advantage to one approach versus another, offering clinicians flexibility in decision-making, although boundaries on alternatives may be set.

### Once-weekly semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity [^3d584436]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study STEP 1 was published by John P H Wilding and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the STEP 1 study, the trial question was: what is the role of once weekly semaglutide as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention in adults with overweight or obesity? In the STEP 1 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the STEP 1 study, the population was: 1961 patients (1453 female, 508 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) who did not have diabetes. The key exclusion criteria were HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, self-reported change in body weight > 5 kg (11 lbs) within 90 days before screening, previous treatment with glucose-lowering agents or any antiobesity medications within the past 90 days before screening. In the STEP 1 study, the interventions were: n = 1306 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for the first 4 weeks and titrated every 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly by week 16, plus diet and physical activity counseling) n = 655 placebo (matching placebo once weekly plus diet and physical activity counseling). In the STEP 1 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in relative weight reduction at week 68 (14.9% vs. 2.4%; AD 12.4%, 95% CI 11.5 to 13.4). In the STEP 1 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% at week 68 (69.1% vs. 12%; OR 14.7, 95% CI 11.1 to 19.4) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a reduction in weight by ≥ 15% at week 68 (50.5% vs. 4.9%; OR 19.3, 95% CI 12.9 to 28.8) Significant increase in absolute weight reduction from baseline to week 68 (15.3 kg vs. 2.6 kg; AD 12.7 kg, 95% CI 11.7 to 13.7). In the STEP 1 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in overall adverse events. significant differences in serious adverse events (9.8% vs. 6.4%), gastrointestinal disorders (74.2% vs. 47.9%), treatment discontinuation due to gastrointestinal events (4.5% vs. 0.8%). In the STEP 1 study, the conclusion was: in patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) who did not have diabetes, semaglutide was superior to placebo with respect to relative weight reduction at week 68.

### Sitagliptin (Januvia) [^8198381b]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Pancreatitis

There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking JANUVIA. After initiation of JANUVIA, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, JANUVIA should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using JANUVIA.

5.2	Heart Failure

An association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Consider the risks and benefits of JANUVIA prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of JANUVIA.

5.3	Acute Renal Failure

There have been postmarketing reports of worsening renal function, including acute renal failure, sometimes requiring dialysis. A subset of these reports involved patients with renal impairment, some of whom were prescribed inappropriate doses of sitagliptin. A return to baseline levels of renal impairment has been observed with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents. Consideration can be given to cautiously reinitiating JANUVIA if another etiology is deemed likely to have precipitated the acute worsening of renal function.

Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiating JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. A dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment and in patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

### The 4.2 ka event is not remarkable in the context of holocene climate variability [^908c380c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Fig. 1
The timing and duration of the 4.2 ka event in our literature review.

Timing and duration of 47 records with clear climate excursions from our literature review (Table S1). a Age of the beginning (green) and end (tan) of the event, with overlap between the two histograms shown as dark brown, and (b) duration of the event. Median values shown as bold vertical lines.

Despite the variety of abrupt changes reported in our literature search, most of the articles (72/109 = 66%) did state whether the climate around 4.2 ka was either wetter or drier relative to before and after. We use these records and their interpretations to characterize the published proxy climate data for the 4.2 ka event (Fig. S 1a). In addition, we show the globally distributed evidence for wetter or drier conditions around 4.2 ka as compiled for an additional 106 sites by two review papers: one by Marchant and Hooghiemstrafocused on environmental shifts in tropical Africa and South America ca 4.0 ka without any discussion of the 4.2 ka event, and a second by Wang et al.that aimed to provide a global context for climatic changes as part of the 4.2 ka event. These two studies were later summarized by Renssento compare with model simulations of the 4.2 ka event. The approach used in these studies to document the abrupt climate changes around the 4.2 ka event is substantially different than the one featured in this study, as it focuses on longer-term (typically millennial-scale and longer) changes in the mean state, thereby affording a semi-independent counterpoint (Fig. S 1b). Altogether, the complexity and variability of the type, magnitude and duration of the event complicates the interpretation of the synthesized results from the literature. Nevertheless, as our meta-analysis has shown, the description of the 4.2 ka event in the literature is variable and complex, and these maps (Fig. S 1) reasonably characterize the spatial pattern of the event as interpreted by the authors in our literature review.

### Knee torsion predicts the preoperative J-sign grade in patients with recurrent patellar dislocation: a prospective study [^43259fbd]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

The aim of this study was to determine the values for knee torsion in healthy knees, and explore predictive thresholds of torsion in grades of the J-sign in patients with recurrent dislocation of the patella.

Methods

A five-year prospective study was conducted involving healthy volunteers and patients with recurrent dislocation of the patella. The knees of the patients were categorized into four groups (J-sign -, J-sign 1+, J-sign 2+, and J-sign 3+) based on visual examination of the patellar maltracking. The torsion of the knee and other bony abnormalities were obtained from routine hip-knee-ankle CT scans. The ranges of the thresholds were determined from the 95% CI of the mean for each group. The predictive thresholds for each grade of J-sign were identified from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and predictive probability curves.

Results

The study included 44 knees (in 22 healthy volunteers) and 255 knees in 234 patients with recurrent dislocation of the patella. In the J-sign -/1+, J-sign 2+, and J-sign 3+ groups, there were 87 (29.1%), 85 (28.4%), and 83 (27.8%) knees, respectively. Age, sex, and laterality were comparable among the groups. There were significant differences in the mean torsion between the groups: healthy knees 1.4° (-8.8° to 5.4°); J-sign 1+ 6.9° (SD 4.3°); J-sign 2+ 9.2° (SD 4.8°) and J-sign 3+ knees 13.9° (SD 5.4°) (p < 0.001). The ranges of the thresholds for the four groups based on the 95% CI of the means were: < 5.5°, 7.2° to 8.1°, and 10.2° to 12.8°, respectively. Ordered regression revealed a 25.4% increased probability of advancing to a higher J-sign grade for every 1° increase in torsion (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.254 (95% CI 1.182 to 1.331); p < 0.001). It was shown in the ROC curves that the presence of torsion effectively differentiated between normal and positive J-sign knees (area under curve (AUC) 0.92; sensitivity 0.76; specificity 1; cut-off 5.5°). Analysis of the ROC and predictive probability curves identified threshold values for the three abnormal J-signs at 7° and 12°, showing an excellent discriminatory performance (p all post-hoc < 0.01).

Conclusion

A threshold of 5° to 6° of torsion in the knee is associated with patellar maltracking in extension. In patients with recurrent dislocation of the patella, there is a one-grade increase in J-sign for approximately every 4° increase in torsion. The 7° and 12° of torsion represent the thresholds for the preoperative J-sign -/1+, J-sign 2+, and J sign 3+, respectively. Routine bilateral lower limb CT scans are therefore required if surgery is to be considered in the knees of patients with recurrent dislocation of the patella who have a positive J-sign.

The inclusion criteria were couples in which a woman had bacterial vaginosis and was in a monogamous relationship with a male partner. The key exclusion criteria were current sex worker; concurrent sexual partners; HIV-positive. In the StepUp study, the interventions were: n = 80 male partner treatment (receipt of first-line recommended antimicrobial agents for woman and receipt of oral metronidazole 400 mg BID and 2% clindamycin cream applied to penile skin BID for 7 days for male partner) n = 79 usual care (receipt of first-line antimicrobial agents for woman and no treatment for male partner). In the StepUp study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the rate of recurrence of bacterial vaginosis in women within 12 weeks (35% vs. 63%; HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.61). In the StepUp study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in the rate of bacterial vaginosis recurrence, 3–4 Amsel criteria and Nugent score 4–10 within 4 weeks (17.4% vs. 45.6%; HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.59) Significant decrease in the rate of bacterial vaginosis recurrence, Nugent score 7–10 within 12 weeks (37.7% vs. 57.4%; HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.76) Significant decrease in missing data imputed as cure (30% vs. 56%; HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.64). In the StepUp study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse effects in women. In the StepUp study, the conclusion was: in couples in which a woman had bacterial vaginosis and was in a monogamous relationship with a male partner, male partner treatment was superior to usual care with respect to the rate of recurrence of bacterial vaginosis in women within 12 weeks.

### AGA clinical practice update on endoscopic therapies for non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding: expert review [^15e6dcf0]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Contact thermal therapy — application parameters for NVUGIB — specify that, when possible, a 10F probe should be used, with heater probe generator settings of 25–30 J per pulse for 4–5 pulses for a total of 100–150 J, and 15–20 W recommended for bipolar/multipolar probes. Forceful contact should be applied for an extended period of at least 8 seconds with the scope tip close to the treatment site to ensure complete obliteration of the culprit vessel, because failure to obliterate the culprit vessel may cause bleeding during treatment or increase the risk for rebleeding.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving nasal form and function after rhinoplasty [^a8359ce3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Guideline statement categories — definitions and implications specify how to act on recommendations: A strong recommendation means that the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms and that the quality of the supporting evidence is excellent; clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. A recommendation means that the benefits exceed the harms but that the quality of evidence is not as strong; clinicians should also generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. An option means either that the quality of evidence that exists is suspect or that well-done studies show little clear advantage to one approach versus another; clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, may set bounds on alternatives, and patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

### Linvoseltamab-gcpt (Lynozyfic) [^89a28fa7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS)

LYNOZYFIC can cause cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which can be serious or life-threatening.

In LINKER-MM1, CRS occurred in 46% (54/117) of patients who received LYNOZYFIC at the recommended dose, with Grade 1 CRS occurring in 35% (41/117) of patients, Grade 2 in 10% (12/117), and Grade 3 in 0.9% (1/117) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Thirty-eight percent (45/117) of patients had CRS following step-up dose 1, including 1 patient who experienced Grade 3 CRS; 8% (9/117) had an initial CRS event following a subsequent dose. Seventeen percent (19/113) of patients developed CRS after step-up dose 2, 10% (11/111) developed CRS after the first full 200 mg dose of LYNOZYFIC, and 3.6% (4/110) developed CRS after the second full dose. Recurrent CRS occurred in 20% (23/117) of patients. The median time to onset of CRS from the end of infusion was 11 (range: -1 to 184) hours after the most recent dose with a median duration of 15 (range: 1 to 76) hours.

Clinical signs and symptoms of CRS included, but were not limited to pyrexia, chills, hypoxia, tachycardia, and hypotension.

Administer pretreatment medications and initiate therapy according to LYNOZYFIC step-up dosing to reduce the incidence and severity of CRS [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of CRS after infusion. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur.

At the first sign of CRS, immediately evaluate patients for hospitalization, manage per current practice guidelines, and administer supportive care; withhold LYNOZYFIC until CRS resolves and modify the next dose or permanently discontinue LYNOZYFIC based on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

### Immunoglobulin light chain repertoire in chronic lymphocytic leukemia [^e62ead10]. Blood (2005). Low credibility.

Immunoglobulin kappa (IGK) and immunoglobulin lambda (IGL) light chain repertoire was analyzed in 276 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cases and compared with the relevant repertoires from normal, autoreactive, and neoplastic cells. Twenty-one functional IGKV genes were used in IGKV-J rearrangements of 179 kappa-CLL cases; the most frequent genes were IGKV3-20(A27), IGKV1-39/1D-39(O2/O12), IGKV1-5(L12), IGKV4-1(B3), and IGKV2-30(A17); 90 (50.3%) of 179 IGK sequences were mutated (similarity < 98%). Twenty functional IGLV genes were used in IGLV-J rearrangements of 97 lambda-CLL cases; the most frequent genes were IGLV3-21(VL2-14), IGLV2-8(VL1-2), and IGLV2-14(VL1-4); 44 of 97 IGL sequences (45.4%) were mutated. Subsets with "CLL-biased" homologous complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) were identified: (1) IGKV2-30-IGKJ2, 7 sequences with homologous kappa CDR3 (KCDR3), 5 of 7 associated with homologous IGHV4-34 heavy chains; (2) IGKV1-39/1D-39-IGKJ1/4, 4 unmutated sequences with homologous KCDR3, 2 of 4 associated with homologous IGHV4-39 heavy chains; (3) IGKV1-5-IGKJ1/3, 4 sequences with homologous KCDR3, 2 of 4 associated with unmutated nonhomologous IGHV4-39 heavy chains; (4) IGLV1-44-IGLJ2/3, 2 sequences with homologous lambda CDR3 (LCDR3), associated with homologous IGHV4-b heavy chains; and (5) IGLV3-21-IGLJ2/3, 9 sequences with homologous LCDR3, 3 of 9 associated with homologous IGHV3-21 heavy chains. The existence of subsets that comprise given IGKV-J/IGLV-J domains associated with IGHV-D-J domains that display homologous CDR3 provides further evidence for the role of antigen in CLL pathogenesis.

### Kibble-zurek exponent and chiral transition of the period-4 phase of rydberg chains [^4a2fb20a]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Now let us turn to the nature of the transition, assuming that there is a portion of boundary without floating phase. The physical reason behind λ < 1 is the difference in energy cost of domains shifted by one or two sites with respect to the bulk (see Fig. 4). In the very simple classical approximation δ E B, D ≃ V 3 while δ E C ≃ Δ. At the Ashkin–Teller critical point, these expressions lead to δ E B, D ≃ 1.2839 and δ E C ≃ 1.593 for the blockade model. Taking into account longer-range interactions, the energy of domain walls for the Rydberg model can be estimated as δ E B, D ≃ V 3 − 2 V 4 + V 5 and δ E C ≃ Δ − 3 V 4 + 2 V 7. Assuming V 3 = V ≃ 1.2839 and a 1/ R 6 decay, we get δ E B, D ≃ 0.885 and δ E C ≃ 0.925. The asymmetry is still present, but it is smaller, implying that the point where the chiral perturbation vanishes gets closer to the four-state Potts point. Therefore, there are two possibilities: (i) λ is still smaller than λ c = 0.9779. Then the chiral perturbation remains relevant, and the transition immediately becomes chiral until a floating phase emerges; (ii) the long-range interactions bring the Ashkin–Teller point close enough to the four-state Potts point so that the chiral perturbation is irrelevant; then there will be an extended region of direct Ashkin–Teller transition, followed on both sides by a chiral transition, and ultimately by a floating phase. Since λ c ≃ 0.9779 is very close to 1, the first possibility (i) is more likely. More importantly, the fact that the asymmetry can be expected to be reduced by long-range interactions and not increased implies that, if anything, the Rydberg model is further away from the clock limit λ = 0 where there would be an intermediate floating phase all along the boundary. So our conclusion that there is a portion of the boundary to the period-4 phase where the transition is direct and continuous in the chiral universality class before a floating phase opens can be considered as a prediction for the Rydberg model with 1/ R 6 interactions.

### Incobotulinumtoxina (Xeomin) [^1c01d691]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2.4		Recommended Dose for Cervical Dystonia

The recommended initial dose of XEOMIN for cervical dystonia is 120 Units. In a placebo-controlled trial utilizing initial XEOMIN doses of 120 Units and 240 Units, no meaningful difference in effectiveness was demonstrated between the doses [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. In previously treated patients, their past dose, response to treatment, duration of effect, and adverse event history should be taken into consideration when determining the XEOMIN dose.

In the treatment of cervical dystonia, XEOMIN is usually injected into the sternocleidomastoid, levator scapulae, splenius capitis, scalenus, and/or the trapezius muscle(s) (see Figure 5). This list is not exhaustive, as any of the muscles responsible for controlling head position may require treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. The dose and number of injection sites in each treated muscle should be individualized based on the number and location of the muscle(s) to be treated, the degree of spasticity/dystonia, muscle mass, body weight, and response to any previous botulinum toxin injections.

The frequency of XEOMIN repeat treatments should be determined by clinical response, but should generally be no more frequent than every 12 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].

Figure 5: Muscles Involved in Cervical Dsytonia

2.5		Recommended Dose for Blepharospasm

In treatment-naïve patients, the recommended initial dose of XEOMIN is 50 Units (25 Units per eye). In patients previously treated with a botulinum toxin A, consider their past dose, response to treatment, duration of effect, and adverse event history when determining the XEOMIN dose.

Do not exceed a total XEOMIN dose of 100 Units per treatment session (50 Units per eye).

Inject XEOMIN into the lateral and medial orbicularis oculi muscle of the upper lid; lateral canthus and the lateral orbicularis oculi muscle of the lower lid; and the corrugator muscle, if necessary (see Figure 6). The number and location of injections may be changed in response to adverse reactions or based on the patient's response to treatment, but do not exceed a total dose of 50 Units per eye.

Determine the frequency of XEOMIN repeat treatments by clinical response but administer repeat treatments no more frequent than every 12 weeks [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^e928504b]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Track 2 (alternative) for adults and adolescents using SABA reliever outlines treatment Steps 1–4 with specified controller options and a referral step, with caution about adherence. Step 1 states "Take ICS whenever SABA taken", Step 2 is "Low dose maintenance ICS", Step 3 is "Low dose maintenance ICS-LABA", Step 4 is "Medium/high dose maintenance ICS-LABA", and Step 5 is "Refer for expert assessment, phenotyping, and add-on treatment for severe asthma"; the reliever is "as-needed ICS-SABA*, or as-needed SABA". It notes that "This is an alternative approach if Track 1 is not possible, or if a patient's asthma is stable with good adherence and no exacerbations on their current therapy", and advises "before prescribing a regimen with SABA reliever, consider whether the patient is likely to be adherent with their maintenance therapy; if not, they will be at higher risk of exacerbations". Abbreviations are defined on-page as "ICS: inhaled corticosteroid; LABA: long-acting beta agonist; SABA: short-acting beta2 agonist".

### Inebilizumab for treatment of IgG4-related disease [^81e8384c]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study MITIGATE was published by John H Stone and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: IgG4-related diseases and IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis. In the MITIGATE study, the trial question was: what is the role of inebilizumab, an anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody, in patients with IgG4-related disease? In the MITIGATE study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the MITIGATE study, the population was: 135 patients (47 female, 88 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with active IgG4-related disease. The key exclusion criteria were history of solid organ or cell-based transplantation or known immunodeficiency disorder; active malignancy; receipt of any biologic B-cell-depleting therapy or non-depleting B-cell-directed therapy in the past 6 months; eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m². In the MITIGATE study, the interventions were: n = 68 inebilizumab (intravenous infusion of 300 mg on days 1 and 15 and week 26 for a 52-week treatment period) n = 67 placebo (matching placebo on days 1 and 15 and week 26 for a 52-week treatment period). In the MITIGATE study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in disease flares (10% vs. 60%; HR 0.13, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.28). In the MITIGATE study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in annualized flare rate (0.1 vs. 0.71; RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.31) Significant increase in flare-free, treatment-free complete remission at week 52 (57.4% vs. 22.4%; OR 4.68, 95% CI 2.21 to 9.91) Significant increase in flare-free, corticosteroid-free complete remission at week 52 (58.8% vs. 22.4%; OR 4.96, 96% CI 2.34 to 10.52). In the MITIGATE study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in at least one adverse event. In the MITIGATE study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with active IgG4-related disease, inebilizumab was superior to placebo with respect to disease flares.

### Stinging insect hypersensitivity: a practice parameter update 2016 [^ae6cde0a]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Recommendation statement types and clinician implications — strong recommendation (StrRec) means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms and may use lesser evidence in specific circumstances; clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Recommendation (Rec) means benefits exceed harms with not-as-strong evidence and may use lesser evidence in specific circumstances; clinicians should generally follow a recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. Option (Opt) means the quality of evidence is suspect or well-done studies show little clear advantage; clinicians should be flexible in their decision making regarding appropriate practice, although they may set bounds on alternatives, and patient preference should have a substantial influencing role. No recommendation (NoRec) means a lack of pertinent evidence and unclear benefit–harm balance; clinicians should feel little constraint in their decision making and be alert to new published evidence, and patient preference should have a substantial influencing role.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^4ad523f0]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy Report provides clinicians with an annually updated evidence-based strategy for asthma management and prevention, which can be adapted for local circumstances (e.g., medication availability). This article summarizes key recommendations from GINA 2021, and the evidence underpinning recent changes. GINA recommends that asthma in adults and adolescents should not be treated solely with short-acting β 2 -agonist (SABA), because of the risks of SABA-only treatment and SABA overuse, and evidence for benefit of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Large trials show that as-needed combination ICS-formoterol reduces severe exacerbations by ≥ 60% in mild asthma compared with SABA alone, with similar exacerbation, symptom, lung function, and inflammatory outcomes as daily ICS plus as-needed SABA. Key changes in GINA 2021 include division of the treatment figure for adults and adolescents into two tracks. Track 1 (preferred) has low-dose ICS-formoterol as the reliever at all steps: as needed only in Steps 1–2 (mild asthma), and with daily maintenance ICS-formoterol (maintenance-and-reliever therapy, "MART") in Steps 3–5. Track 2 (alternative) has as-needed SABA across all steps, plus regular ICS (Step 2) or ICS-long-acting β 2 -agonist (Steps 3–5). For adults with moderate-to-severe asthma, GINA makes additional recommendations in Step 5 for add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists and azithromycin, with add-on biologic therapies for severe asthma. For children 6–11 years, new treatment options are added at Steps 3–4. Across all age groups and levels of severity, regular personalized assessment, treatment of modifiable risk factors, self-management education, skills training, appropriate medication adjustment, and review remain essential to optimize asthma outcomes.
