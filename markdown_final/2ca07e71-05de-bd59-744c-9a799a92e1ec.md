## Question

The Continental Reformation started in what year?

Answer Choices:
A. 1545
B. 1517
C. 1492
D. 1705

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which year the Continental Reformation began, with options 1545, 1517, 1492, and 1705. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "Continental Reformation" refers to historically. Then, I should verify the canonical starting point of the Protestant Reformation in continental Europe. Next, I will check whether any of the alternative years map to key Reformation milestones. Finally, I will confirm the best-supported answer and briefly justify why the other options are incorrect.

> Let me first confirm the terminology. "Continental Reformation" in this context denotes the Protestant Reformation on the European continent, as distinct from the English Reformation, and it is most closely associated with Martin Luther's initiation of the movement in the Holy Roman Empire [^notfound].

> I need to verify the canonical starting date. The traditional marker for the beginning of the Reformation is 1517, when Luther is said to have nailed his Ninety-Five Theses to the church door in Wittenberg, sparking widespread theological and political debate across continental Europe; this is the standard date taught and referenced in historical accounts of the Reformation's origins [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the alternatives before concluding. 1545 corresponds to the opening of the Council of Trent, which was the Catholic Church's response to the Reformation rather than its start; 1492 is the year of Columbus's voyage and predates the Reformation by a quarter-century; 1705 is far too late and falls in the Enlightenment era, well after the Reformation's foundational period, so none of these can plausibly mark the beginning of the Continental Reformation [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should double-check that I'm not conflating regional specifics. Some might argue for earlier reformist currents, but the widely accepted catalyst and conventional starting point for the Continental Reformation remains Luther's 1517 act, which set off the chain of events that defined the movement across mainland Europe [^notfound].

> Conclusion: The Continental Reformation began in 1517, so the correct choice is B.

---

The Continental Reformation began in **1517** with Martin Luther's publication of the Ninety-Five Theses, marking the start of the Protestant Reformation in continental Europe [^notfound]. This event challenged the Catholic Church's practices and sparked widespread religious, political, and social change across Europe. The other options are incorrect: 1545 marks the start of the Council of Trent (the Catholic Counter-Reformation), 1492 is the year of Columbus's voyage, and 1705 is unrelated to the Reformation.

## Historical context and background

By the early 16th century, the Catholic Church faced significant criticism for corruption, including the sale of indulgences, pluralism, and absenteeism. These issues eroded public trust and created a climate ripe for reform. Martin Luther, a German monk and theologian, became a central figure in the Reformation movement [^notfound].

---

## Martin Luther and the Ninety-Five Theses

On **October 31, 1517**, Martin Luther nailed his Ninety-Five Theses to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany [^notfound]. This act is traditionally regarded as the beginning of the Continental Reformation. The theses condemned the sale of indulgences and questioned the authority of the Pope, sparking widespread debate and controversy.

---

## Spread of the Reformation

Luther's ideas quickly spread throughout Germany and beyond, aided by the printing press, which allowed for rapid dissemination of pamphlets and writings. Key figures such as John Calvin and Ulrich Zwingli further developed and expanded Reformation theology, leading to the establishment of various Protestant denominations [^notfound].

---

## Political and social implications

The Reformation had profound political and social consequences. It led to the fragmentation of Christianity in Western Europe, with many regions adopting Protestantism. It also contributed to the rise of nation-states and the decline of papal authority in political affairs [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The Continental Reformation began in **1517** with Martin Luther's publication of the Ninety-Five Theses [^notfound]. This event initiated a period of significant religious, political, and social change across Europe, ultimately leading to the establishment of Protestantism as a major branch of Christianity.

### The Brazilian health system: history, advances, and challenges [^8368fa36]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Brazil is a country of continental dimensions with widespread regional and social inequalities. In this report, we examine the historical development and components of the Brazilian health system, focusing on the reform process during the past 40 years, including the creation of the Unified Health System. A defining characteristic of the contemporary health sector reform in Brazil is that it was driven by civil society rather than by governments, political parties, or international organisations. The advent of the Unified Health System increased access to health care for a substantial proportion of the Brazilian population, at a time when the system was becoming increasingly privatised. Much is still to be done if universal health care is to be achieved. Over the past 20 years, there have been other advances, including investments in human resources, science and technology, and primary care, and a substantial decentralisation process, widespread social participation, and growing public awareness of a right to health care. If the Brazilian health system is to overcome the challenges with which it is presently faced, strengthened political support is needed so that financing can be restructured and the roles of both the public and private sector can be redefined.

### Continental drift? Do European clinical genetic testing laboratories have a patent problem? [^29e410d3]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

These results, however, must be put in context. For example: 76% of laboratories have not been contacted regarding patent infringement; the confidence intervals on some differences between the 2008 results and this survey are quite wide; and only 5% of laboratories have negotiated stand-alone patent licenses. In addition, 31% do not know if they have IP support, only 7% have changed research interests owing to a patent, and 29% do not know if they conduct tests on patented genes or methods. These results indicate that for a significant proportion of laboratories, patent issues are not a primary concern. Furthermore, if one were to separate NIPT from the analysis (for example, on the grounds it is a platform technology and therefore warrants a different approach in patent law), the impact of patents on laboratories is even smaller.

The negative impacts for laboratories outlined above are not in and of themselves negative for patients and the healthcare system. For instance, the mere fact that a patent leads a laboratory to discontinue a test is a negative impact on that lab, but it is not necessarily negative for a healthcare system or patients. The impact on patients depends on several factors, for example: is there a satisfactory alternative medical pathway; can the patients obtain the test from a different laboratory; can funds be raised for a reasonable patent license; has the patent boosted follow-on innovation such that there is net social benefit?

Considered in the round, our view is that the results from this study do not justify European patent law reform at present. The 2017 expert review of the 98/44 EU Biotech Directive reached a similar conclusion with respect to isolated DNA sequence patents. In our view, there is not enough evidence of a problem, particularly given the relatively low number of genetic tests affected. The US experience also shows that law reform in this area is challenging, and, especially a decision like Mayo, is likely to lead to undesirable uncertainty for those involved in translational research on new molecular tests.

### Constitutional developments in latin American abortion law [^2ecd9ba9]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2016). Low credibility.

For most of the 20th Century, restrictive abortion laws were in place in continental Latin America. In recent years, reforms have caused a liberalizing shift, supported by constitutional decisions of the countries' high courts. The present article offers an overview of the turn toward more liberal rules and the resolution of abortion disputes by reference to national constitutions. For such purpose, the main legal changes of abortion laws in the last decade are first surveyed. Landmark decisions of the high courts of Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, and Mexico are then analyzed. It is shown that courts have accepted the need to balance interests and competing rights to ground less restrictive laws. In doing so, they have articulated limits to protection of fetal interests, and basic ideas of women's dignity, autonomy, and equality. The process of constitutionalization has only just begun. Constitutional judgments are not the last word, but they are important contributions in reinforcing the legality of abortion.

### Cocreated regional research agenda for evidence-informed policy and advocacy to improve adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights in sub-saharan Africa [^66e14563]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Summary box

One of the obstacles to domesticating and operationalising continental commitments that promote adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is the lack of stakeholder-driven research or inputs in setting the research agenda.
This commentary describes a cocreation initiative that engaged strategic stakeholders to identify key policy goals and research priorities necessary to advance continental and subregional advocacy around adolescent SRHR in SSA.
The development of the cocreated regional research agenda encompassed three phases: (1) a landscape analysis involving the mapping of existing research and research priorities on adolescent SRHR in SSA; (2) a 2-day cocreation workshop with regional and subregional SRHR policy, advocacy and research actors; and (3) a validation exercise where stakeholders reviewed and confirmed the research priorities.
The emerging adolescent SRHR policy goals centered on policy and law reforms to end child marriage, implement sexuality education in and out of schools, and universal access to comprehensive and integrated sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services for adolescents.
The main research priorities focused on understanding the needs and service access of vulnerable adolescent populations; implementation research on the delivery of comprehensive sexuality education and adolescent-friendly SRH services; understanding the impact of child marriage on health and well-being; and the analysis of legal and policy provisions addressing the age of consent to SRH services for adolescents.
Various stakeholders, including funders and researchers, will find this research agenda useful in improving adolescent SRHR in SSA.

### Reducing total health burden from 2001 to 2009: an employer counter-trend success story and its implications for health care reform [^98d57a1a]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine total health burden for an employer whose health-related focus is direct and indirect costs. To explore implications for the Final Rule for Accountable Care Organizations recently issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, whose focus includes direct but not indirect costs.

Methods

Used 42 claims and survey-based measures to track this employer's continental US workforce burden in the aggregate and by healthy and selected disease designations from 2001–2002 to 2008–2009.

Results

Starting from equivalent baselines, this employer's aggregate total direct costs decreased 16% (8.5% adjusted) whereas comparable US per capita expenditures rose 22.1%. Even larger decreases were recorded in total indirect costs. The healthy and disease designations replicated this pattern. Minimal employee cost shifting occurred.

Conclusions

Attention to direct and indirect costs helped put this employer's health care investment on a markedly more sustainable path than comparable national cost trends. Fully tapping the applicable lessons this and other purchasers have learned will be facilitated by amending the Final Rule to include measures of indirect costs.

### Health reform in central and Eastern Europe and the former soviet union [^d49f9eec]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

In the two decades since the fall of the Berlin Wall, former communist countries in Europe have pursued wide-ranging changes to their health systems. We describe three key aspects of these changes-an almost universal switch to health insurance systems, a growing reliance on out-of-pocket payments (both formal and informal), and efforts to strengthen primary health care, often with a model of family medicine delivered by general practitioners. Many decisions about health policy, such as the introduction of health insurance systems or general practice, took into account political issues more than they did evidence. Evidence for whether health reforms have achieved their intended results is sparse. Of crucial importance is that lessons are learnt from experiences of countries to enable development of health systems that meet present and future health needs of populations.

### Towards universal health coverage: lessons from 10 years of healthcare reform in China [^7cd65a1a]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Stage 2: 30 years after the 'reform and opening up' policy (1979–2009)

Beginning in 1978, China began its 'reform and opening-up' policy, ushering in a socialist market economy that encouraged a free market and focused on economic growth. This led to a fundamental transformation of the Chinese healthcare system and had a profound impact. With privatisation and marketisation, the changes in the healthcare system included: a shift from public financing to private sources; a reorganisation of public hospitals and clinics into commercial enterprises; decentralising healthcare governance to local governments; and a pricing policy that enabled facilities to gain profits. These changes helped expand healthcare resources and improve medical technology and equipment, but also posed many problems (eg, reduced government expenditure on healthcare, less emphasis on rural areas and public health, and overutilisation of unnecessary or expensive care), resulting in a series of adverse effects, such as increased disparities between rural and urban residents, a decline in public health, rising healthcare costs and sharp decreases in insurance coverage. In 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic revealed weaknesses in China's health system and focused a domestic and international spotlight on those weaknesses. This wake-up call opened a window of opportunity for a new round of healthcare reform.

### Progressive unanchoring of antarctic ice shelves since 1973 [^eaf40c23]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Bleak future for some ice shelves

Our results have shown a marked, widespread and accelerating unanchoring of ice shelves from pinning points in the western Antarctic Peninsula and in the Amundsen Sea Sector over the past five decades (Fig. 3). Meanwhile, there has also been steady unanchoring of ice shelves from pinning points in the Wilkes Lands region of East Antarctica. The loss of many of these pinning points is likely to be permanent, owing to their hysteretic evolution, meaning that an ice-shelf thickening of a greater magnitude is required for pinning points to reform at comparable size. On multi-decadal timescales, this pinning-point loss may represent the first steps of irreversible ice-shelf loss and subsequent mass loss of the previously impounded ice sheet.

Our insight into the spatial pattern of ice-shelf thickness change in the 1970s and 1980s (Fig. 2) shows that ice-shelf thinning was already well underway in the Amundsen Sea Sector and Wilkes Land. After 1989, thinning has spread progressively across much of West Antarctica and the western Antarctic Peninsula, with previously unchanged pinning points reducing in extent through the 1990s to the present. We know that ice-shelf thinning is driven predominantly by warm modified Circumpolar Deep Water (MCDW) flooding the continental shelf and melting the bases of ice shelves. However, the primary mechanism driving this progressive flooding of the continental shelf by warm MCDW over the past five decades remains unclear. There is some evidence that an anthropogenic-driven trend in winds over the continental-shelf edge in the Amundsen Sea may be driving an increase in MCDW transport onto the continental shelf since the 1920s. In East Antarctica, the poleward shift of MCDW since the 1930s in response to the poleward shift of westerly windsmay also be driving the thinning of ice shelves. Meanwhile, decadal-scale feedbacks emanating from the input of freshwater from ice-shelf melt onto the continental shelf may enhance the delivery of warm water beneath ice shelves on local scales, and the degree to which this may upscale to affect larger geographic scales continues to be investigated.

### Impact assessment of the WHO FCTC over its first decade: methodology of the expert group [^c166b27d]. Tobacco Control (2019). Medium credibility.

Criterion 1: Temporal precedence — Did the FCTC precede action in the country in a particular policy domain?

To determine the temporality of the FCTC as the putative cause for action in each policy domain, timing of policy implementations was considered in relation to three key dates in the FCTC implementation timeline: FCTC adoption in May 2003, FCTC entry into force in February 2005 and the date each country of interest ratified the Treaty. In order to account for different policy timelines, questions on the temporality of the FCTC were asked in each policy domain. Policy milestones that were considered as indicators of governmental action included: consideration of legislation and formal actions (eg, draft bill, internal report calling for policy action, first reading of and/or passage of draft legislation, establishment of regulations under the authority of an existing act, implementation of law/regulations).

Criterion 2: Covariation between cause and effect — Is there covariation between the FCTC and action in the country in a particular policy domain?

Covariation between cause and effect was considered across the 12 countries.

### Early appraisal of China's huge and complex health-care reforms [^70ecf0dc]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

China's 3 year, CN¥850 billion (US$125 billion) reform plan, launched in 2009, marked the first phase towards achieving comprehensive universal health coverage by 2020. The government's undertaking of systemic reform and its affirmation of its role in financing health care together with priorities for prevention, primary care, and redistribution of finance and human resources to poor regions are positive developments. Accomplishing nearly universal insurance coverage in such a short time is commendable. However, transformation of money and insurance coverage into cost-effective services is difficult when delivery of health care is hindered by waste, inefficiencies, poor quality of services, and scarcity and maldistribution of the qualified workforce. China must reform its incentive structures for providers, improve governance of public hospitals, and institute a stronger regulatory system, but these changes have been slowed by opposition from stakeholders and lack of implementation capacity. The pace of reform should be moderated to allow service providers to develop absorptive capacity. Independent, outcome-based monitoring and evaluation by a third-party are essential for mid-course correction of the plans and to make officials and providers accountable.

### Ending this pandemic and securing the future [^ebc2642a]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

In December it will be two years since the first cases of covid-19 were identified in Wuhan, China, and one year since the first clinical trial results showed that the world had developed an effective vaccine. In May 2021, The Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response put forward a package of vital reforms required to end the current pandemic and better secure the future. Six months later, is the world is better placed to respond to future pandemics or indeed to end this current one?

The short answer is no. There are reasons for optimism in some areas, but the urgency and pace of change does not meet the needs of the moment — to respond quickly and effectively to a disease that has killed more than five million people worlwide. The world is still dangerously unprepared for the next pandemic threat. This collection of nine papers draws on the analytical work that contributed to the panel's recommendations. Together, this collection shows how, why, and where the world and individual countries succeeded or failed against covid-19 and points to solutions that can end the covid-19 pandemic and make it the last pandemic of such devastation.

Key opportunities for progress have been squandered. The recent G20 meeting in Italy failed to deliver. Rather than urgently redistributing vaccine doses and delivering financing for pandemic preparedness, the outcome was yet another task force.

Our panel report in May called for one billion vaccine doses to be redistributed from high income to low income countries by 1 September. High income countries have failed to meet that target. While wealthy countries roll out booster programmes, low and middle income countries' ability to purchase vaccines is being squeezed: at the time of writing, fewer than 5% of people in low income countries had received a single dose. Prime Minister Mia Mottley of Barbados has asked the right question of her fellow heads of government: "How many more deaths must it take before the. excess vaccines in the possession of the advanced countries of the world will be shared with those who [have] simply no access to vaccines?"

### Resetting international systems for pandemic preparedness and response [^94212094]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Next steps

The experience of the covid-19 pandemic must not be repeated, but the window of opportunity for securing the necessary change is short. The experience of previous epidemics shows that the appetite for change fades quickly once the emergency has passed. Commitment to the required reforms needs to be secured in the course of the coming months. The World Health Assembly Special Session in late November 2021 should serve as an opportunity not only to commence negotiations on a framework convention but, in the panel's view, as an opportunity to make crucial decisions regarding WHO's independence, financing, and authority. A political declaration by the UN General Assembly is a potential instrument to set out in a timely fashion international agreement at the highest level on strengthened pandemic preparedness and response, across multiple arenas and processes. Agreement of such a declaration could serve as an immediate focus for defining the steps forward and beginning the necessary processes and negotiations between member states.

Key messages

The Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response has recommended action after failings in the international response to the covid-19 pandemic
The panel considers pandemic preparedness and response to be a global public good
Pandemic threat should be elevated to the highest leadership level and pandemic preparedness and response treated as the responsibility of the whole of government and society
Stronger leadership and better coordination are needed at national, regional, and international levels, including a more focused and independent WHO, a pandemic treaty, and a new global health threats council
Agreement on a package of reforms is needed to ensure that the world can prevent the next outbreak of a new pathogen becoming another pandemic

### The pandemic treaty, the pandemic fund, and the global commons: our scepticism [^097abb1a]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

While these efforts are promising, they are not without their challenges. The ultimate viability of local manufacturing in Africa speaks to a broader set of considerations that needs to be addressed. These include incentives that would derisk investment and guarantee predictability in demands. Although, there are continental efforts to harmonise markets in Africa to facilitate economies of scale such as the implementation of a common regulatory framework, a platform for pool procurement and the Africa Free Trade Area Agreement. Additionally, there is a rising debt burden amidst newer loans and austerity measures instituted by international financial institutions, which has led to a reversal in social sector spending, including those on health commodities in many low-income and middle-income countries according to a report by Oxfam. This debt burden has been further aggravated by the pandemic, rising interest rates and war and instability in some parts of Europe.

While development loans may have spillover effects on population health, the ensuing debt servicing requirements may have detrimental effect on health through constraining fiscal space for government health expenditures. As such, countries' high ratio of debt servicing to health expenditure in Africa could potentially hinder domestic health emergency preparedness reforms, such as efforts to strengthen regional supply chains and access to medicines during emergencies. The temporary halt of COVID-19 vaccine production at Aspen in South Africa due to insufficient domestic demand, for example, highlights this dilemma. The unpredictability of demands could be a major setback for the AU–Africa CDC plan to scale local vaccine manufacturing capacity from 1% to 60% by 2040.

While COVID-19 has shown that going forward, there is a need for greater self-reliance. However, there is still a need for Africa to be embedded within the multilateral pandemic preparedness mechanisms while ensuring that its voice and needs are included in pandemic preparedness funding mechanisms such as the Pandemic Fund.

### US divestment in global health: disruption, uncertainty and response [^b7816108]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

The way forward

In the short term, safeguarding those efforts that grant immediate relief to those who are in need after the unravelling of USAID is of the utmost priority. For example, while it is unlikely that all of the US bilateral health aid can be substituted, our analysis can help countries adjust their short-term funding and anticipate the extent of required funding. Of course, this entails critically reviewing and evaluating whether the funds received by US programmes are used efficiently and effectively — whether resources directly address specific population health needs, or whether the required amounts may be less (if efficiencies can be achieved) or more (if more vulnerable populations can or should be targeted). This may offer opportunities for critical review and re-evaluation of health financing systems by affected countries, while acknowledging that many health systems were severely underfunded even before US divestment. Beyond health services, health research will also require attention. As modelling studies have illustrated, the US divestment may lead to an exacerbation of the pre-existing divergence between disease burden and research funding for global health priorities. Thus, key multilateral institutions with specialised technical expertise such as WHO and UNAIDS should be financially ring-fenced while urgently starting complementary reforms.

A more fundamental question, however, needs answering in the near future: what happens after the disruption caused by the divestment of the erstwhile global health leader? It is evident that a mere continuation of the 'old state of affairs' is not feasible, even if other countries and traditional donors were able and willing to attempt to fill the gap left by the US in global health. An automatic way back to a new 'equilibrium', if that ever existed in global health, is far from realistic, and maybe in the long run not even desirable. In fact, it did not take the US retreat from global health to highlight flaws in the status quo. Even if the successes achieved since the launch of the 2030 agenda need to be celebrated, many of the efforts around financial mobilisation and financial reform have fallen short of their goals. The hope to move 'from billions to trillions' for global development by mobilising private sector funds failed — particularly in global health. Moreover, the historically underlying paradigm of official development assistance as North-South development aid, challenges in donor coordination, and the current challenges of managing the crushing debt burdens of many countries are just examples of a system in trouble.

### Choosing the future of Antarctica [^25778322]. Nature (2018). Excellent credibility.

We present two narratives on the future of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, from the perspective of an observer looking back from 2070. In the first scenario, greenhouse gas emissions remained unchecked, the climate continued to warm, and the policy response was ineffective; this had large ramifications in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, with worldwide impacts. In the second scenario, ambitious action was taken to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to establish policies that reduced anthropogenic pressure on the environment, slowing the rate of change in Antarctica. Choices made in the next decade will determine what trajectory is realized.

### The WHO's 75th anniversary: WHO at a pivotal moment in history [^6abec90e]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) was inaugurated in 1948 to bring the world together to ensure the highest attainable standard of health for all. Establishing health governance under the United Nations (UN), WHO was seen as the preeminent leader in public health, promoting a healthier world following the destruction of World War II and ensuring global solidarity to prevent disease and promote health. Its constitutional function would be 'to act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work'. Yet today, as the world commemorates WHO's 75th anniversary, it faces a historic global health crisis, with governments presenting challenges to its institutional legitimacy and authority amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. WHO governance in the coming years will define the future of the Organisation and, crucially, the health and well-being of billions of people across the globe. At this pivotal moment, WHO must learn critical lessons from its past and make fundamental reforms to become the Organisation it was meant to be. We propose reforms in WHO financing, governance, norms, human rights and equity that will lay a foundation for the next generation of global governance for health.

### What can we learn from China's health system reform? [^1c35cc23]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

The Chinese central government started a first round of health system reform in 1996. The effectiveness of the reform was questioned after several years of implementation for a number of reasons. Firstly, complaints from the public about access to and affordability of healthcare increased. At that time, most people had no financial health protection and made high out-of-pocket payments for healthcare, which accounted for about 60% of total health expenditure. A large proportion of the population could not afford the healthcare they needed. Secondly, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in China in 2003 highlighted the importance of health for human development, and the government began to recognise the contribution of the health system to overall social and economic development. Thirdly, a leading state research institute published a report in 2005 which concluded that the 1996 health system reform had failed, which provoked more discussions about reform.

To respond to the concerns about the health system, the Chinese government began to plan another round of health system reform in 2007 and asked national and international organisations to provide reform proposals. Several ministries, coordinated by the National Development and Reform Commission and Ministry of Health, worked together to produce the master policy document for the reform. In March 2009, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the Opinions on Deepening Health System Reform. The aim of the reform was to establish an equitable and effective health system for all people (universal health coverage) by 2020 by strengthening healthcare delivery, health security, and provision of essential medicines.

China's health system reform is a large scale, long term social endeavour from which many lessons will be learnt. Analysis of the reform is important to help consider options for the future after this round of reform finishes in 2020. In this article we assess the achievements of the main reform policies, identify areas that need attention, and propose reform strategies for the next decade.

### Health systems changes after decentralisation: progress, challenges and dynamics in Pakistan [^8bcf8b83]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

In this paper, we present an analysis of improvements to health systems in Pakistan, in response to a politically driven devolution process. Devolution represents the most radical form of decentralisation. In 2010, Pakistan dissolved 17 federal ministries devolving legislative, operational and financial responsibilities to its four provinces. The devolution was undertaken through a major constitutional amendment unanimously supported by all political parties to meet the long-standing provincial demands for a lead role in shaping and implementing policies, a more equitable financial share and more locally responsive solutions particularly in the social sector.

The analysis aims to better understand and evaluate how subnational structures use decentralisation opportunities for improved planning, spending and carrying out transformations to the health system. Our narrative first landscapes the radical change in subnational authority and the process of abrupt devolution and subsequent partial recentralisation. Next, we analyse progress towards meeting devolution objectives in three areas: (1) did increased provincial resources translate into increased government expenditure for health?; (2) did enhanced provincial policy role lead to improvements in the health planning process?; (3) what progress was made in reform for health systems? Based on the above, we draw implications on how subnational governments used the enhanced decision space and influence of ownership, capacity, coordination and leadership factors.

### Dutch population structure across space, time and GWAS design [^028039a6]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Previous works have hinted that north-south genetic differentiation in the Netherlands may have been facilitated by cultural division between the predominantly Catholic south and the Protestant north. Given that the north-south structure observed in 1–3 cM IBD bins (expected time depth ~700 BCE) greatly precedes different forms of Christianity (Fig. 3), our data support a model in which the Protestant Reformation of the 16th and 17th centuries exploited pre-existing demographic subdivisions, leading to correlation between distinct cultural affinities and clusters of genetic similarity which has potentially been further strengthened by assortative mating among religious groups. Geographical modelling supports the role of migrational boundaries in establishing and maintaining this population substructure, especially rivers (Fig. 5). A substantial belt of low inferred migration runs across the Netherlands, corresponding closely to the roughly parallel east-west courses of the Lower Rhine, Waal and Meuse rivers and correlating with the geographical boundary of the principal north-south fineSTRUCTURE split. Absolute assignment of causality to these geographical correlates is, however, not possible and, given the dense network of waterways in the Netherlands, could be misleading. For example, a strong migrational cold spot in the east of the Netherlands runs parallel to the IJssel (Fig. 5), but could potentially be better explained by the course of the Apeldoorn Canal, a politically fraught waterway constructed in the early 19th Century. Similarly, a cold spot in the northwest directly overlays the North Sea Canal (completed in 1876). As both of these are human-made waterways, it is not certain whether their courses are consequences or determinants of low movement of people across their paths.

### Impact of China's primary healthcare reforms on utilisation, payments and self-reported health: a quasi-experimental analysis of a middle-aged and older cohort 2011–2018 [^bbf263c7]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

The robustness analyses found no significant endogeneity in the reform implementation. The t-test shows that there was no significant difference between the earlier and later adopters before the reform in terms of their covariates (ie, the average population sizes, GDP per capita, urbanisation, governmental health expenditures, unemployment rates, medical facilities/hospital beds/workforces per capita or the number of insured people) (online supplemental table S4). This finding suggests that the treated and control groups had similar characteristics regardless of their different timing of reform implementation. The results from the hazard model show that the baseline covariates were also not associated with the timing of reform adoption, providing further support for the exogeneity of the reform implementation (online supplemental table S5). The DiD model tested the parallel trend assumption. The DiD estimates for the pre-reform periods (eg, relative time < 0) are close to zero with no statistical significance after controlling for the covariates. The insignificant coefficients suggest that we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the parallel trend was satisfied in the pre-reform periods (figure 2).

### Impact of China's primary healthcare reforms on utilisation, payments and self-reported health: a quasi-experimental analysis of a middle-aged and older cohort 2011–2018 [^68436bbb]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Despite the significance of the PHC reforms, there is limited understanding of how the reforms have affected the health system and population health, and whether the reform impacts varied across groups. Several studies have described an increasing trend in the inputs and utilisation of PHC following China's PHC reform. However, these studies lacked robust statistical methods to control for confounders, limiting their ability to evaluate the true reform effects. Existing studies on the causal impacts of China's PHC reforms mostly focus on single policies, such as gatekeeping, family physiciansor system integration. These studies are mostly from megacities/provinces in eastern China that are well-resourcedand are not representative of national-level impacts. Moreover, the focus on single policy components lacks a holistic perspective and overlooks the synergetic impacts of comprehensive reforms on a complicated and interconnected health system. Three studies evaluated the reform as a whole, with two using national data, but the evidence is mixed. A systematic review of the reforms found some increase in primary care utilisation across regions, but it highlights substantial evidence gaps in the reform impacts on financial protection and health. Additionally, as mentioned above, the PHC reform was implemented in a staggered way. However, existing studies only ascertained the staggered implementation at the provincial level and neglected the great temporal variations in the city-level reform implementation within provinces, resulting in inaccurate exposure identification.

This study provides nationally representative, comprehensive and robust evidence on the impacts of China's PHC reform on health service utilisation, payments and health outcomes. This study employed individual-level data on a cohort aged 45 and above and a robust staggered difference-in-differences (DiD) method to assess: (1) how the reform has affected individuals' primary care utilisation, hospitalisation, out-of-pocket expenditures (OOPEs) and health outcomes and (2) how the reform impacts varied across urban and rural populations, and across people of different wealth levels. This study ascertained reform implementation dates at the city level using web scraping, allowing a more accurate exposure identification than existing studies. In doing so, this study reduces the potential for bias by accounting for the temporal and geographical variations in reform implementation across cities and counties within provinces.

### A proposal for FDA reform [^fbc0af3b]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2002). Medium credibility.

Since the current system for the regulation of drugs in the United States was established in 1962, the FDA has steadily increased the scope of its responsibilities and activities, and, concomitantly, the regulatory burden on drug developers. The costs and time that are required for drug development have spiralled upwards. Reform of drug regulation is necessary; it must be fundamental in nature, and it must come from outside the agency through new legislation.

### Cross-national differences in intergenerational family relations: the influence of public policy arrangements [^a62f5acc]. Innovation in Aging (2018). Low credibility.

Weak and Strong Family Regions

article on family ties in western Europe has served as a source of inspiration for many cross-national studies. In "bold strokes" (p. 204), he described the center and north of Europe as a weak family region and the Mediterranean as a strong family region. In countries with weak family ties, young adults set up households of their own at a relatively young age, and the provision of care to vulnerable family members is largely accomplished through public and private institutions. In countries with strong family ties, young adults remain in the parental home until they marry, and much of the aid given to the needy and the poor comes from the family. In weak family areas, individualistic values prevail, whereas collectivistic values predominate in strong family contexts. Reher traced the emphasis on the individual and self-reliance in northern Europe to the Reformation and attributed the overriding importance of kin ties in southern Europe to Catholic and Islamic influences.

The first cross-national studies on intergenerational ties using data from SHARE focused on co-residence, spatial proximity, and frequency of contacts. Results demonstrated "not only a 'weak'–'strong' dichotomy but a North-South gradient" (, p. 167). In Scandinavian countries, the proportions of older adults with children in the same household, at least one child living within a 25-km radius, and daily contact with at least one child are lower than in the Mediterranean countries, with the Continental European countries somewhere in the middle. Interestingly, country differences in intergenerational transfers of time and money do not clearly fit Reher's division between weak family and strong family regions.

Following Reher, one would expect both the frequency and intensity of intergenerational transfers to be lowest in weak family regions and highest in strong family regions. Results show otherwise. The Scandinavian countries exhibit the highest frequency of giving and receiving, but the lowest intensity of support exchanges. The frequency of support exchanges is lowest in the Mediterranean countries, but the intensity is highest. Again, support transfers in the continental European countries fall in between the other two regions. Clearly, support for Reher's weak family — strong family dichotomy depends on the measure of intergenerational relations that is used.

### Exploring motivated reasoning in polarization over the unfolding 2023 judicial reform in Israel [^143c97e3]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

We acknowledge several methodological limitations of the current study. First, although we recruited a representative sample in terms of age and gender, we did so only for the majority Jewish population in Israel, excluding two minority groups: Ultra-Orthodox Jews and Palestinian citizens of Israel. As such, we were unable to use our findings, especially those regarding camp sizes, as indicators of actual views of the reform in the Israeli population. This prevented us from, for example, examining which camp (pro-reform, anti-reform, or both) over-estimated their own camp's size in the population. Second, our investigation was correlational, thus limiting causal inferences. Nevertheless, we can, at least partially, rely on pre-existing differences between groups in Israel e.g. ref.and on the fact that these differences certainly preceded the reform, to establish temporal precedence. Similarly, the reform, and therefore any polarization over this issue, preceded the downstream consequences we focused on. Specifically, protest methods and protest control referred directly to protesting the reform, conflict management strategies referred directly to resolving this conflict, and delegitimization of political opponents centered around their understanding and motives regarding the reform. This temporal precedence, in addition to the associations that we documented, provide two of three requirements for causal inference. Future work should recruit a more representative sample and add the third requirement for establishing causality — disqualification of alternative explanations.

The current research was conducted shortly after the judicial reform was introduced. Although differences in institutional trust, blind versus constructive patriotism, and ethno-religious versus civic identity between groups in general, and pro- and anti-reform camps in particular, existed before the reform, our data cannot account for the underlying causes of these differences. One likely candidate is education, and more specifically Israel's education system, which is segregated by ethnic and religious group membership. Future research should examine whether this segregation leads to differences in the way people construct their national identity, criticize (vs. not) their nation, trust (vs. not) democratic institutions, and understand democracy –. Another avenue for future research is to examine whether and how segregated education systems contribute to issue-based and affective polarization.

### Reimagining global health architecture for a sustainable future [^08d6bced]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Global health architecture — the system of principles, agreements, and actors of global health — emerged in its modern form in the post-Second World War period that assumed steady economic expansion. Today, this growth-dependent model is in crisis; debt-driven instability undermines health expenditure, ecological limits are exceeded, and political distortion fuels militarisation and weakens multilateral institutions. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed serious shortcomings in coordination, financing, and leadership in global health — 5 years on, these governance gaps remain unresolved. Global political polarisation has intensified, further weakening trust in multilateral institutions and straining under-resourced health systems. Addressing this vacuum in global health architecture requires more than institutional reform; it calls for a broader socioecological transformation. One Health, an integrated, unifying approach that aims to sustainably balance and optimise the health of people, animals, and ecosystems, has emerged as the conceptual pillar of this transformation. and led by the International Federation of Environmental Health, focuses this year on clean air and serves as a reminder of the need to place sustainability and the integration of One Health in all policies to shape a new global health architecture. launched in July 2025, frames health as a deeply ecological concept, emerging from the interplay among humans, animals, plants, and the environment. It calls for a socioecological transformation that rethinks food systems, economic models, and power structures. Central to this vision is the transition from extractive, industrial food production to resilient, equitable, and ecologically sound systems. The transformation is essential, but the path toward implementation requires a cautious approach. If not designed and implemented truly inclusively, policies meant to reduce environmental harm might inadvertently burden the very populations they aim to protect, such as smallholder farmers, low-income communities, and marginalised groups. There is also a risk that powerful corporate interests will adapt reforms in ways that shield their own practices while shifting costs downward onto groups with fewer resources, which in turn might exacerbate resource concentration among the ultra-rich and further.

### Impact of China's primary healthcare reforms on utilisation, payments and self-reported health: a quasi-experimental analysis of a middle-aged and older cohort 2011–2018 [^fa535a9d]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Measures

Four outcomes were derived from CHARLS data: (1) whether the respondent visited any PHC facilities in the last month (yes/no); (2) whether the respondent was hospitalised in the last year (yes/no); (3) the respondent's OOPEs for all medical care in the last year (including both inpatient and outpatient care), adjusted for inflation using consumer price index (CPI) in 2010 according to World Bankand (4) a dichotomised variable for self-reported health ('very good', 'good' or 'fair' = 1, 'poor' or 'very poor' = 0).

The exposure variable in this study was a respondent's exposure to the PHC reform based on their city/county of residence and interview date. We compared a respondent's interview month with the month of the reform implementation in their city of residence. A respondent was defined as exposed if their residence city/county had implemented the PHC reform at the time of the interview. If a city implemented the reform after the interview month, its implementation year was categorised into the next year. This imputation prevents misclassifying exposure status for those who started the reform after the survey month but in the survey year. The relative year to the reform implementation was calculated using the interview years and the implementation year, with a negative value for pre-reform periods and a positive for post-reform. We used year zero for the post-reform periods that are less than a year, year+1 for the post-reform periods more than 1 year but less than 2 years and so forth. Existing studies using the DiD proposed by Callaway and Sant'Annatypically use similar methods to construct and report time-varying treatment effects. The latest reform implementation date was February 2018, 6 months prior to the 2018 CHARLS survey. All respondents had been under the PHC reform by the end of the observation periods.

### Global health governance: we need innovation not renovation [^3fac75c7]. BMJ Global Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Summary box

Although the global health community widely accepts that WHO, as currently configured, is no longer fit-for-purpose, commentators cling to renovation ('reform'), rather than innovation, at the expense of a global health governance system that reflects the needs of a very changed world.
Collective action in a globalised world requires institutions that look very different from what we currently have. Rather than the renovation of outdated institutional forms — which are closed, territorially fixed and hierarchical — we need to harness innovations such as social networks, open-source systems and the sharing economy.
One of the biggest forms of institutional innovation more broadly is 'network governance', by which collective action is achieved through interconnected institutions spanning government, business and civil society.

### Exploring motivated reasoning in polarization over the unfolding 2023 judicial reform in Israel [^144475d7]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Perceived societal polarization

Participants rated the extent to which they think Israel is polarized, without mentioning the reform. Higher scores indicated higher perceived polarization.

Motivated perceptions

We assessed two perceptions that can be motivated by participants' views on the reform — false consensus and importance of democratic features. To assess false consensus, we looked at participants' perceptions of the distribution of opinions about the reform in the population. Participants indicated the percentage of the population that supports, opposes, and has no opinion about the reform (adding up to 100). False consensus manifests when participants estimate their own camp (either pro- or anti-reform) as larger than the other camps. To assess importance of democratic features, we presented participants with six features — majority rule, separation of power between branches of government, protection of minority rights, independent and free media, free elections, and protection of human rights for everyone equally. Participants rated the extent to which they believe each feature is important to Israel's democracy.

Motivated downstream consequences

Participants rated their opinions regarding downstream consequences that can be motivated by the extremity of their views on the reform (i.e. issue-based polarization) and their feeling towards opposing camps (i.e. affective polarization). Following Exploratory Factor Analysis (see Supplementary Methods 4 in SI for full description), we focused on four immediate downstream consequences of polarization: endorsement of extreme protest methods (e.g. civil revolt), support of extreme protest control (e.g. police violence), conflict management strategies (e.g. compromise, dialogue), and delegitimization of political opponents. Delegitimization was assessed in the context of the judicial reform. Participants rated characteristics of people who support the reform and of people who oppose it (e.g. "They do not understand what democracy is", "They want revenge"). As with affective polarization, for each participant, we used only the items reflecting delegitimization of the opposing camp. Higher scores indicated greater delegitimization.

### Abortion by telemedicine: an equitable option for Irish women [^82148bf5]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Uncertainty is aggravated by complexity in the law governing telemedicine. Legal systems differ, for instance, on whether, like the Republic and Northern Ireland, criminal law applies only to acts within their territory, or, as in continental Europe, it applies to their nationals wherever they act, even lawfully, elsewhere. Concerns have been raised in both Irish jurisdictions that abortion law is dysfunctional and unjust.

Common knowledge that criminal prohibitions are avoidable by women with means to receive lawful services in the UK or Europe and that women denied services at home face risks to their health and even their lives add momentum to calls for reform. In 2012 Savita Halappanavar died after being denied an abortion in the Republic. International pressure includes a critical review of Irish law by the European Court of Human Rights in 2010and the condemnation of Irish practice by the UN Human Rights committee, resulting in a €30 000 (£25 300, $32 800) payment to Amanda Mellet in 2016.

Aiken and colleagues report the best safety evidence to date for self sourced medical abortion through telemedicine for women living where high quality healthcare is accessible but legal abortion is not. Repeal of legal restrictions would support the safest and most equitable abortion care for women in Irish jurisdictions. Until then, for the first time in history, women of all social classes in a legally restricted yet high resource setting have equitable access to a reasonable alternative: medical abortion guided by physicians through telemedicine.

### Political economy of COVID-19: extractive, regressive, competitive [^c0738540]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Road ahead

The longstanding patterns of extraction, the resulting vulnerabilities, and the specific problems presented by covid-19 all point to the need for change. In nearly all instances, these are changes that governments have committed to in the past but have not actually pursued. For example, countries committed to achieving universal health coverage (UHC) for their population at the 2019 United Nations General Assembly. Domestic inequalities are made worse by the current absence of UHC in many settings, which also impedes pandemic response since people excluded from healthcare because of cost and other barriers cannot seek care or self isolate when infected. Governments should prioritise pooled resources to provide full population coverage of a comprehensive package of health services, including vital public health services needed to prevent pandemics and basic primary healthcare needed to maintain wellbeing. Such coverage can be achieved only through progressive public financing. To be fair and effective, UHC must include marginalised groups, such as migrants, refugees, indigenous people, and people working in the informal sector. For those who have suffered most from extraction, including indigenous people, solutions must include enfranchisement with settlement of land rights and the provision of culturally appropriate services.

Internationally, colonial patterns persist in many complex ways, although their consequences in systematically disadvantaging formerly colonised people and places is clear. The Commission on the Social Determinants of Health concluded in 2008 that health equity could not be achieved without dramatic redistribution of power and resources. The geopolitics of the covid-19 pandemic have shown that much work remains to be done in this respect. In the past three decades our world has grown more unequal, multinational corporations have flourished in a very deregulated global economy, and even as millions suffer and die now, many very rich people have become even more wealthy during the pandemic. Over the past few decades the planet's natural resources — necessary to sustain all life — have been depleted to dangerous levels, threatening human and planetary health alike. The common thread in these problems is the need for governance reform. Helpfully, the mechanisms that could be used to regulate the practices of transnational corporations have been described: these include reporting, reviewing, monitoring, and managing conflicts of interest; stopping the revolving door between transnational corporations and governments; protecting whistleblowers; and restricting and requiring full disclosure of lobbying activities. Similarly, the Transnational Institute has proposed binding treaties to regulate transnational corporations.

### Exploring motivated reasoning in polarization over the unfolding 2023 judicial reform in Israel [^d0de7f9d]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We found that Israeli Jews are polarized over the judicial reform issue, reflecting two distinct camps — pro- and anti-reform. Though we observed some shifts in views of the reform as a threat to democracy, most participants did not change their views, and the observed shift was a result of a decrease in pro-reform participants' perception of threat (i.e. they became more extreme in their views). Views of the reform transcend political orientation and party loyalties, and land instead on concepts of national identity, patriotism, and institutional trust. Even though most pro-reform participants were firmly right wing, opposition to the reform emerged across the entire political spectrum. The anti- (vs. pro-) reform camp exemplified more liberal values: they expressed more universalism/benevolence values, more constructive patriotism, and had higher trust in the judiciary and media. The pro- (vs. anti-) reform camp appeared more conservative: they held a more exclusive ethno-religious identity, engaged in more blind patriotism, and had higher trust in the government. We suggest that these pre-existing differences motivated the groups' opposing views on the newly emerged reform.

In the era of global democratic backsliding, we find support for the notion that trust in different democratic institutions might motivate polarized views on newly introduced political issues, especially when these issues concern democracy. The judicial reform in Israel is the government's attempt to gain power over the judiciary. Reflecting motivated reasoning, trusting the government predicted issue-based and affective polarization (both of which are directly related to the reform) in opposing directions for the two camps. We found evidence for the importance of trust in media, which predicted greater issue-based and affective polarization among the anti-reform camp. This highlights the importance of media in democratic processes, but also suggests that its reach may be limited to people who believe that the media shares their ideology.

### Preparing international cooperation on pandemic prevention for the anthropocene [^2528d9a7]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Similarly, the latest report of the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board released in September 2020 calls on United Nations leadership to agree to an international framework for health emergency preparedness, that incorporates the IHR and mechanisms for 'research and development, social protection, equitable access to countermeasures for all, and mutual accountability'. Whether reform to the IHR, or a potential new pandemic convention, or both, multilateralism for pandemic preparedness must expressly consider the postpandemic Anthropocene we live in and face. This includes tackling the fragmentation that has occurred between global health and the environment in practice, in international institutions, and in legal instruments. Across fields, this may also be an opportunity to improve governance reporting of health hazards, such as notification and data sharing obligations.

While improvements in governance may enable more rapid response, reducing the human toll of epidemics and especially pandemics depends more on strengthening human health systems. To that, ensuring universal healthcare (UHC) is a critical element of both pandemic preparedness and adaptation to a changing world. While there are a range of components to achieving UHC, strengthening primary healthcare can address 80%–90% of a person's health needs over their life, contributing to healthier populations and ensuring access to preventative care and treatment for acute and chronic conditions.UHC is founded in the realisation of the right to health, and on the principles of ensuring that healthcare is available, accessible, acceptable and of sufficient quality, without discrimination. For pandemic preparedness, UHC ensures that when people are sick, they can access healthcare immediately, without fear of economic hardship, while building the trust and preventive healthcare necessary for public health. New evidence also suggests that in doing so, universal health coverage is also likely to improve conservation outcomes, and therefore reduce environmental degradation, in the communities where spillover risk is highest.

### Genetic discrimination and life insurance: a systematic review of the evidence [^8449d380]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Results and discussion

Scope and context

Together, the 33 studies represent two decades' worth of research published from 1991 to 2012 (see Table 1). A small peak in the number of studies (eight studies) can be identified between 2006 and 2007, which can be linked to the charged political climate in the US and renewed academic interest that prefaced the adoption of GINA. These studies generally gathered evidence through direct sources (that is, individuals commenting on their own experience with insurance companies), but some obtained their data through secondary sources such as insurers, insurance associations, health professionals or patient groups.

The majority of studies reviewed (73%) aimed at providing evidence of GD in a variety of fields (for example, employment, immigration, adoption and access to healthcare), including that of life insurance. A minority (27%) focused exclusively on the context of life insurance (see Table 1). The majority of the available evidence (58%) comes from studies involving North American population groups (see Figure 2 and Table 2).

Figure 2
Studies on genetic discrimination and life insurance by country.

Table 2
Distribution of results on the evidence of genetic discrimination.

a Out of 33. GD: genetic discrimination.

Surprisingly, given the rather strong European policy response mentioned above, only six studies (18%) provided empirical data on the situation prevailing in continental Europe, and five of these studies were very specific in nature, addressing the context of familial hypercholesterolemia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the Netherlands, hereditary breast and colorectal cancer in Norway, and Huntington's disease in Germany.

The substantial number of studies carried out in Canada (seven studies), where no specific laws have been adopted to limit the use of genetic information by life insurers, and the absence of studies in a highly legislated European context, could suggest that the number of GD studies carried out in a given country, as well as the number of GD cases reported, does not necessarily have a strong correlative impact on policymaking. A notable exception to this trend could be Australia, whose Disability Act was amended following the publication of major studies on GD and an extensive report from the Australian Law Reform Commission.

### Primary care reform in the peoples' republic of China: implications for training family physicians for the world's largest country [^993be4b4]. Family Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Just as China has struggled with bringing an expanding economy to a country with large areas of economic underdevelopment, the Chinese health care system is experiencing tension between tradition and modernization. Because of this tension, health care in the Peoples' Republic of China has been undergoing significant reform since the beginning of the 1980s. Experiments in market-based health systems have been unsuccessful and have exacerbated disparities. New reforms, announced in 2006, stress the role of family physicians in leading the health care system. This paper discusses the history of the developments that led up to the new reforms and the educational challenges of training sufficient numbers of family physicians to meet the requirements of the new system.

### Performance-based financing in low-income and middle-income countries: isn' T it time for a rethink? [^aee4c9b1]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ten years after the launch of the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF), which aims to promote performance-based financing (PBF) in the health sector in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), and 6 years after publication of the paper 'Performance-based financing: just a donor fad or a catalyst towards comprehensive health care reform?', in which the authors argue that 'performance-based financing can catalyse comprehensive reforms and help address structural problems of public health services [… and that] it may contribute to profoundly transforming the public sectors of low-income countries', we think it is time to question the mainstream view that PBF is an effective, efficient and equitable approach to improving the performance of health systems.

PBF was conceptualised by its promoters — nearly all European or American — as an approach enabling health system reform in countries where past reforms had presumably failed. However, one can question in the first place whether other system-wide reforms, such as ambitious decentralisation or human resources reforms: (1) have actually failed; (2) have ever received sufficient financial support over the years; and (3) have effectively provided adequate funding to the operational level — which could actually be the critical issue to be solved. Indeed, for instance, the randomised controlled trial of PBF in Cameroon showed that, for most of the positive outcomes, there was no statistically significant difference between health facilities with the standard PBF package and a control group receiving all elements of PBF except the direct link between individual facility performance and additional financing.

### A well-timed shift from local to global agreements accelerates climate change mitigation [^415257c1]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Recent attempts at cooperating on climate change mitigation highlight the limited efficacy of large-scale negotiations, when commitment to mitigation is costly and initially rare. Deepening existing voluntary mitigation pledges could require more stringent, legally-binding agreements that currently remain untenable at the global scale. Building-blocks approaches promise greater success by localizing agreements to regions or few-nation summits, but risk slowing mitigation adoption globally. Here, we show that a well-timed policy shift from local to global legally-binding agreements can dramatically accelerate mitigation compared to using only local, only global, or both agreement types simultaneously. This highlights the scale-specific roles of mitigation incentives: local agreements promote and sustain mitigation commitments in early-adopting groups, after which global agreements rapidly draw in late-adopting groups. We conclude that focusing negotiations on local legally-binding agreements and, as these become common, a renewed pursuit of stringent, legally-binding world-wide agreements could best overcome many current challenges facing climate mitigation.

### Do state minimum markup / price laws work? Evidence from retail scanner data and TUS-CPS [^9c56139f]. Tobacco Control (2016). Low credibility.

Table 1
Nielsen markets included in analysis

The CPS was conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics through telephone and face-to-face interviews. Every month the CPS surveys a sample of ∼60 000 households to collect a wide range of demographic, labour force and household characteristics. Data on special topics are also gathered from these same respondents in periodic supplemental surveys, including the TUS. Seven waves of the TUS have been sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) starting in 1992. We use the two most recent waves 2006–2007 and 2010–2011 for this analysis, given the availability of MPL data. Our sample consisted of 40 838 self-responding smokers aged 15 years and older who resided in the continental USA, who reported the prices that they paid in their last purchase of cigarettes. Proxy respondents were allowed in TUS-CPS, but we excluded those respondents because they were not asked the full range of smoking questions, including some key cigarette price questions. When analysing TUS-CPS data, we controlled for individual level demographic characteristics, including gender, age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, education, real family income and employment/labour force participation. Online supplementary appendix tables S1 and S2 provide descriptive statistics for the Nielsen and TUS-CPS samples, respectively.

### Exploring motivated reasoning in polarization over the unfolding 2023 judicial reform in Israel [^9d88107e]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

This work explored polarization over Israel's Judicial Reform, introduced in January 2023. We find that the reform divided people into pro- and anti-reform camps, which differed in characteristics such as institutional trust, patriotism, and national identity. For example, the camps disagreed about trust in the government versus the judiciary. In line with motivated reasoning-biased reasoning processes used to reach desired conclusions-people's pre-existing characteristics motivated polarized views of the reform as a threat to democracy (issue-based polarization) and negative emotions towards opponents (affective polarization). Further demonstrating a motivated process, pro-reform participants (the electorate majority), prioritized majority rule over other democratic features (e.g., minority rights) compared to anti-reform participants. Polarization differentially predicted downstream consequences (e.g., protest methods), indicating that the camps' reactions were motivated by the extremity of their views and negative emotions. This work extends the understanding of potentially motivated polarization processes and their immediate downstream consequences.

Among the noncommunicable diseases, mental ill-health represents the major threat to social and economic progress because it impacts so powerfully on the most critical decades of life. Consequently, mental health reform is increasingly recognized as an urgent priority worldwide. This brings into sharp focus the role of evidence, and more specifically the Cochrane paradigm, in influencing decisions about health system reform. Cochrane clearly still has great value, especially in evidence-based medicine, where the focus is the evaluation of individual treatments. However, it cannot be allowed to be a dominant influence in evidence-based health care (EBHC) policy decisions for health system reform, unless it is modernized or complemented. Health services reform should definitely be as evidence-based as possible; however, the jury should consider its verdict on key reform proposals based on the balance of probabilities and informed by the best "available" evidence from all sources, not only randomized clinical trials, which in many domains may be never be feasible. This is particularly the case when reform is urgent, and the status quo has manifestly failed. So on the one hand, the evidence-based paradigm must not be misused to stifle or paralyze urgent reform. Alternatively, there is a real risk that, if we do not improve the sophistication of EBHC, the whole paradigm will be sidelined and reform will remain reactive, impulsive, and desultory. The recent Cochrane review on early intervention in psychosis provides an opportunity to consider these issues and their wider significance.

### Powerful ideas? Decolonisation and the future of global health [^d5d64f6b]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

In the context of unequal development, global health will continue to be 'centred' in high-income countries - and, increasingly, upper middle-income countries, especially China, which has over the last decade transitioned from being a recipient to a major contributor of development assistance for health. This is because the resources that underpin the field's activities will continue to be provided by governments, philanthropists, private foundations, the corporate sector and individuals situated in richer countries. As funding for global health goals continues to flow from the 'North' (and increasingly the 'East') to the 'South', ensuring proper representation of, respect for, and accountability to, 'Southern' policymakers, researchers and practitioners will remain a complex problem. It is one that can be overcome, or at least offset, but progress will require a properly formulated diagnosis of the problem and an evidence-based theory of change.

Conversely, if the reality of progress is discounted, the space for future improvement is minimised, and only radical, systemic, revolutionary changes are likely to be effective. Thus there are arguments for 'dismantling' global health, for 'flipping every axis of supremacy on its head', for the 'complete overhaul' of the discipline, and for 'anger and revolution', if not violence. Criticism of such approaches can be - and has been - dismissed as a mere power play. Yet it may be driven by a genuine concern that these approaches may be damaging in themselves, and impede the creation of broad coalitions needed to deliver sustainable change.

### Accelerating progress towards universal health coverage in Asia and pacific: improving the future for women and children [^6eb0ef64]. BMJ Global Health (2016). Medium credibility.

UHC is a political process from the start

Across Asia and Pacific, political leaders have recognised that successful UHC reforms are extremely popular and can be a potent political tool to help win and sustain power. UHC can generate huge benefits for some groups in society but can have significant costs for other groups. This, in turn, can result in considerable political costs and benefits (in terms of popularity) for governments and political leaders overseeing reform processes. Given the high political stakes involved, it is not surprising that UHC reforms in the region have often been led by the head of state (eg, Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda in Japan (1963), President Park Chung Hee in the Republic of Korea (1977) and most recently President Joko Widodo in Indonesia (from 2014)). In particular, fulfilling the equity principle underlying UHC (that healthy and wealthy people subsidise services for the poor, vulnerable and sick) requires a strong role for the state in establishing and governing a progressive health financing system. Many analyses of large-scale UHC programmes in Asia have cited political reasons as the main motivation behind these reforms.

Closing primary healthcare gaps is the foundation

Closing primary healthcare gaps should be the foundation of UHC reforms. Countries that want to make rapid progress towards UHC should prioritise primary healthcare, including prevention and health promotion as a first step. Well-structured, efficient primary health services can meet most of the health needs of the population. Engaging communities and removing barriers to access is a core dimension of strengthening primary care. These measures include removing non-financial access barriers, including perceptions about poor quality; language and cultural barriers; lack of appropriate services (eg, for adolescents); indirect costs; and poor community engagement in health. Some of these barriers can be addressed through strengthening health services while others, such as the indirect costs of accessing care, may involve other social protection measures such as cash transfers.

### Granite magma formation, transport and emplacement in the earth's crust [^aa5f0947]. Nature (2000). Excellent credibility.

The origin of granites was once a question solely for petrologists and geochemists. But in recent years a consensus has emerged that recognizes the essential role of deformation in the segregation, transport and emplacement of silica-rich melts in the continental crust. Accepted petrological models are being questioned, either because they require unrealistic rheological behaviours of rocks and magmas, or because they do not satisfactorily explain the available structural or geophysical data. Provided flow is continuous, mechanical considerations suggest that — far from being geologically sluggish — granite magmatism is a rapid, dynamic process operating at timescales of ≤ 100,000 years, irrespective of tectonic setting.

### Intra-oceanic subduction shaped the assembly of cordilleran north America [^fb64323f]. Nature (2013). Excellent credibility.

The western quarter of North America consists of accreted terranes — crustal blocks added over the past 200 million years — but the reason for this is unclear. The widely accepted explanation posits that the oceanic Farallon plate acted as a conveyor belt, sweeping terranes into the continental margin while subducting under it. Here we show that this hypothesis, which fails to explain many terrane complexities, is also inconsistent with new tomographic images of lower-mantle slabs, and with their locations relative to plate reconstructions. We offer a reinterpretation of North American palaeogeography and test it quantitatively: collision events are clearly recorded by slab geometry, and can be time calibrated and reconciled with plate reconstructions and surface geology. The seas west of Cretaceous North America must have resembled today's western Pacific, strung with island arcs. All proto-Pacific plates initially subducted into almost stationary, intra-oceanic trenches, and accumulated below as massive vertical slab walls. Above the slabs, long-lived volcanic archipelagos and subduction complexes grew. Crustal accretion occurred when North America overrode the archipelagos, causing major episodes of Cordilleran mountain building.

### Exploring motivated reasoning in polarization over the unfolding 2023 judicial reform in Israel [^42674aaf]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

To examine polarization, we utilized a group-based approachand identified two camps — reflecting support of (pro-reform) and opposition to (anti-reform) the reform. We suggest that difference in views between these camps can motivate biased self-serving perceptions, both of others' position on the reform as well as of the core issue at hand (i.e. understanding of democracy). First, self-serving motivated reasoning suggests that each camp is motivated to believe that most others hold a similar opinion, thus displaying the false consensus effect. Second, even the importance each camp assigns to core features of democracy (e.g. majority rule, minority rights) is likely to be motivated to align with their polarized positions on the reform. For example, those whose current power position relies on majority rule principle are more likely endorse it than those who are currently harmed by this principle.

Finally, we examined potential downstream consequences of polarization that can be detrimental to social cohesion and impact intergroup relations. It is likely that people's views on the reform (i.e. pro- vs. anti-reform) motivate how they would perceive the legitimacy of various responses to it. Whereas much work has been conducted on the long-term consequences of polarization (e.g. lower political interest, decision-making gridlock, erosion of democratic processes, and lower general trust –), little is known about the more immediate, practical effects of polarization amid an ongoing social conflict (but see ref.). To fill this gap, we investigated four central groups of outcomes that are particularly relevant to the current context: endorsement of extreme protest methods (e.g. general strike), support for protest control (e.g. stun grenades), attitudes to conflict management strategies, (e.g. willingness to compromise), and delegitimization of political opponents (e.g. questioning their understanding of democracy). Our use of cross-sectional data precludes us from inferring causality; however, we argue that it is nevertheless useful to speak in terms of downstream consequences, as these consequences emerged after the judicial reform had split society into camps. Note, all the consequences we investigated may also act as reinforcers of polarization, thus creating a positive feedback loop.

### Future of Japan's system of good health at low cost with equity: beyond universal coverage [^1906c8f8]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Japan's premier health accomplishment in the past 50 years has been the achievement of good population health at low cost and increased equity between different population groups. The development of Japan's policies for universal coverage are similar to the policy debates that many countries are having in their own contexts. The financial sustainability of Japan's universal coverage is under threat from demographic, economic, and political factors. Furthermore, a series of crises-both natural and nuclear-after the magnitude 9·0 Great East Japan Earthquake on March 11, 2011, has shaken up the entire Japanese social system that was developed and built after World War 2, and shown existing structural problems in the Japanese health system. Here, we propose four major reforms to assure the sustainability and equity of Japan's health accomplishments in the past 50 years-implement a human-security value-based reform; redefine the role of the central and local governments; improve the quality of health care; and commit to global health. Now is the time for rebirth of Japan and its health system.

### The anglo-saxon migration and the formation of the early english gene pool [^2c14b30d]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

The history of the British Isles and Ireland is characterized by multiple periods of major cultural change, including the influential transformation after the end of Roman rule, which precipitated shifts in language, settlement patterns and material culture 1. The extent to which migration from continental Europe mediated these transitions is a matter of long-standing debate 2–4. Here we study genome-wide ancient DNA from 460 medieval northwestern Europeans-including 278 individuals from England-alongside archaeological data, to infer contemporary population dynamics. We identify a substantial increase of continental northern European ancestry in early medieval England, which is closely related to the early medieval and present-day inhabitants of Germany and Denmark, implying large-scale substantial migration across the North Sea into Britain during the Early Middle Ages. As a result, the individuals who we analysed from eastern England derived up to 76% of their ancestry from the continental North Sea zone, albeit with substantial regional variation and heterogeneity within sites. We show that women with immigrant ancestry were more often furnished with grave goods than women with local ancestry, whereas men with weapons were as likely not to be of immigrant ancestry. A comparison with present-day Britain indicates that subsequent demographic events reduced the fraction of continental northern European ancestry while introducing further ancestry components into the English gene pool, including substantial southwestern European ancestry most closely related to that seen in Iron Age France 5,6.

### South China sea documents the transition from wide continental rift to continental break up [^626120dc]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

During extension, the continental lithosphere thins and breaks up, forming either wide or narrow rifts depending on the thermo-mechanical state of the extending lithosphere. Wide continental rifts, which can reach 1,000km across, have been extensively studied in the North American Cordillera and in the Aegean domain. Yet, the evolutionary process from wide continental rift to continental breakup remains enigmatic due to the lack of seismically resolvable data on the distal passive margin and an absence of onshore natural exposures. Here, we show that Eocene extension across the northern margin of the South China Sea records the transition between a wide continental rift and highly extended (< 15km) continental margin. On the basis of high-resolution seismic data, we document the presence of dome structures, a corrugated and grooved detachment fault, and subdetachment deformation involving crustal-scale nappe folds and magmatic intrusions, which are coeval with supradetachment basins. The thermal and mechanical weakening of this broad continental domain allowed for the formation of metamorphic core complexes, boudinage of the upper crust and exhumation of middle/lower crust through detachment faulting. The structural architecture of the northern South China Sea continental margin is strikingly similar to the broad continental rifts in the North American Cordillera and in the Aegean domain, and reflects the transition from wide rift to continental breakup.

### Promoting convergence and closing gaps: a blueprint for the revision of the European union tobacco tax directive [^b52f39c8]. Tobacco Control (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study provides a blueprint for a reform of the EU tobacco tax directive that addresses two public health shortcomings about which the European Council has stated that 'action at the EU level is required'. The reform hinges on the use of minimum taxes on a per quantity basis to promote upwards price convergence across countries as well as a reduction of the gap between the prices of FM cigarettes and RYO tobacco. The ex-ante evaluation results presented herein suggest that such a reform would deliver on those desired outcomes and provide useful evidence for the process of reform of the EU tax directive.

What this paper adds

This paper proposes a blueprint for the reform of the European Union Tobacco Tax Directive affecting the two most important combustible tobacco products: factory-made cigarettes and fine-cut tobacco.
The reform aims to solve two public health shortcomings in the existing arrangements: the lack of price convergence across countries and the pervasive price gap between factory-made and roll-your-own cigarettes.
The study simulates the effect of such a reform and shows that it would significantly ameliorate these two public health problems.

### Nationwide seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and identification of risk factors in the general population of the Netherlands during the first epidemic wave [^8f7cc3c0]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Seroprevalence estimates

Overall weighted seroprevalence in the NS was 2.8% (95% CI 2.1 to 3.7), did not differ between sexes or ethnic backgrounds (table 1), and was not higher among healthcare workers (2.7% vs non-healthcare workers 2.5%). Seroprevalence was lowest in the northern region (1.3%) and highest in the mid-west (4.0%). Estimates were lowest in children — gradually increasing from below 1% at age 2 years to 3% at 17 years — was highest in age group 18–39 years (4.9%) and ranged between 2 and 4% up to 90 years of age (figure 2). In both samples, seroprevalence was highest in Orthodox-Reformed Protestants (> 7%) (table 1). Online supplement figure S1B displays the distribution of IgG concentrations for all participants by age, and online supplemental figure S2 shows the seroprevalence smoothed by age in the LVC.

Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity

Variables that were associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in univariable analyses included age group, Orthodox-Reformed Protestant, had been in contact with a COVID-19 case, use of immunosuppressants, and antibiotic/antiviral medication in the last month (table 3). In multivariable analysis, substantial higher odds were observed for those who took immunosuppressants the last month, were Orthodox-Reformed Protestant, had been in contact with a COVID-19 confirmed case, and from age groups 18–24 and 25–39 years (compared to 2–12 years).

### Principles of child health care financing [^4366ac44]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Health financing reform caution — although intelligent fiscal reforms crafted to improve quality of care and outcomes among children and young adults can achieve some savings, reforms that solely aim to limit or reduce expenditures for health care (for example, by using block grant, capped allotment, or per-capita capitations payment methodologies) will endanger the health of children by reducing eligibility, scope of benefits, and access to care, and the principles outlined here should guide both reform of existing plans and design of new plans.

### Evolution of magma-poor continental margins from rifting to seafloor spreading [^4bf4febf]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

The rifting of continents involves faulting (tectonism) and magmatism, which reflect the strain-rate and temperature dependent processes of solid-state deformation and decompression melting within the Earth. Most models of this rifting have treated tectonism and magmatism separately, and few numerical simulations have attempted to include continental break-up and melting, let alone describe how continental rifting evolves into seafloor spreading. Models of this evolution conventionally juxtapose continental and oceanic crust. Here we present observations that support the existence of a zone of exhumed continental mantle, several tens of kilometres wide, between oceanic and continental crust on continental margins where magma-poor rifting has taken place. We present geophysical and geological observations from the west Iberia margin, and geological mapping of margins of the former Tethys ocean now exposed in the Alps. We use these complementary findings to propose a conceptual model that focuses on the final stage of continental extension and break-up, and the creation of a zone of exhumed continental mantle that evolves oceanward into seafloor spreading. We conclude that the evolving stress and thermal fields are constrained by a rising and narrowing ridge of asthenospheric mantle, and that magmatism and rates of extension systematically increase oceanward.

### Promoting convergence and closing gaps: a blueprint for the revision of the European union tobacco tax directive [^e826fd45]. Tobacco Control (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and aims

Despite the European Union (EU) Tobacco Tax Directive (TTD), a lack of convergence in EU tobacco prices promotes high levels of cross-border shopping and down-trading from factory-made (FM) to roll-your-own tobacco (RYO) cigarettes. This study presents a blueprint for reform, whereby minimum taxes are related to the overall price level in the EU and where taxation of RYO is related to that of FM.

Methods

Longitudinal data on prices and taxes on FM and RYO in 25 member states over 2011–2019 are used to estimate econometric models for their weighted average prices as a function of taxes. Two scenarios are simulated with the models' estimates: a baseline scenario for the actual tax stance pertaining to 2020 and a reform scenario implementing the blueprint.

Results

The baseline results show that, while the prices of both products have experienced a slight increase since 2016 in real terms, the dispersion in the prices of FM across countries has increased and the difference in the prices of RYO within countries has widened. The results for the reform scenario show dispersion would diminish both EU-wide and in hotspots for cross-border sales of FM. The reform would also lead to a substantial reduction in the price gap between FM and RYO.

Conclusion

To promote price convergence and close the price gap between FM and RYO, the revised TTD should ensure minimum FM taxes track a measure of their average EU price, and RYO taxes are related to FM taxes.

### Improving access to medicines: lessons from 10 years of drug reforms in China, 2009–2020 [^ce671cfd]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Lessons for other countries

Regardless of the differences in health systems, there are several good practices from China's drug reforms that can be beneficial for other countries that plan to start or have started their drug reforms.

China's drug reform in the past decade has been closely linked to the overall health system reform and indeed is an integral part of the health reform. It has many advantages: drug reform can serve the goals of the overall health system reform, while other sectors, interacted with drug reform, also provided sufficient support for drug reform. In this way, drug reform can receive adequate resources, political commitment as well as good coordination with other sectors of the health system. For example, the insurance has become the largest purchaser in China's health market. Therefore, the drug reform has taken the advantage of the negotiation power of health insurance, using the listing of NRDL and procurement to secure a reasonable price of drugs for the Chinese population. Another example is the interaction between 'zero mark-up policy' and the public hospital reform. While the zero mark-up policy aimed to remove the mark-ups of drugs, the public hospital reform formed a new compensation mechanism for the hospitals.

China adopted a systemic approach that aligned multiple policy levers including governance, regulation and financing. NLPPM was amended in 2019 to provide powerful legal support for 'AMA'. The establishment of NHSA created the largest health service purchaser to determine coordinated decisions for insurance listing and procurement. The introduction of BA provides critical foundation for the pricing and procurement reform. The implementation of the zero mark-up policy also involved multiple levers, including the financing reforms for hospitals and health providers, and the supply and distribution management (the dual invoice). Additionally, the interactions among the drug value chains should not be neglected.

China's drug reform has tailored strategies to achieve a wide range of goals. The NEMP aimed to ensure the access to, quality and affordability of the most common drugs at primary health centres. The focus on essential medicines has been expanded through the classified pricing policy which has developed special strategies for different drugs. For those inadequate drugs, ensuring the supply was the core and designated manufacturing has been applied. The bulked procurement strategy has been used for drugs with high consumption to get a better price and efficiency in distribution. All these approaches highlighted China's strategy to develop different approaches to serve a variety of reform goals.

### Evidence-based health policy: three generations of reform in Mexico [^522ebac1]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

The Mexican health system has evolved through three generations of reform. The creation of the Ministry of Health and the main social security agency in 1943 marked the first generation of health reforms. In the late 1970s, a second generation of reforms was launched around the primary health-care model. Third-generation reforms favour systemic changes to reorganise the system through the horizontal integration of basic functions-stewardship, financing, and provision. The stability of leadership in the health sector is emphasised as a key element that allowed for reform during the past 60 years. Furthermore, there has been a transition in the second generation of reforms to a model that is increasingly based on evidence; this has been intensified and extended in the third generation of reforms. We also examine policy developments that will provide social protection in health for all. These developments could be of interest for countries seeking to provide their citizens with universal access to health care that incorporates equity, quality, and financial protection.

### Exploring motivated reasoning in polarization over the unfolding 2023 judicial reform in Israel [^38f8976b]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Comparisons between clusters

We compared clusters' pre-existing factors (i.e. psychological characteristics, identity, patriotism, and institutional trust), polarization, and motivated downstream consequences (Fig. 2). We found difference in pre-existing factors between the camps that might be differentially motivating. Pro-reform participants held stronger ethno-religious and civic identities than anti-reform participants. Notably, pro-reform participants held an especially strong ethno-religious identity (6.33 on a 7-point scale). Anti-reform (vs. pro-reform) participants expressed more constructive patriotism and less blind patriotism. They also indicated more trust in the judiciary and media, and less trust in the government and parliament than pro-reform participants. Extremity of one's view on the reform (i.e. issue-based polarization) was greater among anti-reform participants and they also perceived Israel as more polarized in general, as compared to pro-reform participants. There were also difference in downstream consequences; anti-reform participants simultaneously expressed greater support for conflict management and greater endorsement of extreme protest methods, but they supported extreme protest control methods less than pro-reform participants.

### The 2024 report of the Lancet countdown on health and climate change: facing record-breaking threats from delayed action [^e1c7b1b0]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Section 4: economics and finance

Climate change is profoundly affecting the global economy. Recent data suggest that the world economy is on track to an income reduction of 11–29% by 2050, threatening the social and economic systems on which human health and wellbeing often depend. The damages expected within the next 26 years vastly outweigh the mitigation costs required to limit global heating to 2°C (by a factor of six, according to a recent study). The health impacts of climate change contribute to economic losses, increase health system costs, limit labour productivity, and threaten important economic sectors, including tourism. The resulting deterioration of the socioeconomic conditions that support good health can aggravate health impacts and overburden the most vulnerable countries, widening global inequities.

A swift and just transition to a net zero greenhouse gas economy is, therefore, crucial to limit economic and health-related losses and damages but requires profound structural and economic changes and substantial capital investment. Years of delay in delivering the $100 billion promised annually to support the most vulnerable countries in a just transition have hampered progress and further exacerbated global inequities.

COP28 saw the long-awaited operationalisation of the Loss and Damage fund, an important milestone for a just transition; additionally, $1 billion was committed to climate change and health. Details on how these funds will be disbursed and who will contribute to the Loss and Damage fund will be negotiated at COP29. COP29 will also be the stage for the negotiation of the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance, setting a new financial goal for supporting countries classified as developing in the context of UNFCCC, in excess of $100 billion.

This section is presented with a new structure, to better reflect the different dimensions of these policy processes. The first set of indicators tracks the economic losses and damages associated with the health impacts of climate change; the second set monitors the extent to which countries are delivering a just, health-promoting restructuring of their economies; and the third set monitors the shift of financial systems away from fossil fuels and towards a health-supporting economy. This year, two new indicators highlight countries' preparedness for such a transition and call out potential losses through stranded assets.

4.1 The economic impact of climate change and its mitigation

As the impacts of climate change grow, so do the associated economic losses. This set of indicators monitors the economic losses resulting from the health impacts of climate change.

### Five years from now, who will be setting the global health agenda? [^6f4477d8]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Initial progress

Power is very much about money. One of the most important ways we are living into shared leadership is by putting major funding decisions into the hands of a wider group of leaders. To date, decisions for allocating nearly $34 million have been made by various committees representing the Ipas executive team, country directors and senior staff. We now ensure that a majority of the participants are in the countries where we work and not from Ipas USA. They are charged with developing criteria for making decisions on the specific allocations involved, and doing so in a transparent, inclusive and fair manner. They also share the criteria and decisions with all staff.

Power is also about people. In filling staff positions, we are taking geography out of the equation. 'Open to all Ipas staff, globally' is a phrase now seen regularly in job announcements internally. Applicants outside the USA are encouraged to apply for jobs that historically have been housed in the USA and can remain in the country where they currently live. This is creating change. For the first time, our global fundraising efforts are led by a director of development based outside the USA. Several other positions traditionally based in the USA, including the director of quality care, and some of our finance, human resources and communications staff, are also now based in other countries. And in January 2022, the chair of the Ipas Board of Directors will for the first time in Ipas's history be based in a country where we work outside of the USA.

### Health care reform 2009–2010: a neurosurgeon's perspective [^34307868]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Organized neurosurgery through its Washington Committee developed a number of principles against which all health care reform legislation was measured, and none of the bills were acceptable. The American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons (AANS/CNS) worked through multiple venues to modify or reject the legislation. In the author's view, the American Medical Association (AMA) supported the bills because its board of trustees was too focused on eliminating the sustainable growth rate, or SGR. Physicians failed to shape the health care debate. The leadership of many medical organizations was not prepared for the debate. Many had no experience in this arena and thus were too willing to let lobbyists dictate their position. In the future there are 3 things organized neurosurgery must do: be prepared, never give in, and stick with their principles. Organized neurosurgery must be prepared by developing leaders that have experience in the full spectrum of organized medicine. Neurosurgeons must not count on others, and because the specialty is small all must be involved. Neurosurgeons must never give in. Organized neurosurgery started 2009 with little support for its positions but by the end of the debate had convinced many other organizations, representing almost 500,000 physicians, to take their position. From an organizational point of view, neurosurgeons should now do 3 things: 1) reform or reject the AMA; 2) develop a real surgical coalition; and 3) change the current political environment. Neurosurgeons must also follow their principles. In the author's opinion the most important principles are: health care as a responsibility, medical liability reform, and the right to privately contract. In the United Kingdom and Germany, where health care is considered a right rather than a responsibility, bureaucratic entities determine whether you have the right to health care just as the Independent Payment Advisory Board, established under the new health care reform law in the US, will soon limit by rationing of health care under the guise of cutting costs. If, however, health care is a responsibility not a right, the obligation is shifted from society to the individual. It puts the patient and the doctor in charge. It is a far better mechanism to control costs and preserve quality without rationing. It becomes our obligation to have health care, and it puts us in charge of our destiny. Proven liability reform was not included in the health care legislation despite the fact that up to $200 billion per year is spent on defensive medicine. Another and possibly the most important principle ignored in the legislation is the right for a patient and his/her physician to privately contract under Medicare without penalty.

### Nationwide seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and identification of risk factors in the general population of the Netherlands during the first epidemic wave [^ccd4e200]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Seroprevalence was highest in adults aged 18–39 years, which is in line with the serosurvey among blood donors in the Netherlands, but contrary to the low incidence rate as reported in Dutch surveillance, caused by restrictive testing of risk groups and healthcare workers at the beginning of the epidemic, primarily identifying severe cases. The elevation in these younger adults may be explained by increased social contacts typical for this age group, in addition to specific social activities in February, such as skiing holidays in the Alps (from where the virus disseminated quickly across Europe), or carnival festivities in the Netherlands (ie, multiple superspreading events primarily in the mid and Southern part, explaining local elevation in seroprevalence). In correspondence with other nationwide studiesand reports from the Dutch government, seroprevalence was lowest in children. Although some rare events of paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome have been reported, this group seems to be at decreased risk for developing (severe) COVID-19 in general, which may be explained by less severe infection possibly resulting in a limited humoral response. Further, significantly higher odds for seropositivity were seen in Orthodox-Reformed Protestants. This community lives socio-geographically clustered in the Netherlands, that is, work, school, leisure and church are intertwined heavily. As observed in other countries, particularly frequent attendance of church with close distance to others, including singing activities, might have fuelled the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within this community in the beginning of the epidemic. Whereas the comorbidities with possible increased risk of severe COVID-19 were not associated with seropositivity in this study, immunosuppressants use did display higher odds (note: we did not have information of specific drugs). Recent data indicate that immunosuppressive treatment is not associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes, yet continued surveillance is warranted as these patients might be more prone to (future) infection, for instance due to a possible attenuated humoral immune response.

### Institutionalising an evidence-informed approach to guideline development: progress and challenges at the World Health Organization [^510ca53d]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Results

WHO's guideline development reforms represented a transformational shift in its approach to producing clinical and public health recommendations

It was widely recognised among WHO interviewees that earlier criticisms of WHO's old guideline development process were appropriate and that reforms were needed due to the widespread reliance on expert opinion and ad hoc processes rather than structured processes informed by synthesised research evidence. For example, according to one WHO interviewee:

… it was felt that this is just a bunch of expert opinions that is coming together. Who you happen to pick on that committee was going to define what the outcome was going to be. It was felt that WHO was handpicking and forcing themselves to a particular outcome that a small group of people at WHO wanted. (WHO Interviewee 9)

The consistent use of systematic reviews was described to be "the major change introduced with the guideline process", with the aim being to "stop WHO relying only on expert opinion" (WHO Interviewee 16). The reformed guideline development process was described to represent a transformational shift in how WHO developed clinical and public health recommendations, with one interviewee arguing that "how things are being done now is totally different from ten years ago" (WHO Interviewee 22). It was felt that the reforms overall had improved the quality of WHO's recommendations:

Yeah, it is a long process that costs time and money because you have to commission the systematic reviews which take time. But then, at the end, you have a document and no one can come and tell you, 'OK, why this?' because you have the evidence, you can show the evidence supports the recommendations. I think that is a good thing for WHO. (WHO Interviewee 18)

### Stopping murder by medicine: introducing the model law on medicine crime [^f673d671]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2015). Low credibility.

However, for the public health community to achieve a meaningful success, it must avoid the mistakes that have thwarted others. Within the last decade, the UNODC and the CoE also developed model legislation, but did so with such secrecy and conflict of interest that they poisoned the outcome: both settled on legal texts that broadened the enforcement of pharmaceutical intellectual property rights, probably because they invited a single French pharmaceutical company (Sanofi, Paris, France) and its nongovernmental organization (NGO) offshoot (called the International Institute of Research Against Counterfeit Medicines, or IRACM) into their drafting processes, which they conducted behind closed doors and with scant representation from developing country officials or health professionals such as doctors, nurses, or pharmacists.–Without expert inputs like these, the UNODC and CoE legal texts made foolish mistakes, such as to permit seizing generic medicines while in transit and to criminalize scientists and health care workers who use using placebos in clinical research. Outcomes like these understandably inflame developing countries, and even led Brazil, China, India, Russia, and South Africa to file formal diplomatic protests. Because the public health community can work in a more transparent, inclusive fashion, it can have a better outcome.

Medicine crime causes iatrogenic injury to patients, which makes it intolerable. I suggest that the public health community should fight it through a sustained campaign by its professional associations: for example, national associations of public health or medicine, and their global affiliates such as the World Federation of Public Health Associations, the International Pharmacists Federation, the International Council of Nurses, and the World Medical Association. These organizations have already been outspoken against medicine crime, although none of them have yet lobbied for law reform. Yet, history teaches that law reform is the obvious next step when translating research into action for health protection, just it was for tobacco. This Model Law is offered as a guide, in the hope that a similar victory can be achieved for the sake of all patients who depend on medicines for their well-being.

### Pathology subspecialty fellowship application reform, 2007–2010 [^988f9fa0]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

The specialty of pathology and laboratory medicine has entered a phase in which the 4-year sequence of residency training is almost universally followed by 1 or more years of subspecialty fellowship training. Such training may occur in an American Board of Pathology-recognized subspecialty or any number of "subspecialty fellowships" that do not lead to subspecialty board certification. Unlike the application process for first-year pathology residency, which is run through the National Resident Matching Program, applications for subspecialty pathology fellowships have no consistent coordination. Responding to widespread dissatisfaction voiced in 2007 by national pathology resident organizations, the Association of Pathology Chairs began evaluation and potential intervention in the fellowship application process. After 3 years of effort, the Council of the Association of Pathology Chairs has recommended implementation of a pathology subspecialty fellowship matching program starting in the 2011–2012 recruiting year for applicants matriculating in fellowship programs in July 2013. We report on the data that informed this decision and discuss the pros and cons that are so keenly felt by the stakeholders in this as-yet-incomplete reform process.

### Health and health-care systems in southeast Asia: diversity and transitions [^ddb8427c]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Southeast Asia is a region of enormous social, economic, and political diversity, both across and within countries, shaped by its history, geography, and position as a major crossroad of trade and the movement of goods and services. These factors have not only contributed to the disparate health status of the region's diverse populations, but also to the diverse nature of its health systems, which are at varying stages of evolution. Rapid but inequitable socioeconomic development, coupled with differing rates of demographic and epidemiological transitions, have accentuated health disparities and posed great public health challenges for national health systems, particularly the control of emerging infectious diseases and the rise of non-communicable diseases within ageing populations. While novel forms of health care are evolving in the region, such as corporatised public health-care systems (government owned, but operating according to corporate principles and with private-sector participation) and financing mechanisms to achieve universal coverage, there are key lessons for health reforms and decentralisation. New challenges have emerged with rising trade in health services, migration of the health workforce, and medical tourism. Juxtaposed between the emerging giant economies of China and India, countries of the region are attempting to forge a common regional identity, despite their diversity, to seek mutually acceptable and effective solutions to key regional health challenges. In this first paper in the Lancet Series on health in southeast Asia, we present an overview of key demographic and epidemiological changes in the region, explore challenges facing health systems, and draw attention to the potential for regional collaboration in health.

### 2020 American Heart Association and American college of cardiology consensus conference on professionalism and ethics: a consensus conference report [^984c846e]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Recognition of inequities and initial steps — accountability statements specify that the existence and perpetuation of bias and structural racial, ethnic, sex, and other inequities throughout the cardiovascular community must be recognized and acknowledged as a problem, and change must be embraced and incentivized as vital to mission, and the Association of American Medical Colleges recommends three essential initial steps: appreciate the historical context and true impact of exclusionary practices on current-day institutions; refuse to blame individuals for these inequities but rather look to the failure of institutional support; and recognize the importance of intentionality and deconstruction of structures, governance, policies, practices, and embedded norms and values that sustain inequities.

### Promoting convergence and closing gaps: a blueprint for the revision of the European union tobacco tax directive [^34feb40b]. Tobacco Control (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Despite the European Union (EU) Tobacco Tax Directive (TTD), a lack of convergence in EU tobacco prices promotes high levels of cross-border shopping and down-trading from factory-made (FM) to roll-your-own tobacco (RYO) cigarettes. This study presents a blueprint for reform, whereby minimum taxes are related to the overall price level in the EU and where taxation of RYO is related to that of FM.

Methods

Longitudinal data on prices and taxes on FM and RYO in 25 member states over 2011–2019 are used to estimate econometric models for their weighted average prices as a function of taxes. Two scenarios are simulated with the models' estimates: a baseline scenario for the actual tax stance pertaining to 2020 and a reform scenario implementing the blueprint.

Results

The baseline results show that, while the prices of both products have experienced a slight increase since 2016 in real terms, the dispersion in the prices of FM across countries has increased and the difference in the prices of RYO within countries has widened. The results for the reform scenario show dispersion would diminish both EU-wide and in hotspots for cross-border sales of FM. The reform would also lead to a substantial reduction in the price gap between FM and RYO.

Conclusion

To promote price convergence and close the price gap between FM and RYO, the revised TTD should ensure minimum FM taxes track a measure of their average EU price, and RYO taxes are related to FM taxes.

Quantile regressions of Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) and ACE over the continental United States (USACE) with year.

a Trend in days year −1 for Atlantic ACE 1st–99th percentile threshold dates between 1979–2020. Light, medium, and dark blue shading designate 99%, 95%, and 90% confidence intervals. b Trend in days year −1 of 1st percentile threshold dates of ACE for starting years 1950–1990 and ending year 2020. Shading as in Fig. 1a. c As in Fig. 1b, with USACE and starting years 1900–1990. Light, medium, and dark red shading designate 99%, 95% and 90% confidence intervals (CI).

Although trend detection can be sensitive to timeseries length, shifts in season onset are robust across variations in initial year of the quantile regression. Changing the start year and fixing the end year at 2020, Atlantic ACE 1st percentile threshold date trends earlier at a rate of 0.15–0.5 days year −1 for starting years 1950–1965, and 0.5–1.0 days year −1 (p < 0.05) for start years 1965–1987 (Fig. 1b). Results are substantially similar when excluding short-lived TCs, with trends of 0.5–1.5 days earlier year −1 (p < 0.05) for starting years after 1970 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Trends are significant for USACE 1st percentile threshold date for all windows, shifting 0.2–0.75 days year −1 earlier (p < 0.05) for 1900–1969 start years, increasing to 0.75–2.0 days year −1 earlier (p < 0.01) for 1970–1990 (Fig. 1c) start years.

### Exposure to natural hazard events unassociated with policy change for improved disaster risk reduction [^77717c14]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Estimation of change in hazard frequency and severity

To ensure comparability between countries, frequency and the three severity measures were normalized for each country by dividing the averages in 2007–2011 (period t 1, Supplementary Fig. 1) with long-term averages over four alternate baseline periods: 40 years (from 1970 to 2011), 30 years (1980–2011), 20 years (1990–2011), and 10 years (2000–2011). For example, in the baseline period of 40 years, the normalized hazard measures are indicated as Ê 40y, Â 40y, andfor event frequency, fatalities, affected, and economic losses, respectively (Figs. 1 and 2). One common approach is to use normalized gross domestic product to normalize country-level economic losses and population to normalize fatalities and affected people. This approach, however, would not make the results comparable since events in some countries are normally more damaging than events in other countries. Thus this normalization approach could not capture the exceptionality of events that, according to the disaster reform hypothesis, are assumed to trigger policy change.

We, therefore, applied an alternative approach, which considers the frequency and severity of natural hazards relative to each country's long-term averages. Our study, thus, recognizes that hazard impacts are context dependent, i.e. that the frequency and severity of events are relative to the historical experience of each individual country. For example, normalized hazard measures > 1 indicate that countries in the 2007–2011 period experienced more severe and/or more frequent hazards than average over the baseline period. Utilizing this approach, we analyzed the data in relation to four baselines periods as benchmarks to test the sensitivity of the statistical results for different hazard events occurring in a period spanning four decades. Figure 2 compares results across all four baselines to discern potential effects from using different time periods that normalize each measure. In other parts of the study (Figs. 1 and 3), we present results based on the 30-year baseline, which represents a reasonable compromise between excluding older events data with potential reliability issuesand ensuring a sufficiently large sample of historical events.

### Towards universal health coverage: lessons from 10 years of healthcare reform in China [^d823c0af]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

The 2012–2015 phase

The second phase of healthcare reform, China's '12th Five-Year Plan', continued in the same general direction. The reforms were promoted and deepened during this period, and clarified three tasks: (1) basic health insurance for all; (2) consolidation and improvement of the essential drug system; and (3) reform of public hospitals. The focus of reform gradually shifted from primary care to the public hospitals, especially county public hospitals. The county public hospitals lead the reform of public hospitals through subsidising medical services with profit from drug sales, and comprehensively promoting the reform of the management system, compensation mechanism, personnel distribution, procurement mechanism and price mechanism.

The 2016–2020 phase

Following the reform tasks specified at the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the CPC in 2013, the '13th Five-Year Plan on deepening the health care system reform' marked the beginning of the third phase, a comprehensive drive for deeper reform. The reform of this phase focuses on the transitions from: (1) laying a solid foundation to improving quality; (2) framework formation to system construction; and (3) single-area breakthroughs to system integration and comprehensive promotion. 'Tripartite System Reform (TSR)', which refers to the linkage reform of the medical care, medical insurance and pharmaceutical industry, became the basic principle for comprehensively deepening the healthcare reform. It is noteworthy that this phase of reform is guided by the 'Healthy China 2030' strategy, which emphasises ensuring population health for all individuals across the life course and integrated Health in All Policies.

Figure 2 illustrates the priorities and relationship among the three healthcare reform plans.

Key events and changes during the evolution of WHO's guideline development process.

Box 1
Key features of WHO's guideline development process*

It is now over 10 years since WHO implemented its guideline development reforms. Previous studies of WHO's guidelines have focused on the outputs of guideline development processes, including assessing the quality of the evidence underlying recommendations, identifying explanations for issuing discordant recommendationsand identifying challenges with implementing the GRADE approach. Only one study, published 5 years ago, focused on examining the views and perceptions of WHO staff about the reforms. That study identified mixed views about whether WHO needed a single quality assurance mechanism, and uncertainties and lack of capacity among staff in applying the GRADE approach, concluding that quality assurance standards set by the GRC were yet to be fully embedded within the agency. This study builds on previous studies and was conducted as part of a larger research project examining the design and effectiveness of WHO's scientific advisory committees. Specifically, the research objectives of this study were to investigate WHO staff's experience with, perceptions of and views about the changes brought by WHO's guideline development reforms, the progress and impact of these reforms to date, and key challenges that need to be addressed.

### Setbacks in the quest for universal health coverage in Mexico: polarised politics, policy upheaval, and pandemic disruption [^2bf5dc7c]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

2023 marks the 20-year anniversary of the creation of Mexico's System of Social Protection for Health and the Seguro Popular, a model for the global quest to achieve universal health coverage through health system reform. We analyse the success and challenges after 2012, the consequences of reform ageing, and the unique coincidence of systemic reorganisation during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify strategies for health system disaster preparedness. We document that population health and financial protection improved as the Seguro Popular aged, despite erosion of the budget and absent needed reforms. The Seguro Popular closed in January, 2020, and Mexico embarked on a complex, extensive health system reorganisation. We posit that dismantling the Seguro Popular while trying to establish a new programme in 2020–21 made the Mexican health system more vulnerable in the worst pandemic period and shows the precariousness of evidence-based policy making to political polarisation and populism. Reforms should be designed to be flexible yet insulated from political volatility and constructed and managed to be structurally permeable and adaptable to new evidence to face changing health needs. Simultaneously, health systems should be grounded to withstand systemic shocks of politics and natural disasters.

### Psychiatric reform revisited [^dda20e78]. World Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

The trend towards the establishment of community psychiatric services seems to be universal. However, before closing down a mental hospital, it is necessary to establish the appropriate alternative facilities in the community. Every de-institutionalization program should have a diachronic component, and cultural issues should be taken into consideration. Care for each patient has to be decided upon on the basis of the characteristics of that patient. Finally, de-institutionalization is just one aspect of psychiatric reform. Primary psychiatric prevention is equally or even more important.

### Beyond political will: unpacking the drivers of (non) health reforms in sub-saharan Africa [^a4ddc6e3]. BMJ Global Health (2022). High credibility.

Background

Lack of political will is frequently invoked as a rhetorical tool to explain the gap between commitment and action for health reforms in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, the concept remains vague, ill defined and risks being used as a scapegoat to actually examine what shapes reforms in a given context, and what to do about it. This study sought to go beyond the rhetoric of political will to gain a deeper understanding of what drives health reforms in SSA.

Methods

We conducted a scoping review using Arksey and O'Malley (2005) to understand the drivers of health reforms in SSA.

Results

We reviewed 84 published papers that focused on the politics of health reforms in SSA covering the period 2002–2022. Out of these, more than half of the papers covered aspects related to health financing, HIV/AIDS and maternal health with a dominant focus on policy agenda setting and formulation. We found that health reforms in SSA are influenced by six; often interconnected drivers namely (1) the distribution of costs and benefits arising from policy reforms; (2) the form and expression of power among actors; (3) the desire to win or stay in government; (4) political ideologies; (5) elite interests and (6) policy diffusion.

Conclusion

Political will is relevant but insufficient to drive health reform in SSA. A framework of differential reform politics that considers how the power and beliefs of policy elites is likely to shape policies within a given context can be useful in guiding future policy analysis.

### Exploring motivated reasoning in polarization over the unfolding 2023 judicial reform in Israel [^f39e626e]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Downstream consequences

We fitted linear models controlling for demographic characteristics as in previous analyses. Following an Exploratory Factor Analysis (see Supplementary Methods 4 in SI), we focused on four immediate downstream consequences of polarization. The results are presented in Table 4. As we already reported effects of cluster on downstream consequences when answering Q2 above, we do not reiterate them here.

Table 4
Predicting downstream consequences of polarization: Protest methods, protest control, conflict management strategies, and delegitimization of political opponents

Note. The analyses included N = 488 complete observations. Significant main effects are bolded unless the interaction term is significant. Significant simple slopes are bloded if the interaction is significant.

Protest methods

Perceived polarization was associated with greater endorsement of extreme protest methods across clusters. Issue-based polarization interacted with cluster. Supporting the notion that endorsement of extreme protest methods might reflect motivated reasoning, among anti-reform participants (whose camp consistently protested the reform), the more extreme their views were, the more they endorsed protest methods. For pro-reform participants, the more extreme their views were, the less they endorsed protest methods.

Protest control

Issue-based and affective polarization interacted with cluster. Supporting the notion that endorsement of extreme protest control might be motivated, for anti-reform participants, the more extreme their views on the reform were, the less they endorsed protest control. For pro-reform participants, the more extreme their views were and the more negatively they felt about the anti-reform camp, the more they endorsed protest control.

Conflict management strategies

Issue-based and affective polarization were associated with less favorable views of conflict management strategies across clusters. Interactions with cluster were not significant.

Delegitimization of political opponents

Issue-based and affective polarization were associated with greater delegitimization. Perceived societal polarization interacted with cluster. For the anti-reform cluster, the more participants perceived society as polarized, the more they delegitimized their political opponents.

### SHEA position statement on pandemic preparedness for policymakers: introduction and overview [^0a7c6139]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

SHEA position statement — background on pandemic preparedness describes how the COVID-19 pandemic exposed pre-existing problems within the US healthcare system, including lack of capacity to manage a large influx of contagious patients while maintaining routine and emergency care to non-COVID patients, a "just in time" supply network causing shortages and competition for essential supplies, and longstanding inequities in the distribution of healthcare and the healthcare workforce. It notes that a decades-long shift to global supply chains compounded gaps in preparedness for supplies such as personal protective equipment and ventilators, and that inequities in racial and socioeconomic outcomes accelerated the call to focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion. The text adds that the pandemic accelerated cooperation between government entities and the healthcare system with swift implementation of mitigation measures, new therapies and vaccinations despite a fragmented system and political divisions, yet misinformation and political divisions continue to prevent a strong and coordinated response. It concludes that rising microbial resistance, emerging or re-emerging pathogens, increasing globalization, an aging population, and climate change increase the likelihood of another pandemic.

### ACR-ASNR-SPR practice parameter for the performance of computed tomography (CT) of the extracranial head and neck [^e6103874]. ACR/ASNR/SPR (2021). High credibility.

Sinus CT — acquisition, reformations, and contrast indications are specified as follows: With a multidetector CT, axial images are most commonly performed parallel to the hard palate, and the scanned volume should be from above the top of the frontal sinus and continue inferiorly through the maxillary teeth. Routine axial, sagittal, and/or coronal reformations should be reconstructed; coronal reformations are performed perpendicular to the plane of the hard palate from the nasal vestibule to the sella, and sagittal reformations are performed perpendicular to the plane of the hard palate through the maxillary sinuses. Contrast is not recommended for evaluating facial trauma or for routine evaluation of patients with uncomplicated sinusitis. IV contrast should be used to evaluate neoplasms, and IV contrast is also indicated to evaluate patients with complicated sinusitis as indicated by proptosis, periorbital or facial swelling, or other signs suspicious of intracranial or orbital extension. Considerations should be given to specific acquisition parameters required for image use in surgical navigation.

In biophysical terms, humanity has never been moving faster nor further from sustainability than it is now. Our increasing population size and per capita impacts are severely testing the ability of Earth to provide for peoples' most basic needs. Awareness of these circumstances has grown tremendously, as has the sophistication of efforts to address them. But the complexity of the challenge remains daunting. We explore prospects for transformative change in three critical areas of sustainable development: achieving a sustainable population size and securing vital natural capital, both in part through reducing inequity, and strengthening the societal leadership of academia.

### Health systems changes after decentralisation: progress, challenges and dynamics in Pakistan [^57beb30b]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Leadership support, capacity and federal–provincial coordination

Proliferation in health systems initiatives post devolution has been driven by strong support by provincial governments and the civil bureaucracy. At the same time, key factors need to be understood that have constrained effective translation.

The provinces had a disadvantaged start in terms of technical capability as the past context of federally dominated political, fiscal, administrative power stunted the maturity of provincial administrative structures. Strong political support for devolution and visible ownership of health in all four provinces led to increased resourcing of health from government budget, push for provincial planning and monitoring, as well as support for regulation, contracting and other governance initiatives to circumvent slow-moving government systems to deliver results. At the same time, the loosening of federal verticality made the provinces vulnerable to interference by provincial political elites. Political pressure for visible health infrastructure projects, specialty schemes, recruitment of local constituents and instances of favoured appointments was seen in all provinces, often derailing health sector strategies. Provinces where health ministries had strong executive backing were better able to withstand political pressures than those that were not closely aligned to provincial leadership. Trained human resource and lack of support systems has blunted progress of sector strategies despite an appetite for health reforms. Frequent change in health secretaries in all provinces further interrupted the momentum of progress.

### Health care reform 2010: a fresh view on tort reform [^8d1d3131]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

We reviewed the state of medical malpractice tort reform in the context of a new political climate and the current debate over comprehensive health care reform. Specifically we asked whether medical malpractice tort reform is necessary, and evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of contemporary reform proposals.

Materials and Methods

The medical, legal and public policy literature related to medical malpractice tort reform was reviewed and synthesized. We include a primer for understanding the current structure of medical malpractice law, identify the goals of the current system and analyze whether these goals are presently being met. Finally, we describe and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the current reform proposals including caps on damages, safe harbors and health care courts.

Results

Medical malpractice tort law is designed to improve health care quality and appropriately compensate patients for medical malpractice injuries, but is failing on both fronts. Of the 3 proposed remedies, caps on damages do little to advance the quality and compensatory goals, while safe harbors and health care courts represent important advancements in tort reform.

Conclusions

Tort reform should be included in the current health policy debate because the current medical malpractice system is not adequately achieving the basic goals of tort law. While safe harbors and health care courts both represent reasonable remedies, health care courts may be preferred because they do not rely on jury determination in the absence of strong medical evidence.

### Acute hospital use in older adults following the 2015 Dutch reform of long-term care: an interrupted time series analysis [^03c7eccd]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2023). High credibility.

Sensitivity analyses

Complete registration of hospital data was mandatory for all Dutch hospitals as of Jan 1, 2013, and therefore data are considered stable over time with no missing data. Before 2013, full registration of hospital data was not mandatory; however, most hospitals participated. Missing data could be a specific hospital, specific treatment, underreporting in a specific month, or random (the number of missing records varies between 1% and 23% within specific months). To ensure the missing data did not unduly influence our results we performed a sensitivity analysis addressing the effect of the missing hospital data from 2009 to 2012. We did this analysis by comparing the outcomes of the fully adjusted models based on all study data (2009–18) to those based on the data from years with no missing data (2013–18). Furthermore, we used the Supremum Wald test with symmetric trimming of 15% to identify whether the coefficients in the time-series regression vary over the periods defined by an unknown break date other than our pre-specified break of Jan 1, 2015: the start of the Dutch LTC reform. Additionally, we tested whether the coefficients in the time series varied over the study period defined by other health-care reforms implemented (ie, abolishment of residential care for people with low care needs in 2013 and Outline Agreement Medical Specialist Care 2018), as known break dates. Lastly, the health-care system and people with LTC needs could have adjusted to the Dutch 2015 LTC reform policy changes after a period of time. To test this question, we performed a lagged time series model, omitting the data of the year 2015 (first year post-reform), as sensitivity analysis to detect any potential effect of the maturing of service following reform.

Indicator 3.1.1: carbon intensity of the energy system

Energy systems remain the largest single source of greenhouse gas emissions. Using data from the International Energy Agency (IEA), this indicator shows that while Europe is making some progress towards achieving net-zero emissions, its current trajectory is consistent with achieving carbon neutrality only by 2100 (appendix 4 pp 131–32). To meet the recommendations of the latest IPCC report of net-zero by 2040, emissions from Europe's energy system are required to fall at around three times the current rate (based on the trend since 2006). This reduction will need to happen even faster if fair-share emissions — taking Europe's population and historical emissions into account — are used to allocate the reductions globally. After an 8·6% reduction in 2020, emissions from fossil fuel combustion had a substantial rebound, surging by 7·1% in 2021, to 3·4 billion tonnes (Gt) of CO 2 per year (5·4 tCO 2 per person) — six times higher than African per-person emissions (0·9 tCO 2), 2·7 times higher than Central and South American emissions (2·0 tCO 2), but 2·6 times less than US per person emissions (13·8 tCO 2). Some countries, such as France and the UK, saw increases of around 10%, in contrast to Finland and Greece where increases were less than 1%. Despite the Russian invasion of Ukraine fuelling an energy crisis, European natural gas prices returned to pre-invasion levels in 2021, reducing the short-term pressures to shift to alternative fuel sources.

Indicator 3.1.2: coal phase-out

In 2021, coal use increased to 13% of Europe's total energy supply compared with 12% in 2020 (appendix 4 pp 133–34), according to IEA data. After two consecutive years of annual reductions, coal use rebounded due to increased use by Germany and Poland. This surge marked the highest growth rate in at least 40 years, underscoring a concerning trend in Europe's energy mix and is driven in part by the slowing of coal phase-out due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Growth in renewable energy deployment partly offset the anticipated resurgence of coal in 2022, but accelerated progress to phase out coal remains essential to meet Europe's climate targets and protect people from air pollution and its related morbidity and mortality.

### Considering socio-political framings when analyzing coastal climate change effects can prevent maldevelopment on small islands [^529702c6]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Selected questions and answer frequency from the population survey. See Supplementary Information File for the question type (open or closed question) as well as associated codes and coding rules.

First experiences with coastal infrastructure in the Maldives dates back to the 1970s, when the first modern coastal protection constructions were built on the islands. However, coastal protection management was not professionalized before 1987 and 1988 when strong coastal floods caused massive damage to the Maldives' capital Male' and on several other islands in the middle of the country (interview with representatives of the Ministry of Environment and Energy (MEE) in 2017). At the same time, establishing coastal protection in the Maldives was accompanied with a rapid increase in population, especially in the Maldives capital Male'. In accordance with the Maldives Decentralization Act in 2010, the national government shifted its focus onto regional development centers, equipped with the necessary infrastructureand limiting the migration to the capital. However, the interviewees still highlight today's accumulation of resources – economic and professional expertize – in Male'. Decisions are made at the highest level and have an impact down to the local scale. When regarding the implementation of coastal development projects in the Maldives, the planning, implementation and decision-making process are centrally executed and ministerially anchored in the national government without significant involvement of local capacities on the islands. According to actors involved in coastal governance, in general, such top-down processes in decision and implementation are applied for coastal infrastructure projects, for example seaports as well as coastal protection structures. Regional and local government institutions, such as the city council on Fuvahmulah, lack influencing power in the decision-making process. According to the interviewees, the role of local government institutions is limited to informing national-level actors about coastal problems on their island. The lack of power is also expressed by missing financial resources for coastal projects at a council-level (interview with a representative of a state environmental agency in 2017). In addition, infrastructure projects usually require external financial and knowledge resources, provided by international organizations. However, international organizations are legally bound to use the national government as an entry point and cannot initiate projects below the central national-level. Altogether, this stands in contrast to the republic's decentralization efforts and the corresponding strengthening of local communities.

### Weighing the evidence for expanding physician supply [^1a0701df]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

For 2 decades, health planners have forecasted impending physician surpluses, and policy decisions related to medical schools and residency programs have been based on such expectations. However, these much-heralded surpluses never materialized, and a growing body of data and opinion now point in the other direction. The question at the forefront is whether the United States is instead headed for a physician shortage. What is the evidence? This paper reviews the trends that link economic growth to health care spending and to the demand for physicians. It assesses the current environment by examining trends in the characteristics of clinical practice, signals from the medical market, and recent experiences of physician shortages in other English-speaking countries; it also discusses why past forecasting approaches may have failed. Taken together, this body of information indicates that physician shortages are emerging and that they will probably worsen over the next 2 decades. By 2020 or 2025, the deficit could be as great as 200,000 physicians — 20% of the needed workforce. If remedies are to be found, the nature of the problem must be appreciated, and a consensus to solve it must be reached.

### SCCT guidelines for the interpretation and reporting of coronary CT angiography: a report of the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography guidelines committee [^fc52ac0d]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2014). Medium credibility.

Coronary CT angiography interpretation — reconstruction formats and data retention notes that available reconstruction types include transaxial image stacks, multiplanar reformation (MPR), maximum intensity projection (MIP), curved multiplanar reformation (cMPR), and volume rendering technique (VRT); data are commonly acquired using retrospectively gated helical or prospectively triggered sequential modes, and because additional reconstructions may be needed, raw data files must be retained until interpretation is complete.
