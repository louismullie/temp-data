## Question

what are some specific oral medications for
diabetes type 1 and 2

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which specific oral medications are used for type 1 and type 2 diabetes, with examples and important safety considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology that drives treatment choices in type 1 versus type 2 diabetes. Then, I should verify the standard of care for type 1 diabetes and whether any oral agents have a role. Next, I will review first-line and add-on oral therapies for type 2 diabetes, including metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, DPP-4 inhibitors, and SGLT-2 inhibitors. After that, I need to check the status of GLP-1 receptor agonists, including oral semaglutide, and clarify their indication. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable answer with safety warnings and guideline alignment, making sure I double-check any exceptions or off-label considerations before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the foundational distinction. Type 1 diabetes is characterized by absent or near-absent beta-cell function, so exogenous insulin is mandatory from diagnosis, whereas type 2 diabetes reflects insulin resistance with progressive beta-cell dysfunction, which allows oral agents that target hepatic glucose production, insulin sensitivity, or glucose handling to be effective adjuncts to lifestyle therapy.

> Now, I should verify the standard of care for type 1 diabetes. The ADA 2025 Standards emphasize multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with analog insulins, supported by continuous glucose monitoring and comprehensive education on matching insulin to carbohydrates and activity; there is no role for oral agents as disease-modifying therapy in type 1 diabetes in current U.S. guidelines, and insulin remains the only approved pharmacologic mainstay [^115dH2RA] [^115jTP59].

> Wait, let me verify whether any oral agents are ever used in type 1 diabetes. I initially thought "none", but hold on, I should double-check adjunctive options. Pramlintide, an injectable amylin analog, is the only noninsulin adjunct with modest A1C and weight effects but notable hypoglycemia risk if insulin is not adjusted; metformin has been studied off-label and may reduce insulin dose and weight in selected patients, though glycemic effects are small and not sustained, and it is not approved for type 1 diabetes; GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors have shown modest benefits in trials but carry increased DKA risk and are not approved for type 1 diabetes in the U.S., with regulatory decisions reflecting safety concerns despite some international approvals for SGLT inhibitors in restricted type 1 populations [^116Y5yxx] [^114BEiqK] [^116BgPZv] [^113vJezQ] [^114p8hFG].

> Next, I should review first-line oral therapy for type 2 diabetes. Metformin remains the preferred initial agent due to durable A1C lowering, low hypoglycemia risk, weight neutrality or loss, favorable cardiovascular data, and low cost; dosing should start low and titrate to tolerance, typically to 2,000–2,550 mg/day depending on formulation, and metformin should be continued as long as tolerated and not contraindicated [^1158avd1] [^114CkQtd] [^117MTcKd] [^117H4U9h].

> I will now examine second-line oral options when metformin is insufficient. Sulfonylureas and meglitinides increase insulin secretion and lower A1C but carry hypoglycemia and weight gain risks; thiazolidinediones improve insulin sensitivity and are durable but can cause edema and heart failure exacerbation; DPP-4 inhibitors are modestly effective, weight neutral, and have low hypoglycemia risk; SGLT-2 inhibitors provide intermediate-to-high A1C lowering with weight and blood pressure benefits and robust cardiorenal protection, though eGFR thresholds and volume status must be considered [^114CkQtd] [^111YPr6n] [^1158avd1].

> Hold on, I should verify the status of GLP-1 receptor agonists, especially oral semaglutide. GLP-1 receptor agonists are highly effective for glycemia and weight and reduce cardiovascular events, but most are injectables; oral semaglutide is approved for type 2 diabetes and is not indicated for type 1 diabetes, aligning with the broader principle that incretin-based therapies are for type 2 diabetes rather than insulin-deficient type 1 diabetes [^111rf9t7] [^1158avd1].

> Let me synthesize the clinical implications clearly. For type 1 diabetes, oral glucose-lowering agents are not substitutes for insulin. Management centers on insulin with CGM and education, with pramlintide as a limited adjunct and metformin, GLP-1 RAs, and SGLT-2 inhibitors considered investigational or off-label with nontrivial safety concerns, particularly DKA risk for SGLT inhibitors in insulin-deficient states [^115dH2RA] [^116Y5yxx] [^117FgVQm]. For type 2 diabetes, metformin is first-line, followed by addition of sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, DPP-4 inhibitors, or SGLT-2 inhibitors based on patient-specific priorities such as hypoglycemia risk, weight goals, comorbid cardiovascular or kidney disease, and cost. GLP-1 receptor agonists, including oral semaglutide, are appropriate in type 2 diabetes and are often prioritized when weight loss or cardiorenal benefit is desired [^1158avd1] [^114CkQtd] [^111YPr6n] [^111rf9t7].

> But wait, what if someone with apparent type 2 diabetes is actually type 1, especially in adults? I need to ensure diagnostic accuracy because misclassification leads to inappropriate oral therapy and poor control; features like low BMI, ketosis-proneness, or islet autoantibodies should prompt reassessment, as adult-onset type 1 diabetes is frequently misdiagnosed as type 2 and requires insulin rather than oral agents [^116MBFwb] [^111gqxiw].

> Final check and concise answer: For type 1 diabetes, no oral agents are approved as disease-modifying therapy. Insulin is essential, with pramlintide as a limited injectable adjunct and metformin, GLP-1 RAs, and SGLT-2 inhibitors off-label and constrained by modest efficacy and meaningful safety concerns, especially DKA risk. For type 2 diabetes, metformin is the foundational oral first-line therapy, with sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, DPP-4 inhibitors, and SGLT-2 inhibitors as add-on options, and oral semaglutide available as a GLP-1 RA for type 2 diabetes. Selection should be individualized to glycemic needs, hypoglycemia risk, weight goals, comorbidities, and cost [^115dH2RA] [^116Y5yxx] [^1158avd1] [^114CkQtd] [^111rf9t7].

Oral medications are used for type 2 diabetes, whereas **type 1 diabetes requires insulin** because of absolute insulin deficiency. The main oral classes for type 2 diabetes are **metformin** (first-line) [^114CkQtd], sulfonylureas, meglitinides, thiazolidinediones, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT-2 inhibitors, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors [^114CkQtd] [^113N7YTz]. Metformin is preferred initially due to efficacy, safety, and low cost [^114yCGpj]; SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists are added for cardiovascular or renal benefit [^114CAaUz] [^117RJxxH]. For type 1 diabetes, **oral agents are not substitutes for insulin**; metformin or pramlintide may be used only as adjuncts in select cases [^114BEiqK] [^116Y5yxx].

## Oral medications for type 2 diabetes mellitus

Oral agents are a cornerstone of type 2 diabetes management [^1158avd1]; **metformin is first-line** unless contraindicated [^114CkQtd] [^112gSxmS]. Additional agents are selected based on glycemic targets, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^113nLXNe].

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Biguanides | Metformin | Decreases hepatic glucose production; improves insulin sensitivity | First-line; low hypoglycemia risk; weight neutral; contraindicated in significant renal impairment |
| Sulfonylureas | - Glipizide <br/> - Glyburide <br/> - Glimepiride | Stimulates insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells | Risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain; use cautiously in elderly |
| Meglitinides | - Repaglinide <br/> - Nateglinide | Rapid insulin secretagogues | Short-acting; lower hypoglycemia risk than sulfonylureas; take before meals |
| Thiazolidinediones | - Pioglitazone <br/> - Rosiglitazone | Improves insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues | Risk of weight gain, edema, heart failure; monitor liver function |
| DPP-4 inhibitors | - Sitagliptin <br/> - Saxagliptin <br/> - Linagliptin | Increases incretin levels, enhancing insulin secretion | Weight neutral; low hypoglycemia risk; modest A1c reduction |
| SGLT-2 inhibitors | - Canagliflozin <br/> - Dapagliflozin <br/> - Empagliflozin | Inhibits renal glucose reabsorption, increasing urinary glucose excretion | Weight loss, blood pressure reduction, cardiovascular and renal benefits; risk of genital infections, euglycemic DKA |
| Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors | - Acarbose <br/> - Miglitol | Delays carbohydrate absorption in the gut | Modest A1c reduction; gastrointestinal side effects |

---

Metformin is the **preferred initial therapy** [^114CkQtd] because of its efficacy, safety, and low cost [^114yCGpj]. SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists are recommended for patients with established cardiovascular or renal disease [^114CAaUz] [^117RJxxH] or at high cardiovascular risk [^114CAaUz].

## Oral medications for type 1 diabetes mellitus

Type 1 diabetes is characterized by absolute insulin deficiency [^113Fuftq]; **insulin is the mainstay of therapy** [^113Fuftq]. Oral agents are not substitutes for insulin but may be considered adjuncts in specific scenarios [^116Y5yxx].

- **Metformin**: May be considered as adjunctive therapy in overweight or obese patients with insulin resistance, but evidence for significant A1c reduction is limited [^112FFjW8] [^116BgPZv].
- **Pramlintide**: An injectable amylin analog approved as adjunct to insulin, modestly reducing A1c and weight but increasing hypoglycemia risk if insulin is not adjusted [^114BEiqK] [^116Y5yxx].
- **SGLT-2 inhibitors**: Not approved for type 1 diabetes due to increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) [^117FgVQm]; ongoing research explores risk mitigation strategies [^114dkrrt].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized therapy** [^113nLXNe] based on patient characteristics, comorbidities, and treatment goals [^113nLXNe]. Metformin remains first-line for type 2 diabetes [^114CkQtd], with early addition of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists for cardiovascular or renal benefits [^114CAaUz] [^117RJxxH]. For type 1 diabetes, insulin is essential [^113Fuftq], and oral agents are only considered adjuncts in select cases [^116Y5yxx].

---

Oral medications are central to type 2 diabetes management, with metformin as first-line therapy [^114CkQtd] and other classes added based on patient-specific factors [^113nLXNe]. In type 1 diabetes, **insulin is mandatory** [^113Fuftq], and oral agents are only adjuncts in specific scenarios [^116Y5yxx].

Background

Despite intensive insulin therapy, target hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) levels remain above 7.0% in many patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) with poor metabolic control. Standard insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes has been associated with increased complications including hypoglycemia, weight gain, and dyslipidemia. Insulin-stimulated skeletal muscle glucose uptake as well as insulin action reduces in type 1 diabetics. This effect contributes to the development of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance leads to poor glycemic control and chronic complications in type 1 diabetics. Metabolic syndrome is a clinical proxy for insulin resistance. Type 1 diabetes associated with metabolic syndrome has been termed as double diabetes. Obesity, lack of exercise, and puberty are primary causes of insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes. Management of insulin resistance usually requires an increase in insulin dose requirement. Increased insulin dose requirement might cause weight gain and hypoglycemia, which might lead to noncompliance with therapy and ultimately poor glycemic control.

Metformin is an oral anti-hyperglycemic agent and commonly used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It increases both hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity in the liver by inhibiting basal hepatic glucose production, as well as in skeletal muscles and adipocytes, by increasing glucose uptake. Thus, it enhances insulin action and improves glycemic control. Metformin leads to reduce insulin dose requirement as well as weight gain because it increases insulin sensitivity. In this respect, compared with insulin monotherapy, the addition of metformin to insulin therapy improves metabolic control and decreases complications in type 2 diabetes. Metformin has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity and reduce metabolic syndrome incidence in people with prediabetes. The addition of metformin to insulin therapy in type 1 DM is still under debate. Until now, a limited number of studies have investigated the addition of metformin to insulin therapy in type 1 diabetics. Metformin as an adjunctive therapy is not formally recommended in type 1 diabetes unlike in type 2 diabetes.

This retrospective study investigated the effect of adding metformin to pharmacologic insulin dosing in type 1 diabetics on insulin therapy 1 year after treatment compared with patients on insulin therapy alone. This study aimed to investigate the effect of metformin, as an adjunctive therapy, on the treatment of poorly controlled type 1 diabetics.

### Liraglutide for treating type 1 diabetes [^115ZPAun]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Many persons with type 1 diabetes do not achieve glycemic targets, why new treatments, complementary to insulin, are of interest. Liraglutide, a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist could be a potential pharmacological supplement to insulin. This review discusses the mechanism of actions, efficacy and safety of liraglutide as add-on to insulin in persons with type 1 diabetes.

Areas Covered

Physiological and clinical data on liraglutide in type 1 diabetes were reviewed. We searched the Cochrane library, MEDLINE and EMBASE, with the final search performed February 16, 2016.

Expert Opinion

Liraglutide as adjunct to insulin treatment reduced body weight and daily dose of insulin compared with insulin alone. The effect on HbA1c was inconsistent with mostly uncontrolled, small-scale studies reporting improvements in glycemic control. In placebo-controlled studies there was no clinically relevant effect on HbA1c. Adverse events were mostly transient gastrointestinal side effects, primarily nausea. Based on the available data, liraglutide cannot be recommended as add-on therapy to insulin in persons with type 1 diabetes with the aim to improve glycemic control. Ongoing trials in newly diagnosed patients with type 1 diabetes and in insulin pump-treated patients will help define the future role of liraglutide therapy in type 1 diabetes.

Choosing specific diabetes interventions and their roles in treating type 2 diabetes

Numerous reviews have focused on the characteristics of the specific diabetes interventions listed below. In addition, meta-analyses and reviews have summarized and compared the glucose-lowering effectiveness and other characteristics of the medications. The aim here is to provide enough information to justify the choices of medications, the order in which they are recommended, and the use of combinations of therapies. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of high-quality studies that provide head-to-head comparisons of the ability of the medications to achieve the currently recommended glycemic levels. The authors highly recommend that such studies be conducted. However, even in the absence of rigorous, comprehensive studies that directly compare the efficacy of all available glucose-lowering treatments and their combinations, we feel that there are enough data regarding the characteristics of the individual interventions to provide the guidelines below.

An important intervention that is likely to improve the probability that a patient will have better long-term control of diabetes is to make the diagnosis early, when the metabolic abnormalities of diabetes are usually less severe. Lower levels of glycemia at the time of initial therapy are associated with lower A1C levels over time and decreased long-term complications.

### Pharmacologic treatment of type 2 diabetes: injectable medications [^116ufEmo]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the oral and injectable pharmacologic treatment options for type 2 diabetes.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted using PubMed electronic database for studies published in English between 1993 and September 2014. Search terms included diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes, and the individual name for each antidiabetic medication reviewed. In addition, manual searches were performed for cross-references from publications. Package inserts, United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Web site, Institute for Safe Medication Practices Web site, American Diabetes Association Web site and scientific session poster presentations, and individual drug company Web pages were also reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

This review focused on information elucidated over the past 10 years to assist prescribers in choosing optimal therapy based on individual patient characteristics. Studies leading to the approval of or raising safety concerns for the antidiabetic medications reviewed in this article were included.

Data Synthesis

In the past 10 years, there have been 4 novel oral antidiabetic medication classes and 10 new injectable agents and insulin products approved by the FDA for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as well as new information regarding the safety and use of several older antidiabetic medication classes. The distinctions were reviewed for each individual agent, and a comparison was completed if there was more than one agent in a particular therapeutic class. Using current information available, select investigational agents in phase III trials or with a pending new drug application were highlighted.

Conclusion

There are now 9 distinct oral pharmacologic classes and a variety of insulin and noninsulin injectable medications available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Metformin remains the first-line treatment option for most patients. When considering options for alternative or additional treatment, prescribers must weigh the benefits and risks using individual patient characteristics.

### Perioperative management of diabetes in patients undergoing bariatric and metabolic surgery: a narrative review and the Cleveland clinic practical recommendations [^111M1268]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Bariatric and metabolic surgery is an effective treatment for patients with severe obesity and obesity-related diseases. In patients with type 2 diabetes, it provides marked improvement in glycemic control and even remission of diabetes. In patients with type 1 diabetes, bariatric surgery may offer improvement in insulin sensitivity and other cardiometabolic risk factors, as well as amelioration of the mechanical complications of obesity. Because of these positive outcomes, there are increasing numbers of patients with diabetes who undergo bariatric surgical procedures each year. Prior to surgery, efforts should be made to optimize glycemic control. However, there is no need to delay or withhold bariatric surgery until a specific glycosylated hemoglobin target is reached. Instead, treatment should focus on avoidance of early postoperative hyperglycemia. In general, oral glucose-lowering medications and noninsulin injectables are not favored to control hyperglycemia in the inpatient setting. Hyperglycemia in the hospital is managed with insulin, aiming for perioperative blood glucose concentrations between 80 and 180 mg/dL. Following surgery, substantial changes of the antidiabetic medication regimens are common. Patients should have a clear understanding of the modifications made to their treatment and should be followed closely thereafter. In this review article, we describe practical recommendations for the perioperative management of diabetes in patients with type 2 or type 1 diabetes undergoing bariatric surgery. Specific recommendations are delineated based on the different treatments that are currently available for glycemic control, including oral glucose-lowering medications, noninsulin injectables, and a variety of insulin regimens.

Type 1 diabetes — noninsulin pharmacologic adjuncts to insulin show limited glycemic and weight effects with safety considerations. Clinical trials have demonstrated a modest reduction in A1C (0.3–0.4%) and modest weight loss (~1 kg) with pramlintide. The largest clinical trials of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in type 1 diabetes have been conducted with liraglutide 1.8 mg daily, and results showed modest A1C reductions (~0.4%), decreases in weight (~5 kg), and reductions in insulin doses; during treatment there was no impact on C-peptide, and after liraglutide discontinuation there was worsening of C-peptide loss versus placebo. Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improved A1C, reduced body weight, and improved blood pressure in trials but were associated with an increased rate of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The SGLT1/2 inhibitor sotagliflozin improved A1C and body weight but was associated with an eightfold increase in DKA compared with placebo. The studies that led to the approved indication for heart failure excluded individuals with type 1 diabetes or a history of DKA, and there are currently no approved therapies for preservation of C-peptide or delaying the progression of symptomatic type 1 diabetes.

Metformin

Metformin is a biguanide that decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis and is used as first-line therapy in type 2 diabetes. It has been shown to have some benefit in reducing insulin doses and weight in small studies in patients with type 1 diabetes and is now being evaluated more fully for use in patients with type 1 diabetes. Two randomized controlled trials are currently under way evaluating metformin in type 1 diabetic patients. The first study is in adults and is using carotid intima-medial thickness as an outcome measure (identifier: NCT01483560). The second study is focusing on overweight or obese youths between the ages of 12 and 19 years who require ≥ 0.85 units/kg/day of insulin (identifier: NCT01808690). Results are currently pending.

Recommendations

Pramlintide may be considered for use as adjunctive therapy to prandial insulin in adults with type 1 diabetes failing to achieve glycemic goals. (B)
Evidence suggests that adding metformin to insulin therapy may reduce insulin requirements and improve metabolic control in overweight/obese patients and poorly controlled adolescents with type 1 diabetes, but evidence from larger longitudinal studies is required. (C)
Current type 2 diabetes medications (GLP-1 agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, and SGLT2 inhibitors) may be potential therapies for type 1 diabetic patients, but require large clinical trials before use in type 1 diabetic patients. (E)

Introduction

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Diabetes has remained a disease of public health importance, affecting over 800 million individuals globally, with its prevalence rising exponentially in low-middle-income countries. It affects almost all the systems in the body, resulting in microvascular complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy, and macrovascular complications such as cardiovascular complications and peripheral arterial disease, which results in lower limb ulceration and amputation. Data from 2021 revealed that almost 2 million deaths were directly a result of diabetes, with kidney diseases related to diabetes causing more than 500,000 extra deaths. Additionally, 11% of cardiovascular deaths were reported to be due to hyperglycemia. There are several classifications of diabetes mellitus, but the two major ones are type 1 and type 2. Type 1 DM occurs due to autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells, which results in deficient insulin production. It is also treated with daily insulin administration. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is more prevalent and often remains undiagnosed for long periods due to its asymptomatic progression. It occurs due to the combination of defects in insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells and insulin resistance.

While classic symptoms like polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia and weight loss are observed in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), many type 2 diabetics may remain asymptomatic. Management of Type 2 DM includes lifestyle modifications such as diet, exercise, and medications.

DM medications could be insulin, oral medications, or other injected medications. Insulin replacement therapy is used to treat type 1 DM, in which the pancreas does not secrete insulin. Insulin can also be used to manage type 2 DM when blood glucose levels cannot be controlled by diet, weight loss, and oral medications. Oral hypoglycemic agents are used to treat type 2 DM in addition to lifestyle modifications. These oral hypoglycemic agents are divided into various classes, which include sulphonylureas, biguanides, DPP-4 inhibitors, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, meglitinide analogues, thiazolidinediones, and SGLT-2 inhibitors. Metformin, a biguanide which enhances insulin sensitivity, is used as the first-line drug. Other classes can be used as second-line or third-line drugs. Despite the availability of these drugs that significantly improve the quality of life for type 2 DM patients, treatment limitations persist. Over time, as the disease progresses, these medications offer little to no help.

### Sodium-glucose co-transporter inhibitors as adjunctive treatment to insulin in type 1 diabetes: a review of randomized controlled trials [^111gGDSv]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) comprise approximately 5% to 10% of the overall population with diabetes, while those with type 2 diabetes (T2D) comprise the majority. Accordingly, most research efforts aimed at developing new glucose‐lowering treatments have focused on T2D, leading to the approval of multiple classes of glucose‐lowering agents. In contrast, insulin analogues and the amylin analogue pramlintide, which is infrequently used, remain essentially the only treatment options available for T1D in the United States.

Insulin therapy is designed to mimic endogenous insulin secretion patterns and has been the mainstay for patients with T1D. However, a basal‐bolus regimen cannot perfectly mimic endogenous insulin secretion, and while exogenous insulin is essential for preventing excessively high blood glucose concentrations, insulin‐treated patients often oscillate between hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia. Intensive treatment with insulin titrated to provide tight control of glycated haemoglobin (A1C) was shown to lower the risk of long‐term microvascular and macrovascular complications in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial; yet, overtreatment with insulin poses an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. 1, 2, 3

### Use of cardioprotective adjuncts in type 1 diabetes [^111ebkFB]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Type 1 diabetes is characterised by impaired, and often non-existent, β-cell function, excessive postprandial glucagon secretion (despite impaired glucagon secretion in response to hypoglycaemia) and rates of obesity in excess of general population trends. GLP-1 receptor agonists stimulate insulin secretion, reduce glucagon secretion and induce appetite suppression both centrally and through slowing of gastric emptying, leading to weight loss. SGLT-2 inhibitors lead to modest weight loss via their glycosuric actions. Both classes of agents improve insulin sensitivity and lead to modest improvements in glycaemia. Currently, neither class of medication is approved for use in type 1 diabetes.

The 2024 American Diabetes Association 'Standards of Care in Diabetes' does not advocate the use of adjunctive medications in type 1 diabetes. The authors write that 'risks and benefits… continue to be evaluated'. Despite the lack of trial data or Therapeutic Goods Administration approval, there is evidence of widespread use of these agents in clinical practice in Australia, as is the case worldwide. There is significant treatment burden related to managing type 1 diabetes, as well as negative effects of the condition on quality of life. People with type 1 diabetes have identified unmet therapeutic needs beyond improving glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), including difficulties managing weight gain and achieving time in range. There is overwhelming acceptance of adjunctive diabetes therapies by people living with type 1 diabetes, particularly relating to benefits such as reduction in insulin dosage and management of obesity and excessive cardiorenal risk.

Should people with type 1 diabetes, who are at increased risk of cardiovascular and renal disease, be denied therapies with documented cardiovascular and renal benefits? Whilst novel agents could be developed to address this cardiovascular risk gap in type 1 diabetes, time to translation is likely to be long. This duration can be significantly shortened by harnessing existing agents, already in use in clinical practice in other populations. A number of recent case reports, case series and retrospective clinic reviews have reported robust reductions in HbA1c, weight, total daily insulin dose and other metabolic risk factors in individuals with type 1 diabetes using these medications. Whilst certain populations with type 1 diabetes may be prone to specific complications, such as ketoacidosis from SGLT-2 inhibitors, the established safety profile of these classes of medications provides some reassurance regarding long-term use.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^117H4U9h]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes — antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy principles and initial therapy: The goal of antihyperglycemic treatment is to achieve clinical and laboratory targets with minimal adverse effects and reduce diabetes-related complications, and minimizing the risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain and maximizing cardiovascular and renal benefits should be priorities. As monotherapy, most noninsulin agents reduce A1C by 0.5% to 2.0%. Metformin is often the preferred initial therapy for most persons with new-onset type 2 diabetes and, once initiated, should be continued as long as it is tolerated and not contraindicated; it can be used in combination with virtually all other antihyperglycemic agents, including insulin, when monotherapy does not reach the glycemic target.

Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment — insulin thresholds and combinations specify that in adults with type 2 diabetes, initiation of insulin should be considered if symptoms of hyperglycemia are present or when A1C or blood glucose levels are very high (i.e. A1C > 10% [≥ 86 mmol/mol] or blood glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL [≥ 16.7 mmol/L]); in adults with type 2 diabetes and no evidence of insulin deficiency, a GLP-1 RA, including a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, is preferred to insulin; if insulin is used, combination therapy with a GLP-1 RA, including a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, is recommended for greater glycemic effectiveness as well as beneficial effects on weight and hypoglycemia risk for adults with type 2 diabetes, and insulin dosing should be reassessed upon addition or dose escalation of a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA; and in adults initiating insulin therapy, continue glucose-lowering agents (unless contraindicated or not tolerated) for ongoing glycemic and metabolic benefits.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^113jySzk]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Process

The guidelines and algorithm that follow are derived from two sources. One source is the clinical trials that address the effectiveness and safety of the different modalities of therapy. Here, the writing group reviewed a wide variety of studies related to the use of drugs as monotherapy or in combination to lower glycemia. Unfortunately, the paucity of high-quality evidence in the form of well-controlled clinical trials that directly compare different diabetes treatment regimens remains a major impediment to recommending one class of drugs, or a particular combination of therapies, over another.

The second source of material that informed our recommendations was clinical judgement, that is, our collective knowledge and clinical experience, which takes into account benefits, risks, and costs in the treatment of diabetes. As in all clinical decision making, an evidence-based review of the literature must also be supplemented by value judgements, where the benefits of treatment are weighed against risks and costs in a subjective fashion. While we realize that others may have different judgements, we believe that the recommendations made in this new iteration of our treatment algorithm will guide therapy and result in improved glycemic control and health status over time.

### Older adults: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^116Wt1rn]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Older adults with diabetes — advanced disease categories for end-of-life management — are delineated into three groups. Different categories have been proposed for diabetes management in those with advanced disease, including a stable individual, an individual with organ failure, and a dying individual. For a stable individual, continue the person's previous medication plan with a focus on the prevention of hypoglycemia and the management of hyperglycemia using blood glucose monitoring, and there is no role for A1C monitoring. For an individual with organ failure, preventing hypoglycemia is of greatest significance, dehydration must be prevented and treated, insulin administration in people with type 1 diabetes may be reduced as oral intake decreases but should not be stopped, and for those with type 2 diabetes agents that may cause hypoglycemia should be reduced in dose, with the main goal to avoid hypoglycemia allowing for glucose values in the upper level of the desired goal range. For a dying individual, for people with type 2 diabetes the discontinuation of all medications may be a reasonable approach because oral intake is unlikely, and in people with type 1 diabetes there is no consensus but a small amount of basal insulin may maintain glucose levels and prevent acute hyperglycemic complications.

Type 1 diabetes insulin dosing and initial regimen — adults and general: Total daily insulin requirements can be estimated based on weight, with typical doses ranging from 0.4 to 1 unit/ kg/day. The American Diabetes Association/JDRF Type 1 Diabetes Sourcebook notes 0.5 units/kg/day as a typical starting dose in adults with type 1 diabetes who are metabolically stable, with approximately one-half administered as prandial insulin and the remaining portion as basal insulin. In general, individuals with type 1 diabetes require approximately 30–50% of their daily insulin as basal and the remainder as prandial. Higher amounts may be required during puberty, menses, and medical illnesses.

### Management of blood glucose in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113N7YTz]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus focus on three areas: intensive lifestyle intervention that includes at least 150 minutes per week of physical activity, weight loss with an initial goal of 7 percent of baseline weight, and a low-fat, reduced-calorie diet; aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors (i.e., hypertension, dyslipidemia, and microalbuminuria) with the use of aspirin, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; and normalization of blood glucose levels (hemoglobin A1C level less than 7 percent). Insulin resistance, decreased insulin secretion, and increased hepatic glucose output are the hallmarks of type 2 diabetes, and each class of medication targets one or more of these defects. Metformin, which decreases hepatic glucose output and sensitizes peripheral tissues to insulin, has been shown to decrease mortality rates in patients with type 2 diabetes and is considered a first-line agent. Other medications include sulfonylureas and nonsulfonylurea secretagogues, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones. Insulin can be used acutely in patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes to normalize blood glucose, or it can be added to a regimen of oral medication to improve glycemic control. Except in patients taking multiple insulin injections, home monitoring of blood glucose levels has questionable utility, especially in relatively well-controlled patients. Its use should be tailored to the needs of the individual patient.

Due to the associated weight loss, SGLT‐2 inhibitors and SGLT‐1/2 inhibitors may particularly benefit those who are overweight or obese. The majority of patients in the studies reviewed herein had a BMI in the overweight or obese ranges, representative of the general adult T1D population. 59, 60 It is unclear whether higher BMI is associated with a decreased risk of DKA in patients taking these medications, and data addressing this question would be welcome. Further research is also needed to better characterize other DKA risk factors during SGLT‐2 inhibitor and SGLT‐1/2 inhibitor use, and to evaluate the efficacy of specific risk mitigation strategies, including insulin dose titration and ketone testing.

### Diabetes mellitus: what the neurologists need to know [^115g7s5T]. Practical Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Diabetes mellitus is a common condition associated with numerous complications and comorbidities. The diabetes spectrum includes type 1, type 2 and other forms of diabetes, which may be associated with medical therapies and genetic factors. Type 2 diabetes is managed with lifestyle, oral therapies, non-insulin-based injectables and subsequently insulin. Type 1 diabetes requires insulin from the time of diagnosis. In recent years, there have been considerable developments in the therapies available to treat type 2 diabetes and some of these also afford cardiorenal protection. This review summarises the nature, complications and therapeutic advances in the field of diabetes and provides a concise review for neurologists. Managing diabetes optimally prevents complications and all medical specialties need a basic understanding of the principles involved in diabetes care.

SGLT inhibition and risk of ketosis — individuals with type 1 diabetes and insulin-deficient type 2 diabetes are at increased risk for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with SGLT inhibitor therapy; SGLT inhibitor–associated DKA occurs in approximately 4% of people with type 1 diabetes, the risk can be 5–17 times higher than in untreated type 1 diabetes, and SGLT2 inhibitors are not approved for use in people with type 1 diabetes; in type 2 diabetes, DKA is uncommon with an estimated incidence of 0.6–4.9 events per 1,000 person-years; up to a third of SGLT2-associated DKA cases present with glucose < 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) and in one small study 71% presented with glucose ≤ 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L); risk factors include low-carbohydrate diets, decreased caloric intake, alcohol intake, and other common precipitating factors, and it is important to educate individuals about the signs and symptoms of DKA and DKA mitigation and management and to provide accurate tools for ketone measurement.

### A review of insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes: is there a place for adjunctive metformin? [^116BgPZv]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The use of metformin as adjunctive therapy to insulin in type 1 diabetes results in a transient reduction in HbA1c that is not sustained with long-term use. However, there is a significant reduction in body weight and BMI, insulin dose and lipids. It also reduces the maximal carotid intima media thickness in individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the use of metformin as an add-on to intensive insulin therapy can be considered, and the potential for cardiovascular risk reduction should be explored further.

### Pharmacologic treatment of type 2 diabetes: oral medications [^113JUNVM]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the oral and injectable pharmacologic treatment options for type 2 diabetes.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted using PubMed electronic database for studies published in English between 1993 and September 2014. Search terms included diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes, and the individual name for each antidiabetic medication reviewed. In addition, manual searches were performed for cross-references from publications. Package inserts, United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Web site, Institute for Safe Medication Practices Web site, American Diabetes Association Web site and scientific session poster presentations, and individual drug company Web pages were also reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

This review focused on information elucidated over the past 10 years to assist prescribers in choosing optimal therapy based on individual patient characteristics. Studies leading to the approval of or raising safety concerns for the antidiabetic medications reviewed in this article were included.

Data Synthesis

In the past 10 years, there have been 4 novel oral antidiabetic medication classes and 9 new injectable agents and insulin products approved by the FDA for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as well as new information regarding the safety and use of several older antidiabetic medication classes. The distinctions were reviewed for each individual agent, and a comparison was completed if there was more than one agent in a particular therapeutic class. Using current information available, select investigational agents in phase III trials or those with a pending new drug application were highlighted.

Conclusion

There are now 9 distinct oral pharmacologic classes and a variety of insulin and noninsulin injectable medications available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Metformin remains the first-line treatment option for most patients. When considering options for alternative or additional treatment, prescribers must weigh the benefits and risks using individual patient characteristics.

Special considerations/patients

In the setting of severely uncontrolled diabetes with catabolism, defined as fasting plasma glucose levels > 13.9 mmol/l (250 mg/dl), random glucose levels consistently above 16.7 mmol/l (300 mg/dl), A1C above 10%, or the presence of ketonuria, or as symptomatic diabetes with polyuria, polydipsia and weight loss, insulin therapy in combination with lifestyle intervention is the treatment of choice. Some patients with these characteristics will have unrecognized type 1 diabetes; others will have type 2 diabetes with severe insulin deficiency. Insulin can be titrated rapidly and is associated with the greatest likelihood of returning glucose levels rapidly to target levels. After symptoms are relieved and glucose levels decreased, oral agents can often be added and it may be possible to withdraw insulin, if preferred.

### Stability of an empirical psychosocial taxonomy across type of diabetes and treatment [^115jQdkw]. Diabetic Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Aims

The aims of the study were (i) to examine whether an empirical psychosocial taxonomy, based on key diabetes-related variables, is independent of type of diabetes and treatment, and (ii) to further establish the external validation of the taxonomy.

Methods

In a cross-sectional study, 82 patients with Type 1 and 86 patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus were assigned to one of three psychosocial patient profiles based on their Multidimensional Diabetes Questionnaire (MDQ) scores. General psychological and diabetes-specific measures were obtained through self-report and HbA(1c) was measured.

Results

Equal proportions of Type 1 and Type 2 patients, and of patients using insulin and oral medication/diet only were classified within each of the three psychosocial profiles. External validation confirmed the validity and distinctiveness of the patients' profiles. The patient profiles were independent of demographic variables, body mass index, duration of diabetes, complexity of treatment, number of complications, social desirability, and major stress levels.

Conclusions

The Psychosocial Taxonomy for Patients with Diabetes provides a new way to categorize individuals who may have more in common than just their type of diabetes and/or its treatment and can help target interventions to individual patients' needs.

Background

Clinical practice guidelines have an important role in guiding choices among the numerous medications available to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus, but little is known about their quality.

Purpose

To assess whether guidelines on oral medications for type 2 diabetes are consistent with a systematic review of the current evidence and whether the consistency of the guidelines depends on the quality of guideline development.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, CINAHL, and guideline-specific databases were searched between July 2007 and August 2011, after the 2007 publication of a peer-reviewed systematic review on oral diabetes medications.

Study Selection

Two reviewers independently screened citations to identify English-language guidelines on oral medications to treat type 2 diabetes that were applied in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada.

Data Extraction

Reviewers assessed whether the guidelines addressed and agreed with 7 evidence-based conclusions from the 2007 systematic review. Two reviewers independently rated guideline quality by using 2 domains from the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation instrument.

Data Synthesis

Of the 1000 screened citations, 11 guidelines met the inclusion criteria. Seven guidelines agreed with the conclusion that metformin is favored as the first-line agent. Ten guidelines agreed that thiazolidinediones are associated with higher rates of edema and congestive heart failure compared with other oral medications to treat type 2 diabetes. One guideline addressed no evidence-based conclusions, and 5 guidelines agreed with all 7 conclusions. The summary scores of the rigor of development (median, 28.6% [range, 16.7% to 100.0%]) and editorial independence (median, 75.0% [range, 8.3% to 100.0%]) domains varied greatly across guidelines. Guidelines that received higher quality scores contained more recommendations that were consistent with the evidence-based conclusions.

Limitation

Only English-language guidelines targeting users in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada that contained recommendations on oral medications were included.

Conclusion

Not all practice guidelines on oral treatment of type 2 diabetes were consistent with available evidence from a systematic review. Guidelines judged to be of higher quality contained more recommendations consistent with evidence-based conclusions. The quality of guideline development processes varied substantially.

### Non-insulin treatments for type 1 diabetes: critical appraisal of the available evidence and insight into future directions [^114KaoGj]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Intensive insulin therapy is the mainstay of treatment for people with Type 1 diabetes, but hypoglycaemia and weight gain are often limiting factors in achieving glycaemic targets and decreasing the risk of diabetes-related complications. The inclusion of pharmacological agents used traditionally in Type 2 diabetes as adjuncts to insulin therapy in Type 1 diabetes has been explored, with the goal of mitigating such drawbacks. Pramlintide and metformin result in modest HbA 1c and weight reductions, but their use is limited by poor tolerability and, in the case of pramlintide, by frequency of injections and cost. The addition of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists to insulin results in improved glycaemic control, reduced insulin doses and weight loss, but this is at the expense of higher rates of hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia with ketosis. Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 and dual sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 and -1 inhibitors also improve glucose control, but with reductions in weight and insulin requirements potentiating the risk of acidosis-related events and hypoglycaemia. The high proportion of people with Type 1 diabetes not achieving glycaemic targets, the negative clinical impact of intensive insulin therapy and the rise in obesity and cardiovascular disease and mortality, underline the need for individualized clinical care. The evaluation of new therapies, effective in Type 2 diabetes, as adjuncts to insulin therapy represents a promising strategy, particularly given the beneficial effects on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in people with Type 2 diabetes with or at high risk of complications that are also observed in patients with Type 1 diabetes. As the population with Type 1 diabetes ages, our mission is to evolve and provide better tools and improved therapies to excel, not only in glycaemic control but also in risk reduction and reduction of complications.

### Effect of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes on the risk of venous thromboembolism [^112b5b2h]. Diabetic Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

2 METHODS

2.1 Study design

The study was a retrospective cohort study, of adults with and without diabetes, included in the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) database.

2.2 Data source

This comprises data from a sentinel network of primary care practices (general practices) distributed across England, which is representative of the general population. 18

Until recently, clinical codes were recorded using the Read coding system (Read Version 2 and Clinical Terms Version 3 [CTV3]), which includes codes for diagnoses, medications, investigations and processes of care. In 2018, the Read classification was replaced by the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). 19

2.3 Study population

We used a two‐step process to identify type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. 20 Step one identifies all people with diabetes (of any type), defined as those who had a diagnostic code (diagnosis of diabetes), clinical investigations (two or more fasted glucose, random glucose or glucose tolerance test values or HbA1c measurements consistent with diagnosis) or medication use (two or more prescriptions for oral diabetes medications [excluding metformin] or injectable therapies). Step two is the categorisation by diabetes type using a clinically based seven‐step algorithm. This accounts for codes for type of diabetes, age (at first insulin prescription), body mass index (BMI) and other key factors to determine type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes. 20 This step‐wise categorisation algorithm allows over‐riding of diagnostic codes where clinical characteristics are highly likely to indicate a specific type of diabetes. BMI is the final step.

We included all adults (age ≥ 18 years) in the RCGP RSC database prior to (1 January 2009).

4 CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS

Positive results from clinical trials of SGLT‐2 inhibitors and an SGLT‐1/2 inhibitor for patients with T1D have led to new recommendations issued by regulatory agencies in Europe and the United States. The European Medicines Agency Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CMPH) recommended approving sotagliflozin and extending the indication of dapagliflozin, each as an adjunct to insulin, in adults with T1D having body mass index (BMI) ≥ 27 kg/m² in whom insulin does not provide adequate glycaemic control despite optimization of therapy. 51, 52 In March 2019, the European Commission approved dapagliflozin for use in patients with T1D as indicated above, 53 while the decision on sotagliflozin is pending. Likewise, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare approved dapagliflozin as an adjunct to insulin for adults with T1D. 54 Another SGLT‐2 inhibitor used for the treatment of T2D in Japan, ipragliflozin, was approved for a T1D indication in late 2018. 55 In early 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee delivered a tie vote on the use of sotagliflozin as an adjunct to insulin in patients with T1D, in whom optimal control of blood glucose levels is not achieved with insulin alone. 56, 57 A key point of consideration involved discussion of the benefits of sotagliflozin weighed against the risk of DKA, including appropriate selection of patients and whether the risk of DKA can be mitigated in the real world. However, the US FDA ultimately declined to approve sotagliflozin as an adjunct to insulin in patients with T1D. 58

Given the apparent increased risk of DKA with SGLT‐2 inhibitor and SGLT‐1/2 inhibitor use in T1D, it will be imperative to carefully select the patients in whom these medications will be prescribed. There is little direct evidence to help define the ideal patient population, but the risk factors that drive DKA in patients taking these medications are likely similar to those in the general T1D population. Thus, fundamental guidelines for patient selection can be suggested. If approved, SGLT inhibitors should be considered in patients with T1D who have demonstrated both adherence to their prescribed insulin regimen, and the ability to understand and utilize relevant education relating to DKA risk and risk mitigation strategies. These medications should be avoided in patients who have had recent or recurrent DKA, who have difficulty adhering to the prescribed insulin regimen, or who have difficulty processing or synthesizing relevant diabetes‐related information.

### Efficacy and safety of dual SGLT 1 / 2 inhibitor sotagliflozin in type 1 diabetes: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111gqxiw]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Type 1 diabetes mellitus affects 1.5 million people in the United States alone and its prevalence is continuously rising, partly because over 10% of patients initially presumed to have type 2 diabetes at diagnosis subsequently show evidence of islet autoimmunity and progress to insulin dependence later on. The achievement and maintenance of glycaemic goals in type 1 diabetes has proven both difficult and hazardous. In the T1D Exchange clinic registry, the average level of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was 8%, only 30% of patients with type 1 diabetes achieved an HbA1c goal of 7%, and severe hypoglycaemia occurred in up to 20% of patients per year. Similarly, in the Diabetes Complications and Control Trial, patients with type 1 diabetes with HbA1c levels within target showed a 2.9-fold increased cardiovascular mortality, and patients in the intensive intervention group escalated back to an HbA1c of 8% in the years following the trial.

### SGLT2 inhibitors as adjunctive therapy for type 1 diabetes: balancing benefits and risks [^113vJezQ]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors have several beneficial effects in patients with type 2 diabetes, including glucose lowering, weight loss, blood pressure lowering, and a reduced risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. To address high unmet medical need via improved glycaemic control, several clinical trials have been done to assess the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in combination with insulin therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes. In this Personal View, we summarise data from eight clinical trials of canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and sotagliflozin in patients with type 1 diabetes. HbA 1c -lowering efficacy was greatest at 8–12 weeks of therapy, but the magnitude of HbA 1c lowering waned with longer duration of treatment (up to 52 weeks). Data are not yet available to establish for how long glycaemic efficacy could be sustained during long-term therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes. Moreover, SGLT2 inhibitor therapy induces serious adverse events, including a roughly six-times increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. The US Food and Drug Administration estimated that one additional case of ketoacidosis will occur for every 26 patient-years of exposure of patients with type 1 diabetes to sotagliflozin therapy. Assuming a case mortality of 0.4%, this estimate translates into 16 additional deaths per year per 100000 patients with type 1 diabetes undergoing treatment. These considerations raise important questions about the risk-to-benefit profile of SGLT2 inhibitors when used as adjunctive therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes.

### Diabetes treatment intensification and associated changes in HbA1c and body mass index: a cohort study [^1154dkui]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Metformin, a biguanide approved and marketed in the U.S. since 1995, is the preferred oral hypoglycemic medication for initial management of type 2 diabetes. In 2006, after review of available evidence, the consensus statement by the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes recommended lifestyle modification and metformin as the preferred first line therapies for type 2 diabetes, with a treatment goal being glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) of ≤ 7%. This recommendation was based on evidence from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study which demonstrated that those randomized to metformin experienced 42% fewer diabetes-related deaths and 36% fewer all-cause deaths compared to the diet alone arm.

Despite consensus on initial diabetes treatment, when to intensify and the preferred specific treatment regimen remains highly patient specific. Diabetes treatment guidelines have advocated for a shared approach between provider and patient when choosing both the treatment goals and regimen for intensification. A number of factors influence providers to recommend a medication for intensification including medication costs, side effects, their own knowledge and beliefs about future treatment benefits, such as prevention or delay of macrovascular and microvascular disease. Patients' understanding of their illness, adherence to their treatment regimens, and ability to manage medications also affect decision-making about treatment choices. Finally, health system factors including achievement of performance metrics can drive the decision to intensify therapy. Although many experts recommend titration of therapy to reach HbA1c goals of < 7%, VHA uses an algorithm which determines an individual glycemic target based on consideration of microvascular complications and co morbid illness (Table 1). The guidelines note multiple treatment options as acceptable add-on medications. Oral medications in general are easier to initiate, but insulin dose can be modified in response to daily variation in food intake, exercise or other variables that cause daily fluctuation in glucose values. Because of the potential microvascular benefit to patients with tighter glycemic control, there has been a fairly substantial increase in the use of insulin over time.

### Metabolic control in type 1 diabetes: is adjunctive therapy the way forward? [^112xXo9p]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Due to the mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors, hypoglycaemia is not common in those with T2DM. A meta-analysis of trials looking at the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in those with type 1 DM did not find a significantly different rate of hypoglycaemia compared to placebo.

Changes in insulin requirements have been reported in some trials investigating the addition of SGLT2 inhibitors to insulin monotherapy in type 1 diabetes. One large trial with 1402 participants which studied the addition of sotagliflozin (a dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitor) found significant reductions in placebo-corrected total daily insulin dose, bolus insulin dose and basal insulin dose (− 9.7%, − 12.3% and − 9.9%, respectively, p ≤ 0.001 for all). A recent meta-analysis reported reductions in both bolus and basal insulin doses when a SGLT2 inhibitor was added to insulin monotherapy (− 3.6 units/day, 95% CI − 2.0 to − 5.3, and − 4.2 units/day, 95% CI − 2.2 to − 6.3, respectively). There is therefore good evidence that adding a SGLT2 inhibitor reduces the insulin requirement in those with type 1 diabetes, and there appears to be reduction in both basal and bolus insulin doses for those on multiple daily injection regimens.

2 DIAGNOSTIC CHALLENGES AND UNIQUE FEATURES

As the prevalence and burden associated with adult‐onset T1D is better recognised, the question of how to most accurately identify disease in adults becomes increasingly important. Identification of adult‐onset T1D is important because the hallmark of progressive autoimmune β cell loss commonly necessitates the use of exogenous insulin as the mainstay of treatment. The erroneous treatment of those with adult‐onset T1D with therapeutics normally used to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D), including dietary modification or oral agents, leads to poor glycaemic control and a higher risk of acute and chronic complications. In addition to allowing for correct therapeutic management, an accurate diagnosis for T1D in adulthood is clinically important for several additional reasons: (1) qualification for treatment with emerging immunotherapies for T1D, (2) optimal family screening and monitoring, (3) qualification for continuous glucose monitors and other diabetes technology, which may be restricted by third party and government payers, and (4) proper monitoring for additional associated autoimmune conditions in affected individuals.

The most prevalent form of diabetes in adults is T2D, which accounts for 90%–95% of all diabetes cases in adults. This proportion is in contrast to paediatric diabetes, where T1D accounts for > 90% of all diabetes cases. The low prior odds of a person with newly diagnosed adult‐onset diabetes having T1D raises a real challenge for accurately identifying T1D in adults. As a result, many cases of adult‐onset T1D are initially incorrectly diagnosed as T2D in clinical care. Additionally, the difference in prior odds of T1D between children and adults means that individual features that are either highly suggestive or confirmatory of paediatric diabetes are less discriminative on their own in adults. Features considered to be associated with T1D (lower body mass index, ketoacidosis at presentation, islet autoantibodies) can also be present in T2D. In adults, presentation with any of these features on their own is more likely to be associated with 'atypical' T2D rather than classical T1D, due to the overwhelming prior odds of T2D in this age group.

### Changing the approach to type 2 diabetes treatment: a comparison of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sulphonylureas across the continuum of care [^114dWFnD]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1 RAs) have a well‐established efficacy and safety profile and, as a class, represent an increasingly important option for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Clinical studies in patients with T2DM show that GLP‐1 RAs provide good glycaemic control, promote weight loss, and are typically associated with lipid and blood pressure reductions.,

In clinical practice, many patients with T2DM eventually require a combination of interventions to maintain glycaemic control and reduce the risk of long‐term complications. Most current practice guidelines recommend lifestyle and dietary modification as an initial step to maintain glycaemic control, usually followed by metformin monotherapy, and then by a combination of metformin with other therapies, including oral and injectable medications. As options for combination therapy, guidelines typically recommend consideration of either a sulphonylurea, thiazolidinedione, dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP‐4) inhibitor, sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 (SGLT‐2) inhibitor, GLP‐1 RA or basal insulin, if glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) targets are not met after approximately 3–6 months. Importantly, the most recently issued updates to management guidelines recommend that treatment selection should be based on clinical trial evidence of reductions in adverse cardiovascular events and/or cardiovascular mortality in patients with T2DM and established cardiovascular disease, and that sulphonylureas should be used as third‐line therapy only, especially where hypoglycaemia or weight gain is a concern.

### Diagnosis and treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults: a review [^1158avd1]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Type 2 diabetes involves progressive loss of insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells in the setting of insulin resistance and manifests clinically as hyperglycemia. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90% to 95% of all cases of diabetes globally, with estimates ranging from 589 million to 828 million people worldwide. In the US, type 2 diabetes affects approximately 1 in 6 adults.

Observations

Risk factors for type 2 diabetes include older age, family history, overweight or obesity, physical inactivity, gestational diabetes, Hispanic ethnicity, and American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, or Black race. Diabetes is diagnosed if fasting plasma glucose is greater than or equal to 126 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1C is greater than or equal to 6.5%, or 2-hour glucose during 75-g oral glucose tolerance testing is greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL. Approximately one-third of adults with type 2 diabetes have cardiovascular disease and 10.1% have severe vision difficulty or blindness. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is 39.2% among patients with kidney failure. Although weight management is an important component of treatment for type 2 diabetes, no specific diet has been proven to be most effective for improving health outcomes. Physical activity can reduce hemoglobin A1C by 0.4% to 1.0% and improve cardiovascular risk factors (ie, hypertension and dyslipidemia). Randomized clinical trials have reported absolute reductions in microvascular disease (3.5%), such as retinopathy and nephropathy, myocardial infarction (3.3%-6.2%), and mortality (2.7%-4.9%), with intensive glucose-lowering strategies (hemoglobin A1C < 7%) vs conventional treatment 2 decades after trial completion. First-line medications for type 2 diabetes include metformin and, in patients with cardiovascular or kidney comorbidities or at high cardiovascular risk, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is). Common add-on medications include dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1RAs, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones. Approximately one-third of patients with type 2 diabetes require treatment with insulin during their lifetime. Several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated benefits of specific SGLT2i and GLP-1RA medications compared with placebo for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (12%-26% risk reduction), heart failure (18%-25% risk reduction), and kidney disease (24%-39% risk reduction) over 2 to 5 years. Most trial participants with type 2 diabetes were taking metformin. High-potency GLP-1RA and dual GIP/GLP-1RA medications result in weight loss of greater than 5% in most individuals with type 2 diabetes, and weight loss may exceed 10%.

Conclusions

Type 2 diabetes affects up to 14% of the global population and is associated with preventable long-term complications, such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, vision loss, and increased mortality. In addition to lifestyle modifications including diet, exercise, and weight management, metformin is generally first-line therapy for attainment of hemoglobin A1C targets. For individuals with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular or kidney disease or at high cardiovascular risk, guidelines recommend early treatment with SGLT2i and/or GLP-1RA medications.

### Second-line pharmaceutical treatments for patients with type 2 diabetes [^112JDMsi]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The annual prevalence of type 2 diabetes remains high, impacting an estimated 11.3% of the US population and 9.3% of people worldwide. Current clinical treatment guidelines recommend targeting glycated hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) less than 7% for most adults (to convert to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01), although there is heterogeneity across recommendations, ranging between 6.5% and 8%, depending on the target population and risk of various microvascular and macrovascular complications. Moderate glycemic control, defined by HbA 1c within 7% to 8%, has been shown to improve macrovascular and microvascular outcomes in individuals with diabetes. Metformin is a preferred glucose-lowering drug and is often recommended at treatment initiation for patients with diabetes due to its tolerability, efficacy, and low cost. However, intensification of treatment with an additional agent is often needed to maintain glycemic levels in the recommended range. Indeed, an estimated one-third of the US population with HbA 1c greater than 7% is prescribed an additional drug to maintain glycemic control. However, the choice of such an add-on treatment is ambiguous, owing to the lack of direct comparisons of currently available agents. Additionally, evidence emerging from the characterization of clinical data suggests that the actual choices clinicians make in adding another agent onto metformin is highly variable across health systems, both in the US and worldwide. Therefore, to help inform clinical decision-making, it is imperative to fill this knowledge gap by comparing the effectiveness and safety of agents added on to metformin in a head-to-head fashion. However, such rigorous comparison across multiple therapeutic options is simply not feasible in the context of classical randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for myriad reasons, including but not limited to cost, time, patient follow-ups, and the combinatorial nature of diabetes treatment options.

### Oral pharmacologic treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a clinical practice guideline update from the American College of Physicians [^114CkQtd]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on oral pharmacologic treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults. This guideline serves as an update to the 2012 ACP guideline on the same topic. This guideline is endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians.

Methods

This guideline is based on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials and observational studies published through December 2015 on the comparative effectiveness of oral medications for type 2 diabetes. Evaluated interventions included metformin, thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors. Study quality was assessed, data were extracted, and results were summarized qualitatively on the basis of the totality of evidence identified by using several databases. Evaluated outcomes included intermediate outcomes of hemoglobin A1c, weight, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate; all-cause mortality; cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality; retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy; and harms. This guideline grades the recommendations by using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with type 2 diabetes.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends that clinicians prescribe metformin to patients with type 2 diabetes when pharmacologic therapy is needed to improve glycemic control. (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends that clinicians consider adding either a sulfonylurea, a thiazolidinedione, an SGLT-2 inhibitor, or a DPP-4 inhibitor to metformin to improve glycemic control when a second oral therapy is considered. (Grade: weak recommendation; moderate-quality evidence.) ACP recommends that clinicians and patients select among medications after discussing benefits, adverse effects, and costs.

### EADSG guidelines: insulin therapy in diabetes [^1144h4Fo]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Executive Summary and Recommendations

A diagnosis of diabetes or hyperglycemia should be confirmed prior to ordering, dispensing, or administering insulin (A).
Insulin is the primary treatment in all patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) (A).
Typically, patients with T1DM will require initiation with multiple daily injections at the time of diagnosis. This is usually short-acting insulin or rapid-acting insulin analogue given 0 to 15 min before meals together with one or more daily separate injections of intermediate or long-acting insulin. Two or three premixed insulin injections per day may be used (A).
The target glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) for all children with T1DM, including preschool children, is recommended to be < 7.5% (< 58 mmol/mol). The target is chosen aiming at minimizing hyperglycemia, severe hypoglycemia, hypoglycemic unawareness, and reducing the likelihood of development of long-term complications (B).
For patients prone to glycemic variability, glycemic control is best evaluated by a combination of results with self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (B).
Indications for exogenous insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) include acute illness or surgery, pregnancy, glucose toxicity, contraindications to or failure to achieve goals with oral antidiabetic medications, and a need for flexible therapy (B).
In T2DM patients, with regards to achieving glycemic goals, insulin is considered alone or in combination with oral agents when HbA1c is ≥ 7.5% (≥ 58 mmol/mol); and is essential for treatment in those with HbA1c ≥ 10% (≥ 86 mmol/mol), when diet, physical activity, and other antihyperglycemic agents have been optimally used (B).
The preferred method of insulin initiation in T2DM is to begin by adding a long-acting (basal) insulin or once-daily premixed/co-formulation insulin or twice-daily premixed insulin, alone or in combination with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) or in combination with other oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) (B).
If the desired glucose targets are not met, rapid-acting or short-acting (bolus or prandial) insulin can be added at mealtime to control the expected postprandial raise in glucose. An insulin regimen should be adopted and individualized but should, to the extent possible, closely resemble a natural physiologic state and avoid, to the extent possible, wide fluctuating glucose levels (C).
Blood glucose monitoring is an integral part of effective insulin therapy and should not be omitted in the patient's care plan. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) values should be used to titrate basal insulin, whereas both FPG and postprandial glucose (PPG) values should be used to titrate mealtime insulin (B).
Metformin combined with insulin is associated with decreased weight gain, lower insulin dose, and less hypoglycemia when compared with insulin alone (C).
Oral medications should not be abruptly discontinued when starting insulin therapy because of the risk of rebound hyperglycemia (D).
Analogue insulin is as effective as human insulin but is associated with less postprandial hyperglycemia and delayed hypoglycemia (B).
The shortest needles (currently the 4-mm pen and 6-mm syringe needles) are safe, effective, and less painful and should be the first-line choice in all patient categories; intramuscular (IM) injections should be avoided, especially with long-acting insulins, because severe hypoglycemia may result; lipohypertrophy is a frequent complication of therapy that distorts insulin absorption, and therefore, injections and infusions should not be given into these lesions and correct site rotation will help prevent them (A).
Many patients in East Africa reuse syringes for various reasons, including financial. This is not recommended by the manufacturer and there is an association between needle reuse and lipohypertrophy. However, patients who reuse needles should not be subjected to alarming claims of excessive morbidity from this practice (A).
Health care authorities and planners should be alerted to the risks associated with syringe or pen needles 6 mm or longer in children (A).
