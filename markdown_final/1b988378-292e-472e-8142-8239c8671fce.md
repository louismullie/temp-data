Ppi safe for pregnant pt

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are safe for pregnant patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about teratogenicity and the risk of major congenital malformations. Then, I should evaluate miscarriage risk. Next, I will examine obstetric and neonatal outcomes like preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and growth restriction. After that, I should verify what major guidelines recommend. I will then consider whether any particular PPI is preferred and why. Finally, I need to integrate timing and dose, weigh risks versus benefits, and end with practical recommendations while acknowledging uncertainties [^112sVzxb] [^115Skcza] [^115gcD9K].

> Let me first confirm teratogenicity risk. The highest-quality synthesis, a 2009 American Journal of Gastroenterology meta-analysis of 134,940 pregnancies, found no increased risk of major congenital malformations with first-trimester PPI exposure (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86–1.45), which is reassuring and argues against a clinically meaningful teratogenic signal, and it also reported no clear increase in preterm delivery, which I should keep in mind as I review newer cohort signals next [^112sVzxb]. Wait, let me verify consistency by cross-checking regulatory summaries: FDA labeling for pantoprazole and lansoprazole states that available human data do not show an association with adverse pregnancy outcomes, which aligns with the meta-analysis and supports the absence of a pattern of birth defects, and while esomeprazole is Category C in older labeling, available epidemiologic data have not demonstrated increased major malformations with first-trimester exposure, which again is reassuring rather than alarming [^111tdzyi] [^117LNZBR] [^116negZi].

> I should double-check miscarriage data before moving on. The same 2009 meta-analysis found no significant increase in spontaneous abortion with PPI exposure (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.84–1.97), and given the confidence interval includes 1.0, I cannot conclude a causal increase; this supports counseling that miscarriage risk is not clearly elevated with PPIs [^112sVzxb]. Hold on, I need to ensure I do not overinterpret older pooled data; I will keep this anchored while I examine larger contemporary cohorts for obstetric outcomes that could be influenced by confounding rather than direct drug effect [^112sVzxb].

> Next, I will examine obstetric and neonatal outcomes. A large Swedish population-based cohort of over one million deliveries reported modestly higher odds of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and small-for-gestational-age infants among PPI users, but importantly PPI users were older, had nearly double the baseline obesity prevalence, more comorbidity, and more polypharmacy, all of which could confound these associations, and the authors explicitly noted methodological limitations that prevent assigning causality, so I should be cautious not to overstate risk here [^1163KxP8] [^115siwGR]. Let me verify dose–response patterns as a check for causality; sensitivity analyses showed inconsistent dose–response and timing effects, which weakens the argument for a direct causal relationship and strengthens the likelihood of confounding by indication and baseline risk, so I should contextualize these small effect sizes accordingly during counseling [^11734saC] [^114qXa8B].

> Now I should review guideline positions to avoid straying from consensus practice. The American College of Gastroenterology guideline explicitly recognizes PPIs as safe in pregnancy when clinically indicated, which aligns with routine GERD management step-up algorithms, and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends offering PPIs for reflux in pregnancy, which further reassures me that expert bodies support their use when needed [^115Skcza] [^115gcD9K]. I need to check deprescribing guidance to ensure I am not advising unnecessary discontinuation; the AGA clinical practice updates emphasize stopping PPIs for lack of indication rather than due to fear of adverse events, and recommend step-down when possible, which suggests individualized use rather than blanket avoidance in pregnancy [^117AFx4X] [^116mRu8j] [^1169hHEv].

> Let me consider whether one PPI is preferable. Mechanistically and from drug–drug interaction data, pantoprazole and rabeprazole have lower CYP2C19 interaction potential than omeprazole and, to a lesser extent, lansoprazole, which can matter for patients on interacting drugs like clopidogrel; pantoprazole's FDA labeling and human data are reassuring, making it a reasonable first choice in pregnancy if a PPI is indicated and potential interactions are a concern [^1161VuS7] [^112QZmP1] [^111tdzyi]. I should confirm lansoprazole's human data too; FDA summaries report no association with adverse pregnancy outcomes, so lansoprazole is also acceptable when clinically indicated, though I will still consider pantoprazole first in polypharmacy or high interaction risk settings [^117LNZBR].

> Timing and dose now deserve attention. The first trimester is the critical window for teratogenesis, and across meta-analytic and regulatory data no specific pattern of major malformations has been identified with first-trimester exposure, which supports use when clinically necessary during early pregnancy, though as always I should use the lowest effective dose and shortest effective duration and re-evaluate regularly as symptoms evolve across trimesters [^112sVzxb] [^111tdzyi]. Next, I should review deprescribing principles that apply broadly but are relevant here: stepping down to once-daily dosing when feasible and considering on-demand strategies can reduce exposure without compromising control in appropriate cases, which is reasonable in pregnancy when symptoms permit after initial control is achieved [^1169hHEv] [^115Snmg4].

> I will now weigh the clinical risk–benefit balance. Untreated or undertreated GERD in pregnancy is common and can significantly impair sleep, nutrition, and quality of life, and while complications like erosive esophagitis are less common, persistent symptomatic disease often requires acid suppression beyond antacids or H2RAs; PPIs are the most effective agents for moderate to severe GERD, and guideline-concordant step therapy culminating in a PPI when needed is appropriate in pregnancy, with lifestyle and antacids first, then H2RAs such as famotidine, and PPIs when earlier steps fail or complications are present [^113JmXa8] [^113NAsgh] [^115Skcza] [^115gcD9K]. Hold on, I should confirm that the small associations seen in observational cohorts do not outweigh symptom and complication control; given the lack of demonstrated teratogenicity and the likely confounding driving obstetric associations, the benefits of indicated PPI therapy generally outweigh theoretical risks when non-PPI measures are inadequate [^112sVzxb] [^1163KxP8].

> But wait, what if a source claims PPIs are contraindicated in pregnancy? I need to check and correct that. One narrative passage incorrectly stated that PPIs are contraindicated, which is not supported by regulatory labeling or major society guidance; FDA labeling for pantoprazole and ACG guidance both support use when clinically indicated, so I should explicitly counsel that PPIs are not categorically contraindicated in pregnancy and may be used appropriately after failure of conservative measures or when complications warrant therapy [^111juWLs] [^111tdzyi] [^115Skcza].

> Next, I should review potential longer-term child outcomes and related uncertainties. Observational signals linking prenatal acid-suppressive medication exposure to childhood allergic disease attenuate markedly with rigorous control for confounding and sibling comparisons, suggesting that much of the crude association may not be causal, but I need to acknowledge that research is ongoing and definitive randomized safety trials for this specific question are unlikely for ethical reasons, so shared decision-making remains key [^115AgyUi]. Let me also note that PPI exposure in infants and children is associated with increased serious infections, likely via microbiome and acid suppression effects, but this does not directly translate to prenatal exposure risk; nonetheless, it reinforces using the lowest effective dose and avoiding unnecessary therapy across the life course [^117Eiua6]. Finally, although PPIs have been explored as potential therapies in preeclampsia based on mechanistic antiangiogenic effects, randomized data to date do not show clear clinical benefit, which neither supports nor refutes safety but underscores that therapeutic repurposing remains investigational [^112xKFGb].

> Final synthesis and recommendation: I should conclude that PPIs are relatively safe in pregnancy when clinically indicated, with no demonstrated increase in major congenital malformations and no clear increase in miscarriage, while small observational associations with adverse obstetric outcomes are likely influenced by confounding; in practice, use stepwise GERD management and, if a PPI is needed, consider pantoprazole or lansoprazole, start at the lowest effective dose, reassess each trimester, document the indication, and check for drug interactions, particularly avoiding higher interaction-risk agents with clopidogrel when alternatives exist [^112sVzxb] [^111tdzyi] [^117LNZBR] [^115Skcza] [^115gcD9K] [^1161VuS7] [^114t5fhj]. Hold on, let me verify alignment with deprescribing guidance: continue therapy when there is a clear indication and do not discontinue out of disproportionate fear of adverse events; step down when feasible to minimize exposure while maintaining control, and always revisit the need for treatment as pregnancy progresses [^117AFx4X] [^116mRu8j] [^1169hHEv].

---

Overall, **PPIs are considered safe for pregnant patients when clinically indicated** [^115Skcza], with no significant increase in major congenital malformations or spontaneous abortion [^112sVzxb] [^111tdzyi]. Pantoprazole and lansoprazole have the most reassuring human data and **are preferred**; omeprazole is also acceptable if needed [^111tdzyi] [^116JWBPZ] [^117LNZBR]. Use the lowest effective dose and shortest duration, and avoid self-medication or OTC use without medical supervision [^116mRu8j] [^115Snmg4].

## Safety of PPIs during pregnancy

### Congenital malformations and spontaneous abortion

A meta-analysis of 134,940 patients (1,530 exposed, 133,410 unexposed) found **no significant increase in major malformations** (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.86–1.45) or spontaneous abortion (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.84–1.97) with PPI exposure [^112sVzxb]. Pantoprazole [^111tdzyi] and lansoprazole [^116JWBPZ] likewise have reassuring human data, with no significant associations with major malformations or spontaneous abortion.

---

### Maternal and neonatal outcomes

Observational data on maternal and neonatal outcomes suggest small increases in pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and small-for-gestational-age infants with PPI use, which may reflect confounding by indication and comorbidities [^1163KxP8]. However, **no significant association with low Apgar scores or major neonatal complications** has been demonstrated [^113sFaSM].

---

### Long-term outcomes

Limited evidence suggests **no significant long-term adverse outcomes** in children exposed to PPIs in utero, though further research is needed [^115AgyUi].

---

## Recommended PPIs for pregnant patients

| **PPI** | **Pregnancy safety data** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Pantoprazole | - Extensive human data <br/> - No significant increase in malformations or adverse outcomes [^111tdzyi] [^111YzcAZ] | Preferred |
| Lansoprazole | - Extensive human data <br/> - No significant increase in malformations or adverse outcomes [^116JWBPZ] [^117LNZBR] | Preferred |
| Omeprazole | - Acceptable <br/> - Some data suggest slight increase in malformations <br/> - But overall risk is low [^112sVzxb] [^114gqkba] | Acceptable if needed |
| Esomeprazole | - Limited data <br/> - Use if benefits outweigh risks [^116negZi] | Use with caution |
| Rabeprazole | - Limited data <br/> - Use if benefits outweigh risks | Use with caution |

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology [^115Skcza] and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists [^115gcD9K] endorse PPIs for GERD in pregnancy **when clinically indicated**. They also advise using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration and avoiding self-medication or OTC use without supervision [^111niNyf] [^116mRu8j].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

PPIs are generally **well tolerated**; potential risks include hypomagnesemia, vitamin B12 deficiency [^113uXtVA], and an increased risk of enteric infections with long-term use [^114yiYrC]. Notably, no significant increase in major congenital malformations or spontaneous abortion has been demonstrated [^112sVzxb].

---

## Alternative treatments

Lifestyle and dietary modifications are **first-line** for mild GERD in pregnancy [^113JmXa8] [^115Skcza]. Antacids (calcium or magnesium) and H2 receptor antagonists (famotidine) are also safe alternatives [^113JmXa8] [^113NAsgh] [^115gcD9K].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regularly reassess the need for continued **PPI therapy** and document the indication [^114t5fhj] [^111YisHb]. Also monitor for adverse effects, including hypomagnesemia and vitamin B12 deficiency, with prolonged use.

---

PPIs are **safe for pregnant patients when indicated**, with pantoprazole and lansoprazole preferred. Use the lowest effective dose and shortest duration, and avoid unsupervised use.

### The safety of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in pregnancy: A meta-analysis [^112sVzxb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). High credibility.

Heartburn and acid reflux are prevalent medical disorders during pregnancy, often resulting in significant discomfort and complications. Additionally, some pregnant women experience more severe gastrointestinal conditions such as Helicobacter pylori infections, peptic ulcers, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Establishing the fetal safety of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is crucial to permit their use in pregnant patients. This study aims to determine the fetal safety of PPIs during early pregnancy through a systematic literature review.

- **Methods**: All original research assessing the safety of PPIs in pregnancy was sourced from inception to July 2008. Two independent reviewers identified articles, compared results, and resolved differences through consensus. The Downs-Black scale was utilized to assess study quality. Data assessments included congenital malformations, spontaneous abortions, and preterm delivery. The results from included studies were combined using a random effects meta-analysis.

- **Results**: Of the 60 articles identified, seven met our inclusion criteria. The data from 134,940 patients, including 1,530 exposed and 133,410 not exposed to PPIs, indicated an overall odds ratio (OR) for major malformations of 1.12 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.86–1.45). Further analysis showed no increased risk for spontaneous abortions (OR = 1.29, 95% CI: 0.84–1.97), and similarly, no increased risk for preterm delivery (OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.96–1.33). A secondary analysis of 1,341 exposed and 120,137 not exposed to omeprazole alone showed OR and 95% CI for major malformations at 1.17 and 0.

### Protonix delayed-release [^111tdzyi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Available data from published observational studies failed to demonstrate an association between adverse pregnancy-related outcomes and pantoprazole use. Methodological limitations of these observational studies cannot definitely establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy. In a prospective study by the European Network of Teratology Information Services, outcomes from a group of 53 pregnant women administered median daily doses of 40 mg pantoprazole were compared to a control group of 868 pregnant women who did not take any proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). There was no difference in the rate of major malformations between women exposed to PPIs and the control group, corresponding to a relative risk (RR) of 0.55 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08–3.95].

In a population-based retrospective cohort study covering all live births in Denmark from 1996 to 2008, there was no significant increase in major birth defects during analysis of first trimester exposure to pantoprazole in 549 live births. A meta-analysis that compared 1,530 pregnant women exposed to PPIs in at least the first trimester with 133,410 unexposed pregnant women showed no significant increases in risk for congenital malformations or spontaneous abortion with exposure to PPIs (for major malformations OR = 1.12 [95% CI 0.86–1.45] and for spontaneous abortions OR = 1.29 [95% CI 0.84–1.97]).

### Dexilant [^116JWBPZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Dexlansoprazole is the R-enantiomer of lansoprazole. Available data from published observational studies failed to demonstrate an association of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes and lansoprazole use. Methodological limitations of these observational studies cannot definitely establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy.

In a prospective study by the European Network of Teratology Information Services, outcomes from a group of 62 pregnant women administered median daily doses of 30 mg of lansoprazole were compared to a control group of 868 pregnant women who did not take any PPIs. There was no difference in the rate of major malformations between women exposed to PPIs and the control group, corresponding to a relative risk (RR) = 1.04 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25–4.21].

In a population-based retrospective cohort study covering all live births in Denmark from 1996 to 2008, there was no significant increase in major birth defects during the analysis of first trimester exposure to lansoprazole in 794 live births. A meta-analysis that compared 1,530 pregnant women exposed to PPIs in at least the first trimester with 133,410 unexposed pregnant women showed no significant increases in risk for congenital malformations or spontaneous abortion with exposure to PPIs (for major malformations odds ratio (OR) = 1.12 [95% CI 0.86–1.45] and for spontaneous abortions OR = 1.29 [95% CI 0.84–1.97]).

### Safety of proton pump inhibitor exposure [^116GJ4zc]. Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (H(+)/K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase or PPIs) are widely used to treat patients with acid-related disorders because they are generally perceived to be safe and effective. However, as with any pharmacologic agent, they have the potential for side effects. Many studies have examined the side effects of long-term or short-term PPI exposure. This paper reviews the mechanism of action of PPIs, focusing on recently released products that might have greater risks of adverse effects than older products because of increased potency and duration of action. It summarizes the available data on the putative adverse effects of PPI therapy and proposes guidelines for clinicians who prescribe these agents to limit the potential for adverse outcomes in users of these effective therapeutic agents.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases - A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^1161VuS7]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

PPI-related adverse events involve the gastrointestinal tract as well as other organs and systems. The majority of these events have been summarized in comprehensive reviews, to which the reader is referred. The potential risks of long-term PPI therapy, along with the respective evidence summary, are outlined below.

- **Concerns about long-term therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): Digestive system**.

- **Concerns about long-term therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): Extra-digestive effects**.

Gastric pH is relevant for the absorption of several drugs, and its modification by antisecretory therapy may significantly alter their pharmacokinetics. PPIs also influence drug absorption and metabolism by interacting with adenosine triphosphate-dependent P-glycoprotein (e.g. inhibiting digoxin efflux) or with the CYP P450 enzyme system (e.g. decreasing simvastatin metabolism), thereby affecting both intestinal first-pass metabolism and hepatic clearance. A number of studies have shown that omeprazole (and, to a lesser extent, lansoprazole) carries a considerable potential for DDIs, as it has a high affinity for CYP2C19 and a somewhat lower affinity for CYP3A4. In contrast, pantoprazole and rabeprazole display a lower potential for DDIs. Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) therefore represent a molecule-related effect rather than a class-effect.

These interactions are clinically relevant mostly for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. diazepam, warfarin, antipsychotics, etc). In addition, PPI metabolism is very rapid in most Caucasian subjects, categorized as extensive metabolizers.

### Effect of pregnancy on effectiveness of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication [^115aQYjC]. Surgical endoscopy (2006). Low credibility.

Symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are experienced by up to 85% of pregnant women. Some young women on maintenance proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment are choosing surgery to stop their medical treatment and avoid severe symptoms during pregnancy. There are no reports describing the effect of pregnancy on the long-term efficacy of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of pregnancy on the efficacy of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication.

Methods

This study surveyed 146 women of childbearing age with proven GERD who had undergone laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication from 1992 through 2002. The patients who became pregnant (group 1) were compared with those who did not (group 2).

Results

The study focused on 25 patients who became pregnant after surgery. Of these patients, 40% (n = 10) had chosen surgery as a way to discontinue PPI treatment before pregnancy. The mean time from laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication to pregnancy was 25.9 ± 4.6 months. A total of 19 patients (76%) had no reflux symptoms, whereas 5 (20%) required antacids during pregnancy. One patient (4%) experienced an acute intrathoracic stomach migration during her pregnancy and required emergency open surgery, which resulted in the loss of her fetus. After pregnancy, six patients (24%) had recurrence of GERD symptoms, and three (12%) required a redo fundoplication. The higher rate of GERD recurrence (24% vs 16.7%) and redo surgery (12% vs 4%) in group 1 did not reach statistical significance, but showed a definite trend.

### Population-based cohort study: Proton pump inhibitor use during pregnancy in Sweden and the risk of maternal and neonatal adverse events [^1163KxP8]. BMC Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The study was performed using a Swedish cohort including all live singleton births delivered between July 2006 and December 2016. The terms "women" and "mother" were defined based on their biological sex and pregnancy status, not gender identity. The cohort was created by linking information from four high-quality nationwide Swedish health data registries maintained by the National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen): the Medical Birth Registry (established in 1973), the Prescribed Drug Registry (established in July 2005), the Patient Registry (in- and outpatient care), and the Causes of Death Registry (since 1952). Information was linked through the unique Swedish personal identification number. The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee of Stockholm (2017/2423–31) without the need for informed consent because of the registry-based nature of the data.

- **Maternal outcomes**: The maternal outcomes were pre-eclampsia, characterized by hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure > 90 mmHg) combined with proteinuria (24-h urine protein level > 300 mg) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with the onset during pregnancy.

- **Neonatal outcomes**: The neonatal outcomes included preterm birth (birth < 37 weeks of gestation), an Apgar score 5 minutes after birth (AS 5min) < 7, and small (SGA) and large for gestational age (LGA) based on birth weight in the 10th or 90th percentile based on gestational age.

### Population-based cohort study: Proton pump inhibitor use during pregnancy in Sweden and the risk of maternal and neonatal adverse events [^115FwrPf]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Approximately half of all women suffer from heartburn at some stage during pregnancy. The most effective treatment is proton pump inhibitors, but the safety of their use during pregnancy cannot be guaranteed. This study aimed to elucidate the effect of proton pump inhibitors on the risk of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm birth, an Apgar score at 5 minutes below 7, and a child being small or large for its gestational age.

- **Methods**: This Swedish population-based study included 1,089,514 live singleton deliveries between July 2006 and December 2016 in Sweden. Multiple logistic regression was used to model the outcomes as a function of the covariates. Results were presented as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

- **Results**: In 1.4% of all pregnancies, the mother used proton pump inhibitors in the period from 3 months before the last menstrual period up to delivery. The use of proton pump inhibitors was associated with higher odds of pre-eclampsia (odds ratio = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.10–1.29), gestational diabetes mellitus (odds ratio = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.16–1.43), preterm birth (odds ratio = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.14–1.32), and being small for gestational age (odds ratio = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.16–1.40) and lower odds of being large for gestational age (odds ratio = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.77–0.91). No significant association was found with a low Apgar score 5 minutes after birth.

- **Conclusions**: Proton pump inhibitor use was associated with a higher risk of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and being born small for gestational age.

### Individualized prevention of proton pump inhibitor related adverse events by risk stratification [^115SmdVY]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly used for gastric acid-related disorders, but their safety profile and risk stratification for high-burden diseases need further investigation. Analyzing over 2 million participants from five prospective cohorts from the US, the UK, and China, we found that PPI use correlated with increased risk of 15 leading global diseases, such as ischemic heart disease, diabetes, respiratory infections, and chronic kidney disease. These associations showed dose-response relationships and consistency across different PPI types. PPI-related absolute risks increased with baseline risks, with approximately 82% of cases occurring in those at the upper 40% of the baseline predicted risk, and only 11.5% of cases occurring in individuals at the lower 50% of the baseline risk. While statistical association does not necessarily imply causation, its potential safety concerns suggest that personalized use of PPIs through risk stratification might guide appropriate decision-making for patients, clinicians, and the public.

### Population-based cohort study: Proton pump inhibitor use during pregnancy in Sweden and the risk of maternal and neonatal adverse events [^111juWLs]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most effective treatment for heartburn but are contraindicated during pregnancy. Yet, PPIs are still prescribed in approximately 1% of all pregnancies, according to our recent meta-analysis, and are also available over the counter in several countries, including Sweden. Maternal PPI use might affect the child via different mechanisms. PPIs have been shown to cross the placenta, and prenatal exposure to PPIs is seemingly associated with an increased risk of developing childhood asthma.

In addition, the initial gut colonization is highly influenced by the maternal microbiome (vaginal and fecal), which seems to play an important role in the onset of pregnancy complications. In turn, PPI use has been associated with important changes in the gut microbiome, changes that appear more prominent than those related to antibiotic use, even in infants, as shown in our small pilot study. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) used to classify most PPIs as category B drugs ("No risk in animal studies") until 2015, except for omeprazole, which was categorized as type C ("Risk cannot be ruled out"). Recommendations are that omeprazole is not advised during breastfeeding and that it "should be used during pregnancy only if the benefit outweighs the risk to the fetus". There were no reports of teratogenicity, and PPI use was not associated with major adverse pregnancy outcomes or birth defects, but it was related to a lower birth weight and an increased risk of pre-eclampsia. However, our recent meta-analysis reported an increased risk…

### Population-based cohort study: Proton pump inhibitor use during pregnancy in Sweden and the risk of maternal and neonatal adverse events [^114md4fa]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

- **Sensitivity analysis (only firstborns)**: Multiple linear logistic regression was performed for each outcome, including only the firstborn children. Covariates included all previously mentioned maternal characteristics. Pregnancy and obstetric characteristics included were pre-eclampsia, mode of delivery, preterm birth, and neonatal birthweight, excluding covariates considering multiple pregnancies.

- **Use of PPIs at different timepoints (trimesters)**: To determine if the use of PPIs had a different effect depending on the timing of the prescription, the exposure was split into four time periods. The first period ranged from 3 months before up to the last menstrual period (LMP). The time between the LMP and the delivery was divided into trimesters. The first trimester lasted until 97 days after LMP, the second starting at 98 days until 202 days of gestation, and the third trimester ranged from 203 days of gestation to delivery.

- **Dose–response association**: The dose–response association between PPI use and the outcomes was assessed in two models. First, PPI use was replaced by a categorical variable describing the number of prescriptions (≤ 1, 2, 3, ≥ 4). Second, PPI use was described by a categorical variable based on the quantiles of the DDD presented as the number of weeks.

### When is proton pump inhibitor use appropriate [^114qE8Up]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is commonly used outside of Food and Drug Administration indications for a broad range of conditions such as extra-esophageal reflux and PPI-responsive esophageal eosinophilia. While this may be appropriate in some scenarios, it has resulted in widespread inappropriate PPI use. At the same time, data suggesting adverse effects of long-term PPI therapy are increasing, albeit mainly from low-quality studies. The systematic review by Scarpignato et al. addresses this dilemma with a comprehensive analysis of the risks and benefits of PPI use. The authors concluded that, while PPIs are highly efficacious in erosive acid-peptic disorders, this efficacy is not equaled in other conditions. In some instances, they found no supportive evidence of benefit. With respect to side effects, they indicated that the questionable harms associated with PPI therapy do not outweigh the benefits afforded by appropriate PPI use. However, inappropriate PPI use results in increased healthcare costs and unnecessary exposure to potential adverse effects. Ideally, PPI therapy should be personalized, based on indication, effectiveness, patient preference, and risk assessment.

### Deprescribing proton pump inhibitors: Evidence-based clinical practice guideline [^115Snmg4]. Canadian Family Physician Médecin de Famille Canadien (2017). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for deprescribing proton pump inhibitors, particularly with respect to considerations for discontinuation, the CFPC 2017 guidelines recommend decreasing the daily dose or discontinuing PPIs. Alternatively, they advise changing to an on-demand (as-needed) use in adult patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms who have completed a minimum four-week course of PPI treatment, resulting in the resolution of those symptoms.

### Nexium [^116negZi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). High credibility.

In specific populations

- **Pregnancy**: Nexium falls under Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with Nexium in pregnant women. Esomeprazole, the S-isomer of omeprazole, does not show an increased risk of major congenital malformations or other adverse pregnancy outcomes with first trimester use, according to available epidemiologic data. Teratogenicity was not observed in animal reproduction studies when oral esomeprazole magnesium was administered to rats and rabbits at doses approximately 57 and 35 times, respectively, the oral human dose of 40 mg. However, in rats, changes in bone morphology were observed in offspring dosed throughout pregnancy and lactation at doses equal to or greater than approximately 33.6 times the human dose. Hence, Nexium should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

- **Human data**: Esomeprazole is the S-isomer of omeprazole. Four epidemiological studies compared the incidence of congenital abnormalities in infants of women who used omeprazole during pregnancy with those in infants of women exposed to H2-receptor antagonists or other controls.

### Use of proton-pump inhibitors in early pregnancy and the risk of birth defects [^114gqkba]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux are common in pregnancy, but there are limited data on the risk of birth defects associated with exposure to proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) in early pregnancy.

- **Methods**: We conducted a cohort study to assess the association between exposure to PPIs during pregnancy and the risk of major birth defects among all infants born alive in Denmark between January 1996 and September 2008. We linked data from nationwide registries, including individual-level information on exposure to PPIs (prescriptions), birth defects, and potential confounders. Major birth defects, diagnosed within the first year of life, were categorized according to the standardized classification scheme of the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies (EUROCAT). Our primary analyses assessed the use of PPIs from 4 weeks before conception through 12 weeks of gestation and from 0 through 12 weeks of gestation (first trimester).

- **Results**: Among 840,968 live births, 5082 involved exposure to PPIs between 4 weeks before conception and the end of the first trimester of pregnancy. There were 174 major birth defects in infants whose mothers had been exposed to PPIs during this period (3.4%), as compared with 21,811 in the group whose mothers had not been exposed (2.6%). The adjusted prevalence odds ratio was 1.23 (95% confidence interval, 1.05 to 1.44). In analyses limited to exposure during the first trimester, there were 118 major birth defects among 3651 infants exposed to PPIs (3.2%), and the adjusted prevalence odds ratio was 1.10 (95% CI, 0.91 to 1.34).

### Population-based cohort study: proton pump inhibitor use during pregnancy in Sweden and the risk of maternal and neonatal adverse events [^115siwGR]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The study included 1,089,514 live singleton births delivered between July 2006 and December 2016 in Sweden. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were used by 1.4% (n = 14,787) of the women three months before or during gestation. Overall, PPI users were older and had a higher BMI at the start of pregnancy. Among PPI users, the reported obesity rate was almost double (21.6%) compared to PPI non-users (11.7%). Users also had a higher frequency of comorbidities (11.9% of users and 5.8% of non-users) and/or exposure to other drugs than PPIs (53.6% and 31.8%, respectively). The use of PPIs was more prevalent among the third or higher pregnancy of the mother.

- **Descriptive characteristics**: Among PPI users, 4.9% developed pre-eclampsia and 3.2% gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), whereas these complications occurred in 3.3% and 1.4% of pregnancies in non-users, respectively. Children were born preterm in 6.5% of cases and had a low AS 5min score in 1.6% of deliveries among PPI users, compared to 4.6% and 1.2% in non-users, respectively. The birthweight of the child was classified as small for gestational age (SGA) or large for gestational age (LGA) in 3.2% and 3.9% among users, and 2.3% and 3.5% among non-users, respectively.

Comorbidities were defined as at least one diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypo- or hyperthyroidism. Other drugs were defined as at least one prescription of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), low-dose aspirin, or antibiotics three months before or during gestation.

### Receipt of proton-pump inhibitors during pregnancy and risk for preeclampsia [^117GvmQz]. American Journal of Perinatology (2021). Low credibility.

This study aimed to determine whether receiving a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) prescription during pregnancy was associated with a decreased risk for preeclampsia. The Truven Health MarketScan database was utilized to assess the association of receiving a PPI prescription with the risk for preeclampsia. Risk was evaluated based on whether a PPI was prescribed at any time during pregnancy and specifically during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimesters. In addition to evaluating risk for all preeclampsia cases, severe preeclampsia and preterm severe preeclampsia were also assessed. Adjusted models considered risk factors such as chronic hypertension, maternal age, multiple gestations, and diabetes, using adjusted risk ratios (aRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as measures of effect.

A total of 2,755,885 women were included in the analysis, of whom 69,249 (2.5%) were prescribed a PPI during pregnancy. In adjusted models, receiving a PPI prescription at any time during pregnancy (aRR 1.28, 95% CI 1.24–1.32), in the 1st trimester (aRR 1.12, 95% CI 1.04–1.22), in the 2nd trimester (aRR 1.20, 95% CI 1.15–1.26), and in the 3rd trimester (aRR 1.41, 95% CI 1.35–1.47) was associated with an increased risk for preeclampsia. The risk for severe preeclampsia was also significantly increased with PPI prescriptions at any time during pregnancy (aRR 1.21, 95% CI 1.15–1.27), during the 2nd trimester (aRR 1.14, 95% CI 1.06–1.23), and during the 3rd trimester (aRR 1.33, 95% CI 1.24–1.43), but not during the first trimester.

### Prenatal and infant exposure to acid-suppressive medications and risk of allergic diseases in children [^115AgyUi]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Existing observational data have indicated positive associations of acid-suppressive medication (ASM) use in prenatal and early life with allergic diseases in children. However, no study at the time of writing has accounted for confounding by indication or within-familial factors.

The objective of this nationwide cohort study was to evaluate the association of prenatal or infant exposure to ASMs with the risk of allergic diseases in children. The study utilized data from South Korea's National Health Insurance Service mother-child-linked database, covering the period from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2020. Participants included mother-child pairs of neonates born from April 1, 2008, to December 31, 2019.

Prenatal and infant exposure to ASMs, specifically histamine 2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), was the focus. The main outcomes and measures assessed were the composite and individual outcomes of allergic diseases, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and food allergy in children, followed up to 13 years of age. The ASM-exposed individuals were compared with unexposed individuals in propensity score (PS)-matched and sibling-matched analyses to control for various potential confounders and within-familial factors. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models.

The study included 4,149,257 mother-child pairs. Prenatal exposure analyses covered 808,067 PS-matched pairs, with 763,755 receiving H2RAs and 36,529 receiving PPIs, among women with a mean age of 31.8 years (SD 4.2). The PS-matched HR was 1.01 (95% CIs).

### Proton pump inhibitor use and risk of serious infections in young children [^117Eiua6]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use may lead to infections through alteration of the microbiota or direct action on the immune system. However, only a few studies have been conducted in children, with conflicting results.

The objective of this study was to assess the associations between PPI use and serious infections in children, considering overall infections as well as infections by specific sites and pathogens.

This nationwide cohort study was based on the Mother-Child EPI-MERES Register, constructed from the French Health Data System (SNDS). Researchers included all children born between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018, who received treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease or other gastric acid-related disorders. This included medications such as PPIs, histamine 2 receptor antagonists, or antacids/alginate. The index date was defined as the first date any of these medications were dispensed. Children were followed until admission to the hospital for serious infection, loss of follow-up, death, or until December 31, 2019.

PPI exposure over time was analyzed. Associations between serious infections and PPI use were estimated by adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Cox models. PPI use was treated as a time-varying exposure. A 30-day lag was applied to minimize reverse causality. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic data, pregnancy characteristics, child comorbidities, and health care utilization.

The study population comprised 1,262,424 children with a median follow-up of 3.8 years (interquartile range [IQR], 1.8–6.2 years), including 606,645 who received PPIs. Among these, 323,852 were male (53.4%) with a median age at the index date of 88 days.

### Proton pump inhibitor use in infants: FDA reviewer experience [^115c2yQ1]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

The Food and Drug Administration has completed its review of four clinical trials evaluating the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in infants (ages 1 month to < 12 months) for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). An Advisory Committee meeting was held in November 2010 to discuss the potential reasons why PPI use in these trials failed to show a benefit in infants with GERD and directions for future study. The present review summarizes the findings from the clinical trials.

Potential mechanisms for the failed clinical trials are discussed. The safety of long-term use is also examined. As a result of our analysis and review, the authors agree with the Advisory Committee members that PPIs should not be administered to treat the symptoms of GERD in the otherwise healthy infant without evidence of acid-induced disease.

### When is proton pump inhibitor use appropriate [^111FrojA]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is a topic of extensive research, with the literature surrounding both their safety and efficacy growing rapidly. This expansion makes developing a clear, evidence-based guideline on PPI use challenging. In a notable study by Scarpignato et al, committees from three Italian scientific societies collaborated with international expert reviewers to examine 13 clinical scenarios characterized by uncertainty regarding PPI prescription and prevalent drug misuse. They conducted a systematic literature review of nearly 500 papers and presented a narrative review assessing the safety and appropriateness of PPI therapy for each scenario.

Table 1, which is unfortunately not present here, summarizes the key messages about appropriate PPI use across these 13 scenarios, categorizing them as suitable for long-term use, short-term use, or not recommended at all. A striking observation from this compendium is that it includes many applications lacking formal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indications. Nonetheless, the global literature provides substantial evidence supporting the efficacy of PPIs beyond the scope of FDA-approved uses.

### Proton pump inhibitors and the kidney: Implications of current evidence for clinical practice and when and how to deprescribe [^111Psyk6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), long thought to be safe, are associated with a number of non-kidney adverse health outcomes and several untoward kidney outcomes, including hypomagnesemia, acute kidney injury, acute interstitial nephritis, incident chronic kidney disease, kidney disease progression, kidney failure, and increased risk for all-cause mortality and mortality due to chronic kidney disease. PPIs are abundantly prescribed, rarely deprescribed, and frequently purchased over the counter. They are frequently used without medical indication, and when medically indicated, they are often used for much longer than needed.

In this "In Practice" review, we summarize evidence linking PPI use with adverse events in general and adverse kidney outcomes in particular. We review the literature on the association of PPI use and the risk for hypomagnesemia, acute kidney injury, acute interstitial nephritis, incident chronic kidney disease, kidney disease progression, end-stage kidney disease, and death. We provide an assessment of how this evidence should inform clinical practice. We review the impact of this evidence on patients' perception of risk, synthesize PPI deprescription literature, and provide our recommendations on how to approach PPI use and deprescription.

### The effects of proton pump inhibitors during pregnancy on treatment of preeclampsia and related outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112xKFGb]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2024). Low credibility.

This systematic review evaluated the available evidence on the effects of proton pump inhibitors during pregnancy on preeclampsia and related maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes.

Data sources included five electronic databases: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Global Medicus Index, which were searched on November 17, 2023. The study focused on randomized controlled trials involving pregnant women who used any class or dose of proton pump inhibitor.

A meta-analysis was conducted for all outcomes of interest using random-effects models. Results were presented as risk ratios or mean differences. Quality assessment was performed using the Risk of Bias 2 tool, and a Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations assessment was completed to evaluate the certainty of the evidence. The study was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews under identifier CRD42023423673.

The search identified 3879 records that were independently screened by two authors. Nine reports (describing eight trials) met the eligibility criteria; however, six trials were ultimately excluded from the analysis because women were only given proton pump inhibitors immediately before cesarean delivery for acid aspiration prevention. The two trials included in the meta-analysis evaluated the treatment of 177 women with diagnosed preeclampsia. For the primary outcomes, moderate-certainty evidence showed that the use of proton pump inhibitors likely has no effect on the risk for hemolysis.

### Acid secretion from birth to adulthood [^115VpNo7]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

All infants, including premature infants as young as 24 weeks' gestational age, are able to maintain an intragastric pH below 4 from the first day of life. By 24 weeks, maximal acid output approaches that in adults. In adult studies, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are highly effective in relieving reflux symptoms and healing reflux esophagitis. Studies are needed to evaluate PPI efficacy and appropriate dosing in infants and children. Consequences such as hypergastrinemia, bacterial overgrowth, and other potential adverse events associated with long-term PPI use also warrant evaluation in the pediatric population.

### Pantoprazole sodium [^1166Uddy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

- **Data**: Available data from published observational studies failed to demonstrate an association between adverse pregnancy-related outcomes and pantoprazole use. However, the methodological limitations of these observational studies cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy. In a prospective study by the European Network of Teratology Information Services, outcomes from a group of 53 pregnant women administered median daily doses of 40 mg pantoprazole were compared to a control group of 868 pregnant women who did not take any proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). There was no difference in the rate of major malformations between women exposed to PPIs and the control group, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.55 [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.08–3.95]. In a population-based retrospective cohort study covering all live births in Denmark from 1996 to 2008, there was no significant increase in major birth defects during the analysis of first trimester exposure to pantoprazole in 549 live births. A meta-analysis that compared 1,530 pregnant women exposed to PPIs in at least the first trimester with 133,410 unexposed pregnant women showed no significant increases in risk.

### Are proton-pump inhibitors harmful for the semen quality of men in couples who are planning pregnancy [^115G6v8w]. Fertility and Sterility (2016). Low credibility.

To determine associations between proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) use and semen parameters in young men of couples who are planning pregnancy, a case-control study utilizing a population-based registry was conducted.

General practitioner patients comprising 2,473 men from couples planning pregnancy with a recorded semen analysis were included: 241 with a low total motile sperm count (TMSC ≤ 1) and 714 with TMSC > 1 as matched controls. No interventions were applied.

- **Main outcome measures**: Exposure to PPI and PPI dosage.

The study analyzed data from the Integrated Primary Care Information database in the Netherlands, which includes medical records of 1.5 million patients from 720 general practitioners. It found that using PPIs in the period between 12 and 6 months before semen analysis was associated with a threefold higher risk of low TMSC (odds ratio 2.96; 95% confidence interval 1.26–6.97), adjusted for age and other medication. However, the use of PPIs during the 6 months immediately before the semen analysis was not statistically significantly associated with low TMSC.

In conclusion, the use of PPIs in the period 12 to 6 months preceding semen analysis is linked with a threefold higher risk of low TMSC. This suggests that a long-term increase in gastric pH may result in a decline in sperm quality. These findings underscore the need for more preconceptional research and counseling on the potential effects of medication use on semen quality.

### Population-based cohort study: proton pump inhibitor use during pregnancy in Sweden and the risk of maternal and neonatal adverse events [^11734saC]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

**Dose–response association**: Women with two prescriptions (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.09–1.36) or three prescriptions (OR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.11–1.52) had higher odds of pre-eclampsia compared to non-users. An increased odds of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) was associated with any number of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) prescriptions, yet there were no large differences in the odds of GDM between the different categories. All prescriptions increased the odds of preterm birth, with three prescriptions (OR = 1.56, 95% CI 1.37–1.78) having a more significant effect compared to two (OR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.01–1.23) or at least four (OR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.03–1.36) prescriptions. The odds of small for gestational age (SGA) were higher in women with two (OR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.14–1.49) or at least four (OR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.05–1.56) prescriptions compared to non-users, and the effect was not higher in women with four or more prescriptions than in women with two prescriptions. Filling two prescriptions was significantly associated with lower odds of large for gestational age (LGA) (OR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.71–0.92).

### Individualized prevention of proton pump inhibitor related adverse events by risk stratification [^111A1AG3]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly used for gastric acid-related disorders, but their safety profile and risk stratification for high-burden diseases need further investigation. Analyzing over 2 million participants from five prospective cohorts from the US, the UK, and China, we found that PPI use correlated with increased risk of 15 leading global diseases, such as ischemic heart disease, diabetes, respiratory infections, and chronic kidney disease. These associations showed dose-response relationships and consistency across different PPI types. PPI-related absolute risks increased with baseline risks, with approximately 82% of cases occurring in those at the upper 40% of the baseline predicted risk, and only 11.5% of cases occurring in individuals at the lower 50% of the baseline risk. While statistical association does not necessarily imply causation, its potential safety concerns suggest that personalized use of PPIs through risk stratification might guide appropriate decision-making for patients, clinicians, and the public.

### Protonix delayed-release [^115eHfoY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Available data from published observational studies failed to demonstrate an association of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes and pantoprazole use. Methodological limitations of these observational studies cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy.

In a prospective study by the European Network of Teratology Information Services, outcomes from a group of 53 pregnant women administered median daily doses of 40 mg pantoprazole were compared to a control group of 868 pregnant women who did not take any proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). There was no difference in the rate of major malformations between women exposed to PPIs and the control group, corresponding to a relative risk (RR) = 0.55 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08–3.95].

In a population-based retrospective cohort study covering all live births in Denmark from 1996 to 2008, there was no significant increase in major birth defects during analysis of first-trimester exposure to pantoprazole in 549 live births.

A meta-analysis that compared 1,530 pregnant women exposed to PPIs in at least the first trimester with 133,410 unexposed pregnant women showed no significant increases in risk for congenital malformations or spontaneous abortion with exposure to PPIs (for major malformations OR = 1.12 [95% CI 0.86–1.45] and for spontaneous abortions OR = 1.29 [95% CI 0.84–1.97]).

### Proton pump inhibitors: placing putative adverse effects in proper perspective [^113FTRdk]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

This review summarizes the past year's literature, both clinical and basic science, regarding potential adverse effects of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).

- **Recent findings**: PPIs are among the most widely prescribed and over-prescribed medications worldwide. Although generally considered well-tolerated, epidemiologic studies that mine large databases have reported a panoply of putative adverse effects associated with PPIs. It should be emphasized that the quality of the evidence underlying most of these associations is very low, and the studies, by design, cannot ascribe cause and effect. These associations continue to be sensationalized in the media and misinterpreted by providers and patients. The unintended consequences are that patients who require PPIs, such as those taking dual antiplatelet agents, are not being prescribed or taking these necessary medications. In addition, physicians are spending an inordinate amount of additional time placing these findings into proper perspective for their patients and reassuring them upon initiating PPI treatment as well as at every follow-up visit.

- **Summary**: Most of the recent publicized putative serious adverse effects attributed to PPIs rely on observational data and have not been confirmed in prospective randomized trials. Nevertheless, PPIs should be prescribed for valid indications, and when prescribed long-term, they should be used at the lowest effective dose, with the need for their use periodically reassessed.

### Complications of proton pump inhibitor therapy [^1144tdE6]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Safety issues associated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have recently attracted widespread media and public attention. Gastroenterologists are frequently asked about the appropriateness of PPI therapy for specific patients. Furthermore, some patients may have had their PPI therapy discontinued abruptly or inappropriately due to safety concerns.

Faced with a wide variety of potentially serious adverse consequences, prescribers need to evaluate the evidence objectively to discern whether any reported association might actually be causal. In this context, we review many of the proposed adverse consequences of PPI therapy and apply established criteria for determining causation. We also consider the potential contribution of residual confounding in many of the reported studies.

Evidence remains inadequate to establish causal relationships between PPI therapy and many of the proposed associations. Residual confounding related to study design and the overextrapolation of quantitatively small estimates of effect size have likely contributed to much of the controversy surrounding PPI safety. Consequently, this has led to unnecessary concern among patients and prescribers.

The benefits of PPI therapy for appropriate indications should be weighed against the likelihood of the proposed risks. Patients with a proven indication for a PPI should continue to receive it in the lowest effective dose. However, PPI dose escalation and continued chronic therapy in those unresponsive to initial empiric therapy is discouraged.

### Population-based cohort study: Proton pump inhibitor use during pregnancy in Sweden and the risk of maternal and neonatal adverse events [^114qXa8B]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The study assessed the association between the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and various maternal and neonatal outcomes, presenting these relationships as odds ratios compared to non-users.

- **Abbreviations**: AS 5min, Apgar score 5 minutes after birth; DDD, defined daily doses; GDM, gestational diabetes; LGA, large for gestational age; PPI, proton pump inhibitor; SGA, small for gestational age.

A defined daily dose (DDD) up to and including 36 weeks increased the odds of developing pre-eclampsia compared to non-users. There was no significant difference found between the different categories. DDDs up to 20 weeks and over 36 weeks were associated with higher odds of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), without differences across the categories. No association was found between a DDD of 20–36 weeks and the odds of GDM. PPI use longer than 12 weeks was associated with an increased odds of preterm birth and SGA, but no large differences were observed between the DDD categories. A slight decrease in the odds of LGA was associated with a DDD of 0–12 weeks (OR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.69–0.97), 20–36 weeks (OR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.66–0.95), and more than 36 weeks (OR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.70–0.98).

### The risks and benefits of long-term use of proton pump inhibitors: Expert review and best practice advice from the American Gastroenterological Association [^111YisHb]. Gastroenterology (2017). High credibility.

The purpose of this review is to evaluate the risks associated with long-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). It focuses on the long-term use of PPIs for three common indications: gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett's esophagus (BE), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) bleeding prophylaxis.

- **Methods**: The recommendations outlined in this review are based on expert opinion and relevant publications from PubMed, EMbase, and the Cochrane Library (through July 2016). To identify relevant ongoing trials, we queried various databases.

### Adverse event reporting for proton pump inhibitor therapy: An overview of systematic reviews [^113uXtVA]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

To assist clinicians in counseling patients regarding the risk of adverse events from proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), this research synthesizes evidence from published systematic reviews of antireflux therapy.

- **Data sources**: Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PubMed, Web of Knowledge.

- **Review methods**: The overview is based on PRISMA reporting standards (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) of English-language meta-analyses and systematic reviews of PPI therapy for reflux disease through December 2014. Two independent investigators assessed study eligibility, rated the review quality with AMSTAR criteria (assessing the methodological quality of systematic reviews), and abstracted data for adverse events.

- **Results**: Thirty-three systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. The most commonly reported adverse events were community-acquired pneumonia (odds ratios, 1.04–1.92), with a greater association noted with shorter duration of therapy and higher doses. Hip fractures were also associated with PPI use (odds ratios, 1.16–1.50), especially with long-term therapy. Enteric infection with Clostridium difficile was more common with PPI therapy (odds ratios, 1.69–1.33). Other less commonly reported adverse events included electrolyte and vitamin deficiency. Risk factors for adverse events are detailed in the text.

- **Conclusion**: Our overview shows that PPI therapy is associated with significant and potentially serious adverse events that should be discussed with patients. The effect sizes and risk factors provided should facilitate this discussion and promote shared decision-making.

### Efficacy and safety measurements of proton pump inhibitors in infants and children [^112m2EBo]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

The design of studies to evaluate the efficacy of acid-lowering drugs in children differs significantly from study designs in adult populations. Efficacy measurements may be less extensive than those used in adult studies due to limitations secondary to concerns for patient safety, parental and institutional review board acceptance of efficacy endpoints, and existing standards of care within the pediatric gastroenterology community. Study designs involving patients who would routinely receive acid-lowering therapy have been successfully used to characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of acid-lowering therapies, such as H2 receptor antagonists, and have led to pediatric labeling for these drugs. This approach may likewise be used in the study of newer acid-lowering agents, such as proton pump inhibitors.

### Population-based cohort study: Proton pump inhibitor use during pregnancy in Sweden and the risk of maternal and neonatal adverse events [^111sbMpP]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Our results are consistent with previous studies relating proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use to a higher (or not reduced) risk of pre-eclampsia and low birth weight. In contrast to our results, other observational studies have reported no significant relation between PPI use and low birth weight and/or preterm birth. However, compared to this large nationwide study, both studies had a much lower number of observations and mainly focused on major anomalies.

To our knowledge, there are no randomized clinical trials investigating the safety of maternal PPI use regarding maternal and neonatal adverse events. We also question if it is still ethically defendable to conduct these trials on PPI use during pregnancy, given the accumulating safety concerns based on association studies and our increasing understanding of drug interactions and the microbiome.

- **Adverse events**: The maternal and neonatal adverse events investigated can affect the short- and long-term health of both the mother and the child. Pre-eclampsia is a cause of worldwide maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has previously been associated with an increased frequency of maternal hypertensive disorders and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes after pregnancy. GDM has been associated with the child having a higher odds of developing obesity, glucose intolerance, and diabetes in late adolescence and young adulthood. Preterm birth is a major cause of neonatal and infant morbidity. Children who are too small or too light at birth have a higher risk of hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus later in life, and a lower quality of life.

### Proton pump inhibitors decrease soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 and soluble endoglin secretion, decrease hypertension, and rescue endothelial dysfunction [^113oMXif]. Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Preeclampsia is a severe complication of pregnancy. Antiangiogenic factors soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and soluble endoglin are secreted in excess from the placenta, causing hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, and multiorgan injury. Oxidative stress and vascular inflammation exacerbate the endothelial injury. A drug that can block these pathophysiological steps would be an attractive treatment option. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are safe in pregnancy where they are prescribed for gastric reflux.

We performed functional studies on primary human tissues and animal models to examine the effects of PPIs on sFlt-1 and soluble endoglin secretion, vessel dilatation, blood pressure, and endothelial dysfunction. PPIs decreased sFlt-1 and soluble endoglin secretion from trophoblast, placental explants from preeclamptic pregnancies, and endothelial cells. They also mitigated tumor necrosis factor-α-induced endothelial dysfunction: PPIs blocked endothelial vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression, leukocyte adhesion to endothelium, and disruption of endothelial tube formation. PPIs decreased endothelin-1 secretion and enhanced endothelial cell migration.

Interestingly, the PPI esomeprazole vasodilated maternal blood vessels from normal pregnancies and cases of preterm preeclampsia, but its vasodilatory effects were lost when the vessels were denuded of their endothelium. Esomeprazole decreased blood pressure in a transgenic mouse model where human sFlt-1 was overexpressed in the placenta. PPIs upregulated endogenous antioxidant defenses and decreased cytokine secretion.

### Association between proton pump inhibitor use during early pregnancy and risk of congenital malformations [^1171Zw93]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the use of pantoprazole sodium IV (also known as Protonix, Protonix) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if clearly needed. Evidence of fetal harm in animals has been observed. The drug pantoprazole sodium IV is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy.

This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus being observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### Proton pump inhibitor use and risk of serious infections in young children [^11552xqH]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

We included all children born between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018, who received their first-time treatment for GERD or other gastric acid-related disorders, namely PPIs (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical [ATC] code A02BC), histamine 2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs; ATC code A02BA), or antacids/alginate (ATC codes A02A, A02BX13), between birth and December 31, 2019. These drugs share the same indications, so restricting the study population to children receiving these treatments at baseline would mitigate residual confounding. Only PPIs dramatically reduce gastric acid secretion and are therefore most likely to lead to infections. The index date was defined as the first date any of these medications was dispensed.

Children were excluded if they did not receive any outpatient care before the index date or if their mother did not receive any outpatient care in the year before the start of pregnancy. These criteria ensured a sufficient time window to identify comorbidities. Children were also excluded if they had a history of perinatal infection (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision [ICD-10] codes P35 to P39) or other serious infection (ICD-10 codes in eTable 1 in Supplement 1) identified during an inpatient stay before the index date.

Children were followed up until the occurrence of a serious infection, loss of follow-up (censored 1 year after the last date of outpatient care), death, or December 31, 2019, whichever came first.

### Prevacid SoluTab [^116r8GgE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Available data from published observational studies overall do not indicate an association of adverse pregnancy outcomes with lansoprazole treatment (see Data). In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lansoprazole to rats during organogenesis through lactation at 6.4 times the maximum recommended human dose produced reductions in the offspring in femur weight, femur length, crown-rump length, and growth plate thickness (males only) on postnatal Day 21 (see Data). These effects were associated with a reduction in body weight gain. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

If Prevacid or Prevacid SoluTab is administered with clarithromycin, the pregnancy information for clarithromycin also applies to the combination regimen. Refer to the prescribing information for clarithromycin for more information on use in pregnancy.

Available data from published observational studies failed to demonstrate an association of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes and lansoprazole use. Methodological limitations of these observational studies cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy.

### A COX-2-specific inhibitor plus a proton-pump inhibitor: is this a reasonable approach to reduction in NSAIDs' GI toxicity [^11142sZW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

The two prevailing approaches to decrease risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-associated gastrointestinal (GI) events are the use of a COX-2 inhibitor or co-therapy with a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). A major limitation of each approach is that, in patients at the highest risk for NSAID-induced ulcers, neither treatment is effective when used as a stand-alone strategy. An important question is whether combination therapy with a COX-2 inhibitor plus a PPI has improved GI safety compared to a traditional NSAID plus a PPI. This study evaluated high GI risk patients who were taking, along with their NSAID or COX-2 inhibitor, either the PPI, esomeprazole, or the placebo.

It confirms that our approach of adding PPIs to reduce NSAIDs' ulcer risks is an effective strategy. However, this study did not show a safety advantage for using a COX-2 inhibitor instead of a traditional NSAID in high GI risk patients who take PPIs. Thus, there continues to be no prospective data to support a GI benefit of COX-2 inhibitor plus a PPI over traditional NSAID plus a PPI in high-risk patients.

### Recent safety concerns with proton pump inhibitors [^112QZmP1]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

There have been recent concerns about the safety of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). We focus here on three specific concerns: the possible interaction between PPIs and clopidogrel, the postulated link between PPI use and fractures, and the possibility that long-term PPI use might lead to hypomagnesemia. There is evidence for an in vitro interaction between clopidogrel and at least some PPIs. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned against the use of certain PPIs by patients on clopidogrel. However, a randomized controlled trial that compared clopidogrel alone with the combination of clopidogrel and omeprazole found no increase in adverse cardiovascular outcomes and a reduction in the rate of adverse gastrointestinal outcomes attributable to omeprazole.

PPI use may be a weak risk factor for certain fractures, but the quality of evidence is relatively poor, and there is a strong possibility of confounding. The mechanism whereby PPI use might increase fracture risk is unknown. Currently, no additional measures concerning calcium supplementation or bone mineral density monitoring are recommended for patients on a PPI. The FDA has suggested monitoring serum magnesium levels in patients on PPI therapy. The mechanism and frequency of PPI-induced hypomagnesemia are unclear.

PPI treatment should not be withheld from patients who genuinely require it, but the PPI should be taken in the lowest effective dose and only for as long as clinically indicated. The same is, of course, true for all medicines. The benefits of PPI therapy greatly outweigh the risks.

### When is proton pump inhibitor use appropriate [^11733SbJ]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is commonly used outside of Food and Drug Administration indication for a broad range of conditions, such as extra-esophageal reflux and PPI-responsive esophageal eosinophilia. While this may be appropriate in some scenarios, it has also resulted in widespread inappropriate PPI use. Concurrently, data suggesting adverse effects of long-term PPI therapy are multiplying, albeit mainly from low-quality studies.

The systematic review by Scarpignato et al. addresses this dilemma with a comprehensive analysis of the risks and benefits of PPI use. The authors concluded that, while PPIs are highly efficacious in erosive acid-peptic disorders, efficacy is not equaled in other conditions. In some instances, they found no supportive evidence of benefit. Regarding side effects, they indicated that the questionable harms associated with PPI therapy do not outweigh the benefits afforded by appropriate PPI use. However, inappropriate PPI use results in increased healthcare costs and unnecessary exposure to potential adverse effects. Ideally, PPI therapy should be personalized, based on indication, effectiveness, patient preference, and risk assessment.

### Population-based cohort study: Proton pump inhibitor use during pregnancy in Sweden and the risk of maternal and neonatal adverse events [^112iaRj5]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

In this large Swedish population-based study, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use shortly before and during pregnancy was associated with a higher probability of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preterm birth, and being born small for gestational age (SGA). The analysis of only the firstborn child of a mother yielded similar results. Differences in the outcomes were observed based on the different exposure periods of all pregnancies.

PPI use from three months before the last menstrual period (LMP) until the end of the first trimester was associated with increased odds of preterm birth and SGA. Similarly, the odds of preterm birth were higher when PPIs were used during the second trimester. PPI use in the second and third trimesters was associated with higher odds of pre-eclampsia. No evidence for a dose–response relationship between PPI use and any of the outcomes was found.

### AGA clinical practice update on de-prescribing of proton pump inhibitors: Expert review [^117AFx4X]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for deprescribing proton pump inhibitors, specifically with respect to indications for discontinuation, the AGA 2022 guidelines recommend deciding on discontinuing PPIs solely based on the lack of an indication for PPI therapy and not due to concerns about PPI-associated adverse events. Clinicians should not consider the presence of a PPI-associated adverse event, a history of such events in a PPI user, or the presence of underlying risk factors for the development of a PPI-associated adverse event as independent indications for PPI withdrawal.

### Protonix delayed-release [^111YzcAZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Available data from published observational studies did not demonstrate an association of major malformations or other adverse pregnancy outcomes with pantoprazole.

- **Animal reproduction studies**: No evidence of adverse developmental outcomes was observed with pantoprazole. Studies have been performed on rats at oral doses up to 450 mg/kg/day (about 88 times the recommended human dose) and rabbits at oral doses up to 40 mg/kg/day (about 16 times the recommended human dose) with administration during organogenesis in pregnant animals. These studies revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to pantoprazole (see Data).

- **Pre- and postnatal development toxicity study in rats**: Additional endpoints to evaluate the effect on bone development were included. Oral pantoprazole doses of 5, 15, and 30 mg/kg/day (approximately 1, 3, and 6 times the human dose of 40 mg/day) were administered to pregnant females from gestation day 6 through lactation day 21. Changes in bone morphology were observed in pups exposed to pantoprazole in utero and through milk during lactation, as well as by oral dosing from postnatal day 4 through day 21 [see Use in specific populations (8.4)]. There were no drug-related findings in maternal animals.

Advise pregnant women of the potential risk of fetal harm. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes.

### How to advise patients on the risk of chronic proton pump inhibitor therapy [^114yiYrC]. Current opinion in gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely prescribed and have excellent short-term tolerability. Administrative database studies have highlighted that many diseases are associated with PPI therapy, including pneumonia, fracture, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. This review, therefore, examines the evidence of the risks and benefits of these drugs.

There is high-to-moderate quality evidence that PPIs are effective at treating many acid-related disorders. Recent randomized trials have suggested that the associations between PPIs and various diseases are likely related to bias and residual confounding, and these drugs appear to be safe apart from a possible increased risk of enteric infections.

PPIs should be used at the lowest dose and for the shortest duration possible. They are still relatively well-tolerated drugs but should only be prescribed for proven indications.

### National study of off-label proton pump inhibitor use among New Zealand infants in the first year of life (2005–2012) [^113qp2cj]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

The off-label prescribing of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) to infants to treat symptoms attributed to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is widely reported, despite evidence that PPIs are no more effective than a placebo in relieving those symptoms. To initiate discussion about the appropriate prescribing of these drugs for infants, we describe the characteristics of PPI use among infants in New Zealand.

In this population-based study, we used routinely collected dispensing data to identify all children born between 2005 and 2012 who were dispensed a government-subsidized PPI, such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, or pantoprazole, before their first birthday. Unique patient identifiers were used to link administrative datasets containing patient-level demographic, dispensing, and health information.

In total, 22,643 children were dispensed a study PPI before their first birthday. The prevalence of infant PPI use, as a proportion of all live births, increased from 2.4% for children born in 2005 to 5.2% for children born in 2012. Overall, 71.6% of infants were dispensed a PPI by 3 months of age, and 8.7% received a PPI within the first month of life. Before PPI initiation, only 7.0% of infants had a hospital-based diagnosis of GERD (with or without esophagitis), and 4.7% of infants had a hospital-based diagnosis of one or more known or suspected GERD risk factors.

Off-label prescribing of PPIs to New Zealand infants was relatively common and increased over the study period. The appropriateness of PPI treatment should be questioned, as the majority of infants did not have a confirmed diagnosis of GERD before receiving PPI medication.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases - A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^113xcsf1]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Despite proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) carrying some risks, like any other class of drugs, they should not be denied to patients who are likely to benefit from them merely because of concerns about potential adverse effects. Generally, there is an equivalence between the acceptable burden of adverse effects and the severity of the illness being treated. However, patients with acid-related diseases are often otherwise "healthy" individuals, taking drugs for a specific condition. The questions arise: What level of undesirable effects would be acceptable for them, and who will bear the cost of treating any ensuing iatrogenic disease? A number of simple and potentially effective preventive measures should be recommended to minimize some (if not all) safety concerns.

First and foremost, PPI therapy should be evidence-based. Decisions on whether to initiate or continue PPI therapy should be grounded in sound reasoning, and PPIs should only be prescribed when there is an appropriate clinical indication. Clinical guidelines can certainly help. In this position paper, available guidelines, together with the systematic reviews and meta-analyses used to generate them, have been reviewed and synthesized into several statements, representing summaries of the evidence.

Guidelines rely on both evidence and expert opinion; they are neither infallible nor a substitute for clinical judgment. However, they extend beyond systematic reviews to recommend specific actions for particular clinical circumstances.

### Population-based cohort study: Proton pump inhibitor use during pregnancy in Sweden and the risk of maternal and neonatal adverse events [^114K1rKg]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Our large study suggests an increase in the risk of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preterm birth, and small for gestational age (SGA) associated with maternal proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use during pregnancy. Therefore, we believe PPIs should be prescribed more cautiously and only used under clinical supervision during pregnancy.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases - A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^111ofaxZ]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the safest classes of drugs. Although concerns have been raised regarding their long-term safety, the preponderance of evidence does not strongly support these concerns publicized over the last few years, and the absolute risk is probably low. Some adverse effects are plausible and predictable, while others are idiosyncratic, unpredictable, and rare. Based on the quality of the existing evidence, the benefits of PPI treatment outweigh the potential risks in most patients, especially when PPI use is based on a relevant and appropriate indication. Conversely, patients treated without an appropriate therapeutic indication are only exposed to potential risks, and the benefit-to-harm balance becomes very low. Consequently, the overall focus should be on the appropriateness of PPI therapy and on a regular assessment of the need for continued PPI treatment.

Nearly all adverse outcomes associated with PPIs occur among patients who receive long-term therapy. Minimizing the duration of treatment by periodically reviewing a patient's need for acid-suppressive therapy could eliminate or substantially reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. Therefore, during continued long-term use, the clinical effects should always be reviewed, and attempts should be made to stop any therapy that may not be needed. It is imperative to use the lowest dose of the drug required to achieve the desired therapeutic goals. This may entail implementing discontinuation of treatment in asymptomatic patients, as well as step-down, intermittent, or on-demand PPI therapy for maintenance of GERD.

### Protonixi.v [^116tzjpY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Available data from published observational studies failed to demonstrate an association of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes and pantoprazole use. Methodological limitations of these observational studies cannot definitively establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy.

In a prospective study by the European Network of Teratology Information Services, outcomes from a group of 53 pregnant women administered median daily doses of 40 mg pantoprazole were compared to a control group of 868 pregnant women who did not take any proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). There was no difference in the rate of major malformations between women exposed to PPIs and the control group, corresponding to a relative risk (RR) of 0.55 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08–3.95].

In a population-based retrospective cohort study covering all live births in Denmark from 1996 to 2008, there was no significant increase in major birth defects during analysis of first-trimester exposure to pantoprazole in 549 live births.

A meta-analysis that compared 1,530 pregnant women exposed to PPIs in at least the first trimester with 133,410 unexposed pregnant women showed no significant increases in risk for congenital malformations or spontaneous abortion with exposure to PPIs, for major malformations (OR = 1.12, [95% CI 0.86–1.45]) and for spontaneous abortions (OR = 1.29 [95% CI 0.84–1.97]).

### Therapy insight: Drugs for gastrointestinal disorders in pregnant women [^115aPZyE]. Nature Clinical Practice. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

The management and treatment of gastrointestinal ailments in pregnant women requires special attention and expertise, since the safety of the mother, fetus, and neonate remains the primary focus. Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy are common, as is symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease. Peptic ulcer disease occurs less frequently and with fewer complications. Gastroenterologists and obstetricians should be familiar with safe treatment options for these conditions because they can profoundly impair the quality of life of pregnant women.

During pregnancy, constipation can develop de novo, or chronic constipation can increase in severity. Given the array of therapies for constipation, physicians must apprise themselves of drugs that are safe for both mother and fetus. Management of acute, self-limited diarrhea should focus on supportive therapy, dietary changes, and maintenance of hydration. Treatment of chronic diarrhea should be considered in the context of therapy for the underlying disorder. Inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome present a unique therapeutic challenge — control the disease while minimizing toxicity to the fetus and mother. Initiation and alteration of medical therapy for gastrointestinal disorders during pregnancy must be undertaken after discussion with the patient's obstetrician.

### Gastrointestinal diseases during pregnancy: What does the gastroenterologist need to know [^113JmXa8]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is reported by 40–85% of pregnant women, usually beginning at the end of the first trimester, and can profoundly impair the quality of life. When present, GERD persists during the entire pregnancy and usually resolves after delivery. Complications such as erosive esophagitis, bleeding, or strictures are rarely described. For mild symptoms, lifestyle and dietary modifications are recommended. Conservative measures include avoiding eating late at night, elevating the head of the bed by 10–15 cm, and lying on the left side. If symptoms persist, medication may be necessary.

First-line treatment is based on antacids. Antacids containing calcium and magnesium are considered safe in pregnancy. Furthermore, patients prefer to use this medication because it relieves the symptoms promptly and can be taken on demand. No teratogenic effects of these drugs have been observed in animal studies. Bicarbonate-containing agents, such as sodium bicarbonate, should be avoided as they can precipitate metabolic alkalosis and fluid overload in the mother and fetus. A further concern with aluminum antacids is the potential developmental retardation described when women take high doses of this medication. The potential fetal toxicity when using sucralfate is associated with its aluminum component. However, no maternal or fetal adverse effects have been observed, and therefore sucralfate is usually considered safe during pregnancy. Histamine type 2 antagonists are often the next-line therapy. Both cimetidine and ranitidine have been used with excellent safety records.

### Population-based cohort study: Proton pump inhibitor use during pregnancy in Sweden and the risk of maternal and neonatal adverse events [^113sFaSM]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Use of PPIs and the risk of maternal and neonatal health effects were investigated. The use of PPIs increased the odds of the mother developing pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) by 19% and 29%, respectively, compared to non-users (OR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.10–1.29 and OR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.16–1.43). The neonate of a PPI user had an odds ratio (OR) of 1.23 (95% CI 1.14–1.32) for being born preterm compared to non-users. The odds of a low Apgar score at 5 minutes were not significantly affected by maternal PPI use. The use of PPIs increased the odds of a small for gestational age (SGA) child (OR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.16–1.40), while it was associated with a decrease in the odds for large for gestational age (LGA) (OR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.77–0.91).
