## Question

How is allergy testing performed?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how allergy testing is performed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial history and determining pretest probability. Then, I should decide which test modality fits the suspected mechanism and allergen. Next, I will review how to perform and interpret skin prick testing and in vitro specific IgE. After that, I will consider advanced tools like component-resolved diagnostics and the basophil activation test. I will then examine oral food challenges and drug provocation testing as reference standards. Finally, I will integrate interpretation principles, special considerations, and post-test management including delabeling and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: allergy testing must be driven by a careful, hypothesis-generating clinical history that clarifies the likely mechanism and sets a pretest probability, because sensitization on testing does not equal clinical allergy and indiscriminate panels increase false positives and harm through unnecessary avoidance [^112F2tg3] [^111y6V85] [^116yzMZG]. Hold on, I should verify the primary care context too; even when serum testing is accessible, guidelines still emphasize ordering only when the history supports a likely IgE-mediated disorder, such as allergic rhinitis or food allergy, and using testing to confirm rather than screen broadly [^115pTW3p] [^114H12rS] [^1179ybNF].

> Next, I should review how to choose the modality based on mechanism and allergen, because that determines both diagnostic yield and safety. For suspected IgE-mediated disease to foods or aeroallergens, skin prick testing is usually first-line, with serum specific IgE as an alternative if antihistamines cannot be stopped or the skin is unsuitable, and both must be interpreted in light of the history to estimate post-test probability, not to stand alone as a diagnosis [^115Z4Kfp] [^1117TTvA]. For allergic contact dermatitis, patch testing is the gold standard, and I need to ensure relevance by testing allergens that match exposure risk to keep pretest probability high [^116sV1ry] [^115sB5n3]. For drug allergy, particularly beta-lactams, structured skin testing and appropriately selected challenges are central, while for stinging insect hypersensitivity, venom skin testing and serum venom-specific IgE confirm sensitization and eligibility for immunotherapy in those with systemic reactions [^1122ipg2] [^117HVXcf] [^114p8EcA].

> I will now examine skin prick testing technique and interpretation because errors here can misclassify patients. Wait, let me verify the steps: hold antihistamines with adequate washout, use validated extracts on volar forearm or back with positive and negative controls, and read at about 15 minutes with mean wheal diameter measured carefully; a wheal at least 3 mm greater than the negative control is generally considered positive, yet positivity indicates sensitization and must be tied back to symptoms on exposure to establish true allergy [^115Z4Kfp] [^111x4Mg1]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a uniform 3 mm threshold always guides risk, but I should correct that; for some foods and ages, larger wheal sizes are used for high positive predictive value, such as peanut SPT around 8 mm and milk thresholds higher than 3 mm, and smaller cutoffs may apply in infants, so I need to align interpretation with validated cut points and the clinical context rather than use size to predict reaction severity [^115dzhJo] [^115RvxXs] [^112TAh8P].

> Hold on, I should verify intradermal testing indications, because it is not interchangeable with prick testing. Intradermal testing is more sensitive but less specific and carries higher risk of false positives; it is reserved for settings like drug allergy when prick tests are negative but suspicion remains, and it should not be used to diagnose food allergy initially, which I almost overstated before correcting myself here [^115tkK4Y] [^114tcwBE]. Let me consider that for inhalant allergy as well, prick testing or serum IgE typically suffices, so unnecessary intradermals can mislead and should be avoided [^111x4Mg1].

> Next, I should review in vitro specific IgE testing and interpretation. Modern assays quantify down to around 0.1 kUA/L, but the clinical meaning of a low-level positive depends entirely on the pretest probability and known predictive values; high PPV thresholds exist for some foods, like peanut around 15 kU/L in high-risk populations, but at low pretest probability even modest positives are often false and should not prompt unwarranted avoidance without corroborating history or challenge [^114ft5BY] [^115dzhJo] [^115HTUGD]. I need to ensure I reiterate that sensitization is a risk marker, not a diagnosis, and that post-test probabilities can be estimated with likelihood ratios when data are available to guide the need for challenge [^111y6V85] [^115HTUGD].

> Let me think about advanced diagnostics next. Component-resolved diagnostics can sharpen specificity and reduce oral food challenges when component-risk relationships are well validated, for example, Ara h 2 for peanut or storage proteins for certain tree nuts, though cutoffs vary across populations and cannot be applied indiscriminately, so I should confirm external validity before relying on them to make firm decisions [^117Pwf93]. The basophil activation test is promising for selected, equivocal cases and may reduce reactive challenges, but access and standardization are limited and it should be used as an adjunct, not a replacement for good history and first-line tests [^115dzhJo] [^114dYJZn].

> I will now examine challenge testing, because this is the reference standard when tests and history do not align. For foods, a supervised oral food challenge confirms diagnosis, assesses resolution, and clarifies cross-reactivity; for drugs, a graded drug provocation is the gold standard when risk stratification deems it safe, and in many low-risk beta-lactam labels a direct oral challenge without prior skin testing is acceptable and increasingly recommended to expedite delabeling and restore first-line therapy access [^111Q68cK] [^114fcYAK] [^117RcH4t]. I should confirm safety steps before proceeding, including ensuring no contraindications, holding beta-blockers if possible, and having immediate treatment available for reactions, with 1- or 2-step protocols commonly used in low-risk scenarios [^117Ned1c] [^117KHdyb].

> Next, I should review how to interpret results in the clinic. Sensitization by SPT or serum IgE requires clinical correlation and does not define allergy alone, high PPV cut points can sometimes obviate the need for challenge in high pretest settings, and negative tests carry good NPV when the history is weak; importantly, neither SPT nor IgE should be used to predict reaction severity, particularly in peanut allergy, where guidelines caution against extrapolating size or titer to future risk [^111y6V85] [^115dzhJo] [^112TAh8P]. But wait, let me verify a potential pitfall; when the history strongly suggests non–IgE-mediated disease, negative IgE testing is expected and should not be overinterpreted as excluding allergy, so I need to keep the mechanism in view [^1112qFuu].

> I need to ensure special situations are considered thoughtfully. After recent anaphylaxis, some clinicians delay skin testing for several weeks due to concern for false negatives, though practices vary and evidence is limited, so if testing is deferred one can still use clinical risk stratification and plan supervised challenges later when safe [^113RccPm]. Medications such as antihistamines suppress SPT and should be held, and age-specific interpretation matters in infants, while in venom allergy with a clear systemic reaction, repeating testing can be necessary if initial results are negative despite compelling history [^115Z4Kfp] [^117HVXcf].

> Let me consider drug allergy pathways more precisely, because practice is evolving. For penicillin allergy, when histories are low risk or inconsistent with IgE mechanisms, testing may be unnecessary and a direct oral amoxicillin challenge can delabel safely, whereas anaphylaxis-consistent or recent IgE-type histories warrant penicillin skin testing with or without selective cephalosporin testing based on side-chain considerations, followed by a graded challenge if negative to confirm tolerance and remove the label [^117RcH4t] [^1135ZxjZ] [^1122ipg2]. I should double-check the stewardship implications too; delabeling is not only clinically valuable but also cost-saving across settings, which supports proactive evaluation programs [^116kHFz7].

> For stinging insect hypersensitivity, I should verify the combined use of skin and serum testing. Patients with systemic reactions should undergo venom testing to confirm sensitization and eligibility for venom immunotherapy, and if initial testing is negative but the history is compelling, repeating or adding complementary tests is recommended to avoid false reassurance and missed opportunities for disease-modifying therapy [^114p8EcA] [^117HVXcf].

> Next, I should review post-test management and follow-up. When allergy is confirmed, provide individualized avoidance counseling, emergency action plans including epinephrine for anaphylaxis risks, and education on cross-reactivity patterns; when uncertainty persists, plan a challenge at a time and place that maximizes safety and patient understanding, and avoid serial IgE or SPT monitoring to time tolerance acquisition because routine trends do not reliably predict readiness for challenge in food allergy [^111y6V85] [^1166FywL]. For drug delabeling, clear communication of results and written documentation improves long-term patient understanding and appropriate antibiotic use, which I need to ensure is built into the workflow [^1127rYZt].

> To tie this together into a practical decision pathway, I should first set a pretest probability from the history, then select SPT or serum IgE for IgE-mediated suspicions or patch testing for contact dermatitis, consider components or BAT in selected equivocal cases, and reserve supervised food or drug challenges as the arbiter when results and history do not align or when delabeling has a favorable risk–benefit profile; throughout, I must resist the urge to overtest when the history is weak, because that increases false positives and mismanagement [^1117TTvA] [^115dzhJo] [^112F2tg3].

> In summary, a history-driven, mechanism-matched, and safety-conscious approach to allergy testing is essential: choose SPT or serum IgE judiciously for suspected IgE-mediated disease, use patch testing for contact dermatitis, integrate components when validated to refine specificity, and rely on supervised challenges as the reference standard when needed, all while remembering that sensitization alone is not disease and results must be clinically correlated [^115Z4Kfp] [^111y6V85] [^114fcYAK].

Allergy testing identifies allergen sensitization [^111x4Mg1] and informs diagnosis and management; however, **testing must be guided by clinical history** [^112F2tg3] to avoid misinterpretation [^114ft5BY] and unnecessary avoidance. The main methods — skin prick testing (SPT), serum-specific IgE, and oral food or drug challenges — each have specific indications and limitations [^1117TTvA].

- **SPT is first-line for IgE-mediated allergy** [^115Z4Kfp] (foods, aeroallergens, venoms) [^117HVXcf] due to high sensitivity and rapid results [^115pTW3p], but false positives occur [^114ft5BY] and results must match clinical context.
- **Serum-specific IgE is used when SPT is contraindicated** [^1117TTvA] or unavailable, or for complex cases; it detects sensitization [^114ft5BY] but does not confirm clinical allergy [^111y6V85].
- **Oral food and drug challenges are the gold standard** [^114fcYAK] for confirming or excluding allergy when history and tests are inconclusive [^111Q68cK], but require specialist supervision due to reaction risk [^117Ned1c].

Avoid **testing without suggestive symptoms**, and interpret results within the **clinical history** [^112F2tg3] to prevent overdiagnosis and unnecessary avoidance [^1179ybNF].

### History and utility of specific IgE cutoff levels: What is the relevance for allergy diagnosis [^114ft5BY]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Low credibility.

Allergy is defined clinically by symptoms upon allergen exposure. A patient is considered sensitized when allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) antibody is detected in serum or plasma, or when a skin test result is positive, even if no clinical reaction has been experienced. Sensitization should be regarded as a requisite and risk factor for allergy but is not synonymous with an allergy diagnosis. The correct allergy diagnosis involves evaluating test results regarding allergen-sIgE in the context of the patient's case history and clinical observations. Accurate and quantitative methods for detecting sIgE antibodies are crucial for correctly assessing a patient's sensitization to specific allergens.

The evolution of sIgE immunoassays towards higher analytical performance, and the use of different cutoff levels in interpreting test results, can sometimes cause confusion. Earlier versions of sIgE assays offered a limit of quantitation of 0.35 kilounits of sIgE per liter (kU A /L), which became an established cutoff level for a positive test result in clinical use. SIgE assays can now reliably measure sIgE levels as low as 0.1 kU A /L, thereby demonstrating sensitization in cases where previous assays could not. When evaluating sIgE test results, it is critically important to distinguish between the analytical data and their clinical interpretation. Although sIgE may be present in the absence of allergy symptoms, available information suggests that sIgE concentrations between 0.1 kU A /L and beyond may indicate sensitization, providing valuable insights into clinical evaluation.

### Will oral food challenges still be part of allergy care in 10 years' time [^115dzhJo]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Low credibility.

Alternatives to oral food challenges: In routine clinical practice, oral food challenges (OFCs) are reserved for equivocal cases due to the risk of allergic reactions and the limited resources compared with demand. Consequently, the diagnosis and/or monitoring of food allergy resolution is made based on the history and evidence of allergen-specific IgE as much as possible. As many sensitized individuals are tolerant to foods, in the absence of a history of an allergic reaction to the food in question, the use of validated cut-offs with high sensitivity and a high positive predictive value can be helpful to diagnose a food allergy. Extrapolation from published studies to clinical practice is most accurate when study populations mirror the full breadth of the clinic population. Good examples are the 95% positive predictive value (PPV) for peanut allergy using a skin prick test (8 mm) or a specific IgE (15 kU/L) result that was validated in the United Kingdom and United States in different studies performed years apart and therefore can be used reliably in these populations.

- **Possible strategies to reduce number of oral food challenges without reducing diagnostic accuracy**: An IgE to individual allergen components for certain foods can be more specific than a specific IgE to whole allergen extracts and reduce the need for OFCs (e.g. peanut Ara h 2, hazelnut Cor a 14, cashew Ana o 3) or encourage the performance of OFCs and reduce food allergy overdiagnosis. Similarly, the use of the basophil activation test (BAT) can reduce the number of reactive OFCs and encourage the performance.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: Survey of drug allergy experts [^113Kkyyv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2025). High credibility.

However, for the same reason of limited resources, if further prospective studies provide an evidence base for low-risk cephalosporin allergy evaluation through DOCs, drug allergy providers in the community may actually perform DOCs with cephalosporins.

In support of the idea that drug allergy practice in the United States is rapidly evolving, with experts receptive to the evolving evidence and ready to change their practice guidelines, most reported that they performed more DOCs, more single-dose challenges, and fewer skin tests. They also affirmed that the updated DAPP had already influenced their practice.

Drug challenge remains the reference standard to remove a drug allergy label, and in low-risk cases, performing skin tests before drug challenge may not be that helpful. Increased uptake of DOC, as shown in our survey, may represent an impact of the 2022 DAPP and associated guideline recommendation changes from the 2010 version. However, we observed significant variation in test practices of cephalosporin allergy among drug allergy experts when evaluating high-risk reactions, with variations among the experts as well as variations from the recommended DAPP pathways. This likely reflects a need for a better evidence base to guide the consensus on testing higher-risk reactions in clinical practice.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Hymenoptera sting allergy, particularly concerning hypersensitivity skin testing, the AAAAI/ACAAI 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining further testing if initial test results (including skin tests and serum tests for IgE to stinging insect venoms) are negative in patients with a clear history of systemic sting reaction. This further testing can include in vitro testing, repeat skin testing, or both.

### Making the most of in vitro tests to diagnose food allergy [^111Q68cK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

The main reason to perform an oral food challenge (OFC) is to identify the food that caused the allergic reaction for the initial diagnosis and for monitoring the resolution of food allergy (FA). Other reasons for an OFC include assessing the status of tolerance to cross-reactive foods, such as tree nuts in peanut allergy (PA) or peanuts in egg allergy, and expanding the diet to include foods not yet introduced but with positive allergy tests. This occurs more frequently due to the increased use of anticipatory testing and has important resource implications.

Many factors affect the decision to perform an OFC. The most important considerations are provided by the clinical history. The previous reaction history and recent exposure to the food in question might avert the need for an OFC if the patient is already consuming the food, or lead to deferment if there was a recent reaction or poorly controlled asthma. Skin prick test (SPT) and specific IgE (sIgE) testing will also affect this decision. In a patient being assessed for the initial diagnosis of FA, a recent convincing history of an allergic reaction to an identified food, along with SPT ≥ 3 mm and/or sIgE to the whole allergen ≥ 0.35 kU/L, may be sufficient to confirm the diagnosis without the need for further testing or an OFC. In cases where the history and SPT/sIgE testing do not provide a clear answer, further testing with sIgE to components or the basophil activation test (BAT) may be warranted before deciding to perform an OFC.

### Delabeling, safety, and impact of β-lactam allergy testing: A systematic review [^116ACwKy]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2023). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this study is the most comprehensive review of the existing evidence base on the performance and safety of penicillin allergy testing through all its stages. It demonstrates that the incidence of anaphylaxis due to provocation testing is low, but the data on which this is based are incomplete. It also demonstrates a lack of data regarding the follow-up of patients after penicillin allergy testing and whether the work done in allergy clinics translates into the real world.

Our systematic review and attempts at meta-analysis demonstrated that the evidence base in β-lactam allergy delabeling is poor. Of the large number of studies that we initially identified, only 15 could be clearly identified as having a low risk of bias across all aspects of the study, and there was a high number of studies with missing or incompletely reported data. Additionally, there were no randomized controlled studies of penicillin delabeling.

Of the studies identified, only one performed direct provocation testing on participants regardless of skin testing results. We cannot comment, therefore, on the utility of skin testing in identifying those who are more likely to react at direct provocation testing, as the positive and negative predictive values of skin testing cannot be appropriately assessed. This is important when considering the expense and time of undertaking specialized skin testing for β-lactam allergy, in terms of both the time and expense required for training clinical staff appropriately and the expense of minor and major determinants.

### Factors associated with aeroallergen testing among adults with asthma in a large health system [^114m6EA6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2023). Low credibility.

We found that having at least one allergy/immunology visit during the study period was the strongest predictor of receiving testing in the multivariable, adjusted analysis. However, it is important to note that we did not count successful referrals from primary care to asthma specialist clinics, which may represent guideline-concordant care. Regardless, our finding that 56.2% of patients in the cohort (17,305 of 30,775) had primary care visits only and were categorized as not receiving testing, despite the fact that any Penn Medicine provider can order serum aeroallergen testing without consulting an asthma specialist, illustrates the low rate of testing or referrals for testing in our primary care practices.

The reasons for this low rate may include lack of availability of skin prick testing in primary care practices, time constraints, lack of knowledge of the US asthma guidelines, and inexperience with interpreting allergy test results among primary care providers. Age was another important factor, with older age associated with lower odds of receiving testing. The COVID-19 pandemic may have also contributed to the low rate, as test rates declined after the March 17, 2020, lockdown date in Philadelphia. Consistent with our expectations based on clinical indication, in the adjusted analysis for the outcome of receiving testing, patients with more severe and/or uncontrolled asthma, including those with prescriptions for multiple controller medications or asthma ED visits in the prior year, were more likely to receive testing. We also found that most aeroallergen tests were ordered…

### Skin testing as a biomarker in drug allergy [^1151qUXe]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). Low credibility.

Despite the significant negative impact drug allergies can have on patient care, the diagnosis is largely based on clinical history, and there are limited diagnostic tests available at the time of a reaction. Biomarkers are needed to improve the diagnosis and the identification of the culprit medication. Skin testing is the most useful biomarker for immediate- and delayed-type reactions available, but it is limited by its low sensitivity. To improve its accuracy and reproducibility, a standardized procedure must be used.

For immediate-type reactions, penicillin skin testing is the most widely studied. It can be used in patients with a history of anaphylaxis or a recent immunoglobulin E-mediated reaction, or for those for whom there is a significant risk if a reaction were to occur, such as during pregnancy. Skin testing is also important in allergy to platinum agents, allowing for continued first-line therapy.

For delayed-type reactions, patch testing and delayed intradermal testing, used in conjunction with clinical history, can help improve the identification of the culprit medication depending on the type of reaction. Other biomarkers, including in vitro testing for specific immunoglobulin E, the basophil activation test, the lymphocyte transformation test, ELISpot, and genetic factors that increase the likelihood of reaction, are under investigation. They may be most helpful when used in combination with the clinical history and skin testing results.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: Survey of drug allergy experts [^113Gvo9M]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2025). High credibility.

When evaluating a patient with a high-risk penicillin allergy, many experts chose to include both penicillin and cephalosporin skin tests, as opposed to just performing a penicillin-based skin test, as suggested by the practice parameter. Similarly, for a high-risk cephalosporin history, more physicians recommended a penicillin skin test in addition to a cephalosporin skin test, even when evaluating whether the patient can receive cephalosporins, while the practice parameter does not suggest the need to evaluate penicillins.

We were especially interested in the approach to cefazolin allergy among drug allergy experts. Cefazolin is a first-generation cephalosporin broadly used for perioperative prophylaxis. Reviewing the chemical structures and immunogenic components of cefazolin showed that it has two side chains (R1 and R2) whose structures do not match those of any other β-lactams in use in the United States, including penicillin. This suggests that the true rate of cross-reactivity of cefazolin to other β-lactam antibiotics may actually be close to zero. Several studies suggest that patients with past immediate reactions to cefazolin often tolerate all other cephalosporins and other β-lactams. A 2021 study demonstrated that in a series of 452 patients labeled as having penicillin allergy who underwent allergy testing, none had a positive skin test result when tested specifically for cefazolin or ceftriaxone. In a systematic review and meta-analysis from 2021 looking at dual allergy to penicillin and cefazolin, less than 1% of non-confirmed penicillin allergy also had the label.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for atopic dermatitis, specifically in relation to allergy testing, the AAD 2014 guidelines recommend considering food allergy testing for milk, egg, peanut, wheat, and soy in patients under 5 years of age with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and either:

- **Persistent atopic dermatitis**: Despite optimized treatment.
- **Reliable history of immediate reaction**: After ingestion of a specific food.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pollen-food allergy syndrome, particularly in relation to indications for allergy testing, the BSACI 2022 guidelines recommend considering allergy tests for foods in the following situations:

- **More severe or atypical symptoms**: To characteristic raw food triggers.

- **Uncertainty about roasted nuts**: Whether reactions also occur to roasted hazelnuts, almonds, walnuts, Brazil nuts, or peanuts, either on their own or when present in composite foods, such as chocolates, spreads, desserts, and snacks.

- **Inclusion of other soy products or processed foods**: Triggers include other soy products or cooked/processed fruits/vegetables, such as smoothies and juices.

- **Specific nut reactions**: Reactions are reported specifically to cashew, pistachio, or macadamia nuts.

### Eaaci food allergy and anaphylaxis guidelines: Diagnosis and management of food allergy [^1166FywL]. Allergy (2014). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for food allergy, specifically in the assessment of treatment response, the EAACI 2014 guidelines recommend not obtaining specific IgE testing (both in vitro and skin prick tests). This recommendation is due to the limited value of these tests in adequately guiding the timing of oral food challenges for the development of tolerance.

### Updating allergy and/or hypersensitivity diagnostic procedures in the who ICD-11 revision [^117XzUrX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

The classification of allergy and/or hypersensitivity conditions for the World Health Organization (WHO) International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11 provides the appropriate corresponding codes for allergic diseases, assuming that the final diagnosis is correct. This classification should be linked to in vitro and in vivo diagnostic procedures. Considering the impact on our specialty, we decided to review the codification of these procedures into the ICD, aiming to have a baseline and to suggest changes and/or submit new proposals.

To achieve this, we prepared a list of the relevant allergy and/or hypersensitivity diagnostic procedures that health care professionals encounter daily. This list was based on the main guidelines, and we selected all possible and relevant corresponding terms from the ICD-10 (2015 version) and the ICD-11 β phase foundation (June 2015 version). More than 90% of very specific and important diagnostic procedures currently used by the allergists' community are missing. It was observed that some concepts commonly used by the allergist community are not fully recognized by other specialties. The comprehensive scheme and the correspondence in the ICD-10 (2015 version) and ICD-11 foundation (June 2015 version) provided a big picture of the missing or imprecise terms and how they are scattered in the ICD-11 framework, allowing us to submit new proposals to increase the visibility of the allergy and/or hypersensitivity conditions and diagnostic procedures.

### Pearls and pitfalls of allergy diagnostic testing: Report from the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology/American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Specific IgE Test Task Force [^116yzMZG]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

The intended purpose of this monograph is to provide a general overview of allergy diagnostics for health care professionals who care for patients with allergic disease. For a more comprehensive review of allergy diagnostic testing, readers can refer to the Allergy Diagnostic Practice Parameters. A key message is that a positive allergy test result (skin or blood) indicates only the presence of allergen specific IgE (called sensitization). It does not necessarily mean clinical allergy (i.e. allergic symptoms with exposure). It is important for this reason that the allergy evaluation be based on the patient's history and directed by a health care professional with sufficient understanding of allergy diagnostic testing to use the information obtained from his/her evaluation of the patient to determine:

1. What allergy diagnostic tests to order.
2. How to interpret the allergy diagnostic test results.
3. How to use the information obtained from the allergy evaluation to develop an appropriate therapeutic treatment plan.

### Management of allergy to penicillins and other beta-lactams [^1122ipg2]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). High credibility.

In the context of diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, particularly regarding the evaluation of penicillin allergy, the BSACI 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining skin testing to penicillins and the required cephalosporin. This helps to determine if the sensitization is to the β-lactam core or the side chain when a cephalosporin is necessary for a patient with a previous reaction. Subsequent challenge testing should be conducted to either exclude allergy or perform desensitization if the patient is confirmed allergic.

### Food allergies: detection and management [^116tYPTg]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Family physicians play a central role in both the suspicion and diagnosis of immunoglobulin E-mediated food allergies. They are also critical in redirecting evaluations for symptoms falsely attributed to allergies. While any food is a potential allergen, more than 90 percent of acute systemic reactions in children are due to eggs, milk, soy, wheat, or peanuts. In adults, these reactions are mainly caused by crustaceans, tree nuts, peanuts, or fish. Oral allergy syndrome is more common than anaphylactic reactions to food, but its symptoms are transient and limited to the mouth and throat.

- **Testing methods**: Skin-prick and radioallergosorbent tests for specific foods exhibit about 85 percent sensitivity and 30 to 60 percent specificity. Intradermal testing has a higher false-positive rate and a greater risk of adverse reactions; thus, it should not be used for initial evaluations. The double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge remains the most specific test for confirming a diagnosis.

- **Treatment and management**: Treatment involves recognizing and avoiding the responsible food. Patients with anaphylactic reactions require emergent epinephrine and instructions on self-administration in case of inadvertent exposure. Antihistamines can be used for more minor reactions.

### Assessment of latex allergy in a healthcare population: Are the available tests valid [^111N2rp7]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2000). Low credibility.

Latex allergy can cause serious, preventable work-related health problems in healthcare workers, who are a high-risk group for this form of allergy. Type I hypersensitivity can produce life-threatening systemic effects and involves an allergen-specific immunoglobulin (IgE) response to proteins found in latex. The estimated prevalence of latex allergy in healthcare workers varies widely (2.8% - 18%), and studies do not always distinguish between those who are positive in an assay for latex-specific IgE and those with clinical allergy.

- **Objective**: To assess the performance of four in-vitro methods and three skin testing methods for detecting latex-specific IgE in a group of UK healthcare workers. Test results were compared with reported clinical symptoms defined by questionnaire.

- **Methods**: Skin prick testing was carried out on volunteers using three reagents: (a) Stallergenes commercial latex extract (Cedex, France); (b) an in-house latex glove extract; and (c) a fresh glove piece. Specific IgE levels were determined using Pharmacia AutocapTM (Uppsala, Sweden), Pharmacia UnicapTM (Uppsala, Sweden), DPC Immulite(R) (Los Angeles, USA), and Hycor HytecTM (Irvine, California, USA) methods. Each volunteer completed a questionnaire detailing latex exposure and allergic history.

- **Results**: In vitro methods for detecting specific IgE to natural rubber latex were positive in 3.6% to 43.6% of the same population. Skin prick test positivity varied between 2.9% and 14.3% with different extracts. Of the subjects tested, 9.1% reported symptoms which could be consistent with latex allergy.

### Diagnostic accuracy, risk assessment, and cost-effectiveness of component-resolved diagnostics for food allergy: A systematic review [^117Pwf93]. Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review analyzing the evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of component-resolved diagnostics (CRD) for a range of food allergies. The strengths of this study include the use of a highly sensitive search strategy with no language restrictions, which allowed for a comprehensive literature search conducted across several databases and clinical trial registries. The inclusion criteria for this review were carefully selected to provide clinically relevant information.

Similar work in the field, including a RAND report and a systematic review by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Guidelines Group, was used as bases for the inclusion criteria of this review. Furthermore, the internal validity of the studies included in this review was strong, as they all used double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFC) as the reference standard in at least 50% of participants.

A limitation of this review is the large degree of heterogeneity between studies that met the inclusion criteria, in terms of the components tested, the particular CRD assay employed, and the cutoff values used, which precluded a quantitative synthesis of data. Additionally, we acknowledge that food allergies other than the ones we focused on are becoming increasingly important. As our search strategy was broadly formulated, we were able, in response to expert peer-review feedback, to check for any other potentially relevant studies for other foods; however, we were unable to find any such studies.

### Making the most of in vitro tests to diagnose food allergy [^115HTUGD]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical reasoning to diagnose food allergy involves utilizing various tests available for routine use in clinics. Practices may vary, with some primarily using skin prick tests (SPT), others favoring specific IgE (sIgE) tests, or employing both. sIgE to allergen components is commonly used in specialist centers, and the basophil activation test (BAT) is increasingly being used clinically. Meanwhile, other tests such as peptide microarrays and T-cell assays are reserved for research settings.

The interpretation of allergy test results aims to determine the probability of clinical allergy, which subsequently informs whether an oral food challenge (OFC) is warranted. The probability of clinical allergy relies primarily on clinical history and secondarily on allergy test results. For instance, if a patient consumes age-appropriate amounts of a food without symptoms, the probability of food allergy (FA) is negligible, rendering allergy testing unnecessary as false-positive results may lead to unwarranted food avoidance. Clinical history aids in establishing a pretest probability of FA, which is considered to determine the post-test probability of clinical allergy. This reasoning is effectively illustrated using nomograms, which employ likelihood ratios to calculate post-test probability based on pretest probability.

### What the clinician should know when ordering a mast cell tryptase test: A review article for the North American practicing clinician [^112KNRkU]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

Tryptase is currently the most specific mast cell biomarker available in clinical laboratories. Tryptase levels in the peripheral blood contribute to the diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic evaluation of the following three clinical categories: (1) immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including the life-threatening systemic form known as anaphylaxis; (2) clonal mast cell diseases and other myeloid malignancies, also as a biomarker for the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents targeting mast cell survival; and (3) hereditary α-tryptasemia, a genetic trait found in 4% to 8% of the general population associated with an increased risk of severe immediate hypersensitivity reactions.

Rapidly evolving pathophysiology knowledge and management guidelines affect tryptase use in clinical practice, explaining the need for frequent updates. Such updates often lack context on the pathophysiology and methods regarding mast cells and tryptase, thus hampering the practicing clinician's ability to get the full picture from tryptase test results.

Here, we provide the practicing physician with the 2025 state-of-the-art recommendations on tryptase use and interpretation in clinical practice, also exposing their basic, clinical, and technical foundations. Successive additions to mast cell and tryptase research are summarized and revisited in light of today's knowledge. The review sections are titled to reflect matter-of-fact questions arising in clinical practice. Currently unmet needs for tryptase use and selected lines of ongoing research expected to influence clinical practice in the near future are also presented.

### Current practices in delaying testing for IgE-mediated food allergy after anaphylaxis [^113RccPm]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2022). Low credibility.

General recommendations for delaying allergy testing, especially skin testing, in the weeks following anaphylaxis have been proposed owing to concern for false-negative results. However, no specific guidelines exist to aid clinicians in the decision regarding when to perform postanaphylactic food allergy testing and which test to use. The practices of allergists regarding a delay in testing for food allergy after anaphylaxis are unknown.

- **Objective**: We aimed to quantify the use of different approaches to postanaphylactic food allergy testing among allergists across the United States.

- **Methods**: A clinical scenario was presented to 82 allergy and immunology fellowship program directors via e-mail survey. They were asked whether they avoid skin prick and/or blood-specific IgE testing in a child in the 6 weeks following suspected food-induced anaphylaxis owing to concern for false-negative results.

- **Results**: The survey response rate was 33%. Of the 27 respondents, 4 (14.8%) avoid both blood and skin testing, 7 (25.9%) avoid skin testing only, and 16 (59.3%) do not avoid any testing.

- **Conclusion**: Given the paucity of published evidence, a spectrum of opinions exists regarding testing in the weeks following food-induced anaphylaxis. About 40% of the allergy and immunology fellowship program directors in the United States who responded to the survey in this study avoid some allergy testing in the first 6 weeks after food-induced anaphylaxis owing to concern for false-negative results.

### Eaaci guidelines on the diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy [^112nknvE]. Allergy (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for food allergy, specifically concerning other tests, the EAACI 2023 guidelines recommend against obtaining the following tests for the diagnosis of IgE-mediated food allergy:

- **IgG and IgG subclass**: These tests are not recommended as they do not accurately diagnose IgE-mediated food allergies.

- **Antigen leukocyte cellular antibody testing**: This method lacks evidence for diagnosing IgE-mediated food allergies.

- **Electrodermal testing**: It is not supported by scientific evidence for this type of allergy.

- **Hair analysis**: Hair analysis is not a valid diagnostic tool for IgE-mediated food allergies.

- **Applied kinesiology**: This is considered unreliable for diagnosing food allergies.

- **Iridology**: There is no scientific basis for using iridology in allergy diagnosis.

- **Genetic analysis**: Although genetic factors play a role in allergies, genetic analysis is not recommended for allergy diagnosis.

### Infant allergy testing and food allergy diagnoses before and after guidelines for early peanut introduction [^1137h9bX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). High credibility.

A landmark 2015 trial on early exposure to peanuts led to expert recommendations for screening and early peanut introduction in high-risk infants (those with severe eczema and/or egg allergy). However, the impact of this paradigm shift on allergy testing and diagnosis is unknown.

- **Objective**: We assessed the effects of the Learning Early About Peanut Allergy (LEAP) trial and guideline publications on allergy testing and food allergy diagnoses in infants.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective cohort study, deidentified administrative health claims from a commercial and Medicare Advantage claims database were used. Infants with at least one year of continuous coverage were selected using newborn codes for birth hospitalizations from January 2010 to June 2018. Interrupted time series models were employed to compare the prevalence of allergy testing before and after the LEAP publication in February 2015 and formal guideline publication in January 2017.

- **Results**: For the 487,533 included infants, allergy testing increased after LEAP (risk ratio [RR]: 1.11 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07–1.15]) and guidelines (1.21 [1.18–1.23]). This increase in testing was also observed in infants not considered high risk, both after LEAP (1.12 [1.08–1.17]) and guidelines (1.20 [1.16, 1.23]). For first-time allergy tests, the post-guideline median number of allergens tested was nine for serum tests and ten for skin tests. Post-guidelines, there was a significant increase in diagnosis of peanut (RR: 1.08 [1.00, 1.16]), egg (1.12 [1.05, 1.20]), and other food allergies (excluding milk) (1.22 [1.14, 1.31]).

- **Conclusion**: Allergy testing shows an increase following the introduction of guidelines.

### Allergic and hypersensitivity conditions in non-specialist care: Flow diagrams to support clinical practice [^113gwY4M]. Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

In spite of the fact that allergy, in one of its many guises, is the reason for an estimated 6% of consultations, the primary care clinician has often received little or no training at either undergraduate or postgraduate level concerning this disease area. There is clearly a need to upskill healthcare professionals working in primary care. At the time of writing, there are two publications which have identified the core skills required for primary care practitioners, with a further one for professions allied to health. However, in general, there is no sign of these being implemented, although for the first time, allergy is included as part of the postgraduate curriculum for primary care in the United Kingdom.

The making of a diagnosis, even if this is provisional until confirmed, is a critical step in patient management, previously called for by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) "to develop simplified pathways for the diagnosis and management of allergic diseases in primary care". Diagnosis is a complex process, requiring an underlying level of relevant clinical knowledge, pattern recognition, and interpretative skills to be successful. An incorrect diagnosis leads to inappropriate investigation and management decisions, which may cause harm to patients and incur greater expense to both the patient and society.

The diagnostic process in allergy is further confounded by the presence of non-allergic diseases, from which it must be differentiated. For example, allergic asthma and non-allergic asthma or IgE-mediated food allergy, non-IgE-mediated food allergy, and others should be properly distinguished.

### Allergy testing: Common questions and answers [^115Wvdmd]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

An estimated 10% to 30% of the global population has an allergic disease. Clinical presentations of allergic diseases, respiratory infections, and autoimmune conditions have similar features. Allergy and immunologic testing can help clarify the diagnosis and guide treatment. Immediate immunoglobulin E (IgE) and delayed T cell-mediated reactions are the main types of allergic responses.

- **IgE-mediated responses**: The allergens suspected in an immediate IgE-mediated response are identified through serum IgE-specific antibody or skin testing. For patients with an inhalant allergy, skin or IgE-specific antibody testing is preferred.

- **Food allergies**: In patients with food allergies, eliminating the suspected allergenic food from the diet is the initial treatment. If this is ineffective, IgE-specific antibody or skin testing can exclude allergens. An oral food challenge should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

- **Insect stings**: Patients with an anaphylactic reaction to an insect sting should undergo IgE-specific antibody or skin testing.

- **Penicillin and other drugs**: Skin testing for penicillin has a high negative predictive value and can help when penicillin administration is indicated and there are limited alternatives. Testing for other drug allergies has less well-determined sensitivity and specificity but can guide the diagnosis.

- **Contact dermatitis**: Patch testing can help identify the allergen responsible for contact dermatitis.

### Skin testing [^114ke6iU]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

To provide the reader with a relevant review of the literature regarding skin testing in the allergist's office, a PubMed search for the years 1970 through 2005 was performed using the following keywords: allergy skin testing, skin prick testing, and intradermal skin testing.

Articles that highlighted aspects central to clinical allergists' use of skin testing in the office — such as methods of skin testing, intradermal vs. skin prick testing, skin test devices, and methods of expressing skin test results — were selected for further review.

Skin testing remains the central test to confirm an allergic response. It is minimally invasive and, when performed correctly, has good reproducibility. Results are easily quantifiable and correlate well with end-organ challenge. It is imperative, however, that technicians who perform the skin tests and the clinicians who order or interpret these tests understand the characteristics of the specific tests they are administering. It is also important that the clinician express skin test results in a manner that allows easy interpretation by another physician.

Allergists must consider controllable variables that affect skin test results and their interpretation. When not considered, they may be responsible for some of the inaccuracies associated with allergy skin testing.

### Biomarkers for diagnosis and prediction of therapy responses in allergic diseases and asthma [^113aGXy7]. Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

Modern health care requires a proactive and individualized response to diseases, combining precision diagnosis and personalized treatment. Accordingly, the approach to patients with allergic diseases encompasses novel developments in personalized medicine, disease phenotyping and endotyping, as well as the development and application of reliable biomarkers. A detailed clinical history and physical examination, followed by the detection of IgE immunoreactivity against specific allergens, still represents the state of the art.

However, there is now further emphasis on optimizing diagnostic and therapeutic standards. A large number of studies have investigated the biomarkers of allergic diseases, including asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, food allergy, urticaria, and anaphylaxis. Various biomarkers have been developed through omics technologies, some of which facilitate a better classification of distinct phenotypes or endotypes. The introduction of biologicals into clinical practice increases the need for biomarkers for patient selection, prediction of outcomes, and monitoring to allow an adequate choice regarding the duration of these costly and long-lasting therapies.

Escalating healthcare costs, together with questions about the efficacy of the management of allergic diseases, require further development of a biomarker-driven approach. Here, we review biomarkers in the diagnosis and treatment of asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, viral infections, chronic rhinosinusitis, food allergy, drug hypersensitivity, and allergen immunotherapy.

### Does provider specialty matter [^113EfEDA]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Low credibility.

Multiple practice guidelines discourage the indiscriminate use of broad panels of allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) tests due to the increased risk of false positives and misinterpretation of results. We provide an analytical framework to identify specialty-specific differences in ordering patterns and effectiveness, which can be used to improve test utilization.

Test results from a tertiary pediatric hospital were analyzed by ordering specialty to evaluate the size of allergen workups. Positivity rates were analyzed to determine effectiveness in selecting tests with high positive pretest probabilities. Laboratory test menu components were also evaluated.

Our findings demonstrate 29% of sIgE tests are ordered as part of broad workups (> 20 sIgE tests/date of service), contrary to the recommended testing approach. Detailed descriptions of ordering patterns and positivity rates are provided.

This study provides a framework for using a cross-sectional analytical approach to assess test utilization patterns and evaluate components of laboratory testing menus.

### Outcomes from an inpatient beta-lactam allergy guideline across a large US health system [^116p3Y5r]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2019). High credibility.

Beta-lactam antibiotic allergies, reported by up to 15% of hospitalized patients, impact acute-care antibiotic prescribing. Cephalosporins, antibiotics important to the treatment of common inpatient infections, are inconsistently prescribed to patients reporting penicillin allergies despite low cross reactivity. Alternatives to β-lactam antibiotics may be less effective and can lead to adverse sequelae for patients, most notably healthcare-associated infections such as Clostridioides difficile infection.

Most patients with a documented penicillin allergy do not have clinically significant hypersensitivity and can be safely treated with penicillins and other β-lactams. Although penicillin allergy evaluation is encouraged by antibiotic stewardship guidelines, penicillin skin testing (PST) is operationally challenging in acute-care settings. Furthermore, many of the antibiotics generally used in hospitalized patients following a negative PST can be administered safely without preceding PST with a full-dose or test-dose challenge.

The Partners HealthCare System (PHS) guideline for inpatients with β-lactam allergy histories is an antibiotic stewardship tool that includes penicillin and cephalosporin hypersensitivity pathways that direct PST when institutionally available and needed (i.e. patients reporting IgE-mediated allergy symptoms to a penicillin who require a penicillin or cross-reactive cephalosporin). It encourages direct full-dose and test-dose (i.e. standardized 2-step graded) drug challenges. Prior to this study, our results demonstrated that the guideline safely improved practice.

### Recommendations for the allergy management in the primary care [^116pA188]. Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

The majority of patients seeking medical advice for allergic diseases are first seen in a primary care setting. Correct diagnosis with the identification of all offending allergens is an absolute prerequisite for appropriate management of allergic disease by the general practitioner. Allergy diagnostic tests recommended for use in primary care are critically reviewed in accordance with the significant workload in a primary care setting. Simplified pathways for recognition and diagnosis of allergic diseases are proposed, and these pathways should be further adapted to local (national) conditions.

### Clinical laboratory assessment of immediate-type hypersensitivity [^111x4Mg1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical laboratory analyses aid in the diagnosis and management of human allergic (IgE-dependent) diseases. Diagnosis of immediate-type hypersensitivity begins with a thorough clinical history and physical examination. Once symptoms compatible with an allergic disorder have been identified, a skin test, blood test, or both for allergen-specific IgE antibodies provide confirmation of sensitization, which strengthens the diagnosis.

Skin testing provides a biologically relevant immediate-type hypersensitivity response, with resultant wheal-and-flare reactions within 15 minutes of allergen application. Allergen-specific IgE antibody in serum is quantified using three laboratory-based autoanalyzers (ImmunoCAP, Immulite, and HYTEC-288) and novel microarray and lateral-flow immunoassays. Technological advances in serologic allergen-specific IgE measurements have involved increased automation, with enhanced reproducibility, greater quantification, lower analytic sensitivity, and component-supplemented extract-based allergen use.

In vivo provocation tests involving inhalation, ingestion, or injection of allergens serve to clarify discordant history and skin- or blood-based measures of sensitization. Other diagnostic allergy laboratory analyses include total and free serum IgE measurement, precipitating IgG antibodies specific for organic dusts, mast cell tryptase, and indicator allergen analyses to assess indoor environments to promote patient-targeted allergen avoidance programs. A critique is provided on the predictive utility of serologic measures of specific IgE for food allergy.

### Peanut allergy: An epidemiologic analysis of a large database [^116Gdkb4]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to confirm new observations on peanut allergy and to address concerns that families and healthcare providers have about peanut allergy.

The study design involved children who presented with a history of peanut allergy or peanut sensitization. They were asked to participate in a registry, which facilitated an analysis focused on questions posed by a food allergy support group regarding children with peanut allergy or sensitization.

Results showed that a total of 1,070 children were entered into the registry over five years. Two-thirds experienced a reaction to peanuts. Of the children with peanut allergy, the majority were male (63%), white (78%), and had private health insurance (80%). Most reactions involved the skin (55%), and anaphylaxis occurred in 35%. The median age of reaction was one year. Atopic dermatitis was observed in 60%, and asthma in 41%. Additional food allergies were noted in 58%. Notably, when there were second exposures, 28% had a more severe reaction. Skin test size did not differentiate the type of reaction, and children with anaphylaxis had slightly higher specific IgE levels. Severe reactions from inadvertent exposure in children who were peanut sensitized were rare (< 1%).

In conclusion, strategies for peanut allergy prevention and treatment have evolved. The data obtained from this large registry can answer many questions that families and healthcare providers have during this transition.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: Survey of drug allergy experts [^116yiWYZ]. Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). High credibility.

For scenario C, the practice parameters recommend the normal administration of a dissimilar cephalosporin, as well as a skin test-based approach for a structurally similar cephalosporin, for patients with an anaphylactic history to penicillin. Our survey results showed that 23% elected to perform a penicillin-based skin test and focus only on proving or disproving the penicillin allergy, which aligns with the practice parameters' recommendations.

- **Scenario D**: For a patient with a high-risk cephalosporin history, the practice parameters suggest a cephalosporin skin test as the evaluation approach. Forty-eight percent of the experts in our survey chose answers that aligned with this approach.

- **Scenario E**: For patients with another high-risk history of a cephalosporin, specifically cefazolin, a higher number of participants, 57%, chose the cephalosporin skin test as their evaluation.

Following scenario E, we specifically asked a question about the recommended steps in cephalosporin use when the skin test results are positive to cefazolin. For this scenario, most experts (34, 79.1%) recommended avoiding cefazolin and conducting an oral challenge with a structurally dissimilar cephalosporin, versus 9 experts (20.9%) who recommended avoiding cefazolin alone, without the need to continue to an oral challenge.

We attempted to perform a post hoc analysis to look for a correlation between the experts' time in practice and their adherence to the guidelines, but we found no such correlation in any of the case scenarios.

The survey's last section asked about the impact of the 2022 practice guidelines.

### The use of penicillin skin testing to assess the prevalence of penicillin allergy in an emergency department setting [^1124Fedn]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Patient-reported penicillin allergies are often unreliable and can result in unnecessary changes in antibiotic therapy. Although penicillin allergy skin testing is commonly performed in allergy clinics, it has not been used in emergency departments (EDs) to verify self-reported allergies. We hypothesize that ED-based testing is possible and that the false-positive rate of patients with self-reported penicillin allergy is greater than 90%.

- **Methods**: This prospective observational cohort study enrolled a convenience sample of ED patients with a self-reported penicillin allergy. Patients were enrolled by one of two emergency physicians who performed skin prick and intracutaneous tests with penicillin major and minor determinants. The total testing time was 30 minutes. The proportion of false-positive self-reported allergies was computed with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by using the score method.

- **Results**: A total of 150 patients (mean age 42 years; SD 16 years; 46% men; 47% Black) were enrolled. The false-positive rate for self-reported penicillin allergy was 137 of 150 (91.3%; 95% CI 85.3% to 95.1%). There were no adverse reactions associated with penicillin skin testing. Compared with patients with a false-positive penicillin allergy result (confirmed by negative penicillin skin testing result), patients reporting a true penicillin allergy confirmed by positive penicillin skin test results tended to be more frequently men (61.5% versus 44.5%; Δ 17.0%; 95% CI -13.5% to 42%) and Black (69.2% versus 44.5%; Δ 24.7%; 95% CI -6.9% to 46.8%).

### National survey of United Kingdom paediatric allergy services [^112VnWyC]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

- **Allergy investigations**: All services offer specific IgE testing, and 95% (147/154) undertake skin prick testing. Component resolved diagnostics (CRD) is offered by 71% (89/126) of secondary services and 89% (25/28) of tertiary services. Intradermal testing, exhaled nitric oxide, spirometry, and ISAC panels are more frequently offered at tertiary centers. Patch testing for foods is offered in five allergy services, including two tertiary and three secondary services. Logistics of skin prick testing, such as staff undertaking the testing, allergens tested, products used, and technical aspects of skin prick test interpretation, are reviewed in detail in the Supplementary Appendix.

- **Intradermal testing**: Of the 25 services offering intradermal testing to paediatric allergy patients, six are secondary and 19 are tertiary services. Intradermal testing is most commonly offered for local anaesthetic agents (5 secondary, 19 tertiary), general anaesthetics (2 secondary, 14 tertiary), and antibiotics (3 secondary, 14 tertiary). Wasp and bee venom intradermal testing are provided by 13 services, all of which are tertiary. Intradermal testing to other drugs was noted by three tertiary services and to chlorhexidine by one tertiary service.

### Evidence-based diagnosis in patch testing [^115sB5n3]. Contact Dermatitis (2003). Low credibility.

Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is defined as the integration of the best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values. Based on the principles of EBM, we can conclude that patch testing is cost-effective only if patients are selected based on a clear-cut clinical suspicion of contact allergy and are tested with chemicals relevant to the problem (high pretest probability). Random patch testing (low pretest probability) should be discouraged. Proper pretest probability assessment can only be done in expert centers because problem-based testing requires both a thorough knowledge of the patch-test procedure and knowledge about potential sensitizers in a specific environment.

### Practical aspects of allergy-testing [^1163XCVD]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Allergy testing is a prerequisite for specific allergy treatment, including specific allergen avoidance measures, relevant pharmacotherapy, and specific allergy vaccination. All children with persistent or severe possible allergic symptoms or those requiring continuous treatment should be tested, irrespective of the child's age. Allergy testing includes a careful case history and a determination of IgE sensitization by skin prick test or the measurement of allergen-specific IgE in serum by standardized and validated methods.

The diagnosis of food allergy cannot usually be based solely on the case history and IgE sensitization; it must be confirmed by controlled food elimination and food challenge procedures. The diagnosis of inhalant allergic disease requires only confirmatory nasal, conjunctival, or bronchial challenges in equivocal cases or before specific allergy treatment such as extensive allergen avoidance measures or allergy vaccination.

### Road map for the clinical application of the basophil activation test in food allergy [^114dYJZn]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Do we need improved diagnostic testing for IgE-mediated food allergy?

The diagnostic performance of skin prick tests (SPT) and specific IgE tests to whole extracts can vary depending on the food sources and the quality of the allergen extracts. Allergen extracts usually contain the major and minor allergens that are relevant for the ability of the food to elicit allergic reactions. However, allergen extracts obtained from certain food sources, such as soya, wheat, and certain nuts and seeds, may miss some important allergens (e.g. lipophilic proteins like oleosins and other proteins that are lost during the process of producing the extracts), which can impair their diagnostic utility.

Generally, when interpreting SPT and specific IgE as positive at the low limits of detection, these tests have a high sensitivity but poor specificity. Therefore, without a clinical history suggestive of allergy, the mere detection of sensitization by SPT or specific IgE leads to high false-positive rates and low positive predictive values (PPVs). When 95% PPV value cut-offs are used (e.g. 8 mm for SPT to peanut and 15 KU/L for specific IgE to peanut), the specificity of these tests is enhanced, but their sensitivity is reduced, resulting in many false negatives and low negative predictive values (NPV). Therefore, a large proportion of patients tested, particularly when the pre-test probability is low (e.g. no or remote history of known ingestion), have intermediate range results for SPT and specific IgE and require oral food challenges (OFC) to clarify whether or not they have food allergy.

### An urgent need for capacity building towards establishment of drug allergy management systems in the Indian sub-continent [^113DKp12]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

There are no 'point-of-care' diagnostic tests for drug allergy. Practice in high-income countries (HICs) involves specialist allergist input with careful history, scrutiny of clinical records, allergy skin tests, and a challenge procedure. However, there is a significant unmet demand for allergists in the Indian subcontinent, compounded by allergy not having an independent specialty status. Consequently, clinical pathways for drug allergy management are not yet established, and there are no guidelines for healthcare professionals (HCPs) to undertake drug allergy labeling and de-labeling.

Research in HICs in the context of penicillin allergy labels (PALs) has shown that a computerized decision support system (CDSS), alongside education, training, and upskilling non-allergy HCPs, enables stratifying patients as 'low-risk' and 'high-risk'. 'Low-risk' patients are highly unlikely to have an immune-mediated reaction, and a direct oral penicillin challenge (without allergy tests) has been safely employed for de-labeling. 'High-risk' patients need skin tests and an oral challenge procedure for an accurate diagnosis. There is emerging evidence for multi-professional non-allergist and allied health professional-led penicillin allergy de-labeling programs in Asia-Pacific countries, which may be the way forward.

Gaining insight into the views and perspectives of patients, HCPs, and stakeholders in the context of cultural, religious, and behavioral factors is essential. Locally adapted strategies are critical to overcoming the limitations of local health services and facilitating access to skin test reagents and in vitro tests.

### The predictive value of total serum IgE for a positive allergen specific IgE result [^113CjCbb]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

The measurement of total serum IgE and allergen-specific IgE is often requested to assess possible allergies. As public awareness increases, so do requests for allergy assessments. Unless there is a clear "allergen suspect" in the history, several allergen-specific IgE requests may be made. This increases the likelihood of detecting borderline increases in allergen-specific IgE of uncertain relevance and has important cost implications for the service.

- **Aims**: To provide an evidence base for this observation.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective observational study, results from 301 patients under 16 years of age from whom blood was taken for "allergy testing" from March 2001 to February 2003 were studied.

- **Results**: Allergen-specific IgE testing in children with low total serum IgE concentrations (< 10 IU/litre) yielded very few positive results (three of 73 children), except in those being investigated for an acute reaction to a single food. When IgE was 11–20 kU/litre, 13 of 73 children had positive allergen-specific IgE. In the 21–40 kU/litre IgE group, 16 of 74 children had positive allergen-specific IgE. In the 41–80 kU/litre group, 22 of 81 had positive allergen-specific IgE.

- **Conclusions**: Allergen-specific IgE testing in children with low IgE concentrations (< 10 kU/litre) produces few positive results in patients with non-specific symptoms. Laboratories should perform allergy testing for specific allergens regardless of total IgE concentration only when there are convincing clinical reasons to do so, and should not proceed with this if the total IgE is < 10 kU/litre.

### The quality of paediatric asthma guidelines: Evidence underpinning diagnostic test recommendations from a meta-epidemiological study [^1112ZpEA]. Family Practice (2024). Low credibility.

- **Selection of diagnostic tests related to primary care**: A list of included diagnostic tests across all relevant clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) was provided to two general practitioners (GPs) who work within the primary author's research department and practice in the United Kingdom. They independently identified which tests could be requested in the primary care setting from those only accessible in specialist care. Interrater agreement between the two GPs was 76%. A third GP resolved any disagreements. The list of included and excluded diagnostic tests was provided to four other GPs who practice in different parts of the United Kingdom. They unanimously agreed on its validity.

- **Assessment of quality of evidence**: We examined the evidence underpinning recommendations for diagnostic tests identified by the GPs. Supporting references could include other guidelines, evidence syntheses, and primary studies. The full texts of referenced studies supporting each guideline recommendation were identified from Medline and Embase searches. If no studies supported a guideline recommendation and it was not explicitly stated that the recommendation was based on expert opinion, we contacted the author organization for clarification.

Two reviewers independently appraised the supporting studies for each recommendation and assessed their quality using GRADE, the most widely adopted tool for grading the quality of evidence supporting guideline recommendations. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and a third author if required. While GRADE assessments are typically tailored towards intervention outcomes, we used the guidance for performing GRADE.

### A practical guide to patch testing [^113H8Ahs]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Contact dermatitis is a common disease seen by allergists, dermatologists, and primary care physicians. The gold standard for diagnosing allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is patch testing. This method is indicated in any patient with chronic, pruritic, eczematous, or lichenified dermatitis if underlying or secondary ACD is suspected.

Patients with acute generalized dermatitis, who have extensive eczema on the back, are on immunosuppressant medications, and have applied topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, or ultraviolet radiation to the patch test (PT) site may have suppressed PT reactions. The procedure of patch testing is not difficult to perform; however, the interpretation of the PT requires some critical components, including having an appropriate level of suspicion for the diagnosis of ACD, testing the relevant allergens in their proper vehicle and concentration, and possessing the necessary experience to properly interpret the results.

A careful history and physical examination must be correlated with the result of the PT to establish clinical relevance. Once the PT is completed, allergens are identified, and relevance is established, educating the patient about the avoidance of exposure is critical. The Joint Task Force of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology and the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology has developed updated practice parameters for contact dermatitis and patch testing, and their recommendations will be discussed.

### Standardized testing and written communication improve patient understanding of beta-lactam allergy testing outcomes: A multicenter, prospective study [^1127rYZt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2022). Low credibility.

Standardizing testing protocols and written communication of testing results improved participant understanding of their allergy status after beta-lactam delabeling from 54% concordance with the clinical team to 91.6% and may consequently change future antibiotic prescribing.

The focus of studies looking at delabeling practices has long concentrated on methods of testing, including skin testing regimens and provocation test practices. Few have reported how these practices translate beyond the allergy clinic or into patient understanding after testing. Of the 285 publications identified that looked at beta-lactam delabeling, only 3 addressed participants' understanding of the testing results after the fact. In these articles, 19.4% to 57.9% of delabeled participants considered themselves allergic to penicillin after testing. Previous studies have also looked at risk-stratifying patients so that testing is applied in a more streamlined manner. The focus on risk assessment and testing procedures is understandable given the known barriers to testing, including limited facilities and how time-intensive the procedure is for both clinician and patient. However, the importance of post-test care and communication may be underestimated.

When comparing the two phases of our study, more standardized testing regimes did not result in significantly different testing results. There were comparable rates of positivity across all forms of testing between the two phases. There was, however, a difference in the rate of delabeling. This may be partly attributed to the differences in age cohorts.

### Penicillin allergy testing is cost-saving: An economic evaluation study [^116kHFz7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Having a penicillin allergy label is associated with the use of less appropriate and more expensive antibiotics and increased healthcare utilization. Penicillin allergy testing results in delabeling most allergy claimants and may be cost-saving. This study aimed to project whether penicillin allergy testing in patients reporting a penicillin allergy is cost-saving.

- **Methods**: In this economic evaluation study, we built decision models to project the economic impact of two strategies for a patient with a penicillin allergy label: (1) perform diagnostic testing (drug challenges, with or without skin tests); and (2) do not perform diagnostic testing. The health service perspective was adopted, considering costs with penicillin allergy tests, hospital bed-days, outpatient visits, antibiotic use, and diagnostic testing. Twenty-four base case decision models were built, accounting for differences in the diagnostic workup, setting (inpatient vs. outpatient), and geographic region. Uncertainty was explored via probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

- **Results**: Penicillin allergy testing was cost-saving in all decision models built. For models assessing the performance of both skin tests and drug challenges, allergy testing resulted in average savings (in United States [US] dollars) of $657 for inpatients (US: $1444; Europe: $489) and $2746 for outpatients (US: $256; Europe: $6045). Seventy-five percent of simulations obtained through probabilistic sensitivity analysis identified testing as the less costly option.

- **Conclusions**: Penicillin allergy testing was projected to be cost-saving across all evaluated scenarios.

### Current practices in delaying testing for IgE-mediated food allergy after anaphylaxis [^114hFX4n]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2022). Low credibility.

General recommendations for delaying allergy testing, especially skin testing, in the weeks following anaphylaxis have been proposed owing to concerns about false-negative results. However, no specific guidelines exist to aid clinicians in deciding when to perform postanaphylactic food allergy testing and which test to use. The practices of allergists regarding a delay in testing for food allergies after anaphylaxis are unknown.

- **Objective**: We aimed to quantify the use of different approaches to postanaphylactic food allergy testing among allergists across the United States.

- **Methods**: A clinical scenario was presented to 82 allergy and immunology fellowship program directors via an email survey. They were asked whether they avoid skin prick and/or blood-specific IgE testing in a child in the 6 weeks following suspected food-induced anaphylaxis due to concerns about false-negative results.

- **Results**: The survey response rate was 33%. Of the 27 respondents, 4 (14.8%) avoid both blood and skin testing, 7 (25.9%) avoid skin testing only, and 16 (59.3%) do not avoid any testing.

- **Conclusion**: Given the paucity of published evidence, a spectrum of opinions exists regarding testing in the weeks following food-induced anaphylaxis. About 40% of the allergy and immunology fellowship program directors in the United States who responded to the survey avoid some allergy testing in the first 6 weeks after food-induced anaphylaxis due to concerns about false-negative results.
