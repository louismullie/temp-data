## Question

Dose of topamax for migraines

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate dose of Topamax (topiramate) for migraine prevention, including dosing, titration, special populations, and safety considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled dosing for adults. Then, I should verify the evidence base supporting dose selection and whether 100 mg/day is the optimal target. Next, I will review titration strategies and tolerability. After that, I need to check special populations, including pediatrics, pregnancy, and renal impairment. Finally, I will consider alternatives if topiramate is not tolerated and summarize practical recommendations with monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the FDA-labeled adult dose. The FDA labeling states that for patients 12 years and older, the recommended total daily dose for migraine prevention is 100 mg/day administered in two divided doses, with titration starting at 25 mg/day for one week and increasing by 25 mg increments weekly until the target dose or maximum tolerated dose is reached [^32cc5ce4] [^b36d65be].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence supporting 100 mg/day as the optimal target. Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses show that 100 mg/day reduces monthly migraine frequency by about 1.2–2.1 attacks versus placebo and achieves a roughly 46–49% 50% responder rate, with efficacy emerging within the first month. Importantly, 200 mg/day does not clearly outperform 100 mg/day and increases adverse effects, so 100 mg/day is the sweet spot for most adults [^86c22834] [^8e869c16] [^ab7bdbf8].

> I should confirm the titration strategy and tolerability. The standard approach is to start 25 mg nightly for one week, then increase by 25 mg/day each week to 50 mg twice daily by week 4, and continue to 100 mg/day if tolerated. Most adverse effects occur during titration, and slower titration can mitigate cognitive effects and paresthesia, which are the most common reasons for discontinuation [^32cc5ce4] [^80af6602] [^98ccdc3b].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric dosing. For adolescents 12–17 years, the FDA supports 100 mg/day as the effective dose, with titration from 25 mg/day weekly to 50 mg twice daily. A pivotal pediatric RCT showed 100 mg/day significantly reduced monthly migraine attacks versus placebo, whereas 50 mg/day did not, establishing 100 mg/day as the minimum effective dose in this age group [^97d8f857] [^5bc763a6] [^60291886].

> But wait, what if the patient is of childbearing potential or pregnant. I need to ensure teratogenic risk counseling and contraception planning are addressed. Topiramate is teratogenic and reduces the efficacy of combined hormonal contraceptives at doses above 200 mg/day; therefore, use the lowest effective dose, avoid use in pregnancy when possible, and ensure reliable contraception and folic acid supplementation if used in patients who could become pregnant [^c68b2a2e] [^d028daef] [^6d918727].

> I should double-check renal impairment. In patients with creatinine clearance less than 70 mL/min/1.73 m², the recommended dose is half the usual adult dose, so a typical target would be 50 mg/day in two divided doses with slower titration as needed [^669f4bed].

> Let me consider alternatives if topiramate is not tolerated. Propranolol, metoprolol, divalproex/valproate, and CGRP monoclonal antibodies are guideline-supported options. Head-to-head and comparative data suggest propranolol has similar efficacy to topiramate 100 mg/day in chronic migraine, and CGRP mAbs have better tolerability but are generally reserved after oral failures due to cost and access considerations [^8ecc2ca0] [^6d918727] [^f87bac76].

> I will now examine practical monitoring and discontinuation. Assess efficacy after about 3 months at a therapeutic dose, monitor for cognitive slowing, paresthesia, mood changes, and weight loss, and check serum bicarbonate if symptoms suggest metabolic acidosis. If stopping, taper by 25–50 mg/day weekly to reduce withdrawal seizures or rebound headache risk [^98ccdc3b] [^54592922].

> Putting this together, my final recommendation is as follows: for adults and adolescents 12 years and older, start topiramate 25 mg nightly for one week, increase by 25 mg/day each week to 50 mg twice daily by week 4, and continue to 100 mg/day if tolerated. Most patients will benefit at 100 mg/day, with 200 mg/day rarely justified due to diminishing returns and more adverse effects. Titrate more slowly if side effects emerge, and individualize to the maximum tolerated effective dose within this range [^32cc5ce4] [^8e869c16] [^ab7bdbf8].

The recommended dose of Topamax (topiramate) for migraine prevention is **100 mg/day** [^32cc5ce4], administered in two divided doses of 50 mg each [^b36d65be]. Start at 25 mg/day and titrate by 25 mg weekly to minimize side effects [^32cc5ce4]; if needed, adjust to 50–200 mg/day based on response and tolerability [^8e869c16]. In adolescents 12–17 years, the effective dose is **100 mg/day** [^5bc763a6] [^97d8f857], titrated from 25 mg/day [^60291886]. Common adverse effects include paresthesia, cognitive slowing, and weight loss [^98ccdc3b]; use caution in pregnancy and with renal impairment [^6d918727] [^669f4bed].

## Recommended adult dose and titration

- **Standard dose**: 100 mg/day in two divided doses (50 mg twice daily) [^32cc5ce4].
- **Titration**: Start at 25 mg/day and increase by 25 mg weekly until 100 mg/day is reached [^32cc5ce4].
- **Range**: 50–200 mg/day, individualized to response and tolerability [^8e869c16].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the 100 mg/day dose

- **Efficacy**: 100 mg/day reduces monthly migraine frequency by ~2.1 attacks vs placebo (~1.1) [^86c22834] and achieves a 49% ≥ 50% responder rate [^8e869c16].
- **Onset**: Significant benefit appears within the first month [^86c22834].
- **Dose-response**: 100 mg/day is optimal; 200 mg/day offers no added benefit and increases adverse effects [^8e869c16].

---

## Pediatric dosing (ages 12–17 years)

For pediatric patients aged 12–17 years, the **effective dose** is 100 mg/day [^5bc763a6], titrated from 25 mg/day in weekly 25 mg increments [^60291886]. The **evidence** comes from a randomized trial showing 100 mg/day reduced monthly migraine attacks by 72.2% vs 44.4% with placebo [^5bc763a6].

---

## Dosing in special populations

| **Population** | **Dose adjustment** |
|-|-|
| Renal impairment (CrCl < 70 mL/min/1.73 m²) | Reduce dose by 50% [^669f4bed] |
| Pregnancy | Avoid if possible; teratogenic risk; use reliable contraception [^6d918727] [^c68b2a2e] |
| Elderly | Use caution; slower titration may be needed |

---

## Common adverse effects and tolerability

- **Most common**: Paresthesia, cognitive slowing, fatigue, nausea, weight loss [^98ccdc3b].
- **Discontinuation**: 25% due to adverse effects in trials; most occur during titration [^98ccdc3b] [^80af6602].
- **Management**: Slow titration, evening dosing, and patient counseling improve tolerability [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other migraine preventive medications

Topiramate has **comparable efficacy** to propranolol, valproate, and amitriptyline [^0e8c784c] [^b8a02c0e] [^99178fde]. It is **first-line** alongside beta-blockers, valproate, and CGRP monoclonal antibodies [^584f4b49] [^6d918727].

---

## Summary of dosing recommendations

| **Patient population** | **Recommended dose** | **Titration schedule** |
|-|-|-|
| Adults (≥ 18 years) | 100 mg/day in two divided doses | 25 mg/day weekly increments |
| Adolescents (12–17 years) | 100 mg/day | 25 mg/day weekly increments |
| Renal impairment (CrCl < 70 mL/min/1.73 m²) | 50 mg/day (half dose) | Slower titration |
| Pregnancy | Avoid if possible | N/A |

---

The recommended dose of Topamax for migraine prevention is **100 mg/day** [^32cc5ce4], titrated from 25 mg/day [^32cc5ce4], with adjustments based on response and tolerability [^8e869c16].

### Topiramate for migraine prevention: a randomized controlled trial [^86c22834]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Small open-label and controlled trials suggest that the antiepileptic drug topiramate is effective for migraine prevention.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of topiramate for migraine prevention in a large controlled trial.

Design, Setting, and Patients

A 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted during outpatient treatment at 52 North American clinical centers. Patients were aged 12 to 65 years and had a 6-month history of migraine (International Headache Society criteria) and 3 to 12 migraines a month but no more than 15 headache days a month during a 28-day prospective baseline phase.

Interventions

After a washout period, patients meeting entry criteria were randomized to topiramate (50, 100, or 200 mg/d) or placebo. Topiramate was titrated by 25 mg/wk for 8 weeks to the assigned or maximum tolerated dose, whichever was less. Patients continued receiving that dose for 18 weeks.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary efficacy measure was change from baseline in mean monthly migraine frequency. Secondary efficacy measures included responder rate (proportion of patients with ≥ 50% reduction in monthly migraine frequency), reductions in mean number of monthly migraine days, severity, duration, and days a month requiring rescue medication, and adverse events. The month of onset of preventive treatment action was assessed.

Results

Of 483 patients randomized, 468 provided at least 1 postbaseline efficacy assessment and comprised the intent-to-treat population. Mean monthly migraine frequency decreased significantly for patients receiving topiramate at 100 mg/d (-2.1, P = 0.008) and topiramate at 200 mg/d (-2.4, P < .001) vs placebo (-1.1). Statistically significant reductions (P < .05) occurred within the first month with topiramate at 100 and 200 mg/d. The responder rate was significantly greater with topiramate at 50 mg/d (39%, P = 0.01), 100 mg/d (49%, P < .001), and 200 mg/d (47%, P < .001) vs placebo (23%). Reductions in migraine days were significant for the 100-mg/d (P = 0.003) and 200-mg/d (P < .001) topiramate groups. Rescue medication use was reduced in the 100-mg/d (P = 0.01) and 200-mg/d (P = 0.005) topiramate groups. Adverse events resulting in discontinuation in the topiramate groups included paresthesia, fatigue, and nausea.

Conclusion

Topiramate showed significant efficacy in migraine prevention within the first month of treatment, an effect maintained for the duration of the double-blind phase.

### Topiramate for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine in adults [^8e869c16]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Some antiepileptic drugs but not others are useful in clinical practice for the prophylaxis of migraine. This might be explained by the variety of actions of these drugs in the central nervous system. The present review is part of an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004, and previously updated (conclusions not changed) in 2007.

Objectives

To describe and assess the evidence from controlled trials on the efficacy and tolerability of topiramate for preventing migraine attacks in adult patients with episodic migraine.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 12), PubMed/MEDLINE (1966 to 15 January 2013), MEDLINE In-Process (current week, 15 January 2013), and EMBASE (1974 to 15 January 2013) and handsearched Headache and Cephalalgia through January 2013.

Selection Criteria

Studies were required to be prospective, controlled trials of topiramate taken regularly to prevent the occurrence of migraine attacks, to improve migraine-related quality of life, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. For headache frequency data, we calculated mean differences (MDs) between topiramate and comparator (placebo, active control, or topiramate in a different dose) for individual studies and pooled these across studies. For dichotomous data on responders (patients with ≥ 50% reduction in headache frequency), we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and, in select cases, risk ratios (RRs); we also calculated numbers needed to treat (NNTs). We calculated MDs for selected quality of life instruments. Finally, we summarised data on adverse events from placebo-controlled trials and calculated risk differences (RDs) and numbers needed to harm (NNHs).

Main Results

Twenty papers describing 17 unique trials met the inclusion criteria. Analysis of data from nine trials (1737 participants) showed that topiramate reduced headache frequency by about 1.2 attacks per 28 days as compared to placebo (MD -1.20; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.59 to -0.80). Data from nine trials (1190 participants) show that topiramate approximately doubled the proportion of responders relative to placebo (RR 2.02; 95% CI 1.57 to 2.60; NNT 4; 95% CI 3 to 6). Separate analysis of different topiramate doses produced similar MDs versus placebo at 50 mg (-0.95; 95% CI -1.95 to 0.04; three studies; 520 participants), 100 mg (-1.15; 95% CI -1.58 to -0.71; six studies; 1620 participants), and 200 mg (-0.94; 95% CI -1.53 to -0.36; five studies; 804 participants). All three doses significantly increased the proportion of responders relative to placebo; ORs were as follows: for 50 mg, 2.35 (95% CI 1.60 to 3.44; three studies; 519 participants); for 100 mg, 3.49 (95% CI 2.23 to 5.45; five studies; 852 participants); and for 200 mg, 2.49 (95% CI 1.61 to 3.87; six studies; 1025 participants). All three doses also significantly improved three or more domains of quality of life as compared to placebo. Meta-analysis of the three studies that included more than one dose of topiramate suggests that 200 mg is no more effective than 100 mg. With regard to mean headache frequency and/or responder rate, seven trials using active comparators found (a) no significant difference between topiramate and amitriptyline (one study, 330 participants); (b) no significant difference between topiramate and flunarizine (one study, 83 participants); (c) no significant difference between topiramate and propranolol (two studies, 342 participants); (d) no significant difference between topiramate and relaxation (one study, 61 participants); but (e) a slight significant advantage of topiramate over valproate (two studies, 120 participants). Relaxation improved migraine-specific quality of life significantly more than topiramate. In trials of topiramate against placebo, seven adverse events (AEs) were reported by at least three studies. These were usually mild and of a non-serious nature. Except for taste disturbance and weight loss, there were no significant differences in the frequency of AEs in general, or of the seven specific AEs, between placebo and topiramate 50 mg. AEs in general and all of the specific AEs except nausea were significantly more common on topiramate 100 mg than on placebo, with NNHs varying from 3 to 25, and the RDs versus placebo were even higher for topiramate 200 mg, with NNHs varying from 2 to 17.

Authors' Conclusions

Meta-analysis demonstrates that topiramate in a 100 mg/day dosage is effective in reducing headache frequency and reasonably well-tolerated in adult patients with episodic migraine. This provides good evidence to support its use in routine clinical management. More studies designed specifically to compare the efficacy or safety of topiramate versus other interventions with proven efficacy in the prophylaxis of migraine are needed.

### Analysis of safety and tolerability data obtained from over 1, 500 patients receiving topiramate for migraine prevention in controlled trials [^6b0ea81f]. Pain Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Topiramate is an effective and generally well-tolerated migraine preventive therapy, as shown in three large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled registration trials. Based upon efficacy/tolerability, topiramate 100 mg/day (50 mg BID) is the recommended target dose for most patients with migraine. To further assess the safety and tolerability of topiramate for migraine prevention, we analyzed safety data from 1,580 patients who participated in the three pivotal registration trials or an earlier pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Methods

The safety population consisted of all patients who took ≥ 1 dose of study medication during the double-blind phase (topiramate 50 mg/day [N = 235], 100 mg/day [N = 386], 200 mg/day [N = 514], or placebo [N = 445]). Safety assessments included adverse event (AE) reports, physical examination, and clinical laboratory tests.

Results

Paresthesia was the most common topiramate-associated AE (35%, 51%, and 49% of patients receiving topiramate 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, or 200 mg/day, respectively [6% on placebo]). The most common topiramate-associated AE were generally mild or moderate in severity and occurred at consistently higher rates during the titration period, compared with the maintenance period of the double-blind phase. AEs leading to withdrawal from the recommended dose of topiramate 100 mg/day included paresthesia (8%), fatigue (5%), nausea (2%), and difficulty with concentration (2%). Serious AEs were infrequent, occurring in 2% of 1,135 topiramate-treated patients and 3% of 445 placebo-treated patients. Patients on topiramate experienced significant decreases in mean body weight compared with placebo.

Conclusions

Topiramate is generally safe and reasonably well tolerated for the prevention of migraine in adults. The most common topiramate-associated AEs were mild or moderate in severity and occurred more frequently during titration to target doses.

### Topiramate reduces headache days in chronic migraine: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^4df1fa41]. Cephalalgia (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of topiramate for the prevention of chronic migraine in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Chronic migraine is a common form of disabling headache presenting in headache subspecialty practice. Preventive treatments are essential for chronic migraine management, although there are few or no controlled empirical trial data on their use in this patient population. Topiramate is approved for the prophylaxis of migraine headache in adults. Patients (18–65 years) who experienced chronic migraine (defined as ≥ 15 monthly migraine days) for ≥ 3 months prior to trial entry and had ≥ 12 migraine days during the 4-week (28-day) baseline phase were randomized to topiramate or placebo for a 16-week, double-blind trial. Topiramate was titrated (25 mg weekly) to a target dose of 100 mg/day, allowing dosing flexibility from 50 to 200 mg/day, according to patient need. Existing migraine preventive treatments, except for antiepileptic drugs, were continued throughout the trial. The primary efficacy measure was the change in number of migraine days from the 28-day baseline phase to the last 28 days of the double-blind phase in the intent-to-treat population, which consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of study medication and had one outcome assessment during the double-blind phase. Health-related quality of life was evaluated with the Migraine Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQ, Version 2.1), the Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) and the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) questionnaires, and tolerability was assessed by adverse event (AE) reports and early trial discontinuations. Eighty-two patients were screened. Thirty-two patients in the intent-to-treat population (mean age 46 years; 75% female) received topiramate (mean modal dose ± SD = 100 ± 17 mg/day) and 27 patients received placebo. Mean (± SD) baseline number of migraine days per 4 weeks was 15.5 ± 4.6 in the topiramate group and 16.4 ± 4.4 in the placebo group. Most patients (78%) met the definition for acute medication overuse at baseline. The mean duration of treatment was 100 and 92 days for topiramate- and placebo-treated patients, respectively. Study completion rates for topiramate- and placebo-treated patients were 75% and 52%, respectively. Topiramate significantly reduced the mean number of monthly migraine days (± SD) by 3.5 ± 6.3, compared with placebo (-0.2 ± 4.7, P < 0.05). No significant intergroup differences were found for MSQ and HIT-6. MIDAS showed improvement with the topiramate treatment group (P = 0.042 vs. placebo). Treatment emergent adverse events were reported by 75% of topiramate-treated patients (37%, placebo). The most common AEs, paraesthesia, nausea, dizziness, dyspepsia, fatigue, anorexia and disturbance in attention, were reported by 53%, 9%, 6%, 6%, 6%, 6% and 6% of topiramate-treated patients, respectively, vs. 7%, 0%, 0%, 0%, 0%, 4% and 4% of placebo-treated patients. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial demonstrates that topiramate is effective and reasonably well tolerated when used for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine, even in the presence of medication overuse.

### Efficacy and tolerability of topiramate 200 mg / D in the prevention of migraine with / without aura in adults: a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 12-week pilot study [^5bc2271a]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Several large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have found topiramate (TPM) to be effective and generally well tolerated as a preventive therapy for migraine.

Objective

This paper evaluates efficacy and safety data from a pilot study of TPM 200 mg/d as preventive therapy in adult subjects with a history of migraine with or without aura.

Methods

The pilot study had a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive TPM 200 mg/d or placebo. The double-blind treatment phase consisted of an 8-week titration period (25 mg/d for the first week, followed by weekly increases of 25 mg) and a 12-week maintenance period. The primary efficacy measure was the change in mean monthly migraine frequency. Additional measures were the median percent reduction in monthly migraine frequency and the proportion of responders (those with ≥ 50%, ≥ 75%, or 100% reduction in monthly migraine frequency).

Results

The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included 211 subjects (138 TPM, 73 placebo; mean [SD] mean weight, 76.7 [18.7] kg). Of 45 subjects who discontinued the study in the TPM group, 21 discontinued during the titration period, compared with 3 of 13 subjects who discontinued in the placebo group. When the efficacy data were assessed using the per-protocol, analysis-of-covariance model, TPM 200 mg/d was not associated with a significant reduction in mean monthly migraine frequency compared with placebo. A post hoc analysis using a Poisson regression model in the ITT population suggested that TPM significantly reduced mean monthly migraine frequency compared with placebo (P = 0.04). A significantly larger proportion of TPM-treated subjects had a ≥ 75% reduction in monthly migraine frequency compared with placebo (P = 0.03). At least 1 adverse event was reported by 90.0% and 69.9% of the TPM and placebo groups, respectively. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) occurring in ≥ 10% of subjects in the TPM group were paresthesia (45%), dizziness (16%), fatigue (16%), nausea (14%), and weight loss (14%). Most treatment-emergent AEs were rated mild or moderate in severity. Of 3 serious AEs (depression, abdominal pain, leg pain) occurring during the trial, none were considered related to either TPM or placebo.

Conclusion

In this pilot study, mean monthly migraine frequency did not differ significantly between TPM and placebo.

### Cessation versus continuation of 6-month migraine preventive therapy with topiramate (PROMPT): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^dc76ad05]. The Lancet: Neurology (2007). Medium credibility.

Background

Use of preventive therapy for migraine is often recommended for only 6–9 months, but no randomised, placebo-controlled trials have investigated migraine frequency after the end of prophylaxis. We assessed the effects of discontinuation of topiramate after a treatment period of 6 months.

Methods

818 patients who have migraines were enrolled from 88 clinics in 21 countries. After a 4-8-week lead-in period, patients received topiramate in a 26-week open-label phase. Daily dose was increased from 25 mg to 100 mg in steps of 25 mg every week; the dose could be adjusted further in the range 50–200 mg/day, but was stable for the final 4 weeks. Patients were randomly assigned to continue this dose or switch to placebo for a 26-week double-blind phase. The primary endpoint was the difference in number of days with migraine during the last 4 weeks of the double-blind phase compared with the last 4 weeks of the open-label phase. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2005-000321-29.

Findings

559 patients (68.3%) completed the open-label phase; 514 entered the double-blind phase and were assigned to topiramate (n = 255) or placebo (n = 259). The mean increase in number of migraine days was greater in the placebo group (1.19 days in 4 weeks, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.66; p < 0.0001) than in the topiramate group (0.10, -0.36 to 0.56; p = 0.5756; mean difference between groups -1.09, -1.75 to -0.43; p = 0.0011) Patients in the placebo group had a greater number of days on acute medication than did those in the topiramate group (mean difference between groups -0.95, -1.49 to -0.41; p = 0.0007). Quality of life, as assessed by the MIDAS questionnaire, fell in the placebo group but remained stable in the topiramate group. Patients were more satisfied with the efficacy of topiramate than with that of placebo, whereas satisfaction with tolerability was similar in both treatment groups.

Interpretation

Sustained benefit was reported after discontinuation of topiramate, although number of migraine days did increase. These findings suggest that patients should be treated for 6 months, with the option to continue to 12 months in some patients.

### May lamotrigine be an alternative to topiramate in the prevention of migraine with aura? Results of a retrospective study [^78d40bab]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Results

Of the 53 patients recruited, 25 (3 male/22 female) were treated with topiramate and 28 (3 male/25 female) with lamotrigine. Among the two treatment groups, only one patient affected by aura without migraine was included, who had been treated with topiramate. Demographics and baseline clinical characteristics of both treatment groups are detailed in table 1.

Table 1
Demographics and baseline clinical characteristics of study population

Clinical features and distribution of migraine aura within the study population are reported in table 2.

Table 2
Clinical characteristics and distribution of migraine aura within the two treatment groups

Groups were sex- but not age-matched, since lamotrigine-treated patients were younger than those treated with topiramate (median age 37 and 46 years, respectively). There was no difference in age of migraine onset between the two groups. Interestingly, among lamotrigine-treated patients, 71% (20/28) had been previously treated with at least another migraine prophylactic agent compared with 48% (12/25) of those within the topiramate group, although this difference was not statistical significant, as shown in table 1.

Median prescribed dosage was 50 mg two times a day for both lamotrigine and topiramate (range 25 mg two times a day to 100 mg two times a day). Two patients treated with lamotrigine and one patient treated with topiramate discontinued treatment after few days due to severe side effects and were therefore excluded from outcome analysis.

Responder rates and optimal responder rates for monthly aura frequency, aura duration per episode and monthly migraine frequency are detailed in table 3.

Table 3
RRs and ORRs at the end of the follow-up period

Both lamotrigine and topiramate were highly effective in reducing monthly migraine frequency of at least 50% at the end of the follow-up period and no substantial difference between the two treatment groups was reported. Responder rates for aura frequency and duration were higher in the lamotrigine group compared with the topiramate group (88% vs 79% and 73% vs 54%, respectively), although these differences failed to reach statistical significance.

### Topiramate [^0b198fd4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.3 Preventive Treatment of Migraine

Adult Patients

The results of 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials established the effectiveness of topiramate in the preventive treatment of migraine. The design of both trials (Study 11 was conducted in the U.S. and Study 12 was conducted in the U.S. and Canada) was identical, enrolling patients with a history of migraine, with or without aura, for at least 6 months, according to the International Headache Society (IHS) diagnostic criteria. Patients with a history of cluster headaches or basilar, ophthalmoplegic, hemiplegic, or transformed migraine headaches were excluded from the trials. Patients were required to have completed up to a 2-week washout of any prior migraine preventive medications before starting the baseline phase.

Patients who experienced 3 to 12 migraine headaches over the 4 weeks in the baseline phase were randomized to either topiramate 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, 200 mg/day, or placebo and treated for a total of 26 weeks (8-week titration period and 18-week maintenance period). Treatment was initiated at 25 mg/day for one week, and then the daily dosage was increased by 25 mg increments each week until reaching the assigned target dose or maximum tolerated dose (administered twice daily).

### Topiramate versus amitriptyline in migraine prevention: a 26-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group noninferiority trial in adult migraineurs [^99178fde]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of topiramate and amitriptyline in the prophylaxis of episodic migraine headache.

Methods

This was a 26-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group noninferiority study. Adults with 3 to 12 migraines per month were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive an initial dose of 25 mg/d of either topiramate or amitriptyline, subsequently titrated to a maximum of 100 mg/d (or the maximum tolerated dose). The primary efficacy outcome was the change from prospective baseline in the mean monthly number of migraine episodes. Secondary efficacy variables included changes from the prospective baseline phase to the end of the double-blind phase in the mean monthly (28-day) rate of days with migraine, mean monthly rate of days with headache (migraine and nonmigraine), mean monthly rate of acute abortive medication use, mean monthly migraine duration, and mean monthly migraine severity. Additional secondary efficacy variables included changes in the mean monthly severity of migraine-associated symptoms (photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea), change in the mean monthly frequency f migraine-associated vomiting, and response rates (based on monthly migraine days and total headache days). The Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQ) and the Weight Satisfaction Scale Questionnaire, which measures subjective satisfaction with current weight, were administered. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were monitored through the end of double-blind treatment.

Results

The intent-to-treat population included 331 subjects (172 topiramate, 159 amitriptyline; 84.9% female; 84.6% white; mean [SD] age, 38.8 [11.0] years; mean weight, 77.1 [20.1] kg) who provided at least 1 efficacy assessment. The least squares mean (LSM) change from baseline in the mean monthly number of migraine episodes was not significantly different between the topiramate and amitriptyline groups (-2.6 and -2.7, respectively; 95% CI, -0.6 to 0.7). There were no significant differences between treatment groups in any of the prespecified secondary outcome measures. Subjects receiving topiramate had a significantly greater improvement in mean functional disability scores during migraine attacks compared with amitriptyline (LSM change: -0.33 vs -0.19; 95% CI, -0.3 to 0.0; P = 0.040) and in the role function-restrictive, role function-preventive, and emotional function domains of the MSQ (P = 0.012, P = 0.014, and P = 0.029, respectively). Subjects receiving topiramate had a mean weight loss of 2.4 kg, compared with a mean weight gain of 2.4 kg in subjects receiving amitriptyline. Subjects in the topiramate group reported an overall improvement from baseline in weight satisfaction, whereas the amitriptyline group reported an overall deterioration in weight satisfaction (P < 0.001, topiramate vs amitriptyline). TEAEs of mild or moderate severity were reported in 118 subjects (66.7%) in the topiramate group and 112 subjects (66.3%) in the amitriptyline group. Among the most common TEAEs (reported in ± 5% of subjects during the double-blind phase) in the topiramate group were paresthesia (29.9%), fatigue (16.9%), somnolence (11.9%), hypoesthesia (10.7%), and nausea (10.2%). The most commonly reported TEAEs in the amitriptyline group were dry mouth (35.5%), fatigue (24.3%), somnolence (17.8%), weight increase (13.6%), dizziness (10.7%), and sinusitis (10.7%).

Conclusions

In this noninferiority study, topiramate was at least as effective as amitriptyline in terms of reducing the rate of mean monthly migraine episodes and all prespecified secondary efficacy end points. Topiramate was associated with improvement in some quality-of-life indicators compared with amitriptyline and was associated with weight loss and improved weight satisfaction.

### Topiramate monotherapy in epilepsy and migraine prevention [^3c2cfef4]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purposes of this review were to assess the efficacy of topiramate as monotherapy for epilepsy and migraine prevention, describe how it should be used, and give clinical advice on how to manage the practical aspects of dosing, titration, and possible adverse events in these 2 indications.

Methods

We searched the PubMed and BIOSIS databases using the key words topiramate, epilepsy, and migraine from the year 1987 onward, and subsequently focused the search on larger controlled trial studies of topiramate as monotherapy.

Results

Studies have evaluated the use of topiramate as monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset and generalized seizures and in the prevention of migraine. In a randomized study, 75% of epilepsy patients treated with 400 mg/d topiramate remained seizure free at 1 year. Patients in the same study treated with a lower dose of topiramate (50 mg/d) also experienced notable seizure reductions, with 59% of patients free of seizures at 1 year. A comparison trial of topiramate (100 or 200 mg/d), valproate, and carbamazepine found that topiramate was associated with a similar time to first posttreatment seizure as the other 2 agents (P = NS). Trials of topiramate monotherapy in migraine prevention found that 100 mg/d was associated with a ≥ 50% reduction in monthly migraine frequency in 49% to 54% of patients. The migraine prevention trials typically used a starting dose of 25 mg/d, with weekly increases of 25 mg and an initial monotherapy target dose of 100 mg/d. The most common adverse events associated with topiramate are paresthesia, weight loss, and other centrally mediated symptoms, many of which may be ameliorated by proper titration and dosing and by good communication between physician and patient.

Conclusions

Data from controlled trials suggest that 100 mg/d topiramate as monotherapy is effective in the treatment of partial-onset and generalized seizures and in the prevention of migraine.

### May lamotrigine be an alternative to topiramate in the prevention of migraine with aura? Results of a retrospective study [^1b7f30ea]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

A total of 53 patients were recruited, 25 of whom treated with topiramate and 28 with lamotrigine. Nine patients within the topiramate group and six patients within the lamotrigine group also reported migraine without aura attacks. Finally, one patient affected by aura without migraine was also included, who had been treated with topiramate. Local ethics committee waived the need for approval and the need to obtain consent for the collection, analysis and publication of the retrospectively obtained and anonymized data for this study.

According to clinical records, all patients had normal extensive laboratory findings, including workup for an underlying coagulopathy. Furthermore, all of them have previously undergone MRI brain scan in order to exclude secondary cause of headache. Treatment dosage varied between 25 mg two times a day and 100 mg two times a day both for topiramate and lamotrigine, according to clinical judgement. Treatments were gradually started in order to reduce development of side effects. All patients were followed for a period of at least 6 months after starting treatment. Reassessment took place on ambulatory visit or on phone interviews conducted by trained examiners. Data collection was based both on patient self-reporting and on examination of headache diary. We evaluated responder rates, defined as the percentage of patients reporting a reduction of at least 50% of migraine with aura attacks at the end of the follow-up period, and optimal responder rates, defined as patient reporting a complete disappearance of migraine with aura attacks at 6 month follow-up. We further evaluate the pre- to post-treatment change of monthly (28 days) aura frequency, aura duration per episode (minutes), monthly (28 days) migraine frequency, monthly days of headache and rescue medication used per month between the two treatment groups. Finally, dropout rate and type and frequency of side effects for both treatment groups were reported.

14.3 Preventive Treatment of Migraine

Adult Patients

The results of 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials established the effectiveness of topiramatein the preventive treatment of migraine. The design of both trials (Study 11 was conducted in the U.S. and Study 12 was conducted in the U.S. and Canada) was identical, enrolling patients with a history of migraine, with or without aura, for at least 6 months, according to the International Headache Society (IHS) diagnostic criteria. Patients with a history of cluster headaches or basilar, ophthalmoplegic, hemiplegic, or transformed migraine headaches were excluded from the trials. Patients were required to have completed up to a 2-week washout of any prior migraine preventive medications before starting the baseline phase.

Patients who experienced 3 to 12 migraine headaches over the 4 weeks in the baseline phase were randomized to either topiramate 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, 200 mg/day, or placebo and treated for a total of 26 weeks (8-week titration period and 18-week maintenance period). Treatment was initiated at 25 mg/day for one week, and then the daily dosage was increased by 25 mg increments each week until reaching the assigned target dose or maximum tolerated dose (administered twice daily).

### New players in the preventive treatment of migraine [^d87d85fd]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Do we need novel migraine preventive treatments?

Although there are many approved and unapproved preventive treatments for migraine, they are often insufficient to manage migraineurs effectively, even in the right hands. There are issues of efficacy, tolerance, safety, adherence, pharmacophobia and nocebo response, all suggesting the need for better treatments. There are several outcome measures used in clinical trials to qualify the efficacy of migraine prevention. The most common is a decrease in migraine or headache days per month compared to baseline, and the proportion of responders to the treatment, defined as those patients that report more than a 50% decrease in migraine days per month after a given treatment (the 50% responder rate). The number needed to treat (NNT; defined as the number of patients who need a specific treatment to prevent one additional bad outcome, e.g. a migraine attack) for responders varies from 4–6 in several randomized trials for migraine prevention (indicating that 4–6 patients suffering from migraine must be treated in order for one to reach a 50% decrease in migraine days per month). The decrease in migraine days per month after extracting the placebo effect varies from 1.2–1.8. This absolute improvement, not including the placebo effect that indeed exists and improves treatment outcomes in real life, looks very small; there is clearly room for improvement. There is also evidence that migraineurs are very sensitive to adverse events (AEs) of preventive medications and more likely to withdraw from treatment because of AEs in comparison to epileptics, as one meta-analytic study with topiramate showed. Generally, one out of five patients treated with any migraine preventive pharmaceutical agent will discontinue treatment because of tolerability and safety reasons, as did one out of twenty patients treated with placebo in randomized controlled studies. In this context, a medication's safety profile matters significantly to migraineurs and impacts adherence considerably.

### Evidence-based guideline update: pharmacologic treatment for episodic migraine prevention in adults: report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society [^0e8c784c]. Neurology (2012). Medium credibility.

Topiramate for episodic migraine prevention — evidence synthesis and comparative effectiveness — has Class I and II support and shows placebo-controlled and active-comparator efficacy. Results of 5 Class II studies support those of the Class I studies showing topiramate as effective for migraine prevention, with four demonstrating significant improvement over placebo and one suggesting equivalence of topiramate (100, 200 mg/day) and propranolol (160 mg/day); two studies comparing topiramate and amitriptyline (25–150 mg/day) reported no difference in efficacy for primary endpoints, and one Class II 24-week pilot study failed to show a difference between topiramate 200 mg and placebo. Topiramate is established as effective for migraine prevention (4 Class I studies, multiple Class II studies; 1 negative Class II study), and topiramate is probably as effective for migraine prevention as propranolol, sodium valproate, and amitriptyline as noted on-page with their respective study class counts.

The effectiveness of topiramate for the preventive treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was established in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial (Study 13). The study enrolled 103 patients (40 male, 63 female) 12 to 17 years of age with episodic migraine headaches with or without aura. Patient selection was based on IHS criteria for migraines (using proposed revisions to the 1988 IHS pediatric migraine criteria [IHS-R criteria]).

Patients who experienced 3 to 12 migraine attacks (according to migraines classified by patient reported diaries) and ≤ 14 headache days (migraine and non-migraine) during the 4-week prospective baseline period were randomized to either topiramate 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, or placebo and treated for a total of 16 weeks (4-week titration period followed by a 12-week maintenance period). Treatment was initiated at 25 mg/day for one week, and then the daily dosage was increased by 25 mg increments each week until reaching the assigned target dose or maximum tolerated dose (administered twice daily). Approximately 80% or more patients in each treatment group completed the study. The median average daily dosages were 45 and 79 mg/day in the target dose groups of topiramate 50 and 100 mg/day, respectively.

### May lamotrigine be an alternative to topiramate in the prevention of migraine with aura? Results of a retrospective study [^c9fe327d]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

The aim of our study was to explore the role of lamotrigine for the prevention of episodic migraine with aura. For this purpose, we decided to compare lamotrigine to topiramate, an antiepileptic drug established to be highly effective for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine. Pooled data from three large multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials demonstrated a clinically relevant response of monthly migraine frequency in patients treated with topiramate compared with placebo and led to topiramate approval as first-line drug for migraine prophylaxis. Further studies confirmed a similar efficacy of topiramate compared with other first-line prophylactic drugs such as propranolol and valproate. Real-world experience with topiramate proved its efficacy in reducing migraine frequency, improving patient quality of life and social functioning as well as reducing healthcare resources allocation to headache, making topiramate one of the most used migraine preventive drug in clinical practice nowadays. Moreover, due to its mechanism of action, topiramate is also believed to affect migraine aura initiation. In an experimental model of CSD, topiramate showed to inhibit the propagation of induced CSD in a dose-dependent manner. However, its clinical efficacy in preventing migraine aura is not clear. In an open longitudinal, pilot study involving patients affected by migraine with aura, topiramate failed to reduce aura frequency and duration at 6-month follow-up. Additionally, a posthoc analysis of the PROMPT trial, a well-designed study consisting of an open label phase in which patients were treated with topiramate for 26 weeks, followed by a double-blind phase in which patients were randomized to receive placebo or continue to receive topiramate, showed a significant reduction in migraine aura frequency at the end of the open label phase which was maintained throughout the double-blind phase. However, no significant change in number of auras between topiramate and placebo were found at the end of the follow-up period.

### Topiramate (Topamax) [^60291886]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age

The effectiveness of TOPAMAX for the preventive treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was established in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial (Study 13). The study enrolled 103 patients (40 male, 63 female) 12 to 17 years of age with episodic migraine headaches with or without aura. Patient selection was based on IHS criteria for migraines (using proposed revisions to the 1988 IHS pediatric migraine criteria [IHS-R criteria]).

Patients who experienced 3 to 12 migraine attacks (according to migraines classified by patient reported diaries) and ≤ 14 headache days (migraine and non-migraine) during the 4-week prospective baseline period were randomized to either TOPAMAX 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, or placebo and treated for a total of 16 weeks (4-week titration period followed by a 12-week maintenance period). Treatment was initiated at 25 mg/day for one week, and then the daily dosage was increased by 25 mg increments each week until reaching the assigned target dose or maximum tolerated dose (administered twice daily). Approximately 80% or more patients in each treatment group completed the study. The median average daily dosages were 45 and 79 mg/day in the target dose groups of TOPAMAX 50 and 100 mg/day, respectively.

Effectiveness of treatment was assessed by comparing each TOPAMAX treatment group to placebo (ITT population) for the percent reduction from baseline to the last 12 weeks of the double-blind phase in the monthly migraine attack rate (primary endpoint). The percent reduction from baseline to the last 12 weeks of the double-blind phase in average monthly migraine attack rate is shown in Table 14. The 100 mg TOPAMAX dose produced a statistically significant treatment difference relative to placebo of 28% reduction from baseline in the monthly migraine attack rate.

The mean reduction from baseline to the last 12 weeks of the double-blind phase in average monthly attack rate, a key secondary efficacy endpoint in Study 13 (and the primary efficacy endpoint in Studies 11 and 12, of adults) was 3.0 for 100 mg TOPAMAX dose and 1.7 for placebo. This 1.3 treatment difference in mean reduction from baseline of monthly migraine rate was statistically significant (p = 0.0087).

### May lamotrigine be an alternative to topiramate in the prevention of migraine with aura? Results of a retrospective study [^b9fb4da7]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Finally, according to the North American Antiepileptic Drug pregnancy registry, topiramate showed a dose independent threefold higher risk of congenital malformations and child developmental retardation in women exposed to the drug, especially in the first trimester of pregnancy. On the other hand, teratogenic activity of lamotrigine is dose-dependent and exerted at higher dosage than that used for migraine prophylaxis. Based on our findings, lamotrigine should be considered in clinical practice for patients having migraine with aura reporting unresponsiveness to topiramate treatment or who discontinue the drug due to side effects. Moreover, lamotrigine could be safely offered to patients who have contraindications to topiramate, especially migraine with aura women planning to have pregnancy.

Regarding the effects on aura frequency and duration, our results showed a trend towards a better efficacy of lamotrigine compared with topiramate. Responder rates for monthly aura frequency were similar between the two treatment groups. However, approximately half of the lamotrigine-treated patients reported a complete disappearance of aura at 6-month follow-up. Additionally, lamotrigine determined a reduction of aura duration per episode of approximately 15 min. In line with previous findings, lamotrigine should then be considered in clinical practice for the treatment of prolonged or disturbing migraine with aura. We are aware of several limitations of this study. A possible bias in patients' selection, the small number of patients recruited, the absence of a placebo controlled group and the retrospective nature of our study may have indicated a higher efficacy of both drugs than observed in other studies. Although results similar to ours for lamotrigine have been previously reported by Pascual et al with a retrospective, non-placebo-controlledì analysis, we think that the main result of our study was not the demonstration of the effectiveness of any specific drug, rather the evidence of a similar effectiveness of lamotrigine compared with topiramate. This could open new therapeutic possibilities, especially in patients for whom topiramate is contraindicated or who are intolerant to this drug. We hope that our observation may stimulate further prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled trials to prove the role of lamotrigine in the prophylaxis of migraine with aura.

The effectiveness of immediate-release topiramate for the preventive treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was established in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial (Study 13). The study enrolled 103 patients (40 male, 63 female) 12 to 17 years of age with episodic migraine headaches with or without aura. Patient selection was based on IHS criteria for migraines (using proposed revisions to the 1988 IHS pediatric migraine criteria [IHS-R criteria]).

Patients who experienced 3 to 12 migraine attacks (according to migraines classified by patient reported diaries) and ≤ 14 headache days (migraine and non-migraine) during the 4-week prospective baseline period were randomized to either immediate-release topiramate 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, or placebo and treated for a total of 16 weeks (4-week titration period followed by a 12-week maintenance period). Treatment was initiated at 25 mg/day for one week, and then the daily dosage was increased by 25 mg increments each week until reaching the assigned target dose or maximum tolerated dose (administered twice daily). Approximately 80% or more patients in each treatment group completed the study. The median average daily dosages were 45 and 79 mg/day in the target dose groups of immediate-release topiramate 50 and 100 mg/day, respectively.

Effectiveness of treatment was assessed by comparing each immediate-release topiramate treatment group to placebo (ITT population) for the percent reduction from baseline to the last 12 weeks of the double-blind phase in the monthly migraine attack rate (primary endpoint). The percent reduction from baseline to the last 12 weeks of the double-blind phase in average monthly migraine attack rate is shown in Table 16.

### Topiramate in migraine prophylaxis – results from a placebo-controlled trial with propranolol as an active control [^b8a02c0e]. Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Topiramate (TPM) has shown efficacy in migraine prophylaxis in two large placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trials. We conducted a randomised, double-blind, multicentre trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two doses of topiramate vs placebo for migraine prophylaxis, with propranolol (PROP) as an active control. Subjects with episodic migraine with and without aura were randomised to TPM 100 mg/d, TPM 200 mg/d, PROP 160 mg/d (active control), or placebo. The primary efficacy measure was the change in mean monthly migraine frequency from the baseline phase relative to the double-blind treatment phase. Five hundred and seventy-five subjects were enrolled from 61 centres in 13 countries. TPM 100 mg/d was superior to placebo as measured by reduction in monthly migraine frequency, overall 50% responder rate, reduction in monthly migraine days, and reduction in the rate of daily rescue medication use. The TPM 100 mg/d and PROP groups were similar with respect to reductions in migraine frequency, responder rate, migraine days, and daily rescue medication usage. TPM 100 mg/d was better tolerated than TPM 200 mg/d, and was generally comparable to PROP. No unusual or unexpected safety risks emerged. These findings demonstrate that TPM 100 mg/d is effective in migraine prophylaxis. TPM 100 mg/d and PROP 160 mg/d exhibited similar efficacy profiles.

Topiramate for migraine prevention — recommendation and safety: We suggest topiramate for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine. It is categorized as Reviewed, New-replaced, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was moderate. The benefits of topiramate in improving monthly migraine days in patients with chronic and episodic migraines slightly outweighed the potential harm of adverse events. Safety cautions include the reduced efficacy of contraception at topiramate doses > 200 mg and an increased risk of teratogenicity with use during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester; cognitive side effects can be extremely bothersome, especially in patients with TBI or PTH, and should be used cautiously or avoided.

### Topiramate (Topamax) [^ab7bdbf8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Effectiveness of treatment was assessed by the reduction in migraine headache frequency, as measured by the change in 4-week migraine rate (according to migraines classified by IHS criteria) from the baseline phase to double-blind treatment period in each TOPAMAX treatment group compared to placebo in the Intent-To-Treat (ITT) population.

In Study 11, a total of 469 patients (416 females, 53 males), ranging in age from 13 to 70 years, were randomized and provided efficacy data. Two hundred sixty-five patients completed the entire 26-week double-blind phase. The median average daily dosages were 48 mg/day, 88 mg/day, and 132 mg/day in the target dose groups of TOPAMAX 50, 100, and 200 mg/day, respectively.

The mean migraine headache frequency rate at baseline was approximately 5.5 migraine headaches/28 days and was similar across treatment groups. The change in the mean 4-week migraine headache frequency from baseline to the double-blind phase was -1.3, -2.1, and -2.2 in the TOPAMAX 50, 100, and 200 mg/day groups, respectively, versus -0.8 in the placebo group (see Figure 2). The treatment differences between the TOPAMAX 100 and 200 mg/day groups versus placebo were similar and statistically significant (p < 0.001 for both comparisons).

### Migraines with and without aura and their response to preventive therapy with topiramate [^6e5fbc10]. Cephalalgia (2010). Low credibility.

Data from the Prolonged Migraine Prevention (PROMPT) with Topiramate trial were evaluated post hoc to determine whether topiramate could prevent migraine auras, and whether its efficacy in preventing migraine headaches was similar in patients with (MA; n = 269) and without (MoA; n = 542) aura. Migraines and auras were recorded during prospective baseline, 6-month open-label (OL) topiramate and 6-month double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled phases. In the last 28 OL days, migraines without aura and migraine auras decreased by 43.1% and 54.1%, respectively, in MA patients. MoA patients experienced a 44.3% reduction in migraines. In the DB phase, increases in migraines with placebo vs. topiramate were similar to the full study, but were generally not statistically significant, probably due to lack of power in the subgroup analysis. Similarly, there were no statistically significant changes in number of auras between groups. Thus, topiramate appears to reduce migraine auras in parallel with headache reductions, which are similar in patients with and without aura.

### Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topiramate for migraine prevention in pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age [^5bc763a6]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Currently, no drugs are Food and Drug Administration-approved for migraine prophylaxis in pediatric patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topiramate for migraine prevention in adolescents.

Methods

Adolescents (12–17 years of age) with a ≥ 6-month history of migraine were assigned randomly to receive 16 weeks of daily treatment with topiramate (50 or 100 mg/day) or placebo. The primary efficacy measure was the percent reduction in monthly migraine attacks, with the use of the 48-hour rule, from the prospective baseline period to the last 12 weeks of the double-blind phase. The 48-hour rule defined a single migraine episode as all recurrences of migraine symptoms within 48 hours after onset. Several secondary efficacy measures were evaluated, including the reduction from baseline in the monthly migraine day rate and the 50% responder rate. Safety and tolerability were also assessed.

Results

A total of 29 (83%) of 35 subjects treated with topiramate at 50 mg/day, 30 (86%) of 35 subjects treated with topiramate at 100 mg/day, and 26 (79.0%) of 33 placebo-treated subjects completed double-blind treatment. Topiramate at 100 mg/day, but not 50 mg/day, resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the monthly migraine attack rate from baseline versus placebo (median: 72.2% vs 44.4%) during the last 12 weeks of double-blind treatment. Topiramate at 100 mg/day, but not 50 mg/day, also resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the monthly migraine day rate from baseline versus placebo. The responder rate favored topiramate at 100 mg/day (83% vs 45% for placebo). Upper respiratory tract infection, paresthesia, and dizziness occurred more commonly in the topiramate groups than in the placebo group.

Conclusions

The 100 mg/day topiramate group demonstrated efficacy in the prevention of migraine in pediatric subjects. Overall, topiramate treatment was safe and well tolerated.

### Utility of topiramate for the treatment of patients with chronic migraine in the presence or absence of acute medication overuse [^2200d8d9]. Cephalalgia (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic migraine has been linked to the excessive use of acute headache medications. Medication overuse (MO) is commonly considered the most significant risk factor for the progression of migraine from an episodic to a chronic condition. Managing MO is a challenge. Discontinuation of the acute medication can result in withdrawal headache, nausea, vomiting and sleep disturbances. This review summarizes the results from two similarly designed, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentre studies of chronic migraine conducted in the USA and European Union. Both studies demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the migraine preventive medication, topiramate, for the treatment of chronic migraine in patient populations both with and without MO. These studies may have important implications for the future of chronic migraine management, suggesting that detoxification prior to initiating prophylactic therapy may not be required in all patients if MO is present.

### Time course of adverse events most commonly associated with topiramate for migraine prevention [^80af6602]. European Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

The efficacy, safety and tolerability of topiramate has been demonstrated in three large multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. To characterize the time course of adverse events (AEs) that led to treatment discontinuation in ≥ 2% of patients who received topiramate 100 mg/day during three pivotal, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and 26-week trials. The pooled population comprised all randomized patients who reported safety data during the double-blind phase (topiramate 100 mg/day, n = 386; placebo n = 372), which consisted of a 4-week titration period and a 22-week maintenance period. Incidence, time to onset, and cumulative mean rate of AEs were assessed. Overall, AEs led to treatment discontinuation in 24.9% of patients receiving topiramate 100 mg/day and 11.0% receiving placebo (P < 0.001). AEs leading to discontinuation during the double-blind phase in ≥ 2% of patients included paresthesia (8.0% discontinued), any cognitive symptoms (7.3% discontinued), fatigue (4.7% discontinued), insomnia (3.4% discontinued), nausea (2.3% discontinued), loss of appetite, anxiety, and dizziness (2.1% discontinued because each AE). Most AEs began during the titration period. Paresthesia, any cognitive symptoms, nausea, and loss of appetite occurred at a higher rate in the topiramate group than in the placebo group (P < 0.01). AEs leading to discontinuation of topiramate are probably to occur during dose titration. If a patient has not experienced one of these AEs within the first 6 weeks of initiating topiramate 100 mg/day, these AEs are unlikely to occur.

### May lamotrigine be an alternative to topiramate in the prevention of migraine with aura? Results of a retrospective study [^9b7a4b69]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusion

Lamotrigine is equally effective as topiramate for the preventive treatment of migraine with aura and exhibits a better tolerability profile. Lamotrigine should be considered in clinical practice especially for patients reporting prolonged aura and who do not respond, have contraindications or discontinue topiramate treatment due to side effects.

Adult Patients

The results of 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trials conducted in the US (Study 11) or the US and Canada (Study 12) established the effectiveness of immediate-release topiramate in the preventive treatment of migraine. The design of both trials was identical, enrolling patients with a history of migraine, with or without aura, for at least 6 months, according to the International Headache Society (IHS) diagnostic criteria. Patients with a history of cluster headaches or basilar, ophthalmoplegic, hemiplegic, or transformed migraine headaches were excluded from the trials. Patients were required to have completed up to a 2-week washout of any prior migraine preventive medications before starting the baseline phase.

Patients who experienced 3 to 12 migraine headaches over the 4 weeks in the baseline phase were randomized to either topiramate 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, 200 mg/day (twice the recommended daily dosage for the preventive treatment of migraine), or placebo and treated for a total of 26 weeks (8-week titration period and 18-week maintenance period). Treatment was initiated at 25 mg/day for one week, and then the daily dosage was increased by 25 mg increments each week until reaching the assigned target dose or maximum tolerated dose (administered twice daily).

Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age

Safety and effectiveness of topiramate for the preventive treatment of migraine was studied in 5 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials in a total of 219 pediatric patients, at doses of 50 to 200 mg/day, or 2 to 3 mg/kg/day. These comprised a fixed dose study in 103 pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.3)], a flexible dose (2 to 3 mg/kg/day), placebo-controlled study in 157 pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age (including 67 pediatric patients 12 to 16 years of age), and a total of 49 pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age in 3 studies for the preventive treatment of migraine primarily in adults. Open-label extension phases of 3 studies enabled evaluation of long-term safety for up to 6 months after the end of the double-blind phase.

Efficacy of topiramate for the preventive treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age is demonstrated for a 100 mg daily dose in Study 13 [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Efficacy of topiramate (2 to 3 mg/kg/day) for the preventive treatment of migraine was not demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial of 157 pediatric patients (6 to 16 years of age) that included treatment of 67 pediatric patients (12 to 16 years of age) for 20 weeks.

### Topiramate (trokendi XR) [^4be96e51]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age

The effectiveness of immediate-release topiramate for the preventive treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was established in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial (Study 13). The study enrolled 103 patients (40 male, 63 female) 12 to 17 years of age with episodic migraine headaches with or without aura. Patient selection was based on IHS criteria for migraines (using proposed revisions to the 1988 IHS pediatric migraine criteria [IHS-R criteria]).

Patients who experienced 3 to 12 migraine attacks (according to migraines classified by patient reported diaries) and ≤ 14 headache days (migraine and non-migraine) during the 4-week prospective baseline period were randomized to either immediate-release topiramate 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, or placebo and treated for a total of 16 weeks (4-week titration period followed by a 12 week maintenance period). Treatment was initiated at 25 mg/day for one week, and then the daily dosage was increased by 25 mg increments each week until reaching the assigned target dose or maximum tolerated dose (administered twice daily). Approximately 80% or more patients in each treatment group completed the study. The median average daily dosages were 45 and 79 mg/day in the target dose groups of immediate-release topiramate 50 and 100 mg/day, respectively.

Effectiveness of treatment was assessed by comparing each immediate-release topiramate treatment group to placebo (ITT population) for the percent reduction from baseline to the last 12 weeks of the double-blind phase in the monthly migraine attack rate (primary endpoint). The percent reduction from baseline to the last 12 weeks of the double-blind phase in average monthly migraine attack rate is shown in Table 12. The 100 mg immediate-release topiramate dose produced a statistically significant treatment difference relative to placebo of 28% reduction from baseline in the monthly migraine attack rate.

The mean reduction from baseline to the last 12 weeks of the double-blind phase in average monthly attack rate, a key secondary efficacy endpoint in Study 13 (and the primary efficacy endpoint in Studies 11 and 12, of adults) was 3.0 for 100 mg immediate-release topiramate dose and 1.7 for placebo. This 1.3 treatment difference in mean reduction from baseline of monthly migraine rate was statistically significant (p = 0.0087).

2.2 Dosing in Adjunctive Therapy Epilepsy

Adults (17 Years of Age and Older)

The recommended total daily dose of topiramate tablets as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial onset seizures or Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome is 200 to 400 mg/day in two divided doses, and 400 mg/day in two divided doses as adjunctive treatment in adults with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Topiramate tablets should be initiated at 25 to 50 mg/day, followed by titration to an effective dose in increments of 25 to 50 mg/day every week. Titrating in increments of 25 mg/day every week may delay the time to reach an effective dose. Doses above 400 mg/day have not been shown to improve responses in adults with partial-onset seizures.

Pediatric Patients 2 to 16 Years of Age

The recommended total daily dose of topiramate tablets as adjunctive therapy for pediatric patients 2 to 16 years of age with partial-onset seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, or seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is approximately 5 to 9 mg/kg/day in two divided doses. Titration should begin at 25 mg/day (or less, based on a range of 1 to 3 mg/kg/day) nightly for the first week. The dosage should then be increased at 1- or 2-week intervals by increments of 1 to 3 mg/kg/day (administered in two divided doses), to achieve optimal clinical response. Dose titration should be guided by clinical outcome. The total daily dose should not exceed 400 mg/day.

2.3 Dosing for the Preventive Treatment of Migraine

The recommended total daily dose of topiramate tablets as treatment for patients 12 years of age and older for the preventive treatment of migraine is 100 mg/day administered in two divided doses (Table 3). The recommended titration rate for topiramate tablets for the preventive treatment of migraine is as follows:

Dose and titration rate should be guided by clinical outcome. If required, longer intervals between dose adjustments can be used.

2.4 Administration Information

Topiramate tablets can be taken without regard to meals.

### Topiramate for migraine prophylaxis in pediatric patients [^340fdc04]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the currently published data pertaining to the efficacy and safety of topiramate for prophylaxis of classic and common migraine in pediatric patients.

Data Sources

The literature was identified via PubMed (through April 2013) and Iowa Drug Information System (through April 2013). References from identified articles were also reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Data were included from studies of efficacy and safety in pediatric patients experiencing migraine (with or without aura), as defined by the International Headache Society. Studies including patients with more specific types of migraine, such as basilar migraine, were excluded.

Data Synthesis

Eight publicatons were identified, including 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), a subgroup analysis, and 4 observational studies. These studies reported a decrease in headache frequency ranging from 63% to 100% for doses of 100 mg/d and 65% for 200 mg/d. Response to therapy, defined as ≥ 50% reduction in migraine rate, was also reported in 83% to 95% of patients receiving topiramate. Topiramate is generally well tolerated. Adverse effects were dose related and included paresthesias, weight loss, and cognitive adverse effects.

Conclusion

Topiramate is an effective and well-tolerated prophylactic therapy for use in pediatric migraine patients. Doses of 100 and 200 mg/d (1.47–2.0 mg/kg/d) effectively decrease the frequency of migraine headaches, with 100 mg/d providing optimal benefit-to-risk ratio. Additional randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are needed to determine the impact of the drug on quality-of-life outcomes, such as school function, and migraine severity and duration.

### May lamotrigine be an alternative to topiramate in the prevention of migraine with aura? Results of a retrospective study [^c5105838]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Background

Evidence suggests that lamotrigine could be effective in reducing aura frequency and duration. However, studies comparing lamotrigine to other, first-line prophylactic agents solely involving patients suffering from migraine with aura are still lacking. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of lamotrigine and topiramate for the preventive treatment of migraine with aura.

Methods

Fifty-three patients suffering from migraine with aura treated with lamotrigine or topiramate for at least 6 months were included. Pre- and post-treatment clinical data regarding monthly aura frequency and duration, monthly migraine frequency, days of headache and rescue medication used per month were collected.

Results

Responder rates were similar between the two treatment groups at 6-month follow-up. Interestingly, responder rates for aura frequency and duration were higher in the lamotrigine group compared with the topiramate group (88% vs 79% and 73% vs 54%). Moreover, 50% of the lamotrigine-treated patients reported a complete disappearance of migraine aura compared with 37% of topiramate-treated patients. Side effects were more frequent in topiramate group compared with lamotrigine group (p = 0.004).

Conclusions

Lamotrigine should be considered in clinical practice for the preventive treatment of migraine with aura especially for patients reporting prolonged aura and who do not respond, have contraindications or discontinue topiramate treatment due to side effects.

### Antiepileptics in migraine prophylaxis: an updated cochrane review [^21dc9c65]. Cephalalgia (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The efficacy of several antiepileptics in the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults has been systematically reviewed. Because many trial reports have been published since then, an updated systematic review was warranted.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed/MEDLINE (1966 to January 15, 2013), MEDLINE In-Process (current week, January 15, 2013), and EMBASE (1974 to January 15, 2013) and hand-searched Headache and Cephalalgia through January 2013. Prospective, controlled trials of antiepileptics taken regularly to prevent the occurrence of migraine attacks, to improve migraine-related quality of life, or both, were selected.

Results

Mean headache frequency on topiramate and sodium valproate is significantly lower than placebo. Likewise, topiramate and divalproex demonstrated favorable results for the proportion of subjects with ≥ 50% reduction of migraine attacks. For topiramate, 100 mg and 200 mg outperformed 50 mg, but this was paralleled by a higher adverse event rate. For valproate/divalproex, a dose-effect correlation could not be established. There was no unequivocal evidence of efficacy for any of the other antiepileptics.

Conclusion

Topiramate, sodium valproate and divalproex are effective prophylactic treatments for episodic migraine in adults. In contrast to previous reports, there is insufficient evidence to further support the use of gabapentin.

### Evidence-based guideline update: pharmacologic treatment for episodic migraine prevention in adults: report of the quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society [^425db46a]. Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide updated evidence-based recommendations for the preventive treatment of migraine headache. The clinical question addressed was: What pharmacologic therapies are proven effective for migraine prevention?

Methods

The authors analyzed published studies from June 1999 to May 2009 using a structured review process to classify the evidence relative to the efficacy of various medications available in the United States for migraine prevention.

Results and Recommendations

The author panel reviewed 284 abstracts, which ultimately yielded 29 Class I or Class II articles that are reviewed herein. Divalproex sodium, sodium valproate, topiramate, metoprolol, propranolol, and timolol are effective for migraine prevention and should be offered to patients with migraine to reduce migraine attack frequency and severity (Level A). Frovatriptan is effective for prevention of menstrual migraine (Level A). Lamotrigine is ineffective for migraine prevention (Level A).

### Practice guideline update summary: pharmacologic treatment for pediatric migraine prevention: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology and the American Headache Society [^09fff5af]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Antiepileptic drug — topiramate for pediatric migraine prevention: Children and adolescents with migraine receiving topiramate are probably more likely than those receiving placebo to have a decrease in the frequency of migraine or headache days (moderate confidence in the evidence, 4 Class I studies), with a random effect model SMD 0.391; 95% CI 0.127–0.655 and confidence downgraded due to imprecision. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether children receiving topiramate are more or less likely than placebo to have at least a 50% reduction in headache frequency (RR 1.330 [95% CI 0.933–1.894]; confidence downgraded due to imprecision). Children with migraine receiving topiramate are possibly more likely than placebo to have a decrease in migraine-related disability (SMD 0.538 [95% CI −0.097 to 1.174]; confidence downgraded due to imprecision).

### Erenumab versus topiramate for the prevention of migraine-a randomised, double-blind, active-controlled phase 4 trial [^2cc82fa9]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Between 22 February 2019 (first patient first visit), and 29 July 2020 (last patient last visit), 949 patients were screened for eligibility and 777 patients were randomised: 389 to the erenumab group and 388 to the topiramate group (Figure 1). One patient did not receive study medication and was excluded from the analysis, which led to identical FAS and SAF data sets; 739 (95.1%) patients completed the study until week 24. Among those, the mean eDiary compliance during the DBTP was 98.5% (SD 4.93).

Figure 1.
Study profile.

Demographic and disease characteristics were well balanced between the groups (Table 1). At baseline, 64.7% of the total study population had 8–14 MMD. The mean number of MMD was 10.4 (3.9) days. 59.4% had never received prior preventive migraine medication.

Table 1.
Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics.

In the erenumab group, 285 (73.5%) patients started with the 70 mg dose and for 165 (42.5%) patients, the dose was increased to 140 mg during the 24-week DBTP. A starting dose of 140 mg was chosen for 103 patients (26.5%). During months 4–6, 346 out of 388 patients (89.2%) were on active study medication.

In the topiramate group, all patients started with a dose of 25 mg/day. Detailed dose distribution during the 6-week up-titration phase is provided in Table S1 (appendix p. 6). At the end of week 6, 275 (70.9%) patients were still on medication. Among those, 207 (75.3%) achieved a daily dose of 100 mg topiramate, 49 (17.8%) received 75 mg and 19 (6.9%) received 50 mg daily, resulting in a mean topiramate dose of 92.1 mg/day. During months 4–6, 246 out of 388 patients (63.4%) were on active study medication.

### Topiramate (Qudexy) [^9b1bdc78]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age

Safety and effectiveness of topiramate for the preventive treatment of migraine was studied in 5 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials in a total of 219 pediatric patients, at doses of 50 to 200 mg/day, or 2 to 3 mg/kg/day. These comprised a fixed dose study in 103 pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.5)], a flexible dose (2 to 3 mg/kg/day), placebo-controlled study in 157 pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age (including 67 pediatric patients 12 to 16 years of age), and a total of 49 pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age in 3 studies for the preventive treatment of migraine primarily in adults. Open-label extension phases of 3 studies enabled evaluation of long-term safety for up to 6 months after the end of the double-blind phase.

Efficacy of topiramate for the preventive treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age is demonstrated for a 100 mg daily dose in Study 13 [see Clinical Studies (14.5)]. Efficacy of topiramate (2 to 3 mg/kg/day) for the preventive treatment of migraine was not demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial of 157 pediatric patients (6 to 16 years of age) that included treatment of 67 pediatric patients (12 to 16 years of age) for 20 weeks.

Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Counseling for patients of childbearing potential — risk counseling notes that topiramate and valproate have well-demonstrated teratogenic effects, especially when used in polytherapy, and valproate use during pregnancy is also associated with developmental disorders in offspring; an FDA black box warning regarding fetal risk from valproate use exists as of the time of this guideline. It further states that topiramate at a daily dose of 200 mg or less does not interact with oral combined hormonal contraceptives; however, at higher doses it can have drug interactions that decrease their effectiveness, and that the risk of major congenital malformation in offspring of women with epilepsy taking antiepileptics is possibly decreased by folic acid supplementation. Clinically, clinicians must consider the teratogenic effect of topiramate and valproate in their choice of migraine prevention therapy recommendations to patients of childbearing potential (Level A).

### Topiramate for migraine prophylaxis [^caf137fe]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2006). Low credibility.

About 14% of adults in the UK have migraines. Drugs used in migraine prophylaxis include beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol), 5HT antagonists (e.g. pizotifen), antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline), antiepileptics (e.g. sodium valproate) and NSAIDs. The antiepileptic topiramate (Topamax-Janssen-Cilag) is licensed for the prophylaxis of migraine headache in patients aged over 16 years. Here we discuss the place of topiramate in migraine prophylaxis.

### Erenumab versus topiramate for the prevention of migraine-a randomised, double-blind, active-controlled phase 4 trial [^2f653066]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

A limitation of this study is the lack of a placebo group to judge nocebo and placebo effects. However, both erenumab and topiramate have been thoroughly tested and shown to be superior in efficacy against placebo. Since there were no questions open regarding the pharmacological effect of both drugs, we also decided against a third placebo group for ethical reasons.

Another potential weakness is partial unblinding due to typical side effects of topiramate. All patients were aware of the potential side effects of both study drugs in line with the GCP requirements for patient information before participation in a clinical trial. Patients who expected to experience side effects of topiramate might have been more prone to discontinue medication. To minimise this potential source of bias, the study was rigorously blinded in accordance with the recent guidelines for migraine trials and employed an elaborate double-dummy design. Patients were not provided with a checklist to report AEs but rather reported them freely to site personnel at visits. We do not believe that unblinding is a major issue in HER-MES since the discontinuation rate was higher than in placebo-controlled trials for both study drugs. Additionally, AEs were in general more frequently reported for erenumab compared to placebo-controlled trials and included typical side effects of topiramate (e.g. paraesthesia). Since side effects typical for topiramate have not been reported as common for erenumab, either in placebo-controlled trials or in current public AE databases, this most likely indicates a nocebo effect as discussed above.

In HER-MES, patients could not reduce the dose of topiramate during the DBTP, although dose reduction of topiramate occurs in clinical practice. Down-titration was not permitted in order to comply with the treatment schemes specified in the current European and US summaries of product characteristics for topiramate. Consequently, the discontinuation rate might be higher than in the real-world situation. However, we implemented measures to reflect the clinical situation as closely as possible, and to avoid enforcing a high AE-related discontinuation rate under topiramate by enabling topiramate up-titration without strict weekly dose increments.

### Erenumab versus topiramate for the prevention of migraine-a randomised, double-blind, active-controlled phase 4 trial [^dce69cc2]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Whereas previous studies in migraine preventive treatment do not take into account the impact of tolerability, the unique design of HER-MES for the first time conveys the real-world situation in a randomised-controlled design. Namely, efficacy endpoints were analysed in composite populations with patients on therapy and patients who had stopped medication but continued daily reporting. During the last 3 months of the DBTP, more patients were on erenumab therapy than on topiramate, which contributes to the better outcome. This underlines the importance of a good tolerability profile in achieving best possible results in migraine prevention.

Efficacy data obtained for erenumab was in line with the STRIVE trial. For topiramate, the 50% responder rates in HER-MES appear lower than in placebo-controlled trials (37% vs. 46.3%). However, previous topiramate studies have used headache frequency instead of migraine days to calculate 50% responder rates, which limits comparison. Furthermore, the mean topiramate dose in the total group (composite population) was lower than in previous studies.

HER-MES includes a broad migraine population with 2/3 of the patients in the high-frequency migraine spectrum. Despite a mean disease duration of about 20 years, almost 60% of the patients had not received previous prophylactic treatment, which underlines the long-standing problem of undertreatment in migraine and may reflect the German healthcare situation. Many patients are reluctant to initiate a prophylactic therapy due to the poor tolerability of non-specific oral migraine preventive drugs. For the typical migraine patient, who is female and young to middle-aged, the cognitive and psychological side effects of topiramate can be especially disturbing in terms of occupational activities. This study demonstrates that compared to topiramate, erenumab substantially increases treatment acceptance. In combination with its good efficacy profile, it addresses the unmet need for a targeted and efficient treatment option that is well-tolerated in patients with episodic and chronic migraine.

### Prevalence of headache days and disability 3 years after participation in the childhood and adolescent migraine prevention medication trial [^6457c999]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How do children and adolescents with migraine function after participating in a multicenter migraine prevention medication trial?

Findings

This survey study that followed up 205 participants from the Childhood and Adolescent Migraine Prevention study at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months found that regardless of treatment group (amitriptyline, topiramate, placebo), youth consistently maintained meaningful reductions of headache days and migraine-related disability for 3 years after completion of the trial. Less than 10% of the participants reported ongoing use of prevention medication prescribed as part of typical clinical care, with most participants reporting no medication use at most time points.

Meaning

These findings suggest that children and adolescents may get better and sustain positive outcomes over time without ongoing pharmacotherapy.

### Topiramate (eprontia) [^006a711a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Effectiveness of treatment was assessed by comparing each topiramate treatment group to placebo (ITT population) for the percent reduction from baseline to the last 12 weeks of the double-blind phase in the monthly migraine attack rate (primary endpoint). The percent reduction from baseline to the last 12 weeks of the double-blind phase in average monthly migraine attack rate is shown in Table 14.

The 100 mg topiramate dose produced a statistically significant treatment difference relative to placebo of 28% reduction from baseline in the monthly migraine attack rate.

The mean reduction from baseline to the last 12 weeks of the double-blind phase in average monthly attack rate, a key secondary efficacy endpoint in Study 13 (and the primary efficacy endpoint in Studies 11 and 12, of adults) was 3.0 for 100 mg topiramate dose and 1.7 for placebo. This 1.3 treatment difference in mean reduction from baseline of monthly migraine rate was statistically significant (p = 0.0087).

### TOP-PRO study: a randomized double-blind controlled trial of topiramate versus propranolol for prevention of chronic migraine [^8ecc2ca0]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the TOP-PRO-study, a double-blind randomized controlled trial, was to assess the efficacy (non-inferiority) and tolerability of propranolol compared to topiramate for the prevention of chronic migraine.

Background

Except for topiramate, oral preventive treatment for chronic migraine lacks credible evidence.

Methods

Chronic migraine patients aged above 18 years and less than 65 years of age, not on any preventive treatment were randomly allocated to receive topiramate (100mg/day) or propranolol (160mg/day). The primary efficacy outcome was the mean change in migraine days per 28 days at the end of 24 weeks from baseline. A mean difference of 1.5 days per four weeks was chosen as the cut-off delta value. Multiple secondary efficacy outcomes and treatment emergent adverse events were also assessed.

Results

As against the planned sample size of 244, only 175 patients could be enrolled before the spread of the corona virus disease-2019 pandemic and enforcement of lockdown in India. Of the 175 randomized patients, 95 (topiramate 46 and propranolol 49) completed the trial. The mean change in migraine days was -5.3 ± 1.2 vs -7.3 ± 1.1 days (p = 0.226) for topiramate and propranolol groups respectively. Propranolol was found to be non-inferior and not superior to topiramate (point estimate of -1.99 with a 95% confidence interval of -5.23 to 1.25 days). Multiple secondary outcomes also did not differ between the two groups. Intention to treat analysis of 175 patients and per-protocol analysis of 95 patients yielded concordant results. There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events between the two groups.

Conclusion

Propranolol (160mg/day) was non-inferior, non-superior to topiramate (100mg/day) for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine and had a comparable tolerability profile. Trial Registration: Clinical Trials Registry-India CTRI/2019/05/018997).

### May lamotrigine be an alternative to topiramate in the prevention of migraine with aura? Results of a retrospective study [^727dd7dc]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Our study is the first to compare the efficacy of lamotrigine and topiramate in solely patients suffering from migraine with aura. Both treatments showed to equally reduce monthly frequency of migraine attacks at 6 months of follow-up. Consequently, our results suggest a similar efficacy of both treatments within the clinical setting of migraine with aura. Interestingly, the majority of lamotrigine-treated patients included in our study had been previously treated with at least another migraine prophylactic agent, suggesting that the therapeutic effect of lamotrigine was certainly not obtained in a population of less resistant patients. Additionally, despite a well-established tolerability profile, discontinuation rates due to adverse events associated with topiramate are higher in patients with migraine compared with patients with epilepsy. Although the small number of patients included in our study, our tolerability data showed a significantly higher rate of adverse events within topiramate group compared with lamotrigine-treated patients.

Preventive Treatment of Migraine in Pediatric Patients 12 to 17 Years of Age

Safety and effectiveness of topiramate for the preventive treatment of migraine was studied in 5 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials in a total of 219 pediatric patients, at doses of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day, or 2 to 3 mg/kg/day. These comprised a fixed dose study in 103 pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14.4)], a flexible dose (2 to 3 mg/kg/day), placebo-controlled study in 157 pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age (including 67 pediatric patients 12 to 16 years of age), and a total of 49 pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age in 3 studies for the preventive treatment of migraine primarily in adults. Open-label extension phases of 3 studies enabled evaluation of long-term safety for up to 6 months after the end of the double-blind phase.

Efficacy of topiramate for the preventive treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age is demonstrated for a 100 mg daily dose in Study 3 [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. Efficacy of topiramate (2 to 3 mg/kg/day) for the preventive treatment of migraine was not demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial of 157 pediatric patients (6 to 16 years of age) that included treatment of 67 pediatric patients 12 to 16 years of age) for 20 weeks.

### Migraine: preventive treatment [^0286893d]. Cephalalgia (2002). Low credibility.

Migraine is a common episodic headache disorder. A comprehensive headache treatment plan includes acute attack treatment to relieve pain and impairment and long-term preventive therapy to reduce attack frequency, severity, and duration. Circumstances that might warrant preventive treatment include: (i) migraine that significantly interferes with the patient's daily routine despite acute treatment; (ii) failure, contraindication to, or troublesome side-effects from acute medications; (iii) overuse of acute medications; (iv) special circumstances, such as hemiplegic migraine; (v) very frequent headaches (more than two a week); or (vi) patient preference. Start the drug at a low dose. Give each treatment an adequate trial. Avoid interfering, overused, and contraindicated drugs. Re-evaluate therapy. Be sure that a woman of childbearing potential is aware of any potential risks. Involve patients in their care to maximize compliance. Consider co-morbidity. Choose a drug based on its proven efficacy, the patient's preferences and headache profile, the drug's side-effects, and the presence or absence of coexisting or co-morbid disease. Drugs that have documented high efficacy and mild to moderate adverse events (AEs) include beta-blockers, amitriptyline, and divalproex. Drugs that have lower documented efficacy and mild to moderate AEs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), calcium channel antagonists, gabapentin, topiramate, riboflavin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

### Headache management: pharmacological approaches [^e9029251]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The effective management of headache disorders remains a moving field and a potential challenge to the neurologist. The frequency of headache and its burden of disability make it essential for neurologists to manage headache in an informed way. Therapeutic decisions are hampered by minimal evidence to support the use of many therapies and hence we a need large, robust clinical trials. However, emerging therapies specifically targeting headache pain pathways are likely to improve significantly the management options and advance the field.

A practical approach is important — using existing evidence and guidelines — to enable effective headache management. It is an area where the clinician can have a huge and very rewarding impact upon patient care.

Key points

Headache is a common cause of disability; an accurate diagnosis is essential, though is often delayed or missed.
Medication-overuse headache frequently coexists and should be actively sought and discussed with patients with headache.
National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends acute migraine abortive treatment with a triptan together with paracetamol (or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) plus an antiemetic; lack of efficacy with one triptan does not mean that others will not work.
NICE guidelines for migraine prophylaxis suggest using topiramate or a beta blocker; comorbidities or lack of efficacy often means that other agents are also prescribed.
Start migraine prophylactic agents at low dose, build the dose up progressively and maintain a therapeutic dose for 3 months before judging its efficacy.

### Topiramate: a case series study in migraine prophylaxis [^ec5330a8]. Cephalalgia (2002). Low credibility.

We reviewed the electronic records of 74 migraine patients treated with topiramate for more than 6 weeks. Twenty-four patients had episodic migraine and 50 had chronic (transformed) migraine. Most (81%) started treatment at 25 mg per day and reached a dose of 100 mg twice a day (mean dose on the last follow-up visit was 208 mg). The mean headache frequency decreased from 20.6 days to 13.6 days per month (P < 0.0001) for all headaches (9.9–5.1 (P < 0.0001) and 25.7–17.7 (P < 0.001) for episodic migraine and chronic migraine, respectively). The percentage of patients whose headache frequency was reduced by ≥ 50% was 44.6% for all patients; 58.3 for episodic migraine and 38.0 for chronic migraine. For all patients mean headache severity (10-point scale) was reduced from 6.2 to 4.8 (P < 0.0001). Patients on monotherapy (20%) and polytherapy (80%) had similar reductions in headache frequency. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate and were seen in 58.1% (paresthesias in 25%, cognitive difficulties 14.9%). Mean weight loss was 3.1 ± 4 kg (3.8% of total body weight).

### Topiramate (Topamax) [^7019dfff]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In Study 12, a total of 468 patients (406 females, 62 males), ranging in age from 12 to 65 years, were randomized and provided efficacy data. Two hundred fifty-five patients completed the entire 26-week double-blind phase. The median average daily dosages were 47 mg/day, 86 mg/day, and 150 mg/day in the target dose groups of TOPAMAX 50, 100, and 200 mg/day, respectively.

The mean migraine headache frequency rate at baseline was approximately 5.5 migraine headaches/28 days and was similar across treatment groups. The change in the mean 4-week migraine headache period frequency from baseline to the double-blind phase was -1.4, -2.1, and -2.4 in the TOPAMAX 50, 100, and 200 mg/day groups, respectively, versus -1.1 in the placebo group (see Figure 2). The differences between the TOPAMAX 100 and 200 mg/day groups versus placebo were similar and statistically significant (p = 0.008 and p < 0.001, respectively).

In both studies, there were no apparent differences in treatment effect within age or gender subgroups. Because most patients were Caucasian, there were insufficient numbers of patients from different races to make a meaningful comparison of race.

For patients withdrawing from TOPAMAX, daily dosages were decreased in weekly intervals by 25 to 50 mg/day.

### Topiramate intervention to prevent transformation of episodic migraine: the topiramate INTREPID study [^449804fa]. Cephalalgia (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The study sought to evaluate whether topiramate prevents development of chronic daily headache (CDH, ≥ 15 headache days per month) in adult subjects with high-frequency episodic migraine (HFEM, 9–14 migraine headache days/month). A secondary objective was to assess the efficacy of topiramate as preventive migraine treatment in this population.

Methods

This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing topiramate 100mg/day and placebo for 26 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was new-onset CDH at month 6. Secondary efficacy measures included migraine and headache days. Adverse events (AEs) were evaluated.

Results

A total of 159 topiramate subjects and 171 placebo subjects were efficacy-evaluable. At month 6, 1.4% of topiramate subjects versus 2.3% of placebo subjects had CDH (p = .589). Compared with placebo, topiramate treatment was associated with statistically significant reductions in mean number of migraine days (6.6 vs. 5.3/28 days; p = .001) and headache days (6.6 vs 5.3/28 days; p = .001). Most commonly reported AEs in the topiramate versus placebo group included paresthesia (32.4% vs. 7.0%), fatigue (14.8% vs. 8.6%), dizziness (11.4% vs. 7.6%) and nausea (10.8% vs. 9.2%).

Conclusion

Topiramate 100mg/day did not prevent the development of CDH at six months in subjects with HFEM. Topiramate was effective in reducing headache days and migraine headache days and generally well tolerated.

### Topiramate for the prophylaxis of episodic migraine in adults… [^6ffc043f]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Is topiramate an effective prophylactic medication for adults with episodic migraine. Evidence-Based Answer Topiramate in a dosage of 100 mg per day is effective for decreasing the frequency of headaches in adults with episodic migraine. Topiramate is an antiepileptic drug used as preventive therapy for migraines. 2 This meta-analysis studied whether topiramate was effective in reducing the occurrence of migraines and/or improving migraine-related quality of life in patients with episodic migraine. Seventeen prospective, controlled trials of topiramate were included in this analysis. Nine of these studies compared topiramate with placebo and found that it reduced headache frequency by 1. 2 attacks per 28 days.

Patients taking topiramate daily were more likely to report a 50% or more reduction in headache frequency compared with patients taking placebo. The number needed to treat for a 50% reduction in migraine headaches with topiramate vs. placebo was 4. Topiramate in dosages of 50 to 200 mg daily improves outcomes compared with placebo. A meta-analysis of three studies showed that the 100-mg dose was more effective at reducing headache frequency than the 50-mg dose, and equivalent to the 200-mg dose. In trials that compared topiramate with placebo, seven adverse effects were reported by at least three studies: anorexia, fatigue, memory problems, nausea, paresthesia, taste disturbance, and weight loss. All adverse effects except nausea were significantly more common in persons taking 100 mg of topiramate daily vs. placebo.

Topiramate is known to cause birth defects if taken during pregnancy, and should be used with caution in women of childbearing age. 2 In conclusion, topiramate in a dosage of 100 mg daily is a reasonable choice for migraine prophylaxis in patients with episodic migraine.

### May lamotrigine be an alternative to topiramate in the prevention of migraine with aura? Results of a retrospective study [^02b1cc2b]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Lamotrigine is an antiepileptic, sodium channel blocking drug able to induce an indirect inhibition of neuronal glutamate release thus blocking CSD propagation throughout the cerebral cortex as shown by experimental model of CSD. The role of lamotrigine for the preventive treatment of migraine has been previously investigated. A double-blind, randomised, controlled, crossover study involving suffering from migraine with and without aura, concluded that lamotrigine was ineffective in reducing migraine frequency and intensity compared with topiramate, another antiepileptic drug approved as first-line agent for migraine prophylaxis, although efficacy outcomes of patients solely affected by migraine with aura were not reported at the end of the abovementioned study. On the other hand, evidence suggests that lamotrigine could be effective within the migraine aura clinical setting. To our best knowledge, studies comparing lamotrigine to others, first-line prophylactic migraine agents involving a population of patients solely suffering from migraine with aura are still lacking. For this reason, we conducted a retrospective analysis in order to assess the efficacy of lamotrigine compared with topiramate for the preventive treatment of migraine with aura.

2.2 Dosing in Adjunctive Therapy Epilepsy

Adults (17 Years of Age and Older)

The recommended total daily dose of QUDEXY XR as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial-onset seizures or Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome is 200 mg to 400 mg orally once daily, and with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures is 400 mg orally once daily. Initiate therapy at 25 mg to 50 mg once daily followed by titration to an effective dose in increments of 25 mg to 50 mg every week. Titrating in increments of 25 mg/day every week may delay the time to reach an effective dose. Doses above 400 mg/day have not been shown to improve responses in adults with partial-onset seizures.

The recommended total daily dose of QUDEXY XR as adjunctive therapy for pediatric patients 2 to 16 years of age with partial-onset seizures, primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, or seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is approximately 5 mg/kg to 9 mg/kg orally once daily. Begin titration at 25 mg once daily (or less, based on a range of 1 mg/kg/day to 3 mg/kg/day) given nightly for the first week. Subsequently, increase the dosage at 1- or 2-week intervals by increments of 1 mg/kg/day to 3 mg/kg/day to achieve optimal clinical response. Dose titration should be guided by clinical outcome. The total daily dose should not exceed 400 mg/day.

2.3 Dosing for the Preventive Treatment of Migraine

The recommended total daily dose of QUDEXY XR as treatment for the preventive treatment of migraine in patients 12 years of age and older is 100 mg once daily. The recommended titration rate for QUDEXY XR for the preventive treatment of migraine is as follows:

Dose and titration rate should be guided by clinical outcome. If required, longer intervals between dose adjustment can be used.

2.4 Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment

In patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 70 mL/min/1.73 m2), one-half of the usual adult dose of QUDEXY XR is recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Randomised clinical trial comparing melatonin 3 mg, amitriptyline 25 mg and placebo for migraine prevention [^ef808468]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Migraine is a chronic debilitating neurological condition affecting 12–20% of the population worldwide. Preventive treatments are available, decreasing the number and severity of headache attacks, and improving health outcomes and quality of life; half of the patients show 50% reduction in attack frequency. Although migraine prophylaxis guidelines from North American, South American and European societies are available, only 3–5% of patients receive adequate preventive therapy.

Public surveys report that migraineurs are among the most dissatisfied patients. About half of the patients with migraine stop seeking care for their headaches, partly because of their side effect profile. Most guidelines recommend topiramate, divalproex/sodium valproate, propranolol and metoprolol as having the highest level of evidence. Newer effective and tolerable options for migraine prophylaxis are necessary to reduce this gap and improve patients' quality of life.

Melatonin use in migraine prevention is supported by several biological effects. Melatonin levels are decreased in patients with migraine; it has been studied for migraine prophylaxis with conflicting results. We aimed to study the effect of melatonin in a double-blind, placebo controlled trial with an active comparator.

### New players in the preventive treatment of migraine [^9ed8f0fd]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The main goals of migraine preventive treatment include: reducing headache frequency, severity and intensity; restoring function; and preventing progression to chronic migraine. There is evidence that valproate, topiramate, metoprolol, propranolol, timolol and flunarizine are effective for episodic migraine prevention and should be offered to appropriate migraineurs to reduce migraine attack frequency and severity (level A medications). Frovatriptan (primarily indicated and usually used for acute care of migraine) is effective for prevention of menstrual migraine (level A), while lamotrigine is ineffective for migraine prevention and should not be used (level A). Although commonly used in clinical practice, amitriptyline does not carry adequate evidence for migraine prevention (only class II studies). For prevention of chronic migraine (with and without medication overuse) only one treatment is approved in the US by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and that is onabotulinumtoxinA. Topiramate studies do show efficacy but there is no approval for this condition. Additionally, a variety of behavioral medicine treatments, such as biofeedback training and cognitive restructuring, are available for these patients.

### Erenumab versus topiramate for the prevention of migraine-a randomised, double-blind, active-controlled phase 4 trial [^bd4779af]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In migraine prophylaxis, tolerability is a major contributing factor to therapeutic success. Still, a recently published study shows that 28.2% of US migraine patients discontinue treatment within 6 months, mostly due to side effects.

Since evidence of comparative efficacy is limited, the therapeutic decisions are usually based on medication side effect profiles, patient characteristics and comorbidities. One of the most commonly used first-line therapy options in international guidelines is topiramate. Several placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of topiramate in migraine prevention, and it is considered to have the highest level of evidence to support its use as a migraine preventive treatment. A placebo-controlled study that included propranolol as an active control showed that topiramate at 100 mg/day is similarly effective to propranolol at 160 mg/day.

With erenumab, an antibody targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor, a new treatment option for migraine prophylaxis was introduced in 2018, subsequently followed by other compounds targeting the CGRP protein. According to current guidelines and local reimbursement status, antibodies targeting the CGRP pathway are mainly considered an option for severely afflicted migraine patients who have failed or have not been suitable for at least two previous prophylactic treatments. So far, no study has been done in order to compare the efficacy of a monoclonal antibody targeting the CGRP pathway to that of a standard of care oral preventive drug.

HER-MES (Head-to-head study of erenumab against topiramate – Migraine study to assess tolerability and efficacy in a patient-centred setting) aimed to directly compare the tolerability and efficacy of the CGRP receptor antibody erenumab to topiramate. We report here the results of the 24-week double-blind, double-dummy trial, which included adult patients with at least 4 migraine days per month.

### Migraine prevention [^5fc2a28c]. Practical Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Preventive medications reduce migraine frequency and severity, and improve migraine-specific quality of life. Recent evidence also suggests that these same medications enhance the patient's response to acute migraine therapies, and may also reduce the likelihood of developing chronic daily headache. However, many patients who should receive or be offered preventive treatment are not. Most patients can be successfully managed when patient and physician expectations are realistic and aligned, the selection of preventive medications is individualised, and the initiation and titration strategy is appropriate and carefully followed. Rational combinations of preventive medications may also be useful. This review provides an evidence and experience-based approach to the preventive treatment of migraine.

### 2023 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline for the management of headache [^57c9d8d1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for Management of Headache — topiramate for prevention of episodic and chronic migraine — We suggest topiramate for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine (Weak for). Evidence from systematic reviews showed statistically significant improvements in monthly migraine days, including -1.11 in episodic migraine (n = 1,903) with a number needed to treat (NNT) of seven (50% responder rate) and number needed to harm (NNH) of 12, and -2.30 in chronic migraine compared with placebo; studies compared various doses (50–200 mg per day across studies), examined the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQL) and ≥ 50% responder rate, and had a mean duration of 19 weeks, with topiramate significantly reducing the frequency of headaches and improving the ≥ 50% responder rate. Compared with placebo, topiramate has greater odds of adverse events (AEs), including nausea, dizziness, and somnolence (OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.06–1.73) and withdrawal because of AEs (OR: 2.08; 95% CI: 1.56, 2.78); providers are encouraged to titrate slowly when starting a patient on topiramate to reduce the risk of side effects, including cognitive side effects. Comorbidity considerations are noted: topiramate might be effective for patients with concurrent obesity, epilepsy, or alcohol use disorder, but might be less appropriate for patients with renal calculi, low weight, eating disorders, and baseline cognitive difficulties; topiramate also has a risk of causing metabolic acidosis.

### Topiramate (Topamax) [^98ccdc3b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adults

In the four multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group migraine clinical trials for the preventive treatment of migraine (which included 35 pediatric patients 12 to 15 years of age), most adverse reactions occurred more frequently during the titration period than during the maintenance period.

The most common adverse reactions with TOPAMAX 100 mg in the clinical trials for the preventive treatment of migraine of predominantly adults that were seen at an incidence higher (≥ 5%) than in the placebo group were: paresthesia, anorexia, weight loss, taste perversion, diarrhea, difficulty with memory, hypoesthesia, and nausea (see Table 8).

Table 8 includes those adverse reactions that occurred in the placebo-controlled trials where the incidence in any TOPAMAX treatment group was at least 3% and was greater than that for placebo patients. The incidence of some adverse reactions (e.g., fatigue, dizziness, somnolence, difficulty with memory, difficulty with concentration/attention) was dose-related and greater at higher than recommended TOPAMAX dosing (200 mg daily) compared to the incidence of these adverse reactions at the recommended dosing (100 mg daily).

Of the 1,135 patients exposed to TOPAMAX in the adult placebo-controlled studies, 25% of TOPAMAX-treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions, compared to 10% of the 445 placebo-treated patients. The adverse reactions associated with discontinuing therapy in the TOPAMAX-treated patients included paresthesia (7%), fatigue (4%), nausea (4%), difficulty with concentration/attention (3%), insomnia (3%), anorexia (2%), and dizziness (2%).

Patients treated with TOPAMAX experienced mean percent reductions in body weight that were dose-dependent. This change was not seen in the placebo group. Mean changes of 0%, -2%, -3%, and -4% were seen for the placebo group, TOPAMAX 50, 100, and 200 mg groups, respectively.

### Topiramate spinkle (Topiramate) [^b6ebe1c5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Efficacy of topiramate for the preventive treatment of migraine in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age is demonstrated for a 100 mg daily dose in Study 13 [see Clinical Studies (14.3)]. Efficacy of topiramate (2 to 3 mg/kg/day) for the preventive treatment of migraine was not demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial of 157 pediatric patients (6 to 16 years of age) that included treatment of 67 pediatric patients (12 to 16 years of age) for 20 weeks.

In the pediatric trials (12 to 17 years of age) in which patients were randomized to placebo or a fixed daily dose of topiramate, the most common adverse reactions with topiramate that were seen at an incidence higher (≥ 5%) than in the placebo group were: paresthesia, upper respiratory tract infection, anorexia, and abdominal pain [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

The most common cognitive adverse reaction in pooled double-blind studies in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age was difficulty with concentration/attention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].

Markedly abnormally low serum bicarbonate values indicative of metabolic acidosis were reported in topiramate-treated pediatric migraine patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Topiramate in the treatment of chronic migraine [^e5fae399]. Cephalalgia (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of topiramate in the treatment of chronic migraine. This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, parallel-group study. Patients suffering from chronic migraine with analgesic overuse were randomly assigned in a 1: 1 ratio to receive topiramate or placebo. Following a baseline phase of eight weeks, the study drug was titrated in 25-mg increments over one week to 50 mg daily. Titration phase was followed by a 8-week maintenance phase. Number of days with headache during a 28-day period was the efficacy variable. At baseline, there was no difference in the number of days with headache between patients treated with topiramate and those treated with placebo (mean ± SD: 20.9 ± 3.2 and 20.8 ± 3.2, respectively). During the last 4 week-maintenance phase, topiramate-treated patients experienced a significantly lower 28-day headache frequency in comparison to those treated with placebo (mean number of days with headache ± SD: 8.1 ± 8.1 vs. 20.6 ± 3.4, P < 0.0007). Topiramate at low doses proved to be an effective therapeutic approach to reduce headache frequency in patients with chronic migraine and analgesic overuse.

### Prevention of episodic migraine headache using pharmacologic treatments in outpatient settings: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^f87bac76]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Episodic migraine prevention — comparative effects favor certain options over topiramate and valproate: β-Blockers may reduce discontinuations due to adverse events compared with topiramate (157 fewer events per 1000 treated people). Compared with topiramate, CGRP monoclonal antibodies (CGRP-mAbs) may reduce migraine frequency (0.80 fewer days per month) and acute medication intake (1.02 fewer days per month) and probably reduce discontinuations due to adverse events (162 fewer events per 1000 treated people). CGRP-mAbs may also reduce migraine frequency (0.76 fewer days per month) compared with valproate, and the SNRI venlafaxine may reduce migraine duration (6.11 fewer hours per migraine headache) compared with amitriptyline.

### Topiramate in the prophylactic treatment of migraine in children [^d9a83e71]. Journal of Child Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

We present a prospective case series of 24 children diagnosed with migraine refractory to prophylactics and treated for 4 months with topiramate as the only prophylactic drug. At the final visit, the mean topiramate dose was 3.5 ± 1.7 mg/kg/day. Nearly all patients (87.5%) reported a shorter duration of attacks, and the average pain intensity was rated as mild by 14 patients (58.3%). Eight (33.3%) patients had adverse events, none of which were serious. In our sample of pediatric patients, topiramate was effective for the prophylactic treatment of migraine in children. It was well tolerated at the doses used for titration and maintenance. Controlled trials are needed to verify the efficacy of topiramate for migraine in children.

### Exercise as migraine prophylaxis: a randomized study using relaxation and topiramate as controls [^27f154fd]. Cephalalgia (2011). Low credibility.

Aim: Scientific evidence regarding exercise in migraine prophylaxis is required. Therefore this study aimed to evaluate the effects of exercise in migraine prevention.

Methods: In a randomized, controlled trial of adults with migraine, exercising for 40 minutes three times a week was compared to relaxation according to a recorded programme or daily topiramate use, which was slowly increased to the individual's highest tolerable dose (maximum 200 mg/day). The treatment period lasted for 3 months, and migraine status, quality of life, level of physical activity, and oxygen uptake were evaluated. The primary efficacy variable was the mean reduction of the frequency of migraine attacks during the final month of treatment compared with the baseline.

Results: Ninety-one patients were randomized and included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The primary efficacy variable showed a mean reduction of 0.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31–1.54) attacks in the exercise group, 0.83 (95% CI 0.22–1.45) attacks in the relaxation group, and 0.97 (95% CI 0.36–1.58) attacks in the topiramate group. No significant difference was observed between the groups (p = 0.95).

Conclusion: Exercise may be an option for the prophylactic treatment of migraine in patients who do not benefit from or do not want to take daily medication.

### Topiramate in the prophylaxis of pediatric migraine: a double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^e77eabfa]. Journal of Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Several large, randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of topiramate in migraine prophylaxis in adults. However, there are limited data about the use of topiramate in migraine prophylaxis in children. We conducted this single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topiramate in the prophylaxis of migraine in children. A total of 44 children with migraine were randomized using random number tables to receive topiramate (n = 22) or placebo (n = 22). The total duration of treatment was 4 months, including a baseline period of 1 month during which topiramate was titrated weekly in 25-mg increments to 100 mg/d in 2 divided doses or to the maximum tolerated dose. The titration was followed by a 12-week maintenance phase during which topiramate was given in 2 divided doses. The primary outcome measures were the reduction in the mean migraine frequency and severity of headache. Secondary outcome measures included the number of times analgesics were required for a month for acute attacks and functional disability. Functional disability was measured by comparing school absenteeism and Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (PedMIDAS). The decrease in mean (± SD) monthly migraine frequency from 16.14 (± 9.35) at baseline to 4.27 (± 1.95) at the end of the study in the topiramate group was significantly greater as compared with a decrease from 13.38 (± 7.78) to 7.48 (± 5.94) at the end of the study in the placebo group (P = 0.025). The difference in number of rescue medications used for topiramate and placebo was not statistically significant (P = 0.059). There was a statistically significant decrease in the PedMIDAS score from 50.66 (± 32.1) to 10.42 (± 6.39) at the end of the study in the topiramate group compared with a decrease from 42.66 (± 27.5) to 23.7 (± 19.1) at the end of 4 months in the placebo group (P = 0.003). The decrease in school absenteeism was significant with topiramate compared with placebo (P = 0.002). Weight loss, decreased concentration in school, sedation, and parasthesias were important side effects with topiramate. Most of these side effects were mild to moderate and were not significant enough to cause dropout from the study.

### Cost-effectiveness of migraine prevention: the case of topiramate in the UK [^6cc8157f]. Cephalalgia (2006). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of topiramate vs. no preventive treatment in the UK. Model inputs included baseline migraine frequency, treatment discontinuation and response, preventive and acute medical cost per attack [2005 GBP (pound)] and gain in health utility. Outcomes included monthly migraines averted, acute and preventive treatment costs and cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Topiramate was associated with 1.8 fewer monthly migraines and a QALY gain of 0.0384. The incremental cost of topiramate vs. no preventive treatment was about 10 UK pounds per migraine averted and 5700 UK pounds per QALY. Results are sensitive to baseline monthly migraine frequency, triptan use rate and the gain in utility. Incorporating savings from reduced work loss (about 36 UK pounds per month) suggests that topiramate would be cost saving compared with no preventive treatment. This analysis suggests that topiramate is a cost-effective treatment for migraine prevention compared with no preventive treatment.

### Health technology assessment for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine: a position statement of the international headache society [^47f8b729]. Cephalalgia (2021). Medium credibility.

Comparators

The developers of new health technologies typically conduct randomized trials to demonstrate efficacy using placebo as a control. For HTAs in migraine, it is recommended that new technologies be compared with an established treatment in the specific patient population of interest. If head-to-head trials comparing relevant interventions are not available at the time of assessment, HTAs should employ indirect or mixed-treatment comparisons (e.g. network meta-analyses) to estimate relative effectiveness, provided that the trials being analysed have comparable treatment periods, endpoints, assessments, and populations. Whenever required, statistical adjustments for potential confounders of treatment effects should be included. The HTA process should be fully inclusive of relevant stakeholders, particularly patients and/or patient groups (including public hearings by the HTA authorities)

Acute treatment

Appropriate comparators for technologies intended for the acute treatment of migraine include the oral tablet formulations of sumatriptan 50 mg, sumatriptan 100 mg, rizatriptan 10 mg, or eletriptan 40 mg and 80 mg. For new technologies intended for patients who do not respond to triptans, do not tolerate them, or have cardiovascular contraindications that preclude their use, appropriate comparators include a different class of medications (e.g. NSAIDs), usual care, or placebo. With usual care as the comparator, real-world data on headache patterns and treatments are required, and patients who have a history of failure with currently available treatments should be analysed. The main challenge with using placebo as a control is that results may lack external validity; placebo is not given as a treatment for migraine in clinical practice.

Preventive treatment

Comparators that may be used for efficacy trials technologies intended for the preventive treatment of migraine include propranolol 80 mg to 160 mg, metoprolol 100 mg, topiramate 50 mg to 100 mg, flunarizine 5 mg/day to 10 mg/day, amitriptyline 25 mg to 50 mg, and mAbs against CGRP or the CGRP receptor (e.g. monthly erenumab 70 mg to 140 mg, fremanezumab 225 mg, or galcanezumab 120 mg and quarterly eptinezumab 100 mg). For populations that include patients with chronic migraine, appropriate comparators include onabotulinumtoxinA 155 IU to 195 IU; topiramate 50 mg to 100 mg; monthly erenumab 70 mg to 140 mg, fremanezumab 225 mg, or galcanezumab 120 mg; and quarterly eptinezumab 100 mg.

### Erenumab versus topiramate for the prevention of migraine-a randomised, double-blind, active-controlled phase 4 trial [^a263bd68]. Cephalalgia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

We compared the tolerability and efficacy of erenumab, a monoclonal antibody binding to the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, to topiramate for migraine prophylaxis in adults.

Methods

HER-MES was a 24-week, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, controlled trial conducted in 82 sites in Germany. Patients with ≥ 4 migraine days per month and naïve to study drugs were randomly assigned (1:1) to either subcutaneous erenumab (70 or 140 mg/month) plus topiramate placebo (erenumab group) or oral topiramate at the individual dose with optimal efficacy (50–100 mg/day) plus erenumab placebo (topiramate group).

The primary endpoint was medication discontinuation due to an adverse event during the double-blind phase. The proportion of patients that achieved ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in monthly migraine days during the last 3 months of the double-blind phase was a secondary endpoint.

Results

Seven hundred and seventy-seven patients were randomised (from 22 February 2019 to 29 July, 2020) and 95.1% completed the study. In the erenumab group, 10.6% discontinued medication due to adverse events compared to 38.9% in the topiramate group (odds ratio, 0.19; 95% confidence interval 0.13–0.27; p < 0.001). Significantly more patients achieved a ≥ 50% reduction in monthly migraine days from baseline with erenumab (55.4% vs. 31.2%; odds ratio 2.76; 95% confidence interval 2.06–3.71; p < 0.001). No new safety signals occurred.

Conclusions

Erenumab demonstrated a favourable tolerability and efficacy profile compared to topiramate.

### May lamotrigine be an alternative to topiramate in the prevention of migraine with aura? Results of a retrospective study [^ed346ca5]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Contrary to topiramate, the role of lamotrigine in the prevention of migraine is more controversial.

The North American guidelines for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine included lamotrigine among medications established to be ineffective. This low level of grading is essentially based on the results of two prospective, randomized, controlled trials, involving migraineurs both with and without aura. Both studies failed to demonstrate the efficacy of lamotrigine in migraine prophylaxis compare to placebo and topiramate respectively. However, posthoc analysis from the abovementioned studies, exploring the role of lamotrigine in reducing migraine aura frequency, was not conducted due to the small number of patients suffering from migraine with auraincluded. Lamotrigine is an antiepileptic drug that exerts its function by blocking voltage-sensitive sodium channels, indirectly leading to the inhibition of neuronal release of glutamate, a neurotransmitter involved in the development and propagation of CSD. Evidence suggests that chronic intraperitoneal administration of lamotrigine determine a strong suppression of CSD propagation in rats compared with placebo and valproate. More than a decade ago, several pilot, open label studies exploring the role of lamotrigine in the prophylaxis of migraine aura were conducted and pointed to a great efficacy of the drug in reducing both frequency and duration of aura episodes. Based on these findings, a prospective open study including 59 patients suffering from migraine with aura treated with lamotrigine showed a sustained reduction of aura frequency and duration. Additionally, more than three quarters of the aura responder patients also reported a significance reduction of migraine attacks frequency during the treatment period, suggesting a potential efficacy of lamotrigine for the prophylaxis of migraine headache as well. Based on these results, lamotrigine is largely used in clinical practice for the preventive treatment of migraine with aura especially in patients for whom other preventive treatments are ineffective or contraindicated, although clear evidence supporting the non-inferiority of lamotrigine compared with other approved migraine prophylactic agents is still lacking.

### Exercise as migraine prophylaxis: a randomized study using relaxation and topiramate as controls [^fcd1e669]. Cephalalgia (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

Scientific evidence regarding exercise in migraine prophylaxis is required. Therefore this study aimed to evaluate the effects of exercise in migraine prevention.

Methods

In a randomized, controlled trial of adults with migraine, exercising for 40 minutes three times a week was compared to relaxation according to a recorded programme or daily topiramate use, which was slowly increased to the individual's highest tolerable dose (maximum 200 mg/day). The treatment period lasted for 3 months, and migraine status, quality of life, level of physical activity, and oxygen uptake were evaluated. The primary efficacy variable was the mean reduction of the frequency of migraine attacks during the final month of treatment compared with the baseline.

Results

Ninety-one patients were randomized and included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The primary efficacy variable showed a mean reduction of 0.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31–1.54) attacks in the exercise group, 0.83 (95% CI 0.22–1.45) attacks in the relaxation group, and 0.97 (95% CI 0.36–1.58) attacks in the topiramate group. No significant difference was observed between the groups (p = 0.95).

Conclusion

Exercise may be an option for the prophylactic treatment of migraine in patients who do not benefit from or do not want to take daily medication.
