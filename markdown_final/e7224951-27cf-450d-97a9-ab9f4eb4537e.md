## Question

Flumazenil will antagonize the respiratory depression associated with which of the following medications?
A. Meperidine B. Methohexital C. Midazolam D. Propofol

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which sedative among meperidine, methohexital, midazolam, and propofol has respiratory depression that can be antagonized by flumazenil, and why the other options do not meet that criterion. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about flumazenil's mechanism and labeled indication. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic class and receptor targets of each listed drug. Next, I will map which agent's respiratory depression is mediated through flumazenil's target. Finally, I will double-check the distractors to ensure there isn't a nuance I'm missing before concluding with the correct answer and a concise rationale.

> Let me first confirm flumazenil's mechanism and scope. Flumazenil is a competitive antagonist at benzodiazepine-binding sites on the GABA-A receptor complex and is indicated to reverse CNS and respiratory depression due to benzodiazepine overdose; it does not reverse non-benzodiazepine sedatives or opioids, so I need to ensure I'm only considering a true benzodiazepine among the choices [^114zWPbL].

> Now, I will examine each option's class and receptor pharmacology. Meperidine is a synthetic opioid; its respiratory depression is mediated via mu-opioid receptors, not GABA-A, so flumazenil would not be expected to reverse it, which means I can eliminate A. Methohexital is a barbiturate that enhances GABA-A currents via barbiturate binding sites distinct from the benzodiazepine site; flumazenil does not antagonize barbiturates, so B is out. Propofol is a general anesthetic that potentiates GABA-A currents but binds at a site different from benzodiazepines; again, flumazenil won't reverse propofol's effects, so D is not correct. Midazolam is a benzodiazepine whose sedative and respiratory-depressant effects are mediated through benzodiazepine-site modulation of GABA-A, making it the pharmacologic match for flumazenil reversal [^116xAcTg] [^115DrLbJ] [^114zWPbL].

> Wait, let me verify the practical implication to avoid overgeneralization. Guidelines explicitly note flumazenil is effective at reversing CNS and respiratory depression from benzodiazepine overdose, reinforcing that midazolam is the correct target here, whereas propofol-based sedation lacks a reversal agent and requires airway-capable management when respiratory depression occurs, which aligns with endoscopy and sedation guidance emphasizing propofol's narrow therapeutic index and absence of an antagonist [^114zWPbL] [^115DrLbJ].

> I should double-check the distractors one more time to ensure no edge cases. There is no evidence that flumazenil reverses opioid-induced respiratory depression from meperidine, nor barbiturate effects from methohexital, nor propofol-mediated GABA-A potentiation; mechanistically and clinically, flumazenil's action is confined to benzodiazepine-site antagonism, so the only viable answer remains midazolam [^notfound].

> Conclusion: Flumazenil will antagonize the respiratory depression associated with midazolam, because midazolam is a benzodiazepine whose effects are mediated at the benzodiazepine-binding site on the GABA-A receptor, which flumazenil competitively blocks [^114zWPbL].

---

The correct answer is **C. Midazolam**. Flumazenil is a specific benzodiazepine antagonist that reverses respiratory depression caused by benzodiazepines such as midazolam [^114zWPbL]. It does not reverse respiratory depression from opioids (meperidine) [^notfound], barbiturates (methohexital), or propofol, which act at different receptors or pathways [^115DrLbJ].

---

## Pharmacological mechanism of flumazenil

Flumazenil is a **competitive antagonist** at benzodiazepine receptors on the GABA-A complex, blocking benzodiazepine binding and reversing their sedative and respiratory-depressant effects [^114zWPbL]. It has **no significant effect** on opioid, barbiturate, or propofol receptors, so it does not reverse respiratory depression from these agents [^113R2jfY].

## Medications listed in the question and their mechanisms of action

| **Medication** | **Class** | **Mechanism of action** | **Receptor involved** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Meperidine | Opioid | - Binds μ-opioid receptors <br/> - Causing analgesia and respiratory depression | Opioid receptors |
| Methohexital | Barbiturate | - Enhances GABA-A activity <br/> - But not via benzodiazepine site | GABA-A (barbiturate site) |
| Midazolam | Benzodiazepine | - Enhances GABA-A activity via benzodiazepine site | GABA-A (benzodiazepine site) |
| Propofol | General anesthetic | - Potentiates GABA-A activity <br/> - But not via benzodiazepine site | GABA-A (distinct site) |

---

## Flumazenil's effect on respiratory depression caused by each medication

- **Meperidine**: Flumazenil does not reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression; naloxone is required [^notfound].
- **Methohexital**: Flumazenil does not reverse barbiturate-induced respiratory depression [^notfound].
- **Midazolam**: Flumazenil effectively reverses benzodiazepine-induced respiratory depression [^114zWPbL].
- **Propofol**: Flumazenil does not reverse propofol-induced respiratory depression [^115DrLbJ].

---

## Clinical implications and safety considerations

Flumazenil is indicated for **benzodiazepine overdose** or when benzodiazepines cause respiratory depression, but it is not effective for opioid, barbiturate, or propofol toxicity. Rapid flumazenil administration can precipitate seizures or withdrawal in benzodiazepine-dependent patients, so use caution and monitor closely [^114zWPbL].

---

## Conclusion

Flumazenil reverses respiratory depression from benzodiazepines such as midazolam but not from meperidine, methohexital, or propofol, which act at different receptors or sites. The correct answer is **C. Midazolam**.

### Propofol and survival: an updated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^116MD5zG]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Propofol is one of the most widely used hypnotic agents in the world. Nonetheless, propofol might have detrimental effects on clinically relevant outcomes, possibly due to inhibition of other interventions' organ protective properties. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to evaluate if propofol reduced survival compared to any other hypnotic agent in any clinical setting.

Methods

We searched eligible studies in PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Register of Clinical Trials. The following inclusion criteria were used: random treatment allocation and comparison between propofol and any comparator in any clinical setting. The primary outcome was mortality at the longest follow-up available. We conducted a fixed-effects meta-analysis for the risk ratio (RR). Using this RR and 95% confidence interval, we estimated the probability of any harm (RR > 1) through Bayesian statistics. We registered this systematic review and meta-analysis in PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42022323143).

Results

We identified 252 randomized trials comprising 30,757 patients. Mortality was higher in the propofol group than in the comparator group (760/14,754 [5.2%] vs. 682/16,003 [4.3%]; RR = 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.20; p = 0.03; I² = 0%; number needed to harm = 235), corresponding to a 98.4% probability of any increase in mortality. A statistically significant mortality increase in the propofol group was confirmed in subgroups of cardiac surgery, adult patients, volatile agent as comparator, large studies, and studies with low mortality in the comparator arm.

Conclusions

Propofol may reduce survival in perioperative and critically ill patients. This needs careful assessment of the risk versus benefit of propofol compared to other agents while planning for large, pragmatic multicentric randomized controlled trials to provide a definitive answer.

Dear Editor,

We read with delight the newly published meta-analysis on propofol and survival in different settings by Kotani et al. We want to congratulate the authors, which made a considerable effort to carry through a wealthy systematic review obtaining a significant number of studies to evaluate this critical question regarding propofol.

We will carefully dissect the three most significant limitations we encountered in the main result of the article that suggests a 10% increase in mortality of propofol when compared to other hypnotic agents in the overall population (RR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.01–1.20, p = 0.03).

### Reply to "Propofol and survival: an updated meta ‑ analysis of randomized clinical trials" [^116SLygA]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

Kotani et al. conducted an updated systematic literature review and meta-analysis of the use of propofol in diverse scenarios. We believe that the information provided is relevant but should be interpreted with caution. One major observation is the lack of defined and clearly stated comparative groups. Propofol is used in a wide range of clinical scenarios and groups of patients. Because of this, multiple comparisons of the use of propofol versus other agents and in different scenarios in clinical trials would be expected. Not stating which are these strategies overshadows the validity of the results. Systematic reviews are intended to answer specific questions based on the PICO framework, where C for comparison is a vital component. A clinical question should always have a reliable comparator, whereas in the present study, the comparator was "any strategy besides propofol". As stated in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, a well-defined comparator group is preferred in the case of standard meta-analysis, while network meta-analysis may be able to perform multiple comparisons between different treatment groups, every time some assumptions are met. Nonetheless, after looking through the present work and the supplementary material, we did not find any evidence of the comparator groups, severely limiting the capacity of interpretation of the data by the readers, and thus, its clinical applicability.

Propofol — sleep promotion in critically ill adults: We suggest not using propofol to improve sleep in critically ill adults (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). No demonstrable improvement in sleep occurred with propofol compared with placebo, and propofol was associated with REM suppression, hemodynamic side effects, and respiratory depression sometimes necessitating mechanical ventilation. This recommendation addresses only the sole purpose of improving sleep and does not address use for procedural or continuous sedation. The evidence base included two RCTs comparing propofol with benzodiazepines and one trial versus placebo.

### A comparison of the effects on respiratory carbon dioxide response, arterial blood pressure, and heart rate of dexmedetomidine, propofol, and midazolam in sevoflurane-anesthetized rabbits [^1132Xs9G]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Dexmedetomidine, propofol, and midazolam are commonly used sedative-hypnotic drugs. Using a steady-state method, we examined the CO2 ventilatory response, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) effects of these three drugs in sevoflurane-anesthetized rabbits.

Methods

New Zealand white rabbits weighing 2.9 ± 0.2 kg (mean ± SD) were used. After anesthetic induction and tracheostomy, the animals inhaled 2% sevoflurane to ensure a stable level of sedation throughout the experiment. After preparation, the rabbits were randomly assigned to four groups (n = 10 x 4) and received the following drugs: Group C, control; Group D, dexmedetomidine infused at 2 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1); Group P, propofol with the plasma concentration maintained at 15 microg/mL; Group M, midazolam initial IV 0.3 mg/kg bolus dose, followed by infusion at 1.86 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1). At 15 minutes after the start of infusion, for 20 min periods, in random sequences, gas including 0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, or 5% of CO2 was delivered to each animal. Fraction of inspired oxygen was maintained at 0.9. We did intergroup comparisons of minute ventilation (MV), respiratory rate, MAP, and HR during the final minute of each inspiratory carbon dioxide concentration (FiCO2) period.

Results

For Groups P and M, the rightward shift of plots for MV against FiCO2 indicated significant respiratory depression compared with Group C. There was also significantly more depression than in Group D. We found no significant differences between Groups P and M or between Groups C and D in the plots of MV against FiCO2. No significant differences among the four groups were apparent for respiratory rate. PaCO2-MV response plots were derived from linear regression analysis of data for mean MV and mean PaCO2 at each FiCO2 to compute apneic CO2 thresholds and CO2 sensitivities. The apneic CO2 thresholds of Groups P and M were larger than those of Groups C and D. The CO2 sensitivities of Group D were slightly lower than in Group C. No similar significant difference between the CO2 sensitivities of other group pairs was apparent. MAP in Group D was lower than in Groups C and M. In Group D, HR was lower than in Groups C, P, and M.

Conclusions

The major finding is that, during sevoflurane anesthesia in rabbits, dexmedetomidine slightly altered the ventilatory response to CO2. It decreased MAP more than propofol and midazolam, which both significantly depressed the ventilatory response to CO2.

### Mechanisms of action of the detrimental effects of propofol on survival [^1116zwz8]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Due to its favorable pharmacologic features, propofol is the most commonly used hypnotic agent in perioperative and intensive care settings. However, it also has adverse effects like propofol infusion syndrome and an increased risk of infection. Growing evidence suggests that propofol may worsen clinical outcomes by inhibiting the organ-protective properties of other interventions, such as volatile anesthetics or remote ischemic preconditioning. This editorial describes possible mechanisms underlying the detrimental effects of propofol, and provides an overview of the results of clinical trials evaluating the effects of propofol in various settings.

### Propofol enhances BCR-ABL TKIs' inhibitory effects in chronic myeloid leukemia through akt / mTOR suppression [^111BWXxW]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Although the inhibitory effect for an intravenous anesthetic drug propofol as an anticancer agent has been demonstrated in a panel of solid tumors, its therapeutic potential in hematological malignancies are not well understood. CML is characterized as a hematopoietic stem cell malignancy. Although imatinib or dasatinib have significantly improved clinical outcome in CML, primary resistance and leukemia relapse after an initially successful response is a major problem. This suggests that addition of drug which can synergize with TKI may be better option in CML. In this work, we addressed a most relevant issue in CML patients by evaluating propofol as a potential agent for overcoming BCR-ABL TKIs resistance. Propofol is an attractive candidate as it is available in clinical practice for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia, and have protective effects in multiple organs and tissues from hypoxia and ischemia-reperfusion injuries. In this study, we show that propofol is active against CML cells and significantly augments TKIs' inhibitory effect via suppression Akt/mTOR signaling.

We used three cell lines: KBM7, K562 and KU812, which derived from different CML patients, to ensure the effect of propofol in CML. Propofol significantly inhibits proliferation, increases apoptosis and caspase 3 activation in all tested CML cell lines (Fig. 1a to c). This result is consistent with the previous reports on the inhibitory effects of propofol on the tumor cell growth and survival. In particular, propofol has been shown to activate caspase 3, 8 and 9 in acute myeloid leukemia cell HL60. In addition, propofol significantly sensitizes CML cell in response to imatinib (Fig. 1d and e). The plasma propofol concentrations for general anesthesia are considered to be 3–6 μg/ml. The IC50 of propofol as single drug is 10 μM (1.78 μg/ml) and the dose of propofol used for combination therapy is 5 μM (0.89 μg/ml) (Fig. 1), suggesting that the effective concentrations of propofol in CML are clinically achievable. Importantly, our results obtained from CML xenograft mouse model further demonstrate the in vivo efficacy of propofol and its synergistic effects with BCR-ABL TKIs (Fig. 4). It has also been shown that propofol enhances paclitaxel- or cisplatin-induced apoptosis in ovarian and cervical cancer cells. Our results together with the previous studies demonstrate that propofol is a potential candidate for combination therapy in cancer treatment.

### ASIPP guidelines for sedation and fasting status of patients undergoing interventional pain management procedures [^115nwKAp]. Pain Physician (2019). High credibility.

ASIPP sedation — propofol guidance states that propofol (Diprivan) is not recommended for interventional pain procedures because of its potency, which can result in rapid deep sedation and/or general anesthesia states with dose-dependent respiratory depression; even at low doses, propofol can cause decreased oxygen levels, increased carbon dioxide levels, and inhibit airway reflexes; because of its pronounced respiratory depressant effects and narrow therapeutic range, propofol should only be administered by individuals trained in airway management and should not be utilized for interventional pain procedures under mild to moderate sedation, and dosing regimens should be further modified for sedation in elderly patients and those with severe systemic disease.

### Propofol: a medication that changed pediatric anesthesia practice [^116cNpWE]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

9 Conclusions

The introduction of propofol has shaped pediatric anesthesia practice. Propofol introduction improved our understanding of pharmacology, initiated new research approaches for intravenous drug study, and led to the use of infusion pumps for the maintenance phase of anesthesia. Propofol pharmacodynamic properties encouraged supraglottic airway use and became the primary treatment for postoperative delirium after inhalational anesthesia. While some progress during the rise of propofol can be attributed to either plan or parallel development, others are simply random events; environmental drug impact concerns were serendipitous. The story of propofol development provided a blueprint for other intravenous drug development. Use of propofol in TCI pumps is a practical example of the target concentration approach to drug therapy and clinical drug development.

Propofol versus benzodiazepines — among mechanically ventilated adults, propofol shortened extubation time while data for other outcomes were limited. Nine trials (n = 423) reported shorter time to extubation with propofol compared with a benzodiazepine (MD, −11.6 hr; 95% CI, −15.6 to −7.6; low quality); only one RCT assessed delirium and found no difference with no data for other critical outcomes, and propofol was associated with a higher risk of self-extubation (RR, 2.2; 95% CI, 0.30–26.45; low quality).

### Propofol: a medication that changed pediatric anesthesia practice [^115oLHUH]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

The introduction of propofol into clinical anesthesia had a major influence on practice. The drug rapidly assumed dominance over other intravenous options for the induction of anesthesia. Propofol use for maintenance does not yet rival that of the inhalational agent, sevoflurane, but acceptance is increasing, even in patients with complex physiology such as premature neonates or those nursed in intensive care units. None of the other hypnotics currently available have successfully competed with propofol in adults or children.

This ascendency of propofol was associated with new concepts to steer clinical pharmacology interpretation. Whether serendipity or design, both the ability to analyze complex pharmacologic data and cerebral effect monitoring underwent advances that allowed improved methods to interpret pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PKPD) of anesthesia drugs. The development of programmed infusion pumps capable of incorporating PKPD knowledge improved the ability, efficacy, and safety of drug delivery. Propofol was the drug spearheading these innovations in anesthesia research and practice.

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

9.2 Abuse

There are reports of the abuse of propofol for recreational and other improper purposes, which have resulted in fatalities and other injuries. Instances of self-administration of DIPRIVAN by health care professionals have also been reported, which have resulted in fatalities and other injuries. Inventories of DIPRIVAN should be stored and managed to prevent the risk of diversion, including restriction of access and accounting procedures as appropriate to the clinical setting.

### A focused update to the clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of pain, anxiety, agitation / sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption in adult patients in the ICU [^1168g1qk]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Mechanically ventilated adults in the ICU — dexmedetomidine versus propofol: Across 29 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 3087 adults, mostly targeting light sedation, dexmedetomidine probably reduced delirium prevalence (RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.37–0.81; absolute risk reduction [ARR], 15 fewer per 100; 95% CI, from 20 fewer to 6 fewer) and may reduce delirium duration (MD, –25.58 hr; 95% CI, –43.49 to –7.66 hr). It may slightly shorten ICU length of stay (MD, –0.19 d; 95% CI, –0.33 to –0.05 d) with little to no difference in mechanical ventilation duration (MD, –1.6 hr; 95% CI, –2.77 to –0.42 hr), may improve time at target sedation and reduce need for supplemental analgesics (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52–0.99), and shows little to no effect on mortality at longest follow-up (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.86–1.13; ARR, 0 fewer per 100; 95% CI, from 3 fewer to 3 more). Dexmedetomidine probably increases bradycardia (RR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.28–2.12; absolute risk increase [ARI], 6 more per 100; 95% CI, from 2 more to 10 more) with little to no difference in hypotension risk (RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.92–1.25), may improve quality of life and functional status at 6 months, and effects on post-ICU cognitive impairment and 28-day mortality are unclear (certainty ratings as stated on-page).

### ACG clinical guideline: liver disease and pregnancy [^113rDPQR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Safety of endoscopy in pregnancy — recommendations and sedation: Endoscopy is safe in pregnancy but should be deferred until the second trimester if possible (strong recommendation, low level of evidence). Meperidine and propofol can be used for endoscopic sedation (strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence). There are currently no FDA pregnancy category A medications for endoscopic sedation; the benzodiazepine class of sedatives (FDA category D) should be avoided. Meperidine crosses the placenta and repeated or prolonged administration should be avoided late in pregnancy or at term (FDA category C). Propofol is an FDA pregnancy category B anesthetic, and if used an anesthesiologist should monitor respiratory function closely. During procedures, the patient should be positioned in the left lateral position with aggressive intravenous hydration, with attention to maintaining hemodynamic stability and oxygenation.

### Sedation during endoscopic procedures: a Hellenic Society of Gastroenterology position statement [^115DrLbJ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Section 5: The use of propofol

What is the role of propofol in sedation during endoscopy?

Statement 10: The use of propofol is superior to the classical sedation drugs during interventional endoscopic procedures because the patient's satisfaction is greater and the recovery time is shorter.

Rounds of voting needed to reach agreement: 1; Agreement level: 100%

Studies have shown that propofol is superior to traditional sedation schemes of benzodiazepines plus opioids in ERCP procedures. Higher post-procedure patient satisfaction is achieved with propofol compared to traditional sedation for colonoscopy, endoscopic ultrasonography, ERCP, but not gastroduodenoscopy. Time to sedation and recovery time are shorter with propofol than with traditional sedation. Regarding adverse effects, propofol may relatively frequently cause hypoventilation, hypotension and bradycardia, but severe adverse effects are extremely rare.

Synergistic sedation with low doses of intravenous midazolam and propofol significantly reduces the required dose of propofol and therefore the risk of complications; it has been reported to be an effective alternative option to the use of propofol as a sole agent. Propofol as a sole agent and synergistic sedation with low doses of intravenous midazolam and propofol have also been proposed for gastrointestinal endoscopy in children.

Despite the adequate safety data from non-anesthesiologists administering propofol, the majority of the anesthesiology community remains opposed, because of the drug's ability to quickly induce deep sedation and general anesthesia. Since there is no reversal agent for propofol, the likelihood that advanced airway management techniques will be needed is higher than for the combination of midazolam with opioids. Moreover, sedation is a continuum, and deep sedation is logically associated with an increased frequency of inadequate ventilation or airway obstruction. Thus, the anesthesiology community recommends that propofol-based sedation should be administered only by anesthetists.

### Propofol (Diprivan) [^116i1761]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of propofol IV (also known as Diprivan) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm in animals. Consider the benefits of appropriate anesthesia in pregnant women against the potential risks, especially for procedures that may last more than 3 hours or if multiple procedures are required prior to delivery. It may be appropriate to delay certain procedures if doing so will not jeopardize the health of the child and/or mother. No specific anesthetic or sedation drug has been shown to be safer than another. Propofol is not recommended for labor and obstetric delivery, including C-section deliveries, because the drug crosses the placenta and may be associated with neonatal depression. The drug propofol IV (also known as Diprivan) is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### Propofol (Diprivan) [^113qTAEH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

DIPRIVAN is an intravenous general anesthetic and sedation drug for use in the induction and maintenance of anesthesia or sedation. Intravenous injection of a therapeutic dose of propofol induces anesthesia, with minimal excitation, usually within 40 seconds from the start of injection (the time for one arm-brain circulation). As with other rapidly acting intravenous anesthetic agents, the half-time of the blood-brain equilibration is approximately 1 to 3 minutes, accounting for the rate of induction of anesthesia.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The mechanism of action, like all general anesthetics, is poorly understood. However, propofol is thought to produce its sedative/anesthetic effects by the positive modulation of the inhibitory function of the neurotransmitter GABA through the ligand-gated GABAAreceptors.

Risk Summary

Data from randomized controlled trials, cohort studies and case series over several decades with propofol use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Most of the reported exposures to propofol describe propofol exposure at the time of cesarean delivery. There are reports of neonatal depression in infants exposed to propofol during delivery (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, decreased pup survival concurrent with increased maternal mortality was observed with intravenous administration of propofol to pregnant rats either prior to mating and during early gestation or during late gestation and early lactation at exposures less than the human induction dose of 2.5 mg/kg. In pregnant rats administered 15 mg/kg/day intravenous propofol (equivalent to the human induction dose) from two weeks prior to mating to early in gestation (Gestation Day 7), offspring that were allowed to mate had increased post implantation losses. The pharmacological activity (anesthesia) of the drug on the mother is probably responsible for the adverse effects seen in the offspring.

Published studies in pregnant primates demonstrate that the administration of anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity during the period of peak brain development increases neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain of the offspring when used for longer than 3 hours. There are no data on pregnancy exposures in primates corresponding to periods prior to the third trimester in humans [see Data, Warnings and Precautions (5.3), and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. The clinical significance of these nonclinical findings is not known, and the benefits of appropriate anesthesia in pregnant women who require procedures should be balanced with the potential risks suggested by the nonclinical data.

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/neonatal Adverse Reactions

Propofol injectable emulsion crosses the placenta and may be associated with neonatal depression. Monitor neonates for hypotonia and sedation following maternal exposure to propofol.

Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol — risk mitigation and subhypnotic dosing: No new studies have examined the effects of propofol-based TIVA on POV/PONV since publication of the previous guidelines, and two previous meta-analyses found that TIVA reduces POV and PONV rates compared to inhalational anesthesia with single-agent prophylaxis or inhalational anesthesia alone (A1). Two smaller studies suggest a protective role for subhypnotic propofol during volatile agent maintenance, with doses ranging from < 100 mcg/kg/min to 20 mcg/kg/min (A3); therefore, if full TIVA is not feasible, a subhypnotic infusion of propofol may serve as a risk mitigating strategy (A3).

Sedation strategy research gaps — adult ICU: Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations should be incorporated in both sedative choice and delivery methods; benzodiazepine medications still form the mainstay of therapy in resource-poor areas and their risks and benefits need study in the context of cost; with increased propofol use, strategies to detect propofol-related infusion syndrome earlier are required and large-scale registry studies to characterize its prevalence and risks should be undertaken; and the role of nonpharmacologic strategies to reduce agitation, anxiety, and distress in terms of sedative choice and requirements is uncertain, and thus, no recommendations could be made in this regard.

The variable of time becomes vital all the time that patients with different follow-up periods are being included in the same pool for an effect analysis. A common methodological error is missing different times of follow-up for the calculation of the development of an outcome in a longitudinal fashion. This is the rationale behind using time-to event analyses. In the circumstances in which the time-periods are similar, an assumption of equality can be made, and RRs or ORs can be used. But as in the comparative groups, a median follow-up, and the ranges of follow-up were not stated. Mortality is a variable dependent and affected by time. It lacks all clinical significance attributing a negative mortality effect to a drug without knowing after how much time this effect will be seen.

Currently, a vital part of the results should be in the different scenario of the patients, and this cannot be determined with the results obtained by the meta-analysis. There are certain scenarios in which propofol has been seen to be superior to other agents. The work of Shehabi et al. in 2023 carried out in adults less than 65 years, sedation with a combination of propofol with dexmedetomidine revealed that the incremental dose of propofol was associated with a decreased mortality, while those with dexmedetomidine had an increased mortality 90 days. Based on this, the time hypothesis arises, the variability of the outcomes between studies, the fact of taking too short and/or too long times can alter the interpretation in relation to the main outcome. This study showed a faster induction and movement of the lower body and the patient by achieving a higher recovery area score compared to dexmedetomidine, the importance of this work lies in the fact that it took into account the perspective of patients in sedation of short stay, a rarely explored outcome. Finally, in terms of mortality, Schaefer et al. conducted a study in more than 200,000 patients where increasing propofol dose was associated with reduced odds of 1-year mortality in patients without solid cancer (aOR 0.78; 95% CI 0.71–0.85), it seems that the clinical scenario given by the clinical characteristics of the patient and the propofol dose can play a determining role in terms of outcome.

While this meta-analysis provided valuable insights into the use of propofol, it is important for future studies to address these limitations. The inclusion of specific control groups and the reporting of in RCTs and reporting the different follow-up periods, are crucial to ensure that the findings are accurate and reliable.

2.2 Induction of General Anesthesia for Patients Greater than or Equal to 3 Years of Age

Adult Patients

Most adult patients under 65 years of age and classified as ASA-PS I or II require 2 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg of DIPRIVAN. For induction, whether administered by infusion or intravenous injection the dose of DIPRIVAN to the patient should be titrated against the response of the patient and until there are clinical signs consistent with the onset of anesthesia. As with other sedative-hypnotic agents, the amount of intravenous opioid and/or benzodiazepine premedication may impact the dose of DIPRIVAN required for induction of general anesthesia.

Elderly, Debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV Patients

Due to the reduced clearance and higher blood concentrations, most elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients require approximately 1 mg/kg to 1.5 mg/kg of DIPRIVAN for induction of anesthesia. For induction, whether administered by infusion or intravenous injection the dose administration of DIPRIVAN to the patient should be titrated against the response of the patient and until there are clinical signs consistent with the onset of anesthesia. A rapid bolus may increase the likelihood of undesirable cardiorespiratory depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]

Conclusions

In this open-label trial, fospropofol disodium achieved deep sedation at a rate comparable to propofol. For mechanically ventilated ICU patients, it may offer a safe and effective sedation option. However, larger-scale, multicenter trials with improved blinding, alternative sedation endpoints, and extended infusion durations are needed to validate these findings. Future studies should also examine the long-term safety profile and the potential influence of adjunctive medications. These considerations will be essential for optimizing sedation protocols in critically ill patients.

### Propofol is in the air: can exhaled gas monitoring illuminate intravenous dosing? [^114MKMzK]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Exhaled propofol monitoring has the potential to guide i.v. anaesthesia in a manner analogous to end-tidal monitoring of inhalation anaesthetics. Early proof-of-concept studies demonstrated the detection of propofol in breath, but adoption into routine clinical practice has been limited by the lack of compact, accurate, and rapid sensors, together with incomplete understanding of the pharmacokinetics of exhaled propofol across diverse patient populations. In this issue, a novel photoacoustic sensor that demonstrates strong correlation with mass spectrometry, the current gold standard for exhaled propofol detection, while offering reduced complexity and size, is described. This technology could facilitate broader investigation of exhaled propofol in clinical settings, potentially informing strategies to improve anaesthesia delivery and patient outcomes during i.v. anaesthesia.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^11312xia]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for the Tapering Process
6 Clinicians should generally consider dose reductions of 5 to 10% when determining the initial pace of the BZD taper. The pace of the taper should typically not exceed 25% every 2 weeks (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
7 Clinicians can consider transitioning patients without contraindications to a comparable dose of a longer-acting BZD medication for the taper (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).
8 Clinicians should tailor tapering strategies to each individual patient and adjust the taper based on a patient's response (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
9 Clinicians should evaluate patients undergoing tapering for signs and symptoms related to the BZD taper with each dose reduction (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

Recommendations for Adjunctive Interventions
10 Clinicians should offer patients undergoing BZD tapering behavioral interventions tailored to their underlying conditions (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I)) or provide them with referrals to access these interventions (Low Certainty, Strong Recommendation).
11 Clinicians should first consider pausing or slowing the pace of the BZD taper when patients experience symptoms that significantly interfere with the taper (e.g. sleep difficulty, anxiety). However, clinicians can also consider use of adjunctive medications (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).

Recommendations for Management of Severe or Complicated Withdrawal Symptoms

12 Clinicians should manage patients experiencing severe or complicated withdrawal in inpatient or residential medically managed settings (e.g. residential withdrawal management program) with:

Monitoring for signs and symptoms of BZD withdrawal, including regularly measuring vital signs and using structured assessment tools (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation)
Assessments for seizure risk, managed as appropriate (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation)

13 Tapering with very long-acting agents such as phenobarbital: a Can be considered for BZD withdrawal management in inpatient settings (Low Certainty, Strong Recommendation). b Should only be conducted by or in consultation with clinicians experienced in the use of these agents for the purpose of BZD withdrawal management (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).

14 Clinicians should avoid rapid BZD reversal agents such as flumazenil for the purpose of BZD tapering due to risks for refractory seizure, cardiac dysrhythmias, and other adverse effects (Clinical Consensus, Strong Recommendation).
15 Clinicians should avoid general anesthetics such as propofol or ketamine for the purpose of BZD tapering (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).

15 Clinicians should avoid general anesthetics such as propofol or ketamine for the purpose of BZD tapering (Clinical Consensus, Conditional Recommendation).

Implementation Considerations
Tapering initiated in an inpatient or residential medically managed level of care may be continued in a less intensive level of care once it is safe to do so.
When tapering with very long-acting agents, discharge planning should include an outpatient follow-up appointment, ideally within 7 days. Clinicians should assess patients for ongoing signs or symptoms related to discontinuation of the BZD, including re-emergence of symptoms for which the BZD was originally prescribed. Clinicians should consider medications and/or behavioral interventions to address ongoing signs or symptoms related to discontinuation of the BZD.

Propofol

Propofol is an agonist for GABA A receptors, resulting in hyperpolarization by increasing the duration of chloride channel opening/conductance by directly activating the chloride ionophore complex. This activation inhibits firing, thereby inducing sedation and anxiolysis. Of note, propofol binds at a different site of the GABA A receptor than benzodiazepines, and, hence, is often used in benzodiazepine refractory cases. Propofol also reduces glutamate activity, thereby preventing seizures, inhibits NMDA glutamate receptors, and is thought to inhibit other amino acids that may be upregulated in DTs. Propofol acts within seconds, duration of action is approximately 10 min, and has a short elimination half-life. Risks of propofol infusion include hypotension, the rare but potentially fatal propofol-related infusion syndrome, metabolic acidosis, and hypertriglyceridemia. Of note, barbiturates and propofol have similar effects on intracranial dynamics and cerebral activity. It is not clear if the increased duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital length of stay of patients treated with propofol is secondary to propofol itself or the severity of the withdrawal. Two, small, single-center studies demonstrated the efficacy of propofol in alleviating DTs, with one showing no difference in ventilator days, ICU days, or hospital length of stay between patients receiving benzodiazepines versus propofol. The ASAM guidelines recommend propofol in mechanically ventilated ICU patients with resistant alcohol withdrawal. Of note, higher induction doses of propofol are required in patients with AUD, with a recommended IV loading dose of 100 to 200 mg/hour.

5.8 Use for Intensive Care Unit Sedation of Intubated, Mechanically Ventilated Adult Patients

The administration of propofol injectable emulsion should be initiated as a continuous infusion and changes in the rate of administration made slowly (> 5 min) in order to minimize hypotension and avoid acute overdosage [see Overdosage (10) and Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

Patients should be monitored for early signs of significant hypotension and/or cardiovascular depression, which may be profound. These effects are responsive to discontinuation of propofol injectable emulsion, intravenous fluid administration, and/or vasopressor therapy. In the elderly, debilitated, or ASA-PS III or IV patients, rapid (single or repeated) bolus administration should not be used during sedation in order to minimize undesirable cardiorespiratory depression.

As with other sedative medications, there is wide interpatient variability in propofol injectable emulsion dosage requirements, and these requirements may change with time.

Failure to reduce the infusion rate in patients receiving propofol injectable emulsion for extended periods may result in excessively high blood concentrations of the drug. Thus, titration to clinical response and daily evaluation of sedation levels are important during use of propofol injectable emulsion infusion for ICU sedation, especially when it is used for long durations.

Opioids and paralytic agents should be discontinued and respiratory function optimized prior to weaning patients from mechanical ventilation. Infusions of propofol injectable emulsion should be adjusted to maintain a light level of sedation prior to weaning patients from mechanical ventilatory support. Throughout the weaning process, this level of sedation may be maintained in the absence of respiratory depression.

Abrupt discontinuation of propofol injectable emulsion prior to weaning or for daily evaluation of sedation levels should be avoided. This may result in rapid awakening with associated anxiety, agitation, and resistance to mechanical ventilation. It is therefore recommended that administration of propofol injectable emulsion be continued in order to maintain a light level of sedation throughout the weaning process until 10 to 15 minutes prior to extubation, at which time the infusion can be discontinued.

We suggest using either propofol or dexmedetomidine over benzodiazepines for sedation in critically ill, mechanically ventilated adults (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). Recognizing that dexmedetomidine should not be used when deep sedation (with or without neuromuscular blockade) is required, the panel issued a conditional recommendation favoring propofol over a benzodiazepine infusion and a conditional recommendation favoring dexmedetomidine over a benzodiazepine.

### Propofol in a modified cyclodextrin formulation: first human study of dose-response with emphasis on injection pain [^1139suJi]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2011). Low credibility.

Background

A new lipid-free preparation of propofol has been developed containing the drug, sulfobutylether ß-cyclodextrin and water. The primary objective of this study was to compare the effects of propofol in the lipid formulation with those of the new cyclodextrin formulation, particularly with regard to pain on injection. We hypothesized that the propofol in cyclodextrin would be associated with less pain on injection than propofol in lipid.

Methods

The study was a single-center, double-blind, 2-period, randomized, dose-escalating study using a completely balanced cross-over design in healthy volunteers. Pain on injection was compared between propofol in cyclodextrin and propofol in lipid using subject and observer assessments of pain rated at several different time points. Five response variables to pain were analyzed.

Results

Propofol in cyclodextrin had significantly higher pain scores for all 5 variables. Other endpoints, including sedation, showed no difference.

Conclusion

The propofol in cyclodextrin formulation failed to reduce the pain on injection associated with propofol.

Other pharmacological interventions during BZD tapering — Flumazenil, a GABA-A receptor antagonist, is effective at reversing CNS and respiratory depression due to BZD overdose, but the CCG agreed that flumazenil should not be utilized for the purposes of BZD tapering because of concerns about refractory seizures, cardiac dysrhythmias, and other adverse effects. Both ketamine and propofol are associated with increased respiratory depression when combined with BZDs, no evidence supports their use for routine BZD tapering, and the CCG agreed that the risks of anesthetics (e.g., ketamine, propofol) for BZD tapering outweigh potential benefits and could not be recommended; there is also no evidence for the use of medications used for procedural sedation (e.g., dexmedetomidine) in BZD withdrawal management.

Introduction

Delirium is a common and severe acute neurocognitive disorder characterized by attentional deficits, fluctuating levels of consciousness, and an unpredictable clinical course. Its incidence increases markedly with advancing age and is associated with prolonged hospitalization, higher morbidity and mortality rates, and long-term cognitive and functional decline. These adverse outcomes impose substantial medical, social, and economic burdens on patients, caregivers, and healthcare systems. The pathogenesis of delirium is multifactorial, influenced by perioperative factors such as the type of surgical procedure, choice of anesthetic agents, patient-specific vulnerabilities, and postoperative complications. Given its detrimental effects on recovery and prognosis, early identification and preventive strategies are crucial in clinical practice.

Propofol, a widely used intravenous anesthetic (chemically known as 2,6-diisopropylphenol), is commonly administered for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia as well as sedation in mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care units (ICUs). Its pharmacodynamic properties include rapid onset, short duration of action, and a predictable recovery profile, primarily mediated through potentiation of gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA A) receptor activity in the central nervous system. However, despite its efficacy, propofol use is associated with adverse effects, including pain on injection, dose-dependent respiratory depression, hemodynamic instability, and, particularly in elderly patients, a potential increased risk of postoperative delirium (POD). These limitations have prompted investigations into alternative sedative agents with improved safety profiles in high-risk populations. Benzodiazepines, another class of sedative-hypnotics, also act via GABA A ​receptor modulation, exerting sedative, anxiolytic, hypnotic, and anticonvulsant effects. While earlier studies suggested that propofol may reduce the incidence of delirium compared to traditional benzodiazepines such as midazolam — likely due to more precise sedation control and lower cognitive impairment — emerging benzodiazepine derivatives offer potential advantages.

Propofol

Propofol is an ultra-short-acting potent sedative, hypnotic medication with no analgesic properties. Compared to other commonly used agents, propofol has the fastest onset of action and one of the shortest recovery times. Clinical effect is usually achieved within 30 seconds of administration. Adverse effects requiring routine intervention by appropriately trained providers occur in approximately 2–5% of children undergoing propofol sedation and include respiratory obstruction, respiratory depression, apnea, and hypotension. Its main disadvantage as a drug used in procedural sedation is its narrow therapeutic index, i.e. its possibility of rapidly inducing anesthesia with loss of airway reflexes, upper airway obstruction and respiratory depression.

Fentanyl

Sedative-hypnotic agents, such as propofol and midazolam do not have analgesic properties and need to be combined with other analgesic agents to provide effective sedation for painful procedures. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that provides analgesia for procedures with moderate to severe pain. Its rapid peak effect (within 5 minutes) and relatively short duration of action render it preferable for procedural sedation when compared to longer acting opioids, such as morphine. Although typically administered parenterally, fentanyl also can be effective when used intranasally or via nebulizer.

Hypoxemia, respiratory depression, and apnea may occur when fentanyl is combined with other sedatives (e.g. propofol, midazolam). Chest wall and glottic rigidity are rare, but life-threatening adverse effects of fentanyl. Because of the above, fentanyl should be given only by an anesthesiologist or by a non-anesthesiologist physician who has undergone a specialized sedation course and when adequate facilities for pediatric resuscitation are available.

### Infectious disease risk associated with contaminated propofol anesthesia, 1989–2014 (1) [^1167WpeA]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Propofol is an excellent medium not only for bacterial growth but also for fungal infections, which have been associated with propofol use particularly when poor hygienic standards are observed during the administration. Viral infections with HCV and HBV have also been demonstrated, possibly explained by the viral stability offered by propofol emulsions. Overall, ≈23% of the published infection outbreaks associated with propofol were caused by HCV (18.1%) and HBV (4.2%); 21.5% by Candida albicans; and 47.2% by bacteria (gram-positive 27.1%, gram-negative 20.1%). In the remaining reports, no microorganisms were identified, possibly as a consequence of concurrent antimicrobial drug therapy. The most frequent pathogens associated with propofol-related outbreaks, in order of frequency, were Staphylococcus aureus (39/144), Candida albicans (31/144), and HCV (26/144).

Laboratory-based (Table 3) and epidemiologic (online Technical Appendix Table 1) microbiological studies have demonstrated that the production of bacterial endotoxins is greatly enhanced by propofol solutions. Case reports of endotoxemia associated with the use of contaminated propofol have also been published.

Frequency of Contaminated Propofol Used in ICUs and ORs

Microbiological observations of opened propofol vials were reported in the first studies that identified bacterial growth in propofol, and observational studies on propofol formulations have determined the proportion of extrinsic contamination (Table 3). In 1994, Farrington et al. established an incidence rate of 6% (3/50) of contaminated propofol syringes in an ICU. Webb et al. retrospectively observed similar results in a different ICU setting with an incidence of 5.9% (18/302). Soong observed a lower propofol contamination incidence (3.0%) in ORs and also noted an association between postoperative infections and vials from which multiple patients were medicated; Bach et al. found similar results. In 1995, McHugh and Roper reported an incidence of 6.3% (16/254) of infection when propofol was administered from vials but did not find that delays in the administration of propofol were associated in any increased likelihood of bacterial contamination. Cole et al. recorded the incidence of contamination as high as 17.3% (26/150) in propofol found in stopcock dead space.

### Guidelines for performing a comprehensive transesophageal echocardiographic examination: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists [^115dT5nq]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) sedation — opioids, benzodiazepines, and propofol: Opioids are frequently used as adjuncts to the procedure to offset the discomfort of probe insertion and manipulation, and opioids and benzodiazepines are synergistic, and caution is warranted when administering both simultaneously. Fentanyl and meperidine are the most commonly used sedation agents, though the use of meperidine has decreased over time because of increased incidence of respiratory depression and contraindications in patients with renal failure; opioids in general present a risk for respiratory depression, nausea, and vomiting. In frail or elderly individuals, the starting dose should be decreased by half, and patients on chronic benzodiazepines or opioids should be instructed to take their normal doses before the procedure and should be expected to have tolerance that will necessitate higher starting and overall dosing to achieve the same end point. Propofol is an intravenous sedative hypnotic that is not typically used by nonanesthesiologists because of the high risk for apnea and the need for airway management; many states have laws preventing its administration by nonanesthesiologists except in ventilated patients. The advantage of propofol is that it provides rapid sedation and recovery with fewer lingering sedation-related side effects and no increase in cardiopulmonary complications compared with the benzodiazepine-narcotic combination, but its use in the echocardiography lab requires scheduling coordination with anesthesiology services, and the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of this approach compared with traditional sedative agents have not been studied.

Propofol has been reported to own anti-inflammatory effects. It was revealed that propofol reversed TNF-α-induced human vascular endothelial cells apoptosis. It has also been reported that propofol exerted anti-inflammatory effects in rats. In this study, propofol inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury by inhibition of cluster of differentiation (CD) 14 and Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 expression. In recent years, the anti-inflammatory effects of propofol in CNS attract widespread concerns. For example, it has been reported that propofol inhibited TNF-α-induced apoptosis in mouse hippocampal HT22 cells. A study also revealed that propofol inhibited the inflammation and apoptosis of mouse microglia BV2 cells. Here, we wondered if propofol attenuated the effect of TNF-α on the expression of occludin and ZO-1. As shown in Fig. 2, we found that the effect of TNF-α on occludin expression was markedly attenuated by 25 μM propofol, which is within clinical plasma concentration (5–50 μM) during the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. In addition, the supplementary data showed that propofol had no effect on TNF-α-modulated ZO-1 expression. Although it has been reported that propofol attenuated hypoxia-modulated ZO-1 expression in mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells. We reasoned that hypoxia and inflammation may reduce ZO-1 expression through different intracellular signaling pathway, and that propofol may have different effect on these pathways.

### Prostate cancer cell malignancy via modulation of HIF-1 α pathway with isoflurane and propofol alone and in combination [^111sbiz8]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Propofol inhibited activation of HIF-1 α induced by various stimulants

To test the effect of propofol on HIF-1 α expression, co-intervention experiments were performed with clinically relevant concentrations of propofol (≤ 4 μ g mL −1) and HIF-1 α inducers: hypoxia, CoCl 2 or isoflurane. Exposure times varied depending on the experiment performed. Cells were harvested either immediately after the co-intervention experiments (propofol and hypoxia or CoCl 2), or at different time points for propofol alone (0–24 h), or at 24 h post-anaesthetic exposure for propofol and isoflurane. In order to exclude any effects of the propofol vehicle, DMSO and intralipid controls were used in these experiments as well as the naïve control. Exposure to hypoxia significantly increased HIF-1 α protein levels when compared with the naïve control (3.14 ± 0.50 vs 1.00 of naive, P < 0.01; Figure 2A); an effect that was abrogated following co-exposure to hypoxia and propofol in a dose-dependent manner (1.38 ± 0.64-fold of naïve for propofol at 2 μ g mL −1 and 1.16 ± 0.26-fold of naïve for propofol at 4 μ g mL −1 vs 3.14 ± 0.50-fold of naïve for isoflurane alone, P < 0.01; Figure 2A). Similar results were observed for cells treated with both CoCl 2 and propofol. CoCl 2 was shown to induce HIF-1 α activation (3.33 ± 0.41 vs 1.00 of naive, P < 0.01, Figure 2B) and propofol negated this effect (1.85 ± 0.30-fold of naïve for propofol at 1 μ g mL −1, 1.15 ± 0.30-fold of naïve for propofol at 2 μ g mL −1 and 0.87 ± 0.34-fold of naïve for propofol at 4 μ g mL −1 vs 3.33 ± 0.41-fold of naïve for isoflurane alone, P < 0.01; Figure 2B). Most importantly, propofol abolished 2% isoflurane-induced HIF-1 α expression in a dose-dependent manner both when dissolved in lipid (1.95 ± 0.28-fold of naïve for propofol at 2 μ g mL −1 P = 0.04, 0.89 ± 0.59-fold of naïve for propofol at 4 μ g mL −1 and 0.82 ± 0.48-fold of naïve for propofol at 10 μ g mL −1 vs 3.12 ± 0.24-fold of naïve for isoflurane alone, P < 0.01; Figure 2C) and when dissolved in DMSO (2.25 ± 0.38-fold of naïve for propofol at 1 μ g mL −1 P = 0.048, 1.27 ± 0.35-fold of naïve for propofol at 2 μ g mL −1 and 1.11 ± 0.21-fold of naïve for propofol at 4 μ g mL −1 vs 3.01 ± 0.20-fold of naïve for isoflurane alone, P < 0.01; Figure 2D).

### Delirium in older patients given propofol or sevoflurane anaesthesia for major cancer surgery: a multicentre randomised trial [^112ZGbtq]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is a common and disturbing postoperative complication that might be ameliorated by propofol-based anaesthesia. We therefore tested the primary hypothesis that there is less delirium after propofol-based than after sevoflurane-based anaesthesia within 7 days of major cancer surgery.

Methods

This multicentre randomised trial was conducted in 14 tertiary care hospitals in China. Patients aged 65–90 yr undergoing major cancer surgery were randomised to either propofol-based anaesthesia or to sevoflurane-based anaesthesia. The primary endpoint was the incidence of delirium within 7 postoperative days.

Results

A total of 1228 subjects were enrolled and randomised, with 1195 subjects included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (mean age 71 yr; 422 [35%] women); one subject died before delirium assessment. Delirium occurred in 8.4% (50/597) of subjects given propofol-based anaesthesia vs 12.4% (74/597) of subjects given sevoflurane-based anaesthesia (relative risk 0.68 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.48–0.95]; P = 0.023; adjusted relative risk 0.59 [95% CI: 0.39–0.90]; P = 0.014). Delirium reduction mainly occurred on the first day after surgery, with a prevalence of 5.4% (32/597) with propofol anaesthesia vs 10.7% (64/597) with sevoflurane anaesthesia (relative risk 0.50 [95% CI: 0.33–0.75]; P = 0.001). Secondary endpoints, including ICU admission, postoperative duration of hospitalisation, major complications within 30 days, cognitive function at 30 days and 3 yr, and safety outcomes, did not differ significantly between groups.

Conclusions

Delirium was a third less common after propofol than sevoflurane anaesthesia in older patients having major cancer surgery. Clinicians might therefore reasonably select propofol-based anaesthesia in patients at high risk of postoperative delirium.

The anticonvulsant midazolam has been shown to be effective against both convulsant and cholinergic, soman, cyclosarin, tabun, VX, and organophosphorus pesticides) agents by enhancing the inhibitory effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid at GABA receptors and limiting excess central nervous system excitation and seizures. In the presence of atropine sulfate, the benzodiazepines, mecamylamine, flunarizine, diphenylhydantoin, clonidine, CGS 19755 and Organon 6370 studied were effective.

We also found that at anticonvulsant doses biperiden and trihexyphenidyl each significantly reversed the effects of soman on striatal levels of DOPAC and HVA, the metabolites of dopamine, and have concluded that in addition to actions on muscarinic receptors, the anticonvulsant effects of these anticholinergics in soman poisoning may be partially related to their actions on the striatal dopaminergic system. Therapy for acute OP intoxication involves pre-treatment with pyridostigmine bromide, and post-exposure treatment with atropine, an oxime, and an anticonvulsant. The benzodiazepine midazolam is used clinically as a sedative and anxiolytic, and, like other benzodiazepines, has anticonvulsant properties. In a randomized clinical trial in patients treated for seizures by paramedics, status epilepticus was terminated by the time of hospital arrival in 73.

4% of patients receiving an intramuscular midazolam injection, a significantly greater benefit compared to patients receiving intravenous lorazepam. Midazolam also had a comparable safety profile; combined with the greater ease of intramuscular injection compared to intravenous infusion, midazolam may become the preferred treatment for seizures outside of the hospital setting. RESULTS: Plasma midazolam, propofol, and fentanyl pharmacokinetics were consistent with reports of others.
