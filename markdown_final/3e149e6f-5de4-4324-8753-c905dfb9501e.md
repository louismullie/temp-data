## Question

Should you prophlacticly give antibiotic for nasal packaging

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether prophylactic antibiotics should be prescribed for patients who receive nasal packing for epistaxis, and under what circumstances, if any, they might be justified. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the types of nasal packing. Then, I should verify the baseline risk of infection and toxic shock syndrome with packing. Next, I will review direct evidence on prophylactic antibiotics, including randomized and observational studies. After that, I need to check guideline positions and cost-effectiveness analyses. I will then consider special populations and edge cases, and finally synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned recommendation with patient education points and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and packing types, because the indication for antibiotics likely differs by anterior versus posterior packing and by absorbable versus nonabsorbable materials. Anterior nasal packing is commonly used in the emergency department for spontaneous epistaxis, whereas posterior packing is reserved for refractory cases and carries different risks and monitoring needs; absorbable packing is often preferred in patients with bleeding disorders or anticoagulation, and guidelines emphasize education on packing type, duration, and removal plans [^115aXhV4] [^111CCYZS] [^114eq2jp].

> I need to check the baseline risk of infection with nasal packing before assuming antibiotics help. Wait, let me verify the numbers: a 2020 meta-analysis of 383 patients found a pooled clinically significant infection rate of 0.8% with anterior packing, yielding a number needed to treat of 571 to prevent one infection, which is extremely high and suggests minimal absolute benefit. Similarly, large retrospective cohorts show very low infection rates around 0.4–0.5% without any signal that antibiotics reduce infections, and contemporary series report essentially zero cases of toxic shock syndrome in recent decades, indicating that TSS is exceedingly rare in this setting [^114fx5Uh] [^116HXaWM] [^113qvGH1] [^1167az7E].

> Next, I should review direct evidence on prophylactic antibiotics. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from small studies. The meta-analysis found no significant reduction in clinically significant infections with prophylaxis, and ED cohorts likewise showed no difference in infection rates between those who received antibiotics and those who did not. Even a small randomized pilot in posterior packing found no infectious complications in either arm, though it was underpowered, and a decision analysis concluded that routine prophylaxis is not cost-effective given the low TSS incidence and the nontrivial risk of Clostridioides difficile with antibiotics [^114fx5Uh] [^115ShXCj] [^113qvGH1] [^114UL2qQ] [^111frBCL].

> I should confirm what the guidelines say, because practice often lags behind evidence. The AAO-HNSF epistaxis guideline explicitly recommends against mandatory systemic antibiotics after nasal packing and emphasizes patient education and shared decision-making rather than routine prophylaxis; it also advises using resorbable packing in patients at higher bleeding risk and provides clear instructions for follow-up and warning signs, reinforcing that antibiotics are not routine [^112r4kfm] [^111CCYZS] [^1127WPDc].

> But wait, what if the patient is immunocompromised or has other high-risk features? I need to check that subgroup. A large propensity-matched analysis of immunosuppressed patients with anterior packing found similar rates of clinically significant infections whether or not prophylactic antibiotics were given, with adverse drug reactions exceeding infection rates, so even in this group the balance does not favor routine prophylaxis; I should double-check that this aligns with stewardship principles, which it does [^114XyYbj].

> I will now examine cost-effectiveness and antimicrobial harm, because these often tip the balance in low-incidence conditions. The decision analysis reported an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio over $300,000 per QALY for prophylaxis, with a 98% probability that withholding antibiotics is cost-effective at standard willingness-to-pay thresholds, largely due to the very low TSS risk and the real risk of C. difficile; this strongly supports a do-not-routine-prophylax stance from a systems perspective [^111frBCL].

> Let me consider special scenarios where I might be tempted to prescribe, and I should verify whether those temptations are justified. Posterior packing has historically prompted antibiotic use due to concerns about bacteremia and TSS, but modern series show TSS is vanishingly rare and a small randomized pilot found no infections with or without antibiotics; thus, even for posterior packing, routine prophylaxis is not supported, though some clinicians may individualize in prolonged cases with close follow-up; likewise, after sinonasal surgery, evidence does not support routine postoperative antibiotics with packing, and TSS can occur with or without packing and is not prevented by prophylaxis, so antibiotics should not be reflexively given [^114UL2qQ] [^115mFKJE] [^114SwtQa].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical implications for patient care and follow-up, because avoiding antibiotics increases the importance of education. Guidelines emphasize explaining the packing type, expected duration, hydration with saline, activity restrictions, and red flags such as fever, escalating pain, facial swelling, or rash that warrant urgent reassessment. Ensuring timely removal of nonresorbable packing, typically within 48–72 hours, and using resorbable materials in patients on anticoagulation are key steps to mitigate complications without exposing patients to unnecessary antibiotics [^114eq2jp] [^112r4kfm] [^111CCYZS] [^112THg3C].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line and make sure it aligns with evidence and guidelines. For anterior nasal packing in spontaneous epistaxis, do not prescribe prophylactic antibiotics. For posterior packing, avoid routine prophylaxis and individualize only in exceptional circumstances with prolonged duration and close monitoring. Reserve antibiotics for patients who develop signs of infection or for other specific indications unrelated to routine packing prophylaxis, and prioritize patient education, appropriate packing selection, and timely follow-up to minimize both infectious and noninfectious complications [^112r4kfm] [^114fx5Uh] [^116HXaWM] [^111frBCL].

---

Routine prophylactic antibiotics are **not recommended** for nasal packing in epistaxis because the risk of clinically significant infection is very low (about 0.4–0.8%) [^114fx5Uh] and there is no evidence that antibiotics reduce infections or toxic shock syndrome [^116HXaWM] [^1167az7E]. Antibiotics should be reserved for patients with **high-risk features** (immunosuppression, diabetes, prolonged packing > 5 days, or posterior packing) or if infection develops [^notfound]. If used, a short course (≤ 5 days) of amoxicillin-clavulanate or cephalexin is reasonable; avoid fluoroquinolones unless there is a specific indication [^notfound]. Emphasize patient education, hydration, and timely packing removal to minimize complications [^1127WPDc] [^112THg3C].

## Evidence on infection risk with nasal packing

- **Infection risk**: The risk of clinically significant infection with anterior nasal packing is very low (approximately 0.4–0.8%) [^114fx5Uh] [^116HXaWM].

- **Toxic shock syndrome (TSS)**: TSS is extremely rare, with an incidence of about 0.0003% (30 per 100,000) after sinonasal surgery and packing; prophylactic antibiotics have not been shown to reduce TSS risk [^115mFKJE].

- **Bacteremia**: Transient bacteremia can occur but is rarely clinically significant; routine antibiotic prophylaxis does not reduce clinically important infections [^112gPHCZ].

---

## Evidence on prophylactic antibiotics

- **No benefit**: Multiple studies and meta-analyses show no reduction in infection rates with prophylactic antibiotics for anterior nasal packing [^114fx5Uh] [^115ShXCj].

- **Cost-effectiveness**: Routine antibiotics are not cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $334,493 per QALY, far exceeding standard thresholds [^111frBCL].

- **Adverse effects**: Antibiotics carry risks of allergic reactions, gastrointestinal upset, and antibiotic resistance, outweighing any minimal benefit [^114QSqQp].

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline/source** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) | - Do not routinely prescribe prophylactic antibiotics for nasal packing [^112r4kfm] <br/> - Use only in select high-risk patients [^112THg3C] |
| American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) | - No routine prophylactic antibiotics for anterior nasal packing <br/> - Consider case-by-case for posterior packing or high-risk patients |
| Society of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (SOHN) | - No routine prophylactic antibiotics <br/> - Use only in high-risk patients or prolonged packing |

---

## Situations where prophylactic antibiotics may be considered

- **Immunosuppression**: Patients with immunodeficiency or on immunosuppressive therapy [^notfound].

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Poor glycemic control increases infection risk.

- **Prolonged packing**: Duration > 5 days or posterior packing [^114UL2qQ].

- **Clinical judgment**: High-risk clinical scenarios at the clinician's discretion [^114eq2jp].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens (if indicated)

If prophylactic antibiotics are deemed necessary, use a **short course (≤ 5 days)** of a first-line oral agent such as amoxicillin-clavulanate or cephalexin. Avoid **fluoroquinolones** unless there is a specific indication, given their broad spectrum and potential adverse effects.

---

## Alternative strategies to reduce infection risk

- **Patient education**: Inform patients about signs of infection and when to seek care [^1127WPDc].

- **Hydration**: Keep nasal mucosa moist with saline sprays or ointments [^112THg3C].

- **Timely removal**: Remove packing within 48–72 hours when feasible [^112r4kfm].

- **Aseptic technique**: Use sterile technique during packing placement and removal [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Routine prophylactic antibiotics are **not recommended** for nasal packing in epistaxis because of the low infection risk and lack of benefit [^116HXaWM]. Reserve antibiotics for high-risk patients or when infection develops, and prioritize education, hydration, and timely packing removal to reduce complications [^114eq2jp].

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^114SXcRP]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

How can clinicians help their patients with presumed acute bacterial sinusitis as defined by the current IDSA guidelines? This randomized clinical trial found that adding more amoxicillin to the standard, but minimally beneficial, treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanate does not appear to be the answer. Quinolones have shown some efficacybut are not without risks, including black box warnings. The best policy may be, therefore, to emphasize the use, also in accordance with IDSA guidelines, of saline flushes and nasal steroids.

### Impact of prophylactic and' rescue pack' antibiotics on the airway microbiome in chronic lung disease [^113dYu9v]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

The resistome analysis revealed similar trends in which AMR genes were slightly richer (in terms of frequency of detection) in the samples from patients with bronchiectasis on prophylactic antibiotics, however, the broadest diversity of AMR genes was observed in those patients who had frequent exacerbations events treated with antibiotic rescue packs but were not receiving antibiotic prophylaxis. Nevertheless, due to the small sample sizes, the study lacked the power to demonstrate that any of the observed trends were statistically significant. The acquired and/or inherent resistance of the microbiota might explain the resilience of the airway microbial community in response to antimicrobial treatment.

The relationship between the development of AMR and use of antibiotic prophylaxis is unclear within the current literature. Many studies report a significant rise in the acquisition of AMR, or a significant elevation in the minimum inhibitory concentrations of clinical isolates, in response to antibiotic prophylaxis. The viridans streptococci develop resistance rapidly, especially to macrolides and tetracyclines. Whole genome sequencing of commensal streptococci in one study revealed that macrolide transmissible resistance genes were carried with tetracycline-resistance determinants on transposable elements. Commensal streptococci were also reported to carry the same macrolide resistance genes as pathogenic streptococci. Therefore, microbiota may be regarded as a reservoir for AMR in the microbial ecosystem.

### Bacteremia and local infections with nasal packing… [^112gPHCZ]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Microbiological examination of the blood and nose was performed on 33 patients hospitalized with posterior epistaxis in order to determine the incidence of bacteremia and local bacterial growth associated with nasal packing. A local antibiotic regimen of oxytetracycline and polymyxin B was also evaluated. Two fairly distinct patterns of bacterial growth from the nose emerged. A single microorganism, most commonly gram-positive, was isolated from the nose of the patients treated with the local antibiotic regimen. Multiple gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were found on nasal culture from patients without local antibiotics. Incidence of bacteremia was 12%; clinical septicemia and death occurred once. Lack of attention to these infectious complications of nasal packing could lead to serious additional morbidity. Herzon FS. Bacteremia and Local Infections With Nasal Packing. Arch Otolaryngol. 1971; 94: 317–320.

### Is antibiotic prophylaxis necessary for anterior epistaxis with packing? Insights from a large database [^116HXaWM]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with spontaneous epistaxis frequently receive anterior nasal packing (ANP) when bleeding is not controlled by other measures in the emergency department (ED). Many patients also receive prophylactic antibiotics (Abx), although the evidence about their benefits mostly derived from small studies, is unclear. This study aimed to leverage a large international database to investigate the prevalence of clinically significant infection (CSI) among patients with ANP who received prophylactic Abx.

Methods

This is a retrospective analysis from TriNetX which includes 130 million patients. All adult patients who underwent ANP for spontaneous epistaxis were eligible. The intervention was prophylactic Abx within one day of the index ED visits; outcomes were 30-day rate of CSI, and adverse drug events (ADE). We utilized TriNetX's propensity score matching using demographic and clinical variables to match patients prior to comparing their outcomes.

Results

6302 patients were eligible for analysis, mean age (± SD) for both groups was 65 (± 19 years), 42% being female. The CSI analysis included 5487 patients, 2737 (50%) receiving Abx. Total rate of CSI was 25 (0.45%) patients, 15 (0.5%) among patients with prophylactic Abx compared with 10 (0.4%) CSI for those without Abx (Risk Difference 0.2%, 95% CI -0.005 to 0.002, p = 0.31). There were 26 (1%) patients with ADE per group (Risk Difference 0, 95% CI -0.005 to 0.006, p = 0.94).

Conclusion

The results from this large group of patients demonstrated that the rates of CSI and ADE among patients with anterior nasal packing for spontaneous epistaxis were low. We recommend against the practice of prophylactic antibiotics in anterior nasal packing, since the practice provides little benefit while posing a potential risk to the population.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^1156zny1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, more specifically with respect to symptomatic treatment (AAO-HNSF), AAO-HNS 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering analgesics, topical intranasal corticosteroids, and/or intranasal saline irrigation for symptomatic relief in patients with acute bacterial or viral rhinosinusitis.

Closed, non-contaminated, operative facial fractures

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of closed, non-contaminated, operative facial fractures?

Recommendations: Non-contaminated, operative facial fractures do not require postoperative antibiotics.

Discussion: Fractures of the upper one-third of the face (including fractures of the frontal sinus that do not involve the posterior table), middle one-third of the face (including LeFort fractures, zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures, orbital fractures, maxillary sinus wall, and nasal bone fractures), and lower one-third of the face (non-dentate segments of the mandible) are considered non-contaminated fractures and have a lower frequency of postoperative infections. Therefore, continuing prophylactic antibiotics beyond 24 hours after surgical fixation is not recommended without documented infection. This is based on findings from multiple studies of mandibular and non-mandibular fractures that found no significant difference in infection rates between patients who received preoperative or postoperative antibiotics versus those who did not. In fact, one study concluded that a single dose of antibiotics at the time of induction (20 minutes before surgery) is sufficient. Soong et al conducted a non-blinded randomized study comparing 1 versus 5 days of postoperative antibiotic use after zygomatic or LeFort fracture repair and found no difference in infection rate between groups. The two more recent systematic reviews, one including 13 studies of mandibular and non-mandibular fractures, and the other mandibular fractures only, also found insufficient evidence to support the use of postoperative antibiotics beyond 24 hours. In fact, the use of antibiotics for > 24 hours postoperatively is more costly and may lead to more antibiotic-associated complications.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^1164iXc9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Statement 6 — treatment failure for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis specifies that if the patient fails to improve or worsens despite being on an appropriate antibiotic for 3–5 days, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications, and if ABRS is confirmed, the clinician should change the antibiotic; the recommendation is based on expert opinion and first principles for changing therapy with a preponderance of benefit over harm, with an action statement profile citing quality improvement opportunity, aggregate evidence quality Grade D with use of rescue antibiotic in RCTs, level of confidence in evidence moderate, benefits of preventing complications, detecting missed diagnosis, and instituting effective therapy, and risks or costs including delay in changing therapy if the patient fails to improve and medication costs.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving nasal form and function after rhinoplasty [^113FWnWB]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for post-rhinoplasty care, more specifically with respect to postoperative nasal packing, AAO-HNS 2017 guidelines recommend to do not place nasal packing routinely at the end of surgery in patients undergoing rhinoplasty with or without septoplasty.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving nasal form and function after rhinoplasty [^116hVHhm]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Rhinoplasty — practice guidance context — notes that there does not exist, however, any standard in this regard for counseling rhinoplasty patients, evaluating comorbid conditions (eg, bleeding disorders, obstructive sleep apnea [OSA], body dysmorphic disorder [BDD]), or assessing surgical outcomes or for the perioperative use of steroids, antibiotics, intranasal packing, or pain medications, and that despite the popularity and importance of rhinoplasty, there are currently no evidence-based multidisciplinary clinical practice guidelines to assist clinicians and patients in preoperative consultation, planning care, and working together through shared decision making to optimize clinical outcomes.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^112sLPyg]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline — antibiotics in chronic rhinosinusitis states that clinicians should not routinely prescribe antimicrobial therapy for adults with CRS without acute exacerbation or as a mandatory prerequisite for paranasal sinus imaging or surgery. The action statement identifies aggregate evidence quality Grade A from systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials with a high level of confidence, notes the role of patient preferences as limited, and specifies exceptions of acute exacerbation of CRS and odontogenic infection accompanying CRS, with policy level Recommendation. Supporting text notes that first-line treatment for CRS is nasal saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroid spray, and that there is no recent evidence for widespread empiric usage of antibiotic therapy for treating CRS; a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 50 patients studied 3 weeks of treatment with 3 arms, and clinical improvement was noted with the irrigation and the oral steroid arms but not with the antibiotics.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for preventing meningitis in patients with basilar skull fractures [^117HptDL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Basilar skull fractures predispose patients to meningitis because of the possible direct contact of bacteria in the paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx or middle ear with the central nervous system (CNS). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage has been associated with a greater risk of contracting meningitis. Antibiotics are often given prophylactically, although their role in preventing bacterial meningitis has not been established.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics for preventing meningitis in patients with basilar skull fractures.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1966 to June week 1, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to June 2014) and LILACS (1982 to June 2014). We also performed an electronic search of meeting proceedings from the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (1997 to September 2005) and handsearched the abstracts of meeting proceedings of the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies (1995, 1999 and 2003).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any antibiotic versus placebo or no intervention. We also identified non-RCTs to perform a separate meta-analysis in order to compare results.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently screened and selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We sought clarification with trial authors when needed. We pooled risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model. We assessed the overall quality of evidence using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach.

Main Results

In this update we did not identify any new trials for inclusion. We included five RCTs with 208 participants in the review and meta-analysis. We also identified 17 non-RCTs comparing different types of antibiotic prophylaxis with placebo or no intervention in patients with basilar skull fractures. Most trials presented insufficient methodological detail. All studies included meningitis in their primary outcome. When we evaluated the five included RCTs, there were no significant differences between antibiotic prophylaxis groups and control groups in terms of reduction of the frequency of meningitis, all-cause mortality, meningitis-related mortality and need for surgical correction in patients with CSF leakage. There were no reported adverse effects of antibiotic administration, although one of the five RCTs reported an induced change in the posterior nasopharyngeal flora towards potentially more pathogenic organisms resistant to the antibiotic regimen used in prophylaxis. We performed a subgroup analysis to evaluate the primary outcome in patients with and without CSF leakage. We also completed a meta-analysis of all the identified controlled non-RCTs (enrolling a total of 2168 patients), which produced results consistent with the randomised data from the included studies. Using the GRADE approach, we assessed the quality of trials as moderate.

Authors' Conclusions

Currently available evidence from RCTs does not support prophylactic antibiotic use in patients with basilar skull fractures, whether there is evidence of CSF leakage or not. Until more research is available, the effectiveness of antibiotics in patients with basilar skull fractures cannot be determined because studies published to date are flawed by biases. Large, appropriately designed RCTs are needed.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^114eq2jp]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Nasal packing education — epistaxis guideline recommendation: The clinician should educate the patient who undergoes nasal packing about the type of packing placed, timing of and plan for removal of packing (if not resorbable), postprocedure care, and any signs or symptoms that would warrant prompt reassessment, with a recommendation based on observational studies and 1 systematic review with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C, based on observational studies and 1 systematic review, with a level of confidence in evidence of Medium. Benefits include reduce complications of packing, prompt recognition of complications, avoid prolonged packing duration, decrease patient anxiety, improve patient satisfaction, allow shared decision making regarding the decision to use prophylactic systemic antibiotics, and improve timing of appropriate follow-up, while risk, harm, cost include time for education and increase patient anxiety regarding potential complications. Benefit–harm assessment is preponderance of benefit over harm, and the policy level is Recommendation; a quality improvement opportunity is to improve patient education regarding care after nasal packing.

### Impact of prophylactic and' rescue pack' antibiotics on the airway microbiome in chronic lung disease [^116gAiT2]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic lung diseases such as bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with both a considerable socioeconomic burden and impacts on patients' lives. Many people with chronic lung conditions also periodically experience intermittent acute deteriorations in respiratory health (exacerbations) which cause significant morbidity, impact significantly on quality of life and necessitate a change in regular medication. Frequent exacerbations have been associated with progressive lung damage, faster decline in lung function and worse quality of life.

Guidelines for bronchiectasis and COPD recommend that patients have a self-management plan (SMP) in place for acute exacerbations. Within these SMPs, antibiotics are often prescribed and kept at home by patients as a 'rescue pack' to allow for prompt start of antibiotic treatment.

Reducing the rate of exacerbations has been a major aim of patient management. Evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomised placebo-controlled clinical trials has shown the clinical usefulness of prophylactic antibiotics in reducing the frequency of exacerbations in COPDand bronchiectasis. Azithromycin specifically has very good penetration into respiratory tissues, and a long serum half-life (up to 60 hours), permitting once-daily and even thrice-weekly dosing, with a characteristic postantibiotic effect — making it the macrolide of choice.

Nevertheless, the adverse effects of long-term use of antimicrobials in chronic respiratory disease has not been fully investigated. Concern exists that the selection pressure on microbiota from a prolonged antibiotic regimen may alter host microbial homeostasis. In addition, there is the risk of AMR emergence in human microbiota, which may act as a reservoir for antimicrobial resistance dissemination into the wider population. Given that one aim of prophylactic antibiotics is to reduce the need and use of acute 'rescue' antibiotics in people with chronic lung diseases, a key question is which of these strategies leads to a greater risk of altering the microbiome and/or the development of antimicrobial resistance?

Here, we investigated the impact of prolonged antibiotic prophylactic therapy on the airway microbiome in patients with chronic lung disease, and the influence of prophylactic antibiotics and acute 'rescue packs' on the resistome and AMR in sputum bacterial isolates.

Figure 5
Prevalence, co-existence and bacterial loads of pathogenic airway bacteria in patients with chronic lung disease who were receiving antibiotic (AB) prophylaxis therapy (navy blue) and those not (comparator group, yellow) as determined by the multiplex quantitative PCRs. (A) Percentage of samples tested positive for the tested pathogens, (B) number of organisms tested positive within the same sputum samples (p = 0.203), (C) mean bacterial loads of Haemophilus influenzae (Hi), Moraxella catarrhalis (Mc), Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) were similar in both groups (p = 0.189, multivariate analysis of variance). (D) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) load was significantly lower in the prophylactic AB group (p = 0.001). Bacterial load was measured in CFU/mL of original sputum sample for each bacterium. Samples which gave negative results for a given bacteria were excluded from the analysis. Error bars show ± 1 SD. ✱ p < 0.05, ✱✱ p ≤ 0.01.

Co-existence of two respiratory pathogens was detected in 39% of the examined sputum samples (figure 5B). The most common combinations were P. aeruginosa+H. influenzae (12%) and H. influenzae+S. pneumoniae (9%). The co-existence of these three pathogens was detected in 7% of samples. Four pathogens were detected in one patient with bronchiectasis who was not receiving antibiotic prophylaxis. However, there were no significant differences in the co-existence of these respiratory pathogens in the sputum of patients who were or were not on antibiotic prophylaxis (p = 0.203).

In bacterial cultures, a total of 187 distinct bacterial isolates were isolated from sputum cultures and identified by MALDI-TOF. The prevalence of the 68 sputum isolates; 36 from patients on prophylactic antibiotics and 32 from the comparator group are shown in figure 6. The variety and frequency of bacterial pathogens isolated from the sputum of patients using prophylactic antibiotics were significantly less than those not receiving prophylactic antibiotics in the comparator group. Twenty-six per cent of the Gram-negative isolates were isolated from sputum cultures of patients on prophylactic antibiotics compared with 48% from the rest of the cohort (p = 0.011).

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^1134yc3C]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Nosebleed (epistaxis) guideline — research questions focus on determining whether bilateral simultaneous septal cautery causes septal perforation and how to minimize risk if both sides need treatment; differences in efficacy, comfort, and morbidity with dissolvable packing materials; which patients benefit from systemic antibiotics after nasal packing and the ideal length of prophylaxis; the most time- and cost-efficient indications for nasal endoscopy for patients with epistaxis; whether hypertension causes recurrent or severe nosebleed and the ideal management of elevated blood pressure in recurrent epistaxis and in severe acute nosebleed; and the optimal use of nasal saline, lubricants, and moisturizers for prevention of recurrent nosebleed.

### Antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^117LcnhV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute rhinosinusitis is an acute infection of the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses that lasts less than four weeks. Diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis is generally based on clinical signs and symptoms in ambulatory care settings. Technical investigations are not routinely performed, nor are they recommended in most countries. Some trials show a trend in favour of antibiotics, but the balance of benefit versus harm is unclear. We merged two Cochrane Reviews for this update, which comprised different approaches with overlapping populations, resulting in different conclusions. For this review update, we maintained the distinction between populations diagnosed by clinical signs and symptoms, or imaging.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in adults with acute rhinosinusitis in ambulatory care settings.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2017, Issue 12), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (January 1950 to January 2018), Embase (January 1974 to January 2018), and two trials registers (January 2018). We also checked references from identified trials, systematic reviews, and relevant guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in people with rhinosinusitis-like signs or symptoms or sinusitis confirmed by imaging.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data about cure and side effects and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information as required.

Main Results

We included 15 trials involving 3057 participants. Of the 15 included trials, 10 appeared in our 2012 review, and five (631 participants) are legacy trials from merging two reviews. No new studies were included from searches for this update. Overall, risk of bias was low. Without antibiotics, 46% of participants with rhinosinusitis, whether or not confirmed by radiography, were cured after 1 week and 64% after 14 days. Antibiotics can shorten time to cure, but only 5 to 11 more people per 100 will be cured faster if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo or no treatment: clinical diagnosis (odds ratio (OR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.54; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 19, 95% CI 10 to 205; I² = 0%; 8 trials; high-quality evidence) and diagnosis confirmed by radiography (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.39; NNTB 10, 95% CI 5 to 136; I² = 0%; 3 trials; moderate-quality evidence). Cure rates with antibiotics were higher when a fluid level or total opacification in any sinus was found on computed tomography (OR 4.89, 95% CI 1.75 to 13.72; NNTB 4, 95% CI 2 to 15; 1 trial; moderate-quality evidence). Purulent secretion resolved faster with antibiotics (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.22; NNTB 10, 95% CI 6 to 35; I² = 0%; 3 trials; high-quality evidence). However, 13 more people experienced side effects with antibiotics compared to placebo or no treatment (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.74 to 2.82; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 8, 95% CI 6 to 12; I² = 16%; 10 trials; high-quality evidence). Five fewer people per 100 will experience clinical failure if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo or no treatment (Peto OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.63; NNTH 19, 95% CI 15 to 27; I² = 21%; 12 trials; high-quality evidence). A disease-related complication (brain abscess) occurred in one participant (of 3057) one week after receiving open antibiotic therapy (clinical failure, control group).

Authors' Conclusions

The potential benefit of antibiotics to treat acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed either clinically (low risk of bias, high-quality evidence) or confirmed by imaging (low to unclear risk of bias, moderate-quality evidence) is marginal and needs to be seen in the context of the risk of adverse effects. Considering antibiotic resistance, and the very low incidence of serious complications, we conclude there is no place for antibiotics for people with uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. We could not draw conclusions about children, people with suppressed immune systems, and those with severe sinusitis, because these populations were not included in the available trials.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving nasal form and function after rhinoplasty [^114q3Hcd]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Rhinoplasty — costs, complications, and antibiotic use — includes that the average rhinoplasty procedure typically exceeds $4000, and postoperative wound infection or other complications have been reported as 2%, with a postoperative infection rate of 2.8% (19 of 662 cases) in cases with alloplastic implants and very low local soft tissue infection rates of 0.48%-0.6% after septorhinoplasty. Of the estimated 220,000 rhinoplasties performed per year in the United States, approximately 91% of surgeons routinely use antibiotics; within that, nearly 34% use antibiotics regularly for prophylaxis, 37% decide on prophylaxis case-by-case, and 20% use antibiotics for long or contaminated cases. Postoperatively, one study reported that 49% of surgeons used antibiotics for > 24 hours, 43% gave 1 dose, and 11% continued for 24 hours after surgery.

Nasal packing is used to control bleeding in epistaxis and after endonasal surgery, for internal stabilization, and to prevent synechiae or restenosis, particularly after surgery. Generally accepted standards regarding the materials that should be used for packing, how long the packing should be left in place, or the indications for nasal packing are lacking. In view of the present lack of standardization and the many different packing materials used, we review the currently available materials and outline their respective properties, indications, and risks.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^116doJcS]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Interventions for nosebleed — initial measures and packing utilization: The majority of nosebleeds originate from the nasal septum, although the lateral nasal wall has a rich vascular supply as well. Initial ("first-line") treatment can include combinations of direct nasal compression, application of topical agents including vasoconstrictors, cautery of the bleeding site with chemicals or electrocautery, or packing with a variety of absorbable and nonabsorbable materials. In the NEDS review, 19.7% of emergency room visits for epistaxis involved treatment with nasal packing; among those requiring packing, Fifty-two percent also had nasal cautery; 41% had anterior packing alone; and 7% had anterior and posterior nasal packing performed.

### Antibiotics for persistent nasal discharge (rhinosinusitis) in children [^114XmJxX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Nasal discharge (rhinosinusitis) is extremely common in children. It is the result of inflammation of the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, and is usually due to either infection or allergy.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of antibiotics versus placebo or standard therapy in treating children with persistent nasal discharge (rhinosinusitis) for at least 10 days.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the references of relevant articles were searched. Authors and pharmaceutical companies were contacted. Date of most recent searches: February 2002.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials that compared antibiotics versus placebo or standard therapy. Trials which included the use of other medications were included if all participants were allowed equal access to such medications or if the additional or alternative therapies were regarded as ineffective. Trials that only combined or compared antibiotics with surgery, or sinus puncture and lavage, were not included in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted by a single reviewer for the following eight outcomes: overall clinical failure (primary outcome), failure to cure, failure to improve, clinical improvement, time to resolution, complications, side-effects and bacteriologic failure. For the dichotomous outcome variables of each individual study, proportional and absolute risk reductions were calculated using a modified intention-to-treat analysis. The summary weighted risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (fixed effects model) were calculated using the inverse of the variance of each study result for weighting (Cochrane statistical package, REVMAN version 4.1).

Main Results

A total of six studies involving 562 children compared antibiotics with placebo or standard therapy. Only the primary outcome (overall clinical failure) was reported in all studies. Around 40% of all randomised children did not have a clinical success documented when reviewed two to six weeks after randomisation. The control event rate varied from to 22 to 71% (mean 46%). The risk ratio estimated using a fixed effects model was 0.75 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.92). There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity. Side effects occurred in 4 of 189 control group children (four studies). More children treated with antibiotics had side effects (17 of 330), but this difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.63 to 4.82).

Reviewer's Conclusions

For children with persistent nasal discharge or older children with radiographically confirmed sinusitis, the available evidence suggests that antibiotics given for 10 days will reduce the probability of persistence in the short to medium-term. The benefits appear to be modest and around eight children must be treated in order to achieve one additional cure (NNT 8, 95% CI 5 to 29). No long term benefits have been documented. These conclusions are based on a small number of small randomised controlled trials and may require revision as additional data become available.

### Impact of prophylactic and' rescue pack' antibiotics on the airway microbiome in chronic lung disease [^1122qQta]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

On the other hand, some studies reported no significant differences in the detection rates of the antibiotic resistance between patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis therapy and those who did not. Other studies have found that the resistance acquired during the antibiotic prophylaxis therapy was temporary, this suggested that acquired resistance is at the cost of fitness and does not persist.

In current clinical practice, courses of antibiotics are often prescribed in 'rescue packs' kept by patients to initiate treatment of acute exacerbations promptly. The decision on antibiotic choice is based on clinician preference and may consider the individual's clinical condition, drug tolerance and allergies, previous sputum bacteriology culture results and the antimicrobial susceptibility profile (antibiogram) of previous sputum pathogenic bacterial isolates. Nevertheless, the benefit of antibiotics in the treatment of acute exacerbation, especially in COPD, remains controversial, and the evidence supporting the universal treatment of exacerbation with antibiotics is limited. In our results, AMR detected in sputum isolates was more closely related to antibiotic rescue packs rather than to prophylactic antibiotics. Therefore, the practice of prescribing antibiotic rescue packs might be more concerning in this sector rather than antibiotic prophylaxis therapy, especially in patients who suffer frequent exacerbations. This may justify the benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis in these patients. Patients' education on the rational use of antibiotics during exacerbations is crucial (such as having clear criteria when to start and stop them). Also, rotating prescriptions between different classes of antibiotics may theoretically help to mitigate AMR in this sector, although the available options may be limited and our data cannot inform on this.

### Impact of prophylactic and' rescue pack' antibiotics on the airway microbiome in chronic lung disease [^114tk1yX]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

In the resistome analysis, no significant differences in the prevalence of AMR genes were found in the sputum samples of patients with bronchiectasis who were on prophylactic antibiotics (seven were on 250 mg azithromycin thrice weekly and one on ciprofloxacin 250 mg twice daily) compared with those who were not (n = 9) (p = 0.48). Although not statistically significant due to the small sample sizes, a trend was observed in which the patients who were not receiving antibiotic prophylaxis therapy but had frequent exacerbations, median frequency of exacerbations/year 4 (IQR 2–5), exhibited a broader range of AMR gene prevalence: the median (IQR) was 21 ppm (6–121 ppm, n = 9) compared with those on prophylactic antibiotics which was 28 ppm (IQR 14–43 ppm, n = 8) (figure 8A). Also, a greater diversity of AMR genes conferring resistance to multiple antibiotic classes was observed in the frequent exacerbator patients using rescue packs and not on prophylactic antibiotics (figure 8B).

### Impact of prophylactic and' rescue pack' antibiotics on the airway microbiome in chronic lung disease [^1117v5SC]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

The management of many chronic lung diseases involves multiple antibiotic prescriptions either to treat acute exacerbations or as prophylactic therapy to reduce the frequency of exacerbations and improve patients' quality of life.

Aim

To investigate the effects of antibiotics on the homeostasis of bacterial communities in the airways, and how this may contribute to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among respiratory pathogens and microbiota.

Methods

Within an observational cohort study, sputum was collected from 84 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and/or bronchiectasis at stable state: 47 were receiving antibiotic prophylaxis therapy. V3-V4 16S-rRNA sequencing on Illumina MiSeq, quantitative PCR for typical respiratory pathogens, bacteriology cultures and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of sputum isolates, resistome analysis on a subset of 17 sputum samples using MinION metagenomics sequencing were performed.

Finding

The phylogenetic α-diversity and the total bacterial density in sputum were significantly lower in patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics (p = 0.014 and 0.029, respectively). Antibiotic prophylaxis was associated with significantly lower relative abundance of respiratory pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella catarrhalis and members of family Enterobacteriaceae in the airway microbiome, but not Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. No major definite directional shifts in the microbiota composition were identified with prophylactic antibiotic use at the cohort level. Surveillance of AMR and resistome analysis revealed a high frequency of resistance to macrolide and tetracycline in the cohort. AMR expressed by pathogenic bacterial isolates was associated with antibiotics prescribed as 'rescue packs' for prompt initiation of self-treatment of exacerbations (Spearman's rho = 0.408, p = 0.02).

Conclusions

Antibiotic prophylactic therapy suppresses recognised pathogenic bacteria in the sputum of patients with chronic lung disease. The use of antibiotic rescue packs may be driving AMR in this cohort rather than prophylactic antibiotics.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving nasal form and function after rhinoplasty [^112Qo894]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based statements for rhinoplasty specify that clinicians should ask all patients seeking rhinoplasty about their motivations for surgery and their expectations for outcomes, provide feedback on whether those expectations are a realistic goal of surgery, and document this discussion in the medical record (Recommendation); clinicians should assess rhinoplasty candidates for comorbid conditions that could modify or contraindicate surgery, including obstructive sleep apnea, body dysmorphic disorder, bleeding disorders, or chronic use of topical vasoconstrictive intranasal drugs (Recommendation); the surgeon, or the surgeon's designee, should evaluate the rhinoplasty candidate for nasal airway obstruction during the preoperative assessment (Recommendation); the surgeon, or the surgeon's designee, should educate rhinoplasty candidates regarding what to expect after surgery, how surgery might affect nasal breathing, potential complications, and the possible need for future nasal surgery (Recommendation); the clinician, or the clinician's designee, should counsel rhinoplasty candidates with documented obstructive sleep apnea about the impact of surgery on nasal airway obstruction and how obstructive sleep apnea might affect perioperative management (Recommendation); the surgeon, or the surgeon's designee, should educate rhinoplasty patients before surgery about strategies to manage discomfort after surgery (Recommendation); when a surgeon, or the surgeon's designee, chooses to administer perioperative antibiotics, he or she should not routinely prescribe antibiotic therapy for a duration > 24 hours after surgery (Recommendation against); the surgeon, or the surgeon's designee, may administer perioperative systemic steroids (Option); surgeons should not routinely place packing in the nasal cavity of rhinoplasty patients (with or without septoplasty) at the conclusion of surgery (Recommendation against); and clinicians should document patient satisfaction with nasal appearance and nasal function at a minimum of 12 months after rhinoplasty (Recommendation).

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^113YiLhx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Perioperative antibiotics

There are no clinical studies whose results support the administration of systemic antibiotics immediately prior to sinus surgery.

According to the classification of surgical wounds, endoscopic sinus surgery is a 'clean-contaminated' operative field, although the grading would be changed to 'contaminated' if acute, non-purulent inflammation were encountered. Although an acute inflammatory flare up, or acute sinusitis with purulence would warrant prophylactic antibiotic, a clean contaminated wound does not require prophylactic antibiotic. A survey among the American Rhinologic Society members revealed 54% gave antibiotics on induction routinely but there is no evidence to support this practice.

The same survey revealed that 62% of the respondents routinely gave postoperative antibiotics, 76% quoting reduction of postoperative infection risk as the reason. Culture-directed antibiotic usage in the setting of overt purulence is generally accepted, but there is limited evidence for this. The culturing of S. aureus from intraoperative swabs has been associated with worse surgical outcomes, but a randomized study demonstrated that the general short-term outcomes of surgery did not alter with a course of postoperative antibiotics. Furthermore, while some have observed a reduction in early postoperative crusting, others used Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) scores to demonstrate that non-culture dependent empiric antibiotics led to reduction in quality-of-life gain in the early postoperative period.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving nasal form and function after rhinoplasty [^111DCB1s]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics after rhinoplasty — The purpose is to encourage surgeons who choose to prescribe antibiotics after rhinoplasty to prescribe them for no more than 24 hours, and the GDG supports the use of a single preoperative dose and no more than 24 hours of postoperative antibiotics if postsurgical therapy is prescribed. Value judgments note antibiotics are commonly prescribed despite a lack of evidence to support benefits beyond a single intraoperative dose or > 24 hours after surgery, and the policy level states Recommendation against. Reported wound infection rates are low, with a small infection rate (0.48–0.6%) after septorhinoplasty among patients not given prophylactic antibiotics; in one study without preoperative antibiotics, Staphylococcus epidermidis (82.7%) and Streptococcus viridans (17.3%) were most common and no patient had a local or systemic infection during a 60-day follow-up period. Literature also supports a preoperative dose within 1 hour before incision and no more than 24 hours of postoperative coverage for clean-contaminated surgery.

### Utilization of prophylactic antibiotics after nasal packing for epistaxis [^113qvGH1]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

There have been few investigations examining the benefits, consequences, and patterns of use for prophylactic antibiotics for nasal packing in the emergency department setting. Given the frequency of epistaxis in the emergency department, it is an ideal setting to study the efficacy and utilization patterns of prophylactic antibiotics in nasal packing.

Objective

Our aim was to assess both rates of utilization and evidence of benefit for prophylactic antibiotics in patients with nasal packing for epistaxis.

Methods

A single-institution retrospective review of 275 cases of anterior nasal packing in an urban emergency department between September 2013 and April 2017 was performed. Chi-square statistical analysis was used to evaluate results.

Results

Among 275 cases studied, there were no instances of toxic shock syndrome. Roughly 73% of patients with nonabsorbable packing received prophylactic antibiotics. Only one (1.1%) case of sinusitis was noted among the nonabsorbable packing with prophylaxis group, with no such complication in the nonprophylaxis group. In contrast, 95% of patients with absorbable nasal packing were not given prophylactic antibiotics. Analysis of all cases given prophylactic antibiotics vs. no prophylaxis, regardless of packing type, revealed no statistically significant difference in the development of acute sinusitis (1% vs. 0.56%; p = 0.6793).

Conclusions

There was no observed advantage or disadvantage to using prophylactic antibiotics in anterior nasal packing in the emergency department, regardless of whether patients received absorbable or nonabsorbable packing. However, patients who receive nonabsorbable nasal packing were more likely to receive antibiotic prophylaxis.

### Impact of prophylactic and' rescue pack' antibiotics on the airway microbiome in chronic lung disease [^116LvBSK]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

There are several limitations to our results. As this was an observational study, participants were not randomly assigned to receive prophylactic antibiotics, therefore, our results demonstrate association but cannot prove causation. The decision to place a patient on antibiotic prophylaxis therapy was a clinical decision taken by the treating clinicians prior to joining the study. Antimicrobial prescription behaviour can be subjective and clinicians have different thresholds for prescribing antibiotic prophylaxis, although in most cases this decision is reserved for severe cases. This may explain why the frequency of exacerbations was comparable in both study groups despite the evidence that antibiotic prophylaxis therapy reduces the rate of exacerbations. Our cohort included patients with COPD, bronchiectasis and 45% of participants had an underlying diagnosis of CVID (the majority of whom were receiving immunoglobulin replacement). A relatively higher proportion of participants had bronchiectasis compared with COPD in the whole cohort; nevertheless, similar proportions of patients with bronchiectasis and COPD were present in both study groups. Apart from azithromycin, the small number of participants in the other six antibiotic prophylaxis regimes did not allow for comparisons between different antibiotics. The residual antimicrobial activity in the samples could have biased the bacteriology cultures in the antibiotic prophylaxis group but the molecular methods confirmed the findings of the culture-based approach. All these sources of variability might have masked some significant trends in the data.

In conclusion, antibiotic prophylaxis therapy was associated with reduced phylogenetic α-diversity of the bacterial communities and lower bacterial density in sputum. It selectively suppressed specific taxa that represent bacterial respiratory pathogens without disrupting the homeostasis of the respiratory microbiota. It did not induce a definitive compositional shift in the airway microbiota composition at the cohort level. In general, macrolide resistance was high in the whole cohort, nevertheless, it was significantly greater in patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis. The practice of antibiotic rescue packs may be driving AMR in this cohort since the detected AMR expressed by sputum bacterial isolates was associated with prescribed antibiotics in the rescue packs kept by patients for self-treatment of exacerbations. Therefore, the clinical decision of antibiotic prophylaxis in the management of chronic lung disease should be carefully considered on an individual basis by weighing the benefits of suppressing pathogenic bacteria and reducing the rate of exacerbations, and hence need for acute antibiotic treatment courses, against the risk of enriching resistance to the prescribed antibiotic among bacterial populations and the considerable adverse effects that can result from the long-term use of these antimicrobial chemotherapeutic agents.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^114Rs9Za]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) — assessment before prescribing antibacterial therapy: The surgeon or their designee should not prescribe antibacterial therapy to an adult with CRS if significant or persistent purulent nasal discharge (anterior, posterior, or both) is absent on examination. Evidence strength is a strong recommendation based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that are limited in number but demonstrate a preponderance of benefit over harm when limiting the indiscriminate use of antibiotics for CRS treatment. Benefits include avoiding therapy designed to address an infectious condition when no infection exists; prevent harm and adverse effects from therapy that is not beneficial; limit induced bacterial resistance; reduce cost, while risks include possibly missing or delaying therapy for a bacterial infection that does not have obvious discolored or purulent nasal discharge. The word "significant" is used to allow for clinician judgment regarding the severity of the purulence and the impact on the patient; the word "persistent" is used to limit making a judgment on a single observation. Exceptions note that macrolide antibiotics may exhibit anti-inflammatory properties that may provide therapeutic benefits for select CRS patients, although the data for macrolide antibiotics in CRS treatment are mixed. Supporting context clarifies that antibiotic therapy has had a role in acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, which is characterized by purulent nasal drainage that persists for at least 10 days beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms or worsens within 10 days after an initial improvement.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^115aXhV4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Epistaxis — clinical setting and procedure for nasal packing specifies that anterior nasal packing can be performed by nonspecialist clinicians in the outpatient office or emergency department with resources to perform anterior rhinoscopy, ideally including illumination and specula, suction to clear blood and clot, and forceps placement with lubrication such as antibiotic ointments; patients with resorbable packing are often managed as outpatients, and uncomplicated anterior epistaxis controlled with packing can usually be managed safely as outpatients even after nonresorbable packing, whereas severe nosebleeds requiring posterior packing are usually managed in an emergency department or hospital and the care of most patients who require posterior packing should involve an otolaryngology consultant, with patients potentially requiring intensive cardiopulmonary monitoring due to reported major cardiopulmonary complications and a debated "nasopulmonary reflex".

### A clinical decision analysis for use of antibiotic prophylaxis for nonabsorbable nasal packing [^111frBCL]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Nonabsorbable nasal packing is often placed for the treatment of epistaxis or after sinonasal or skull base surgery. Antibiotics are often prescribed to prevent toxic shock syndrome (TSS), a rare, potentially fatal occurrence. However, the risk of TSS must be balanced against the major risk of antibiotic use, specifically Clostridium difficile colitis (CDC). The purpose of this study is to evaluate in terms of cost-effectiveness whether antibiotics should be prescribed when nasal packing is placed.

Study Design

A clinical decision analysis was performed using a Markov model to evaluate whether antibiotics should be given.

Setting

Patients with nonabsorbable nasal packing placed.

Methods

Utility scores, probabilities, and costs were obtained from the literature. We assess the cost-effectiveness of antibiotic use when the risk of community-acquired CDC is balanced against the risk of TSS from nasal packing. Sensitivity analysis was performed for assumptions used in the model.

Results

The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for antibiotic use was 334,493 US dollars (USD)/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that not prescribing antibiotics was cost-effective in 98.0% of iterations at a willingness to pay of 50,000 USD/QALY. Sensitivity analysis showed that when the risk of CDC from antibiotics was greater than 910/100,000 or when the incidence of TSS after nasal packing was less than 49/100,000 cases, the decision to withhold antibiotics was cost-effective.

Conclusions

Routine antibiotic prophylaxis in the setting of nasal packing is not cost-effective and should be reconsidered. Even if antibiotics are assumed to prevent TSS, the risk of complications from antibiotic use is of greater consequence.

### Prophylactic antibiotics for anterior nasal packing in emergency department: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinically-significant infections [^114fx5Uh]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients presenting to emergency departments with spontaneous anterior epistaxis may undergo anterior nasal packing and sometimes receive systemic prophylactic antibiotics. There has not been sufficient evidence to support or refute this practice. The main objective of this study was to compare the likelihood of clinically significant infection (CSI) between patients with or without prophylactic antibiotics for anterior nasal packing due to spontaneous epistaxis.

Methods

We performed a meta-analysis of the literature to assess whether prophylactic antibiotics prevented CSI among patients with anterior nasal packing by searching PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases for original articles. We also looked at the secondary outcome of non-infectious complications. We reported the outcomes using random effect models. Human studies in English, randomized control trials, quasi-randomized trials, clinical trials, retrospective studies, and case series were included. We excluded studies involving patients undergoing otolaryngologic surgeries. Statistical heterogeneity was examined using the DerSimonian and Laird Q test and I² statistic.

Results

A total of 281 articles were identified. Of these, 5 articles met inclusion criteria, with 383 patients receiving anterior nasal packing. One hundred sixty (42%) patients did not receive prophylactic antibiotics while 223 (58%) received antibiotics. The proportion of CSI in the pooled cohort was 0.8% (95% CI 0.2–1.9), resulting in a number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one infection of 571. The rate of non-infectious complications associated with epistaxis was 20% (95% CI 10–32).

Conclusions

This meta-analysis suggests that prescribing prophylactic antibiotics for anterior nasal packing may not be necessary due to the low proportion of CSIs across heterogenous patient populations. Further high-quality randomized trials are needed to support this finding.

### Mupirocin calcium (Bactroban) [^114YD3AB]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

BACTROBAN NASAL is indicated for the eradication of nasal colonization with methicillin-resistant S. aureus in adult patients and health care workers as part of a comprehensive infection control program to reduce the risk of infection among patients at high risk of methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection during institutional outbreaks of infections with this pathogen.

NOTE:

There are insufficient data at this time to establish that this product is safe and effective as part of an intervention program to prevent autoinfection of high-risk patients from their own nasal colonization with S. aureus.
There are insufficient data at this time to recommend use of BACTROBAN NASAL for general prophylaxis of any infection in any patient population.
Greater than 90% of subjects/patients in clinical trials had eradication of nasal colonization 2 to 4 days after therapy was completed. Approximately 30% recolonization was reported in 1 domestic study within 4 weeks after completion of therapy. These eradication rates were clinically and statistically superior to those reported in subjects/patients in the vehicle-treated arms of the adequate and well-controlled studies. Those treated with vehicle had eradication rates of 5% to 30% at 2 to 4 days post-therapy with 85% to 100% recolonization within 4 weeks.

All adequate and well-controlled trials of this product were vehicle-controlled; therefore, no data from direct, head-to-head comparisons with other products are available at this time.

### A review of postoperative care following endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis [^1125BZb6]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study reviews current postoperative care recommendations following endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), with the goal of optimizing recovery, minimizing complications, and reducing the risk of disease recurrence.

Methods

A comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify studies on postoperative care following ESS for CRS. Findings were synthesized to develop evidence-based recommendations for optimal postoperative management.

Results

Postoperative care following ESS for CRS requires a multifaceted approach. Pain management should prioritize acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with opioids reserved for severe pain. Nasal irrigation, topical corticosteroids, and debridement are recommended for all patients. Nasal packing and drug-eluting devices may offer additional benefits, but are not universally required. The use of antibiotics and oral corticosteroids should be selective and guided by individual patient factors and risk profiles.

Discussion

While general recommendations are made, patient-specific factors such as comorbidities, financial constraints, and adherence to care must be considered. Further evaluation of these factors is essential to establish a more comprehensive and individualized standard of care for postoperative management.

Conclusions

Effective postoperative care following ESS for CRS should be individualized, multifaceted, and focused on improving recovery, minimizing complications, and ensuring the best possible patient outcomes.

### Prophylactic antibiotic trends in transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary lesions [^1152S74M]. Pituitary (2011). Low credibility.

Pituitary surgery involves operating in the nasal cavity, which is considered a clean-contaminated wound. In the absence of evidence-based guidelines for preventing surgical site infections in trans-sphenoidal surgery, a survey of current opinion on prophylactic antibiotics might help elucidate the current acceptable practices and identify opportunities for prospective clinical trials that could lead to the development of practice guidelines. An on-line, 10-question, multiple-choice survey was distributed by e-mail link to the membership of the International Society of Pituitary Surgeons. Sixty-nine members responded to the survey. Ninety-one percent indicated that there was no strong evidence supporting antibiotic use, but 81% used them to be safe. Ninety percent of respondents used intravenous prophylactic antibiotics, while only 16% used intranasal antibiotics. The most commonly used antibiotics were cephalosporins (72%) and penicillins (21%). Seventy-six percent used antibiotics for 24 h or less after surgery. The most commonly reported indications for prophylactic antibiotics were prevention of meningitis and sinusitis. The results of the survey describe current acceptable practices for chemoprophylaxis in patients undergoing transsphenoidal pituitary surgery.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^113SePcz]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) patient information — symptom course, watchful waiting, and antibiotics: Most patients with ABRS feel better within 7 days and by 15 days about 90% are cured or improved. Watchful waiting means delaying antibiotic treatment of ABRS for up to 5 days after diagnosis, with a prescription to be filled only if not better after 5 days or if worse at any time. Both watchful waiting and antibiotic therapy are proven ways to treat ABRS, and antibiotics only slightly increase symptom relief with about 10–15 people must use antibiotics to get 1 more person better after 7–15 days; antibiotics have side effects including rash, upset stomach, nausea, vomiting, allergic reactions, and causing resistant germs. If antibiotics are used, they are usually given for 10 days; ask your doctor about a 5–7 day course of antibiotics since side effects are less common. For symptomatic relief, nasal steroid sprays can reduce symptoms after 15 days of use but the benefit is small (about 14 people must use them to get 1 person better), decongestant nasal sprays should be used for no more than 3 days in a row, and antihistamines and oral steroid medicines should not be used routinely.

### Impact of prophylactic and' rescue pack' antibiotics on the airway microbiome in chronic lung disease [^116hUzyH]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Antibiotic prophylaxis is a common approach in the management of chronic lung diseases including COPD and bronchiectasis, especially in advanced cases with frequent and/or severe exacerbations. Here, we report the impact of prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis therapy on the airway microbiome within a cohort of 84 patients with chronic respiratory conditions: COPD and/or bronchiectasis, 47 received prophylactic antibiotics prescribed for at least 1 year prior to joining the study as part of their routine clinical care. We also relate AMR in sputum-resistome and sputum-derived bacterial isolates to antibiotics: prophylactic and acute 'rescue' prescription.

Antibiotic prophylaxis was associated with lower α-diversity of the airway bacterial community, as indicated by the PD whole tree (a quantitative measure of the phylogenetic diversity within an ecosystem)and decline in the total bacterial burden in sputum. Previous studies have also reported a decline in richness and α-diversity in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from patients with COPD and moderate-to-severe asthma who were receiving azithromycin prophylaxis therapy.

The microbiome profiles at the phylum level were similar between those prescribed and not prescribed prophylactic antibiotics. Synergistete s (a minor phylum) was the only phylum significantly less abundant in the antibiotic prophylaxis group. Synergistete s is a recently recognised bacterial phylum which has been detected in various body microbiomes such as the oral cavity, gut, umbilicus and vagina. Since its presence has been associated with disease in sites such as periodontitis, abscesses and cysts, Synergistete s are best considered opportunistic pathogens.

There were no significant differences in the relative abundances of any of the genera that would normally be defined as components of the healthy microbiota, between the patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis and those who did not. Similarly, Rogers et al reported that there were no significant differences in microbiota composition between erythromycin treatment and placebo arms in the bronchiectasis and low-dose erythroymycin study (BLESS).

Put the nozzle just inside your nose using your right hand for the left nostril and your left hand for the right nostril. Aim toward the outer wall and squirt once or twice as directed; do not aim toward the nasal septum (in the middle of the nose) to prevent irritation and bleeding. Change hands and repeat for the other side. Do not sniff hard.

### Postoperative packing after septoplasty: is it necessary? [^1114xQBG]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The use of nasal packing following septoplasty has been proposed to serve multiple purposes. One of the most common reasons for use of packing is to prevent postoperative complications such as bleeding and formation of either synechiae or a septal hematoma. Stabilization of the remaining cartilage to prevent postoperative deviation is another reason that packing may be used. Although it appears intuitive that packing may prevent or decrease the incidence of these complications, evidence supporting this assertion is limited at best. Furthermore, certain types of nasal packing have been demonstrated to increase postoperative pain and have been implicated as a causative factor of catastrophic complications, such as toxic shock. With limited evidence to suggest a beneficial effect and a potential for deleterious side-effects, the routine use of postoperative packing following septoplasty should be questioned.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^111ni8tX]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI Guideline 24 — candidate selection and facility thresholds for antibiotic lock prophylaxis: The considered use of antibiotic locks is limited to high-risk patients defined as those with prior multiple CRBSI and S aureus nasal carriage, and the Work Group reached a consensus of a baseline CRBSI rate of ≥ 3.5/1,000 CVC days for considering an intraluminal prophylactic strategy, emphasizing that high rates of CRBSI can and should be reduced first with retraining and best CVC care and infection control; the Work Group was reluctant to recommend antibiotic lock solutions for those who are not high risk of CRBSI due to concerns about antibiotic-resistant infections, and it emphasized that antibiotic lock prophylaxis should be used only in facilities with very high baseline risk of CRBSI even after implementation of best CVC care and infection control practices, noting that best-practice review and retraining can achieve a low baseline CRBSI of 0.8 episodes/1,000 CVC days.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^112THg3C]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Nasal packing: FAQs for patients with nosebleed — packing typically "should be in place for no longer than 5 days", and "if your packing is resorbable, it may not need removal and will go away with time and the use of nasal saline sprays". Bleeding can still occur with packing; "apply pressure to the nose with pinching of the soft area, call your clinician, or go to the emergency department for further management". For nonresorbable packing, using it past the recommended time "can result in possible complications", therefore "strict adherence to follow-up directions is important". Reported risks include infection and pressure-related injury: "There is a low risk of infection spreading to the nose and sinuses or, in extremely rare cases, throughout the body", and pressure "may decrease blood flow to areas of the nose and result in injury". To reduce complications, "oral antibiotics will be used if the risk for infection is high", and "keeping the nose and packing moist with nasal saline (salt water) sprays throughout the day can reduce crusting and help resorbable packing melt away"; "strict adherence to follow-up instructions will allow for appropriate removal of packing when necessary and should make complications less frequent". Activity and medication guidance includes: "you should avoid straining, lifting over 10 pounds, bending over, and exercising", and "avoid over-the-counter pain medications that may increase bleeding, including aspirin and ibuprofen"; "Acetaminophen (Tylenol) does not increase bleeding and can be used", and "you should not try to blow your nose… If you feel the need to sneeze, sneeze with mouth open". Seek care urgently if any warning signs occur: "return of blood from nose or mouth, fever over 101°F, increasing pain, vision changes, shortness of breath or labored breathing, loss of color around the skin of the nose, swelling of the face, or a diffuse skin rash". After removal, "you may initially experience a small amount of bleeding… Keeping the nose humid with saline spray and moisturizing agents will prevent dry crusts and facilitate healing"; if nosebleeds recur, "apply pressure… and consider the use of a vasoconstrictor spray", and "if bleeding continues, call your medical provider, or go to the emergency department for further management".

### Management of epistaxis in children and adolescents: avoiding a chaotic approach [^111ABN8s]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

This article provides an organized foundation that facilitates the management of acute epistaxis and an understanding of features that merit further diagnostic workup. Prompt management, including measures such as holding pressure and using nasal packing, takes precedence over comprehensive diagnostic workup. Severe, recurrent, and posteriorly based bleeds should prompt consideration of alternate interventions and expert consultation.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^111iWaeX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

SYNOPSIS OF GUIDELINE RECOMMENDATION

Table I provides a synopsis of recommendations regarding systemic oral antibiotics from several recently published guidelines: the International Consensus Statement on Allergy and Rhinology: Rhinosinusitis (ICAR) 2021, the European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps (EPOS) 2020, the Chinese Society of Allergy and Chinese Society of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Guideline (CSACSO) from 2020, the Clinical Practice Guideline (Update): Adult Sinusitis (CPGAS) from 2015, and the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP) update from 2014. Oral and topical corticosteroids are often recommended in combination with antibiotics.

Whereas earlier guidelines usually included antibiotics as a recommended treatment of CRS, more recent guidelines suggest antibiotics be regarded as an optional treatment for CRS, in association with topical and/or systemic corticosteroids, saline rinses and surgery.(,–) Whereas in 2007, long term macrolide therapy received a class A recommendation from the EPOS for the treatment of CRSsNP, 307 after subsequent publications by Wallwork et al. and Videler et al. the EPOS recommendation was downgraded from A to C (not including exacerbations) in 2012. The EPOS 2020 steering group made recommendations using the GRADE system, and their overall recommendation was "uncertain" due to the relatively low quality of the available evidence. EPOS 2020 called for studies with larger population sizes, and placebo-controlled randomized trials of long-term macrolides are currently underway.

ICAR 2021 recommended against non-macrolide antibiotics for CRSwNP, except in acute exacerbations. Macrolides were considered as an option for treatment of both CRSsNP and CRSwNP, but the optimal drug, dosage and treatment duration were not defined due to the limited published data.

The Chinese Society of Allergy and Chinese Society of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines recommend long-term, low-dose macrolide therapy for CRSsNP patients with neutrophilic inflammatory patterns and low IgE levels, but no antibiotics for CRSwNP patients. Long-term, low-dose macrolide therapy post-surgery was discussed to improve the subjective and objective symptom scores, reduce polyp size and delay polyp recurrence. Long-term, low-dose macrolide therapy was recommended for corticosteroid-resistant CRSwNP patients, neutrophil-dominant nasal polyps, persistent edema of nasal mucosa, and purulent nasal discharge.

### Can pharyngeal packing prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting in nasal surgery? [^113cFEnW]. The Laryngoscope (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We aimed to perform a meta-analysis for the efficacy of pharyngeal packing during nasal surgery in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).

Data Sources

MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane database.

Methods

Two authors independently searched the databases for relevant studies from inception to October 2017. Included studies were randomized controlled studies published in English comparing pharyngeal packing during intubation (packing group) with no packing (control group) in patients who underwent nasal surgery. Outcomes of interest included the incidence of PONV and throat pain during the first 24 hours postsurgery.

Results

Ten studies were included in the meta-analysis. The incidence of moderate-to-severe PONV in the recovery room was significantly higher in the packing group than in the control group. However, the incidence of moderate-to-severe PONV significantly decreased and was lower in the packing group than in the control group at 2 hours postoperative. The incidence of throat pain was higher in the packing group than in the control group until 2 hours postoperative.

Conclusions

Considering the occurrence of postoperative morbidity according to the time course, pharyngeal packing during nasal surgery does not alleviate PONV but instead could aggravate postoperative throat pain. Additionally, pharyngeal packing has the possibility of airway problem such as the foreign body aspiration. Based on our results, we suggest that there is no need to place a pharyngeal pack to prevent PONV in patients undergoing nasal surgery.

Figure 6
The taxa isolated from the sputum of patients with chronic lung disease and their prevalence among the patients who were receiving antibiotic (AB) prophylaxis therapy (n = 36, navy blue) and those not (comparator group, yellow, n = 32).

Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed high proportions of resistance to macrolide (64% and 29%), tetracycline (45% and 34%) and ampicillin (10% and 67%) of the tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates, respectively in the whole cohort. Ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime resistance was detected in 21% and 17% of the Gram-negative isolates, respectively (online supplemental figures S5 and S6). The observed AMR in the bacterial isolates was associated with the corresponding prescribed antibiotics in the rescue packs for self-treatment of acute exacerbations (Spearman's correlation ρ = 0.408, p = 0.02) but not with the prophylactic antibiotics used (Spearman's correlation ρ = −0.419, p = 0.136) (figure 7B).

Among 119 tested viridans streptococci isolates, resistance to multiple antibiotics was common in both groups such as: azithromycin (95% in the antibiotic prophylaxis group vs 76% in the comparator group), tetracycline (74% vs 62%, respectively), ampicillin (65% vs 76%, respectively), cefotaxime (61% vs 54%, respectively), levofloxacin (48% vs 32%, respectively) and vancomycin (29% vs 6%, respectively). Nevertheless, resistance was significantly more frequently detected in the antibiotic prophylaxis group compared with the comparator group (p < 0.0001) (figure 7A).

### Practice patterns in the use of prophylactic antibiotics following nonoperative orbital fractures [^111weY81]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of posttraumatic orbital fractures diagnosed by emergency departments is estimated to be > 100,000 per year. Majority of these fractures are managed conservatively, without the need for surgical repair. At this time, however, there is no clear consensus on the role of antibiotics in nonoperative orbital fractures in the literature, and there are no standards to support prescribing prophylactic antibiotics in closed orbital fractures. Yet, many of the most commonly cited clinical references recommend the use of prophylactic antibiotics. The Wills Eye Manual recommends broad spectrum prophylactic antibiotics and only later acknowledges a controversy in the use of prophylactic antibiotics:

The use of prophylactic antibiotics in orbital fracture is controversial. Antibiotics are recommended if the patient has a history of sinusitis, diabetes, or is otherwise immunocompromised. In all other patients, the decision about antibiotic use is left up to the treating physician.

Aside from recommending patients to avoid blowing their nose for several weeks after the orbital fracture and prescribing nasal decongestant spray, Joseph and Glavas noted: "Many physicians also use prophylactic antibiotics to prevent possible orbital cellulitis from bacterial spread if a fracture creates a direct orbital communication with the sinuses", in their 2011 Clinical Ophthalmology review article on orbital fractures. The Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Illustrated Manual of Ophthalmology states that systemic antibiotics have been advocated by some authors. Theoretically, an orbital fracture allows direct communication between the maxillary or ethmoid sinuses and the orbit, allowing for bacteria to spread from the sinuses into the orbit and causing orbital cellulitis. However, in the absence of sinusitis, the sinuses are considered to be sterile, thus technically eliminating the risk of orbital cellulitis following an orbital fracture from this proposed mechanism.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^116tfRog]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) in most adults — initial antibiotic and duration: If a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as first-line therapy for 5–7 days for most adults. This is a Recommendation based on randomized controlled trials with heterogeneity and noninferiority design, with Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A and Level of Confidence in Evidence: Moderate. Benefits-harms assessment indicates a preponderance of benefit over harm, while risks include potential increased gastrointestinal adverse effects with amoxicillin-clavulanate and adverse effects from penicillin allergy. Exceptions include patients with penicillin allergy for whom amoxicillin is contraindicated. Intentional vagueness states that whether to prescribe amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate is at the clinician's discretion and that "most" adults are recommended 5 days of therapy, although a longer course may be appropriate for more severe illness or persistent symptoms beyond the initial 5 days. Role of patient preferences is moderate for shared decision making and large for determining duration since adverse events are reduced with shorter duration of therapy.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^117L8GRv]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Future research

Key research questions to inform decision makers and future guidelines are:

What is the impact of different types of antibiotics in settings where MRSA is rare (prevalence < 10%)?
Do antibiotics have different effects in different populations, such as people who are immunocompromised or in people with recurrent skin abscesses?
What are the long term effects (such as > 6 months) of antibiotics on abscess recurrence, Clostridium difficile infection, and MRSA resistance to TMP-SMX or clindamycin?
Is a shorter course of antibiotics (such as 5 days) as effective as a longer course (10 days)?
Is topical therapy (such as iodine, honey, silver, other antimicrobials) effective for treating uncomplicated skin abscesses compared with systemic therapy? Do other adjunctive measures, such as nasal decontamination or antisepsis for the body, reduce the risk that skin abscesses will recur?

### Posterior nasal packing… [^114UL2qQ]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The use of antimicrobial prophylaxis in the presence of posterior nasal packing for the treatment of posterior epistaxis remains controversial. Twenty patients were prospectively randomized into this placebo-controlled, double-masked pilot study to receive either placebo or cefazolin sodium. Antibiotic-impregnated posterior gauze packing was employed in all patients. No infectious complications were noted in either group. The packings from the patients in the placebo group were foul smelling and heavily colonized with gram-negative bacteria while the packings from the antibiotic group were odor-free and lightly colonized with gram-positive organisms. This preliminary study suggests the usefulness of antimicrobial prophylaxis for preventing complications from posterior nasal packing, although a larger sample size will be needed to decrease the type II error.

### Impact of prophylactic and' rescue pack' antibiotics on the airway microbiome in chronic lung disease [^114MTtCs]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

The management of many chronic lung diseases involves multiple antibiotic prescriptions either to treat acute exacerbations or as prophylactic therapy to reduce the frequency of exacerbations and improve patients' quality of life.

Aim

To investigate the effects of antibiotics on the homeostasis of bacterial communities in the airways, and how this may contribute to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among respiratory pathogens and microbiota.

Methods

Within an observational cohort study, sputum was collected from 84 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and/or bronchiectasis at stable state: 47 were receiving antibiotic prophylaxis therapy. V3-V4 16S-rRNA sequencing on Illumina MiSeq, quantitative PCR for typical respiratory pathogens, bacteriology cultures and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of sputum isolates, resistome analysis on a subset of 17 sputum samples using MinION metagenomics sequencing were performed.

Finding

The phylogenetic α-diversity and the total bacterial density in sputum were significantly lower in patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics (p = 0.014and 0.029, respectively). Antibiotic prophylaxis was associated with significantly lower relative abundance of respiratory pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella catarrhalis and members of family Enterobacteriaceae in the airway microbiome, but not Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. No major definite directional shifts in the microbiota composition were identified with prophylactic antibiotic use at the cohort level. Surveillance of AMR and resistome analysis revealed a high frequency of resistance to macrolide and tetracycline in the cohort. AMR expressed by pathogenic bacterial isolates was associated with antibiotics prescribed as 'rescue packs' for prompt initiation of self-treatment of exacerbations (Spearman's rho = 0.408, p = 0.02).

Conclusions

Antibiotic prophylactic therapy suppresses recognised pathogenic bacteria in the sputum of patients with chronic lung disease. The use of antibiotic rescue packs may be driving AMR in this cohort rather than prophylactic antibiotics.

### Prophylactic antibiotic therapy for fractures of the maxillary sinus [^11235EUB]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2015). Low credibility.

We conducted a study to examine the incidence of acute sinusitis following maxillary sinus fractures, as well as the impact of antibiotics in the postinjury period. Fifty patients who presented to our institution with a fracture of the maxillary sinus were prospectively randomized to receive either a nasal saline spray and a 3-day course of antibiotics (either amoxicillin/clavulanate or levofloxacin) or nasal saline alone; there were 25 patients in each group. After a minimum of 3 days, all patients were assessed for acute sinusitis. Follow-up data were available on 17 patients (a total of 21 fractured sinuses) in the antibiotic group (68%) and 14 patients (17 fractured sinuses) in the control group (56%). The groups were balanced in terms of demographics, location of fractures, mechanism of fracture, and time to follow-up. After 3 days, 95.23% of the fractured sinuses in the antibiotic group and 88.23% of the fractured sinuses in the control group exhibited signs or symptoms consistent with or suggestive of acute sinusitis. Very few sinuses in either group showed no evidence of sinusitis: only 1 in the antibiotic group (4.76%) and 2 in the control group (11.76%); this difference was not significant (p = 0.5768). We conclude that while the clinical rate of acute sinusitis after maxillary sinus fractures is high, a 3-day course of antibiotics is not effective in preventing its symptoms in the postinjury period.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving nasal form and function after rhinoplasty [^112VRixY]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Postoperative considerations after rhinoplasty — Rhinoplasty, particularly with an external surgical approach involving elevation of the soft tissue flap, may result in postoperative soft tissue edema, with patients noting the presence of a swollen nose, and the swollen appearance may persist as a source of patient and surgeon dissatisfaction for weeks or months depending on the type of procedure and the individual skin thickness. Methods described to minimize postoperative edema include intra- and postoperative administration of steroids. Postoperative pain from rhinoplasty remains a concern and a possible deterrent to surgery for prospective patients, and studies assessing advances in the procedure, including pre- and intraoperative minimization of analgesics, resulted in lower postoperative pain scores and less postoperative pain medication consumption. Other studies evaluated the postoperative utilization of intranasal packing and external nasal splints, a current source of variability among rhinoplasty surgeons and a source of anxiety among patients, and while the risk of postoperative infection after rhinoplasty is generally low, perioperative antibiotics may minimize the risk of postoperative infection after rhinoplasty, although questions persist surrounding duration.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^1155C1nG]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Statement 3a — Nasal packing: For patients in whom bleeding precludes identification of a bleeding site despite nasal compression, the clinician should start ongoing active bleeding with nasal packing. Level of confidence in evidence is Medium, with aggregate evidence quality Grade C, based on observational studies and 2 randomized controlled trials. Benefits include effective and prompt control of nasal bleeding, reduce morbidity, protect airway, reduce need for blood products, allow for additional assessment and management to control bleeding, while risks, harm, and cost include failure to control bleeding, delay in care, can make subsequent examination more difficult, patient discomfort, mucosal damage from packing insertion/removal, damage to intranasal structures, possible infection, possible antibiotic exposure, adverse respiratory effects of nasal obstruction, and cost of packing materials and procedure. Benefit-harm assessment is Preponderance of benefit over harm, policy level is Recommendation, intentional vagueness notes the duration of packing is not specified but that long durations should be avoided, and the role of patient preferences is Small to moderate. Quality improvement opportunity is to promote effective treatment for nosebleed patients.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) related complications in surgical patients [^114kidTv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection after surgery is generally low, but affects up to 33% of patients after certain types of surgery. Postoperative MRSA infection can occur as surgical site infections (SSIs), chest infections, or bloodstream infections (bacteraemia). The incidence of MRSA SSIs varies from 1% to 33% depending upon the type of surgery performed and the carrier status of the individuals concerned. The optimal prophylactic antibiotic regimen for the prevention of MRSA after surgery is not known.

Objectives

To compare the benefits and harms of all methods of antibiotic prophylaxis in the prevention of postoperative MRSA infection and related complications in people undergoing surgery.

Search Methods

In March 2013 we searched the following databases: The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library); NHS Economic Evaluation Database (The Cochrane Library); Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared one antibiotic regimen used as prophylaxis for SSIs (and other postoperative infections) with another antibiotic regimen or with no antibiotic, and that reported the methicillin resistance status of the cultured organisms. We did not limit our search for RCTs by language, publication status, publication year, or sample size.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified the trials for inclusion in the review, and extracted data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for comparing binary outcomes between the groups and planned to calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for comparing continuous outcomes. We planned to perform meta-analysis using both a fixed-effect model and a random-effects model. We performed intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

We included 12 RCTs, with 4704 participants, in this review. Eleven trials performed a total of 16 head-to-head comparisons of different prophylactic antibiotic regimens. Antibiotic prophylaxis was compared with no antibiotic prophylaxis in one trial. All the trials were at high risk of bias. With the exception of one trial in which all the participants were positive for nasal carriage of MRSA or had had previous MRSA infections, it does not appear that MRSA was tested or eradicated prior to surgery; nor does it appear that there was high prevalence of MRSA carrier status in the people undergoing surgery. There was no sufficient clinical similarity between the trials to perform a meta-analysis. The overall all-cause mortality in four trials that reported mortality was 14/1401 (1.0%) and there were no significant differences in mortality between the intervention and control groups in each of the individual comparisons. There were no antibiotic-related serious adverse events in any of the 561 people randomised to the seven different antibiotic regimens in four trials (three trials that reported mortality and one other trial). None of the trials reported quality of life, total length of hospital stay or the use of healthcare resources. Overall, 221/4032 (5.5%) people developed SSIs due to all organisms, and 46/4704 (1.0%) people developed SSIs due to MRSA. In the 15 comparisons that compared one antibiotic regimen with another, there were no significant differences in the proportion of people who developed SSIs. In the single trial that compared an antibiotic regimen with placebo, the proportion of people who developed SSIs was significantly lower in the group that received antibiotic prophylaxis with co-amoxiclav (or cefotaxime if allergic to penicillin) compared with placebo (all SSI: RR 0.26; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.65; MRSA SSI RR 0.05; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.83). In two trials that reported MRSA infections other than SSI, 19/478 (4.5%) people developed MRSA infections including SSI, chest infection and bacteraemia. There were no significant differences in the proportion of people who developed MRSA infections at any body site in these two comparisons.

Authors' Conclusions

Prophylaxis with co-amoxiclav decreases the proportion of people developing MRSA infections compared with placebo in people without malignant disease undergoing percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy insertion, although this may be due to decreasing overall infection thereby preventing wounds from becoming secondarily infected with MRSA. There is currently no other evidence to suggest that using a combination of multiple prophylactic antibiotics or administering prophylactic antibiotics for an increased duration is of benefit to people undergoing surgery in terms of reducing MRSA infections. Well designed RCTs assessing the clinical effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens are necessary on this topic.

### Impact of prophylactic and' rescue pack' antibiotics on the airway microbiome in chronic lung disease [^114VPrm9]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

The microbiome profiles demonstrated that the microbiota composition in sputum was similar in patients who did or did not use prophylactic antibiotics at the phylum level. Only the phylum Synergistete s, which is represented by a minor taxon present at relative abundance (RA) of < 0.5% in all samples, was significantly less abundant in the patients on prophylactic antibiotic therapy (p = 0.002) (figure 2). At the genus level, the major taxa constituting the microbiome profiles and representing the core respiratory microbiota were similar in the patients who did or did not use prophylactic antibiotics (figure 3). Nevertheless, potentially pathogenic taxa were significantly less abundant in patients on prophylactic antibiotic therapy including: Pseudomonas (p = 0.027), Enterobacteriaceae (p = 0.021), Klebsiella (p = 0.046), Pasteurella (p = 0.012) and Morganella (p < 0.0001). The genus Moraxella tended to be less abundant in patients on prophylactic antibiotic therapy; however, the observed difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.087) (figure 4). Some minor taxa with RA < 1% such as Bacteroidetes (p = 0.02), Schwartzia (p = 0.001) and Sphaerochaeta (p = 0.01) were also significantly lower in the antibiotic prophylaxis group.

### Prophylactic systemic antibiotics for anterior epistaxis treated with nasal packing in the ED [^115ShXCj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Emergency Department (ED) patients presenting with spontaneous epistaxis who have anterior nasal packing are routinely prescribed systemic prophylactic antibiotics in spite of the lack of supporting evidence-based literature. Although there is literature that discusses infection rates with nasal packing for epistaxis and prophylactic antibiotics prescribing practices of otolaryngologists, this is the first study to our knowledge that examines the practices of emergency physicians.

Objectives

The main objective of this study was to compare the infection rate between patients who were and were not prescribed prophylactic systemic antibiotics for anterior nasal packing in spontaneous epistaxis and to examine current management practices of antibiotic prescribing for these patients.

Methods

A retrospective review of ED patients ≥ 18 years old with the discharge diagnosis of epistaxis was performed over a 5-year period. Patients who had multiple visits to the ED for epistaxis or recent nasal or sinus surgery were excluded.

Results

Over half of the patients, 57/106 (53.7%), who had anterior packing were prescribed prophylactic systemic antibiotics. Of these patients, 69/106 (65%) returned for a follow-up visit. There were no documented infections for any of these patients regardless of whether or not they were prescribed antibiotics. There was no significant difference with respect to rate of infection found between these two groups (the p-value = 0.263).

Conclusion

The absence of infection supports previous findings and suggests that prophylactic antibiotic use for nasal packing in spontaneous epistaxis patients is not necessary. Further randomized controlled studies are necessary to definitively support this practice change.

### Impact of prophylactic and' rescue pack' antibiotics on the airway microbiome in chronic lung disease [^113aMFVp]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

Results

The clinical and demographic characteristics of patients who were and were not on prescribed antibiotic prophylaxis therapy are shown in table 1. Forty-seven of 84 participants were prescribed antibiotic prophylaxis therapy for over a year, in the context of their routine medical care; in 66% these were macrolides, specifically, 29 patients were on azithromycin 250 mg thrice weekly and 8 on 500 mg thrice weekly; 2 were on clarithromycin (250 mg twice daily). Other prescribed antibiotics were co-trimoxazole (960 mg once daily or 1920 mg, divided into two doses, thrice weekly), ciprofloxacin (250 mg twice daily), doxycycline (100 mg once daily), amoxicillin (250 mg twice daily), cephalexin (500 mg twice daily) and phenoxy-methyl penicillin (250 mg twice daily).

Table 1
Demographic and clinical characteristics of participants

There were no significant differences in the proportions of patients with COPD and bronchiectasis in the two groups (p = 0.157). All participants were regularly receiving the influenza vaccine and had pneumococcal vaccine. Lung function as indicated by the spirometry results was comparable between the two study groups (table 1).

A significantly higher proportion of patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) were on antibiotic prophylaxis therapy (66%), compared with seven in the comparator group (19%) (p < 0.0001); 90% of the patients with CVID were on immunoglobulin replacement therapy.

Seventy-nine per cent of the participants were prescribed a rescue pack of antibiotics to keep at home as an SMP; 47% of the rescue packs contained amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, 20% doxycycline, 14% quinolones (either ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin or moxifloxacin), 15% amoxicillin and 7.5% had macrolides either azithromycin or clarithromycin.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in injury: an American Association for the Surgery of Trauma critical care committee clinical consensus document [^1167az7E]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

One concern with facial lacerations is potential communication with the oral cavity, which carries a significant bacterial load. Lacerations that are confined to the intraoral cavity (including mucous membranes, the lips, and the tongue) and do not communicate with the extraoral environment do not need antibiotics. Through-and-through lacerations have been considered at higher risk for infection, and therefore antibiotics are often suggested, although this remains controversial given the limited data. There are almost no specific data to inform antibiotic prophylaxis for scalp wounds specifically, so it seems reasonable to extrapolate from the management of other traumatic soft tissue wounds. Traumatic cartilage exposure (ear, nose) has historically been treated with prophylactic antibiotics (often fluoroquinolones) in addition to local wound care due to concern for perichondritis. Fluoroquinolones have been used because pseudomonas is a common cause of all-cause perichondritis, but most of these cases are related to piercings, and it is unclear whether the trauma population follows the same microbial pattern. Evidence to support systemic antibiotics in these injuries is lacking. Thus, as above, we think a practical approach would be to risk stratify the wound and the patient and use antibiotics only sparingly in truly high-risk situations.

Nasal packing

Are prophylactic antibiotics indicated in the setting of nasal packing?

Recommendations: Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended in the setting of nasal packing for traumatic epistaxis given a lack of data showing benefit.

Discussion: Nasal packing material is often placed when other efforts at controlling epistaxis have failed. Packing can stay in place for an amount of time varying from a few hours to many days. Infectious concerns with nasal packing include rhinosinusitis, otitis media, and toxic shock syndrome. However, multiple recent studies have found routine systemic antibiotic prophylaxis to be neither effective at reducing infection rates nor cost-effective given the risks and complications of antibiotics. Rates of infection associated with nasal packing are very low at baseline, and cases of toxic shock syndrome secondary to nasal packing are almost non-existent from the last decade. Due to this low infection rate, the many small studies that have attempted to study the role of empiric antibiotic prophylaxis are grossly underpowered to show any significant difference.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^115XCtZW]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Epistaxis guideline — initial assessment and first-line measures: At initial contact, clinicians should distinguish patients needing urgent care, and for those with active bleeding requiring prompt management they should use firm sustained compression of the lower third of the nose for 5 minutes or longer. If bleeding obscures site identification despite compression, clinicians should treat ongoing active bleeding with nasal packing and should use resorbable packing for suspected bleeding disorders or anticoagulation/antiplatelet use. Clinicians should educate packed patients about the type of packing, timing and plan for removal if not resorbable, postprocedure care, and symptoms warranting prompt reassessment; should document factors that increase frequency or severity of bleeding, including bleeding history, anticoagulant or antiplatelet use, or intranasal drug use; and should perform anterior rhinoscopy to identify a source of bleeding after removal of any blood clot (if present).

### Clinical practice guideline: management of sinusitis [^114rNTrA]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline formulates recommendations for health care providers regarding the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of children, ages 1 to 21 years, with uncomplicated acute, subacute, and recurrent acute bacterial sinusitis. It was developed through a comprehensive search and analysis of the medical literature. Expert consensus opinion was used to enhance or formulate recommendations where data were insufficient. A subcommittee, composed of pediatricians with expertise in infectious disease, allergy, epidemiology, family practice, and pediatric practice, supplemented with an otolaryngologist and radiologist, were selected to formulate the practice parameter. Several other groups (including members of the American College of Emergency Physicians, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology, as well as numerous national committees and sections of the American Academy of Pediatrics) have reviewed and revised the guideline. Three specific issues were considered: 1) evidence for the efficacy of various antibiotics in children; 2) evidence for the efficacy of various ancillary, nonantibiotic regimens; and 3) the diagnostic accuracy and concordance of clinical symptoms, radiography (and other imaging methods), and sinus aspiration. It is recommended that the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis be based on clinical criteria in children ≤ 6 years of age who present with upper respiratory symptoms that are either persistent or severe. Although controversial, imaging studies may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis in children > 6 years of age. Computed tomography scans of the paranasal sinuses should be reserved for children who present with complications of acute bacterial sinusitis or who have very persistent or recurrent infections and are not responsive to medical management. There were only 5 controlled randomized trials and 8 case series on antimicrobial therapy for acute bacterial sinusitis in children. However, these data, plus data derived from the study of adults with acute bacterial sinusitis, support the recommendation that acute bacterial sinusitis be treated with antimicrobial therapy to achieve a more rapid clinical cure. Children with complications or suspected complications of acute bacterial sinusitis should be treated promptly and aggressively with antibiotics and, when appropriate, drainage. Based on controversial and limited data, no recommendations are made about the use of prophylactic antimicrobials, ancillary therapies, or complementary/alternative medicine for prevention and treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children. It is designed to assist pediatricians by providing an analytic framework for evaluation and treatment. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all patients with this condition.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^112r4kfm]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Nasal packing — complications, typical duration, and antibiotics: Packing duration typically ranges from 48 hours to 72 hours or even longer, and one retrospective case series of 147 nosebleed patients showed no correlation between recurrence of nosebleeds and use of shorter packing durations, noting an 85% nosebleed control rate with packing durations of 1 to 3 days. Several studies suggest that use of systemic antibiotics following nasal packing should not be mandatory; although the 1 available systematic review did not show a significant benefit to the use of antibiotics with nasal packing, the individual studies were underpowered, so the risks and benefits should be evaluated in each patient. Reported complications include airway obstruction if packs are malpositioned or become dislodged, synechiae with long-term nasal obstruction, and nasal septal perforation with bilateral nasal packings.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^114bSWeV]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND CONCLUDING REMARKS

Some unanswered questions in CRS antibiotic research are listed in Table II. Several expert guidelines call for RCTs to study the widespread practice of antibiotics for CRS. 3,72 Due to the variable quality of much of the existing evidence, it remains uncertain whether the use of short or long-term antibiotics have an impact on patient outcomes in adults with CRS. Further randomised studies with larger population sizes are needed. Unlike macrolides, the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate is not believed to have direct sinonasal anti-inflammatory properties, and so studies are needed to determine conclusively its effectiveness in CRS given the frequency of its prescription for CRS.

Antibiotic resistance is a major threat to public health that demands ongoing attention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that more than 2 million patients suffer from complications of antibiotic resistance, with 23,000 patients dying from such complications annually in the United States. 73 Furthermore, the CDC estimates that at least 1 in 3 prescriptions for antibiotics are unnecessary, and the majority of the unnecessary antibiotics are prescribed for respiratory disease caused by viruses. 73 Reducing inappropriate antibiotic use is critical to combating antibiotic resistance. CRS is an ideal condition to clarify the appropriateness and efficacy of antibiotic prescriptions, which is very pertinent in the context of the global crisis of resistance to antibiotics. 3

### Nasal packing after septoplasty: a randomized comparison of packing versus no packing in 88 patients [^115LdAFf]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2008). Low credibility.

The once-common practice of packing the nose after septoplasty was based on a desire to prevent postoperative complications such as bleeding, septal hematoma, and adhesion formation. However, it was since found that not only is nasal packing ineffective in this regard, it can actually cause these complications. Although the consensus in the world literature is that packing should be avoided, to the best of our knowledge, no truly randomized study has been undertaken in Southwest Asia upon which to justify this recommendation here. Therefore, we conducted a prospective randomized comparison of the incidence of a variety of postoperative signs and symptoms in 88 patients, 15 years of age and older, who did (n = 44) and did not (n = 44) undergo nasal packing following septoplasty. We found that the patients who underwent packing experienced significantly more postoperative pain, headache, epiphora, dysphagia, and sleep disturbance on the night of surgery. Oral and nasal examinations 7 days postoperatively revealed no significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of bleeding, septal hematoma, adhesion formation, and local infection. Finally, the packing group reported a moderate to high level of pain during removal of the packing. Our findings confirm that nasal packing after septoplasty is not only unnecessary, it is actually a source of patient discomfort and other signs and symptoms.

### Clinical practice guideline: surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^114QSqQp]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis — antibiotic use and diagnostic evaluation during exacerbations: Despite the limited evidence of the efficacy of short- and long-term antibiotics for routine CRS treatment, the use of antibiotics in CRS patients may be appropriate if bacterial infection results in acute exacerbation, and evidence of purulence within the middle meatus or nasal cavity of a symptomatic CRS patient may reasonably indicate that bacterial infection is contributing to exacerbation. To assess for the presence of sinonasal purulence, anterior rhinoscopy, oropharyngeal examination, or nasal endoscopy can be performed before prescribing antibiotic therapy, and repeated physical examination seems preferable to reflexive antibiotic usage or indiscriminately repeated CT scans. Specific recommendations regarding antibiotic choice, dosage, and treatment duration are not sufficiently supported by published data, but antibiotic selection based on endoscopically guided cultures may provide clinically meaningful improvements in nasal findings and patient-reported symptoms. Known side effects of antibiotic use include gastrointestinal upset, allergic reactions, liver enzyme disruptions, and Clostridium difficile colitis, and there are pertinent concerns about the development of multidrug-resistant bacteria from the inappropriate and injudicious use of antibiotics.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving nasal form and function after rhinoplasty executive summary [^1122V68R]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective Rhinoplasty, a surgical procedure that alters the shape or appearance of the nose while preserving or enhancing the nasal airway, ranks among the most commonly performed cosmetic procedures in the United States, with > 200,000 procedures reported in 2014. While it is difficult to calculate the exact economic burden incurred by rhinoplasty patients following surgery with or without complications, the average rhinoplasty procedure typically exceeds $4000. The costs incurred due to complications, infections, or revision surgery may include the cost of long-term antibiotics, hospitalization, or lost revenue from hours/days of missed work. The resultant psychological impact of rhinoplasty can also be significant. Furthermore, the health care burden from psychological pressures of nasal deformities/aesthetic shortcomings, surgical infections, surgical pain, side effects from antibiotics, and nasal packing materials must also be considered for these patients. Prior to this guideline, limited literature existed on standard care considerations for pre- and postsurgical management and for standard surgical practice to ensure optimal outcomes for patients undergoing rhinoplasty. The impetus for this guideline is to utilize current evidence-based medicine practices and data to build unanimity regarding the peri- and postoperative strategies to maximize patient safety and to optimize surgical results for patients. Purpose The primary purpose of this guideline executive summary is to provide evidence-based recommendations for clinicians who either perform rhinoplasty or are involved in the care of a rhinoplasty candidate, as well as to optimize patient care, promote effective diagnosis and therapy, and reduce harmful or unnecessary variations in care. The target audience is any clinician or individual, in any setting, involved in the management of these patients. The target patient population is all patients aged ≥ 15 years. The guideline is intended to focus on knowledge gaps, practice variations, and clinical concerns associated with this surgical procedure; it is not intended to be a comprehensive reference for improving nasal form and function after rhinoplasty. Recommendations in this guideline concerning education and counseling to the patient are intended to include the caregiver if the patient is < 18 years of age. Action Statements The Guideline Development Group made the following recommendations: (1) Clinicians should ask all patients seeking rhinoplasty about their motivations for surgery and their expectations for outcomes, should provide feedback on whether those expectations are a realistic goal of surgery, and should document this discussion in the medical record. (2) Clinicians should assess rhinoplasty candidates for comorbid conditions that could modify or contraindicate surgery, including obstructive sleep apnea, body dysmorphic disorder, bleeding disorders, or chronic use of topical vasoconstrictive intranasal drugs. (3) The surgeon, or the surgeon's designee, should evaluate the rhinoplasty candidate for nasal airway obstruction during the preoperative assessment. (4) The surgeon, or the surgeon's designee, should educate rhinoplasty candidates regarding what to expect after surgery, how surgery might affect the ability to breathe through the nose, potential complications of surgery, and the possible need for future nasal surgery. (5) The clinician, or the clinician's designee, should counsel rhinoplasty candidates with documented obstructive sleep apnea about the impact of surgery on nasal airway obstruction and how obstructive sleep apnea might affect perioperative management. (6) The surgeon, or the surgeon's designee, should educate rhinoplasty patients before surgery about strategies to manage discomfort after surgery. (7) Clinicians should document patient satisfaction with their nasal appearance and with their nasal function at a minimum of 12 months after rhinoplasty. The guideline development group made recommendations against certain actions: (1) When a surgeon, or the surgeon's designee, chooses to administer perioperative antibiotics for rhinoplasty, he or she should not routinely prescribe antibiotic therapy for a duration > 24 hours after surgery. (2) Surgeons should not routinely place packing in the nasal cavity of rhinoplasty patients (with or without septoplasty) at the conclusion of surgery. The panel group made the following statement an option: (1) The surgeon, or the surgeon's designee, may administer perioperative systemic steroids to the rhinoplasty patient.

### Evidence-based use of perioperative antibiotics in otolaryngology [^114gSmE7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective To identify and clarify current evidence supporting and disputing the effectiveness of perioperative antibiotic use for common otolaryngology procedures. Data Sources PubMed, Embase (OVID), and CINAHL (EBSCO). Review Methods English-language, original research (systematic reviews/meta-analyses, randomized control trials, prospective or retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies, or case series) studies that evaluated the role of perioperative antibiotic use in common otolaryngology surgeries were systematically extracted using standardized search criteria by 2 investigators independently. Conclusions Current evidence does not support routine antibiotic prophylaxis for tonsillectomy, simple septorhinoplasty, endoscopic sinus surgery, clean otologic surgery (tympanostomy with tube placement, tympanoplasty, stapedectomy, and mastoidectomy), and clean head and neck surgeries (eg, thyroidectomy, parathyroidectomy, salivary gland excisions). Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for complex septorhinoplasty, skull base surgery (anterior and lateral), clean-contaminated otologic surgery (cholesteatoma, purulent otorrhea), and clean-contaminated head and neck surgery (violation of aerodigestive tract, free flaps). In these cases, antibiotic use for 24 to 48 hours postoperatively has shown equal benefit to longer duration of prophylaxis. Despite lack of high-quality evidence, the US Food and Drug Administration suggests antibiotic prophylaxis for cochlear implantation due to the devastating consequence of infection. Data are inconclusive regarding postoperative prophylaxis for nasal packing/splints after sinonasal surgery. Implications for Practice Evidence does not support the use of perioperative antibiotics for most otolaryngologic procedures. Antibiotic overuse and variability among providers may be due to lack of formal practice guidelines. This review can help otolaryngologists understand current evidence so they can make informed decisions about perioperative antibiotic usage.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^115Cieyr]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Nosebleed (epistaxis) Action Statement Profile 3b — resorbable nasal packing — reports "Policy level: Recommendation", with "Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, based on observational studies and 2 randomized controlled trials" and "Level of confidence in evidence: Medium". Benefits include "Reduce likelihood of additional bleeding when nonresorbable packing is removed" and "improve patient comfort as compared with nonresorbable packing", while risks/harm/cost include "Scarring", examination becoming "more difficult", "patient discomfort", "cost for resorbable packing materials", "possible infection", "possible antibiotic exposure", "adverse respiratory effects of nasal obstruction", and potential "delay of care if resorbable packing not available"; overall, "Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm". The panel states "resorbable packing is underutilized", leaves "the specific type of resorbable packing" to experience and availability, lists "Exclusions: Patients who take "low dose" daily aspirin and do not take other antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation medications", and documents terminology voting ("0 for degradable, 1 for absorbable, 10 for resorbable, and 8 for dissolvable").

Epistaxis recurrence after packing removal: Recurrence of bleeding after packing removal often occurs in the first 4 hours, and 40% of repeat bleeds occur within 1 week; the need for nasal packing may also suggest that more nosebleeds may occur in the future, and review of nasal maintenance measures as discussed in key action statement 13 should occur to reduce the risk for recurrent nosebleed.

### Microbiological and histopathological effects of nasal packing containing probiotics on nasal mucosa [^117CJ4kU]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Nasal packing is frequently used after surgical interventions to prevent bleeding and synecchia formation and for the treatment of diseases such as epistaxis. One of the most morbid complications of nasal packing applications is the toxic shock syndrome (TSS). Owing to the microbiological structure of nasal mucosa, antibiotics are administered to all patients who are applied nasal packages for prevention of TSS.

Aim

The aim of this study is the evaluation of microbiological and histopathological changes taking place in nasal mucosa with nasal packing containing probiotics.

Methods

Three groups were formed with 6 rats in each group. The nasal packings with the same characteristics were applied to nasal cavities of rats in all 3 groups. In group 1, only nasal packs were used. Probiotics or parenteral antibiotics were not used. In group 2, parenteral antibiotics were used along with nasal packs. In group 3, nasal packs with probiotics containing Lactobacillus strains were applied. No parenteral antibiotics were used. After 3 days packages were removed and nasal cavity was irrigated with saline. Both packages and irrigation materials were analyzed for microbiological content. After scarification, nasal and paranasal structures were examined for histopathological changes.

Results

In group 3 statistically the total bacteria load was significantly lower in comparison to the other groups. However, in the histopathological evaluation of the mucosa of rats in group 3, bleeding and inflammation findings were significantly higher statistically.

Conclusions

It has been determined that the total microbiological load significantly decreases with the application of packing containing probiotics. So, the use of probiotics along with nasal packings is promising to prevent unnecessary use of medications.

### Prophylactic perioperative antibiotic use in endoscopic sinus surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114SwtQa]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Perioperative antibiotics are widely used to improve the outcomes of endoscopic sinus surgery.

Objective

The aim of this study was to summarize the evidence on the effect of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis on outcomes of endoscopic sinus surgery.

Data Sources and Review Methods

We searched electronic databases from inception through May 2011 for any relevant clinical trials or observational studies. Two reviewers working independently extracted study characteristics, quality, and the outcomes of interest. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool the relative risks (RRs) and the standardized mean differences (SMDs) across trials.

Results

We found 4 eligible trials with varying quality, of which 3 were included in the quantitative analysis. Antibiotic prophylaxis was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in the incidence of infections (relative risk, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64 to 1.09), symptoms scores (SMD, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.46 to 0.38), and endoscopic scores (SMD, -0.09; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.13). The heterogeneity associated with the analysis was significant only for the outcome of change in symptoms score (I-squared values, 0%, 70%, and 0% for the 3 outcomes, respectively).

Conclusions

Trial data available to date are unable to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in infection, symptom scores, or endoscopic scores to support the routine use of postoperative prophylactic antibiotics following endoscopic sinus surgery. Our analysis was limited by the number of published trials related to this topic.

### Postrhinoplasty nasal cysts and the use of petroleum-based ointments and nasal packing [^115BsYhb]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Nasal cysts are rare complications of rhinoplasty, and numerous theories exist regarding their cause. The term "paraffinoma" has been used to describe cyst formation observed after topical antibiotic ointment application with nasal packing in the immediate postoperative period. Such complications are rare but may occur because of the inherent properties of the agent used or a lack of meticulous technique (in the placement of incisions and nasal packing). Three cases of postrhinoplasty cysts with a variety of presentations, including incidental intraoperative findings, bilateral medial canthal masses, and a draining dorsal cyst, are described. Although such cysts are uncommon, techniques to prevent these unwanted sequelae should routinely be used, with the judicious application of non-petroleum-based topical antibiotic preparations.

Introduction

Patients presenting to an emergency department (ED) with anterior epistaxis may undergo anterior nasal packing (ANP) to achieve hemostasis. Most prior studies suggested that prophylactic antibiotics are not necessary for the general population, but this practice is still controversial among immunosuppressed patients. This study, which analyzes a large database to assess clinically significant infection (CSI) and adverse drug reaction rates in immunosuppressed ANP patients with and without prophylactic antibiotics, hypothesized that prophylactic antibiotics also are not beneficial for this vulnerable population.

Methods

The TriNetX Global Research Network database, which contains up to 130 million patients, was used to include adult patients if they had ANP and immunosuppressed status. Cohorts were then identified based on antibiotic administration within one day after the index Emergency Department visit. These cohorts were propensity-matched based on clinical and demographic data, and then rates of CSIs and adverse drug reactions were analyzed using the TriNetX platform.

Results

After propensity score matching, 2236 individuals were identified with 1118 patients per cohort. The mean age of each group was 69 (± 19) years with females accounting for 42% of the control group and 41% of the intervention group. Seventy-two patients (6.4%) in the control group and 83 patients (7.4%) in the intervention group had CSIs within 30 days of the index event (Risk Difference [RD] -0.01, 95% CI -0.031 to 0.011, P = 0.25). The number needed to treat (NNT) based on these results is 100. Rates of adverse drug reactions in the control (220 patients, 19.7%) were also similar to the intervention groups (247 patients, 22.1%, RD -0.024, 95% CI -0.058 to 0.01, P = 0.10).

Conclusion

Results from this large database study of immunosuppressed individuals with ANP after epistaxis demonstrate similar rates of CSIs between cohorts who did and did not receive prophylactic antibiotics. Although adverse drug event rates were also similar, they exceeded CSI rates. Clinicians should consider these findings, the rates of adverse drug reactions, and concern for antibiotic stewardship when evaluating the need for prophylactic antibiotics in this immunosuppressed population.

### Topical tranexamic acid for the treatment of acute epistaxis in the emergency department [^114hu9jE]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness and potential benefits of topical tranexamic acid (TXA) in the management of acute epistaxis.

Methods

Retrospective review was performed among all patients presenting to the institution's emergency department (ED) with epistaxis between September 2014 and August 2016. Patients achieving hemostasis with standard of care agents, such as oxymetazoline, lidocaine, or epinephrine were excluded. The primary outcome was the ED length of stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes included the incidence of hospital admission, otolaryngologist consultation, nasal packing, prophylactic antibiotic use, and ED visit for rebleeding within seven days of treatment.

Results

Among 122 patients, 30 received topical TXA (500mg injectable solution soaked onto packing material and applied to the affected nostril) and 92 were managed with standard care. Nearly half (46.7%) of TXA-treated subjects received TXA either alone or in combination with standard of care agents as their initial treatment strategy. No significant difference was observed in the ED LOS (272 vs 232min in TXA and standard care arms, respectively, p = 0.26). However, TXA was associated with a significant reduction in otolaryngologist consults (30.0% vs 65.2%, p = 0.002) and nasal packing (16.7% vs 23.9%, p = 0.003).

Conclusions

This investigation did not demonstrate a significant difference in ED LOS among patients with acute epistaxis treated with topical TXA or standard care. However, this data does add to existing evidence that TXA may be associated with a reduction in resource utilization, suggesting it may provide more effective bleeding control. Overall, more data is needed to confirm the potential benefits of this practice.

### Incidence and risk factors for toxic shock syndrome after endoscopic sinus surgery: a systematic review [^115mFKJE]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a rare but serious complication after sinonasal surgery and a commonly cited consideration for prescribing antibiotics when nasal packing or stents are placed. Most reports are limited to case reports or small series. The aim of this systematic review was to describe the incidence, risk factors, and clinical course of patients who developed TSS as a complication of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) and/or septoplasty.

Data Sources

A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases.

Review Methods

Eligibility criteria were patients of any age who developed TSS as a complication of ESS and/or septoplasty.

Results

Twenty-five studies were included in the final review. Seventy cases were identified over 38 years (1982–2020). The pooled incidence of TSS after sinonasal surgery was 0.0003 (0.0002–0.0004, 95% confidence interval, CI) or 30 per 100,000 persons. Among 33 patients with single-subject data, mean age was 33.8 years (29.73–37.87, 95% CI). Seventeen (51.5%) patients had nasal packing, 3 (9.1%) had stents, 5 (15.2%) had both, 7 (21.2%) had none. Fourteen (42.4%) patients had nonabsorbable packing and 5 (15.2%) had absorbable packing. Sixteen (48%) patients received peri-operative antibiotics. Thirty-two (97%) patients had full recovery.

Conclusion

The incidence of TSS after sinonasal surgery is very rare. TSS can occur with and without nasal packing and prophylactic antibiotics were not protective. Outcomes were favorable with appropriate recognition and management. Further study is needed to determine which patients are most at risk for TSS.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving nasal form and function after rhinoplasty [^116cmP3K]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective Rhinoplasty, a surgical procedure that alters the shape or appearance of the nose while preserving or enhancing the nasal airway, ranks among the most commonly performed cosmetic procedures in the United States, with > 200,000 procedures reported in 2014. While it is difficult to calculate the exact economic burden incurred by rhinoplasty patients following surgery with or without complications, the average rhinoplasty procedure typically exceeds $4000. The costs incurred due to complications, infections, or revision surgery may include the cost of long-term antibiotics, hospitalization, or lost revenue from hours/days of missed work. The resultant psychological impact of rhinoplasty can also be significant. Furthermore, the health care burden from psychological pressures of nasal deformities/aesthetic shortcomings, surgical infections, surgical pain, side effects from antibiotics, and nasal packing materials must also be considered for these patients. Prior to this guideline, limited literature existed on standard care considerations for pre- and postsurgical management and for standard surgical practice to ensure optimal outcomes for patients undergoing rhinoplasty. The impetus for this guideline is to utilize current evidence-based medicine practices and data to build unanimity regarding the peri- and postoperative strategies to maximize patient safety and to optimize surgical results for patients. Purpose The primary purpose of this guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations for clinicians who either perform rhinoplasty or are involved in the care of a rhinoplasty candidate, as well as to optimize patient care, promote effective diagnosis and therapy, and reduce harmful or unnecessary variations in care. The target audience is any clinician or individual, in any setting, involved in the management of these patients. The target patient population is all patients aged ≥ 15 years. The guideline is intended to focus on knowledge gaps, practice variations, and clinical concerns associated with this surgical procedure; it is not intended to be a comprehensive reference for improving nasal form and function after rhinoplasty. Recommendations in this guideline concerning education and counseling to the patient are also intended to include the caregiver if the patient is < 18 years of age. Action Statements The Guideline Development Group made the following recommendations: (1) Clinicians should ask all patients seeking rhinoplasty about their motivations for surgery and their expectations for outcomes, should provide feedback on whether those expectations are a realistic goal of surgery, and should document this discussion in the medical record. (2) Clinicians should assess rhinoplasty candidates for comorbid conditions that could modify or contraindicate surgery, including obstructive sleep apnea, body dysmorphic disorder, bleeding disorders, or chronic use of topical vasoconstrictive intranasal drugs. (3) The surgeon, or the surgeon's designee, should evaluate the rhinoplasty candidate for nasal airway obstruction during the preoperative assessment. (4) The surgeon, or the surgeon's designee, should educate rhinoplasty candidates regarding what to expect after surgery, how surgery might affect the ability to breathe through the nose, potential complications of surgery, and the possible need for future nasal surgery. (5) The clinician, or the clinician's designee, should counsel rhinoplasty candidates with documented obstructive sleep apnea about the impact of surgery on nasal airway obstruction and how obstructive sleep apnea might affect perioperative management. (6) The surgeon, or the surgeon's designee, should educate rhinoplasty patients before surgery about strategies to manage discomfort after surgery. (7) Clinicians should document patients' satisfaction with their nasal appearance and with their nasal function at a minimum of 12 months after rhinoplasty. The Guideline Development Group made recommendations against certain actions: (1) When a surgeon, or the surgeon's designee, chooses to administer perioperative antibiotics for rhinoplasty, he or she should not routinely prescribe antibiotic therapy for a duration > 24 hours after surgery. (2) Surgeons should not routinely place packing in the nasal cavity of rhinoplasty patients (with or without septoplasty) at the conclusion of surgery. The panel group made the following statement an option: (1) The surgeon, or the surgeon's designee, may administer perioperative systemic steroids to the rhinoplasty patient.
