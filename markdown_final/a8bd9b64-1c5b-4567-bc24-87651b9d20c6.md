## Question

Describe Lyme arthritis and the expected duration of symptoms and treatment.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Lyme arthritis, specifically a description of the condition and the expected duration of symptoms and treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the condition and its epidemiology. Then, I should characterize the clinical presentation and course. Next, I will establish the diagnostic framework, including appropriate use and limitations of testing. After that, I need to outline guideline-concordant treatment and durations, followed by expected response timelines and outcomes. Then, I should address management of persistent synovitis and post-treatment symptoms, making sure not to over-treat with antibiotics. Finally, I will review special considerations such as Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions, pediatric risk factors for refractory disease, and geographic strain differences, and close with a concise summary of durations and key pitfalls to avoid [^112niLTj] [^1135NeTv].

> Let me first confirm the condition and epidemiology. Lyme arthritis is the most common late manifestation of Borrelia burgdorferi infection in North America, typically emerging months after the tick bite, and in modern practice arthritis may be the presenting manifestation because earlier stages can be missed or subclinical, especially in endemic U.S. regions such as the Northeast and upper Midwest [^1135NeTv] [^113HjPyu]. Hold on, I should also acknowledge that European disease often reflects different Borrelia species with somewhat different phenotypes, with arthritis being relatively less common than in the U.S., which affects how clinicians weigh pretest probability by geography [^111aJVbn] [^111zfkTr].

> I will now examine the clinical presentation. The pattern is classically monoarticular or oligoarticular involving large weight-bearing joints, most often the knee, with pronounced effusion that can be out of proportion to pain, and typically without systemic fever; the course can be intermittent with relapsing and remitting swelling if untreated or undertreated [^113HjPyu] [^114Y8nfz]. Wait, let me verify the knee predominance estimate, because some reports cite greater than 90% knee involvement and others approach the upper 90s; the safest and most accurate phrasing is that the knee is by far the most commonly affected joint, often overwhelmingly so in U.S. series, with ankle next in frequency, and the relative paucity of fever and severe pain helps distinguish it from septic arthritis, though overlap exists and clinical judgment is required [^114GHwoR] [^113HjPyu].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic framework. Two-tier serologic testing, using an initial EIA followed by confirmatory immunoblot, is the diagnostic mainstay for suspected Lyme arthritis; because arthritis is a late manifestation, serology is usually positive, unlike early localized disease where a window period can reduce sensitivity, so I need to ensure testing is timed appropriately and interpreted in the context of pretest probability [^112niLTj] [^117UB8f9]. Hold on, I should verify the role of synovial fluid PCR; it can be positive pre-treatment and supports the diagnosis in the right context, but it is not reliable as a test of cure and should not be used to guide treatment duration or retreatment decisions after adequate therapy, so I must avoid over-interpreting post-treatment PCR results [^111XG7DD] [^112niLTj].

> Let me think about evidence-based treatment and durations. Per the 2020 IDSA/AAN/ACR guideline (published 2021), first-line therapy for Lyme arthritis is a 28-day course of an oral agent such as doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil, with clinical improvement expected during that month; if there is minimal or no response with persistent moderate-to-severe effusion, the recommended second-line is intravenous ceftriaxone for 2 to 4 weeks, rather than extending or cycling multiple oral courses [^117PJZaP] [^114VJGeV] [^112niLTj]. Wait, let me verify total exposure; while some patients will need both an oral and an IV course, the typical total antibiotic duration remains about 6 to 8 weeks when IV therapy is necessary, and longer durations are not supported by evidence and increase risk without added benefit [^114VJGeV] [^112niLTj].

> I should confirm expectations for response and outcomes. Most patients will improve and ultimately resolve swelling with appropriate antibiotics, often within the initial 4-week oral course, while others require escalation to IV ceftriaxone; nevertheless, a minority — on the order of about 10% in U.S. cohorts — develop persistent synovitis after adequate oral and IV antibiotics, reflecting a post-infectious, dysregulated inflammatory response rather than ongoing active spirochetal infection [^1135NeTv] [^111c3zzy] [^113HjPyu]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about persistent swelling during treatment; transient worsening early on can occur, and I should also monitor for a Jarisch-Herxheimer-like reaction shortly after antibiotic initiation, which is self-limited and does not indicate treatment failure [^1124vLk7].

> Next, I should address management of persistent or post-treatment symptoms. For objective arthritis that persists after a full oral course and a subsequent 2–4 weeks of IV ceftriaxone, additional or prolonged antibiotics are not indicated; instead, management should pivot to anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory strategies tailored by rheumatology, because the process is post-infectious synovitis rather than ongoing infection in most cases [^113HjPyu] [^112niLTj]. I need to ensure I distinguish this from Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome, where patients have nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue or cognitive complaints; in those cases, the IDSA/AAN/ACR guideline recommends against further antibiotics in the absence of objective evidence of reinfection or treatment failure, given multiple trials showing no sustained benefit and meaningful risks from prolonged therapy [^112niLTj] [^111aJVbn] [^114DXqw5].

> I will now examine special considerations and prognostic factors. A Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction can present within 1–2 hours of therapy onset with fever, chills, and myalgias, typically resolving within 12–24 hours without changing antibiotics, so I should counsel patients up front and avoid unnecessary escalation if this occurs transiently [^1124vLk7]. In pediatrics, risk factors for antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis include older age at onset, prolonged arthritis duration by the time of diagnosis, knee-only disease, and worsening after starting antibiotics, and presentation can mimic oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, so I should double-check the differential and ensure adherence and appropriate dosing to mitigate modifiable risks [^114DX4Np] [^116htuFg]. But wait, what if the geography is Europe rather than the U.S.; differences in Borrelia species there, notably B. garinii and B. afzelii, shift the clinical spectrum and may influence the relative frequency of arthritis and neurocutaneous features, so I need to factor local epidemiology and strain variation into pretest probability and counseling [^111zfkTr] [^111aJVbn].

> Let me reconsider pitfalls and verification steps. I need to ensure septic arthritis is not missed, especially in patients with severe pain, high fever, or systemic toxicity, and synovial fluid analysis to exclude bacterial septic arthritis remains critical in the right clinical scenario; I should also interpret serologies with attention to timing and background seropositivity, avoiding overdiagnosis based on symptoms alone or on persistent antibodies after prior infection [^117UB8f9] [^112niLTj]. I should double-check that retreatment decisions are grounded in objective findings rather than nonspecific symptoms, both to optimize outcomes and to minimize harms from unnecessary prolonged antibiotics, particularly catheter-related complications with IV therapy [^112niLTj] [^11397E4C].

> In summary, I need to ensure an initial 28-day oral antibiotic course for Lyme arthritis, escalate to 2–4 weeks of IV ceftriaxone if there is minimal response, and expect most patients to improve within 4–8 weeks total of appropriately selected therapy; persistent objective synovitis after adequate antibiotics should be managed as a post-infectious inflammatory arthritis with anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory strategies rather than extended antimicrobials, while nonspecific post-treatment symptoms warrant supportive care and avoidance of further antibiotics in the absence of objective evidence for ongoing infection or reinfection [^117PJZaP] [^114VJGeV] [^112niLTj] [^113HjPyu]. Hold on, I should verify that patient counseling covers expected timelines, the possibility of transient early symptom flares, and the plan for reassessment at the end of each treatment phase to decide whether to escalate, transition to rheumatologic management, or broaden the differential if the course is atypical for Lyme arthritis [^1124vLk7] [^1135NeTv].

Lyme arthritis is a late manifestation of Borrelia burgdorferi infection, typically presenting as **mono- or oligoarticular arthritis** of large joints, especially the knee, with swelling and limited range of motion but minimal pain or systemic symptoms [^113HjPyu] [^1135NeTv]. Diagnosis relies on clinical features plus **two-tier serology** (ELISA followed by Western blot) [^112niLTj] [^114yENZC]. First-line treatment is a **28-day course** of oral doxycycline or amoxicillin [^117PJZaP]; if there is no or minimal response, a 2–4-week course of IV ceftriaxone is recommended [^114VJGeV]. Most patients improve within weeks to months, but about 10% may have persistent synovitis for months to years despite antibiotics, managed with NSAIDs, intra-articular steroids, or synovectomy; prolonged antibiotics are not beneficial and should be avoided [^111c3zzy] [^112niLTj].

---

## Clinical presentation

- **Joint involvement**: Mono- or oligoarticular arthritis, most often the knee; other large joints (ankle, wrist, elbow, hip, TMJ) can be affected [^113HjPyu] [^1135NeTv].
- **Symptoms**: Marked swelling, limited range of motion, minimal pain, and minimal systemic symptoms (fever, malaise) [^114GHwoR] [^114Y8nfz].
- **Course**: Intermittent or persistent arthritis, often months after initial infection; arthritis may be the first recognized manifestation [^113HjPyu] [^1135NeTv].

---

## Pathophysiology

Dissemination occurs via **hematogenous spread** of B. burgdorferi to the synovium, triggering a strong inflammatory response [^113HjPyu] [^1135NeTv]. Immune dysregulation explains the persistent synovitis seen in approximately 10%, reflecting **immune-mediated inflammation** rather than ongoing infection [^111c3zzy].

---

## Diagnosis

- **Clinical evaluation**: Characteristic arthritis in patients from endemic areas [^112niLTj].
- **Serologic testing**: Two-tier testing (ELISA then Western blot) is the mainstay [^112niLTj] [^114yENZC].
- **Synovial fluid analysis**: Inflammatory fluid with elevated WBCs (mostly neutrophils); PCR for B. burgdorferi DNA may be positive before treatment but is not a reliable marker of eradication [^111XG7DD] [^113HjPyu].

---

## Treatment

### First-line therapy

Oral antibiotics (doxycycline or amoxicillin) are given for **28 days** [^117PJZaP].

---

### Second-line therapy

IV ceftriaxone is given for **2–4 weeks** if there is minimal response to oral therapy [^114VJGeV].

---

### Refractory cases

Persistent synovitis is managed with NSAIDs, **intra-articular corticosteroids**, or **arthroscopic synovectomy**. Prolonged antibiotics are **not recommended** because they lack benefit and may cause harm [^112niLTj] [^11397E4C].

---

## Duration of symptoms and treatment

- **Resolution**: Most improve within weeks to months after antibiotics [^113HjPyu] [^112niLTj].
- **Persistent synovitis**: About 10% have synovitis lasting months to years despite adequate therapy [^111c3zzy] [^1135NeTv].
- **PTLDS**: Nonspecific symptoms (fatigue, arthralgia, cognitive complaints) may persist ≥ 6 months after treatment; prolonged antibiotics are not beneficial [^112niLTj] [^114PigJk].

---

## Prognosis

Overall prognosis is **favorable** with appropriate antibiotics [^113HjPyu] [^112niLTj]. Refractory disease occurs in a small subset who may require **additional anti-inflammatory or surgical management** [^111c3zzy] [^1135NeTv].

---

Lyme arthritis is a late manifestation of Lyme disease characterized by **mono- or oligoarticular arthritis**, primarily affecting large joints. Most patients respond well to standard antibiotic therapy, but a minority may experience **persistent synovitis** requiring additional interventions [^1135NeTv] [^112niLTj].

### Lyme arthritis [^113HjPyu]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Low credibility.

Arthritis is the most common late manifestation of Borrelia burgdorferi infection in the United States, usually beginning months after the tick bite. In most patients with Lyme arthritis (LA) today, arthritis is the presenting manifestation of the disease. Patients experience swelling and pain in one or a few large joints, especially the knee. Serologic testing is the mainstay of diagnosis. Responses to antibiotic treatment are generally excellent, although a small percentage of patients experience persistent, postinfectious synovitis after 2 to 3 months of oral and IV antibiotics. These cases often respond to anti-inflammatory therapies. Herein, we review the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of LA.

Regarding the medical management of Lyme disease, particularly in relation to antibiotic therapy for Lyme arthritis, the AAN/ACR/IDSA 2021 guidelines recommend considering the completion of a 2–4-week course of intravenous ceftriaxone. This recommendation applies to patients with Lyme arthritis who exhibit no or minimal response to an initial course of oral antibiotics. Specifically, this is in cases of moderate-to-severe joint swelling with minimal reduction of the joint effusion.

### Elucidation of Lyme arthritis [^111c3zzy]. Nature Reviews Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Before the first description of Lyme arthritis in 1976, patients with this disease were often thought to have juvenile or adult rheumatoid arthritis. It is now known that Lyme arthritis is caused by a tick-borne spirochete that disseminates to joints, where it induces marked pro-inflammatory responses. In most patients, the arthritis resolves with antibiotic treatment. However, in the United States, about 10% of patients with Lyme arthritis develop persistent synovitis, which lasts for months or even several years after the apparent eradication of the spirochete from the joint with antibiotic therapy.

The elucidation of Lyme arthritis, from acute infection to chronic synovitis, might help in our understanding not only of this entity, but also of other forms of chronic inflammatory arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis.

### Rare case of Lyme borreliosis in a patient presenting with dactylitis and skin rash [^114GHwoR]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

Clinical symptoms in Lyme borreliosis (LB) are not always specific, and LB can resemble several diseases. It can cause multisystem disease, particularly affecting the skin, musculoskeletal system, nervous system, and heart. Lyme arthritis is usually not painful and is not accompanied by fever. It has been shown that 84% of patients have monarthritis, with the knees affected in up to 98% of cases. Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) is reported in 1%–3% of LB cases in Europe. ACA and arthritis are late manifestations of LB and may present months to years after the infectious tick bite.

To our knowledge, this is the first case of LB describing asymmetrical dactylitis in a hand. Previously, a case report of LB dactylitis in a toe was published by Levy et al. Additionally, diffuse hand and finger swelling has been reported as a striking feature of Lyme arthritis. Borrelia lymphocytoma cutis, a non-tender bluish-red nodule, may mimic dactylitis if located in one digit. However, it is typically found on the ear lobe, areola mammae, or scrotum.

The diagnosis of LB may be challenging and the diagnosis of disseminated infection is often delayed for several years because of the similarity of this entity to other diseases. One of the reasons is that patients do not always recall a preceding tick bite, and dermatological manifestations are not obligatory. Furthermore, once a patient has developed anti-Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (B.b.s.l.) antibodies, these can persist for years. B.b.s.l.-specific PCR has a reasonable sensitivity in Lyme arthritis, with a higher sensitivity in synovial samples than in synovitis fluid (range 40%–96%), but a high specificity.

### Rare case of Lyme borreliosis in a patient presenting with dactylitis and skin rash [^1171Bvzz]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

An immunocompetent male in his 70s was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis based on dactylitis, onycholysis of the nails, and scalp psoriasis. He was treated with corticosteroids, methotrexate, and local corticosteroid injections without improvements in his symptoms. When tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor treatment was introduced, the symptoms worsened, and dactylitis of all digits and a bluish-red rash were observed on the extensor side of the left hand and arm.

At this point, a skin biopsy was performed, showing histopathological changes compatible with Lyme borreliosis, and the serum contained IgG antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi. It was concluded that he was suffering from acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) and Lyme dactylitis. Ten days of phenoxymethylpenicillin treatment was initiated, and after 2 weeks, the dactylitis and ACA had regressed substantially. After 6 months, both had resolved. This case emphasizes the need for clinical reassessment when treatment is not effective.

### Differences in genotype, clinical features, and inflammatory potential of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto strains from Europe and the United States [^111zfkTr]. Emerging infectious diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Researchers have reported differences in clinical features of infection with B. garinii and B. afzelii in Europe and B. burgdorferi in the northeastern United States. We extended these findings by showing differences in clinical features of erythema migrans caused by B. burgdorferi in Slovenia compared with B. burgdorferi in the United States. Despite substantial phylogenetic discordance among species, clinical features of infection with B. burgdorferi in Slovenia more closely resembled those of milder infections with B. afzelii and B. garinii, the two other Borrelia species that cause disease in Europe, than the more symptomatic infection associated with more closely phylogenetically related B. burgdorferi from the United States. These findings suggest sharing of genetic information among different Borrelia species.

Although we cannot exclude the possibility that host genetic or cultural differences might contribute to differences in clinical features of Lyme borreliosis in Slovenia and the United States, we do not believe that these differences are major factors. First, all study patients at both sites were of European descent and probably similar genetically. Second, evaluation of patients in both locations was similar and included assessment of objective measures, such as fever and erythema migrans diameter and duration, which would not be influenced by cultural differences in reporting symptoms. Third, the median duration of erythema migrans in patients in the United States likely was shorter because these patients had more associated symptoms and sought treatment.

### Penicillin G potassium [^1124vLk7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is a systemic reaction that may occur after the initiation of penicillin therapy in patients with syphilis or other spirochetal infections (i.e. Lyme disease and relapsing fever). The reaction begins one to two hours after initiation of therapy and disappears within 12 to 24 hours. It is characterized by fever, chills, myalgias, headache, exacerbation of cutaneous lesions, tachycardia, hyperventilation, vasodilation with flushing, and mild hypotension. The pathogenesis of the Herxheimer reaction may be due to the release of heat-stable pyrogen from the spirochetes.

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: The reported incidence of allergic reactions to all penicillins ranges from 0.7 to 10 percent in different studies (see WARNINGS). Sensitization is usually the result of previous treatment with a penicillin, but some individuals have had immediate reactions when first treated. In such cases, it is postulated that prior exposure to penicillin may have occurred via trace amounts present in milk or vaccines.

	- **Two types of allergic reactions to penicillin are noted clinically**: immediate and delayed. Immediate reactions usually occur within 20 minutes of administration and range in severity from urticaria and pruritus to angioneurotic edema, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, hypotension, vascular collapse, and death (see WARNINGS). Such immediate anaphylactic reactions are very rare and usually occur after parenteral therapy, but a few cases of anaphylaxis have been reported following oral therapy. Another type of immediate reaction is an accelerat

### Lyme borreliosis: Diagnosis and management [^111aJVbn]. BMJ (2020). Low credibility.

Lyme borreliosis is the most common vectorborne disease in the Northern Hemisphere. It usually begins with erythema migrans, while early disseminated infection particularly causes multiple erythema migrans or neurologic disease. Late manifestations predominantly include arthritis in North America and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) in Europe. Diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis is based on characteristic clinical signs and symptoms, complemented by serological confirmation of infection once an antibody response has been mounted.

Manifestations usually respond to appropriate antibiotic regimens, but the disease can be followed by sequelae, such as immune arthritis or residual damage to affected tissues. A subset of individuals reports persistent symptoms, including fatigue, pain, arthralgia, and neurocognitive symptoms, which in some people are severe enough to fulfill the criteria for post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. The reported prevalence of such persistent symptoms following antimicrobial treatment varies considerably, and its pathophysiology is unclear.

Persistent active infection in humans has not been identified as a cause of this syndrome, and randomized treatment trials have invariably failed to show any benefit of prolonged antibiotic treatment. For prevention of Lyme borreliosis, post-exposure prophylaxis may be indicated in specific cases, and novel vaccine strategies are under development.

### Six versus 2 weeks treatment with doxycycline in European Lyme neuroborreliosis: A multicentre, non-inferiority, double-blinded, randomised and placebo-controlled trial [^111Psckm]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Low credibility.

The primary objective of the study was to determine if a treatment duration of 2 weeks with doxycycline is as effective as a prolonged regimen of 6 weeks. Accordingly, the null hypothesis was that a 2-week treatment duration is inferior to the 6-week treatment duration.

For the sample size calculation, the authors drafting the protocol considered a non-inferiority margin of 0.5 points in mean improvement on the CCS as clinically relevant. In other words, a mean difference in the clinical score from baseline to 6 months after inclusion of up to 0.5 points represented the maximum reduction in effectiveness we would accept while still considering the short regimen treatment to be non-inferior. We used data from our previous trial with an adult population with European LNB and the same clinical score to calculate sample size and determine the non-inferiority margin. With a significance level of 0.05 and statistical power at 80%, this corresponded to a sample size of 50 patients in each group. To compensate for 20% drop-outs, we planned to include 120 patients, with 60 in each group.

For analyses of the primary endpoint, we applied a general linear model adjusting for gender, age, pretreatment duration of symptoms, and CCS at baseline. The primary endpoint was analysed in an intention-to-treat (ITT) principle population (excluding participants who withdrew consent, discontinued treatment, and/or were lost to follow-up) and in a per-protocol population. In the latter, we also excluded one patient who fulfilled treatment according to protocol but was shown to have an…

### The Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi infects murine bone and induces trabecular bone loss [^111C4HwZ]. Infection and Immunity (2017). Low credibility.

Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the Northern Hemisphere. Its causative agents are spirochetes from the species complex. These bacteria are not known to secrete conventional toxins and are therefore postulated to induce pathology primarily by triggering host inflammatory response. Lyme disease is transmitted to vertebrates during the blood meal of tick species and disseminates from the tick bite site to colonize a variety of host tissues. This can result in diverse clinical manifestations at various infection stages. In humans, erythema migrans (EM), a bull's-eye-shaped skin lesion, typically appears at the bite site 1 to 2 weeks post-feeding. If antibiotic treatment does not begin at this early infection stage, the infection disseminates to more distant tissues, and late-stage manifestations such as Lyme arthritis, carditis, and neuroborreliosis can develop. Of these late-stage symptoms, Lyme arthritis is the most common in North America, affecting as many as 60% of untreated patients. The pathological effects of infection on bone tissue outside articular surfaces, however, have not been widely investigated.

Bone pathologies are observed in diseases associated with other spirochete bacteria, including syphilis and periodontitis. Bone is central to the physiological homeostasis of the whole body and to systemic responses to infection, injury, and a variety of stressors. Infections within bone, as well as induction of local and systemic inflammatory responses to infection at other sites, can be accompanied by significant bone loss. Infection has been detected by culture and PCR in bone.

### Chronic limping in childhood, what else other than juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a case series [^116htuFg]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Lyme arthritis is a manifestation of infection with the Borrelia burgdorferi spirochete. It is widespread in North America, but infrequent in Europe, although an increase in incidence has also been recorded, ranging from 0.14 to 1.4 cases per 1000 inhabitants per year due to the greater diffusion of the vector. Lyme disease usually begins with an expanding skin lesion known as erythema migrans (stage 1), which, if untreated, can be followed within days to weeks by early disseminated infection responsible for neurological and cardiac involvement (stage 2). Late infection occurs after months and is characterized by arthritis or acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (stage 3).

However, Lyme arthritis may not be associated with a history of tick bite and/or erythema migrans, so arthritis can be the first manifestation. At the onset, Lyme arthritis usually affects large joints with swelling often associated with limited range of motion but little or no pain, with the knee being the most affected joint. The ankle is the second most affected joint, and the presentation may mimic oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Serological testing is the only available method to support a diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. It is based on a two-step test using serological screening and confirmation with immunoblot or polymerase chain reaction. Although a course of oral antibiotics leads to resolution in over 70% of cases, in a smaller proportion of patients, an immunological mechanism leads to chronic arthritis indistinguishable from juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

### Chronic Lyme disease: a review [^115x4unD]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Studies have shown that most patients diagnosed with chronic Lyme disease either have no objective evidence of previous infection with Borrelia burgdorferi or should be classified as having post-Lyme disease syndrome. This syndrome is defined as continuing or relapsing nonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and cognitive complaints, in a patient previously treated for Lyme disease. Despite extensive study, there is currently no clear evidence that post-Lyme disease syndrome is caused by persistent infection with B. burgdorferi.

Four randomized placebo-controlled studies have shown that antibiotic therapy offers no sustained benefit to patients who have post-Lyme disease syndrome. These studies also revealed a substantial placebo effect and a significant risk of treatment-related adverse events. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying persistent symptoms after Lyme disease and to conduct controlled trials of new approaches to the treatment and management of these patients.

When discussing medical management for Lyme disease, specifically regarding antibiotic therapy for erythema migrans, the AAN/ACR/IDSA 2021 guidelines recommend completing a 10-day course of doxycycline or a 14-day course of amoxicillin or cefuroxime axetil rather than opting for longer treatment courses in patients with erythema migrans.

### Counterpoint: Long-term antibiotic therapy improves persistent symptoms associated with Lyme disease [^113mbfbV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Controversy exists regarding the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease. Patients with persistent symptoms after standard (2–4-week) antibiotic therapy for this tickborne illness have been denied further antibiotic treatment due to the perception that long-term infection with the Lyme spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, and associated tickborne pathogens is rare or nonexistent.

- **Methods**: I review the pathophysiology of B. burgdorferi infection and the peer-reviewed literature on diagnostic Lyme disease testing, standard treatment results, and coinfection with tickborne agents, such as Babesia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, and Bartonella species. I also examine uncontrolled and controlled trials of prolonged antibiotic therapy in patients with persistent symptoms of Lyme disease.

- **Results**: The complex "stealth" pathology of B. burgdorferi allows the spirochete to invade diverse tissues, elude the immune response, and establish long-term infection. Commercial testing for Lyme disease is highly specific but relatively insensitive, especially during the later stages of the disease. Numerous studies have documented the failure of standard antibiotic therapy in patients with Lyme disease. Previous uncontrolled trials and recent placebo-controlled trials suggest that prolonged antibiotic therapy (duration, > 4 weeks) may be beneficial for patients with persistent Lyme disease symptoms. Tickborne coinfections may increase the severity and duration of infection with B. burgdorferi.

- **Conclusions**: Prolonged antibiotic therapy may be useful and justifiable in patients with persistent symptoms of Lyme disease.

### Editorial commentary: Life after Lyme disease [^111AwXa2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

This study may inform physicians and patients seeking care or explanations for problems that may or may not be related to Lyme disease. Given the high rates of nonspecific, subjective symptoms such as pain and fatigue in the general population, for those with erythema migrans, it should help suppress concerns that the effects of early Lyme disease are likely to cause lifelong debilitation. For patients with difficult-to-resolve, less well-understood problems without good evidence of B. burgdorferi infection, this study offers evidence that treated erythema migrans is not likely a significant driver of chronic health problems in the United States. For this latter group, the study offers little solace and, much like William James more than a century ago, thoughtful physicians are left listening to patients without a clear understanding of mechanisms or effective solutions.

### Six versus 2 weeks treatment with doxycycline in European Lyme neuroborreliosis: a multicentre, non-inferiority, double-blinded, randomised and placebo-controlled trial [^112YiE8t]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Low credibility.

Another possible limitation is the use of an unvalidated clinical score (CCS) that carries both inter- and intra-observer variability. The randomisation procedure is assumed to equalise this variability, but the score is still encumbered with imprecise absolute scores that may cause wide 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We chose the score since we were familiar with it from a previous trial, it reflects assessments done of these patients in clinical practice, and it has also been used in a modified form by other researchers.

Our study included 18 patients with possible Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB), including six with negative antibodies in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A relatively short pretreatment symptom duration, ranging from two to seven days, could explain persistent antibody negativity in these six patients, but it is possible that some of them did not have LNB. Two had facial palsy as their only symptom, and retrospectively were thought to have suffered from Bell's palsy. The inclusion of some patients with unclear diagnosis is unavoidable in a treatment trial of LNB due to the low sensitivity of intrathecal antibody production in the early phase of the disease, and the need to start antibiotic treatment before antibody results are available. However, this study included relatively few such patients.

Overall, we consider the trial to be well-designed with few sources of biases and high internal validity. We also think the trial results reflect everyday clinical practice by including patients with both definite and possible LNB from different centres, thereby possessing high external validity.

### Lyme arthritis: Pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and management [^114Y8nfz]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Arthritis is one of the most prominent features of Lyme disease, the tick-borne illness caused by Borrelia burgdorferi. Although the pathogenesis of Lyme arthritis is complex and still under study, the clinical presentation and natural history have been established by long-term observation of untreated and treated patients.

- **Clinical presentation**: Lyme arthritis typically manifests as a mono- or oligoarticular relapsing/remitting arthritis primarily affecting the large joints and may present with arthralgias rather than arthritis in some cases.

- **Diagnosis and treatment strategies**: Methods for diagnosing and treating Lyme arthritis are discussed, with a focus on treatment-refractory Lyme arthritis and arthralgias that may persist after therapy. These post-treatment symptoms are sometimes referred to as post-Lyme disease syndrome.

This comprehensive review provides detailed insights into the clinical management of Lyme arthritis and the challenges associated with persistent symptoms following treatment.

### Clinical and laboratory characteristics during a 1-year follow-up in European Lyme neuroborreliosis: A prospective cohort study [^113rXh94]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

A high total symptom burden, as measured by the CCS, and pronounced fatigue, as measured by the FSS score pretreatment and at 10 weeks and 6 months, were associated with poor outcomes at 12 months. A high symptom burden early in follow-up being a negative prognostic factor is consistent with a previous study with a similar LNB case definition. In contrast to previous studies, the outcome was not influenced by symptom duration before treatment, other clinical features, laboratory parameters, or LNB case definition. Our patients had a shorter median pretreatment duration of symptoms compared to other studies, which might explain the contrasting results. Our findings indicate that a high burden of complaints before and after treatment is the most important negative prognostic factor.

Regarding the study's limitations, 16 patients were lost to follow-up before 12 months, and a reporting bias toward patients with more residual complaints is possible. Additionally, there are no long-term data on the patients treated with further antibiotics. Even so, the dropouts were few and differed from the remaining patients only in age, not in initial clinical presentation. Another possible limitation is the use of the unvalidated CCS, which had both intra- and interrater variability. Even so, the score reflects a thorough clinical assessment of these patients in daily practice, and the premise of use was specific scoring on symptoms and findings related to the LNB only.

### Lyme disease periprosthetic joint infection [^111DvtbM]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Lyme PJI lacks standardized treatment guidelines, with limited case reports employing various approaches. Seven cases have been reported in the literature. Five cases were managed successfully with surgical intervention (three DAIR and two two-stage arthroplasty exchange), and two cases were managed successfully with medical management (oral doxycycline and intravenous ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline only). One of the biggest hurdles in the diagnosis of Lyme PJI is the acuity of the symptoms.

In the subacute to chronic setting, where surgical options tend to lean more towards two-stage reimplantation, there is no rush to surgery, and standard PCR testing can more easily be incorporated into painful total joint protocols, as was the case for Wright et al. However, for acute PJI (< 2 weeks), standard recommendations are for attempted DAIR, and time to surgery matters greatly. However, PCR evaluation of synovial fluid may take time and delay the management of acute infections. Faster, reliable testing may need to be developed to offset delaying disease progression with surgical delays. This underscores the need for further research to determine the most effective treatment approach for Lyme PJI.

Lyme arthritis is common, and it is a well-researched topic on native joints. In recent years, 30,000–40,000 cases of Lyme disease have been reported annually to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and in a fourth of reported cases, arthritis was a manifestation of the disease. Lyme disease is most prevalent in the northeastern and upper Midwestern USA.

### Serious bacterial infections acquired during treatment of patients given a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease - United States [^11397E4C]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

A woman in her late 30s with fatigue and joint pain received a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease, babesiosis, and Bartonella infection by a local physician. Despite multiple courses of oral antibiotics, her symptoms worsened, leading to the placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) for the initiation of IV antibiotic treatment.

After 3 weeks of treatment with IV ceftriaxone and cefotaxime, the patient's joint pain persisted, and she developed fever and rash. She became hypotensive and tachycardic and required hospitalization in an intensive care unit, where she was treated with broad-spectrum IV antibiotics and required mechanical ventilation and vasopressors. Despite maximal medical support, her condition continued to deteriorate, and she eventually died. The patient's death was attributed to septic shock related to central venous catheter–associated bacteremia.

### Posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome [^117Fo7rV]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The prognosis following appropriate antibiotic treatment of early or late Lyme disease is favorable but can be complicated by persistent symptoms of unknown cause termed posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), characterized by fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and cognitive complaints that persist for six months or longer after the completion of antibiotic therapy. Risk factors include delayed diagnosis, increased severity of symptoms, and the presence of neurologic symptoms at the time of initial treatment. Two-tier serologic testing is neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of PTLDS because of variability in convalescent serologic responses after the treatment of early Lyme disease. Optimal treatment of PTLDS awaits a more precise understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in this illness and future treatment trials.

### A case revealing the natural history of untreated Lyme disease [^1127n1R1]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

A 71-year-old woman presented to a rheumatologist with what she believed to be a 2-year history of Lyme disease, progressing from erythema migrans to Lyme arthritis.

- **Investigations**: History, physical examination, and serologic testing confirmed the diagnosis of Lyme disease.

- **Diagnosis**: Lyme disease.

- **Management**: The patient refused antibiotic therapy during the first 2 years of her illness. During the next 2 years, she consulted a rheumatologist but declined antibiotic therapy. She continued to have recurrent episodes of arthritis, following which she was successfully treated with doxycycline, given initially for 2 weeks, with a second, 4-week cycle administered 2 months later. This case illustrates the natural history of untreated Lyme disease, which is rarely observed in most patients, as diagnosis almost always leads to successful antibiotic treatment. Furthermore, this case also demonstrates that infection with Borrelia burgdorferi can persist for years in untreated patients; however, antibiotic therapy is still likely to be effective, despite long-term infection.

### Clinical and laboratory characteristics during a 1-year follow-up in European Lyme neuroborreliosis: A prospective cohort study [^116XcUa1]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

There is scant knowledge on the time course of recovery after antibiotic treatment, and both the prevalence and underlying cause of long-term residual complaints after Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) are debated. In a systematic review of 34 studies from 2015, 28% (23%–34%) of included patients had residual complaints after LNB. However, the studies included differed considerably regarding design, inclusion criteria, follow-up times, and outcome measures. More recent studies found unfavorable outcomes after treated LNB in 12%–45%, with significantly more complaints among patients classified with possible LNB compared to those classified with definite LNB.

The pathogenesis of residual complaints after treated LNB is not fully understood, but substantial evidence refutes the hypothesis of ongoing infection. Other causes, such as pre-existing cognitive-behavioral factors, negative illness perceptions, tissue damage, and immune responses, might be relevant. One prospective study found that cytokine and chemokine levels could be linked to LNB clinical features and outcomes. Another prospective study, primarily on patients with erythema migrans, found that the main predictors of outcome were baseline psychosociological characteristics. Others have shown that delayed initiation of antibiotic treatment and a high burden of symptoms pretreatment are associated with reduced health-related quality of life and a higher burden of residual complaints.

In summary, even though LNB is a well-studied disease, more knowledge is needed on the different clinical presentations, illness time courses, biomarkers, and predictors of resolution.

### An insight into Lyme prosthetic joint infection in knee arthroplasty: A literature review [^1123oWY5]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Lyme arthritis is a common late manifestation of Lyme disease and typically presents with joint pain accompanied by swelling and erythema. Clinically, it is very difficult to distinguish Lyme arthritis from a native septic joint. As far as we know, only five cases of Lyme arthritis associated with total knee prosthetic joint infection (PJI) have been reported in the literature.

- **Management of PJI**: The management of PJI is based on the acuity of symptoms and can include irrigation and débridement, intravenous antibiotics, and implant retention if symptoms are of less than three weeks' duration. Chronic infection often requires a two-stage exchange arthroplasty and an extended course of antibiotics.

- **Diagnosis challenges**: Diagnosis remains difficult and, when associated with Lyme disease, becomes very complicated. The Musculoskeletal Infection Society criteria are often used to assist in the diagnosis of PJI. Timely diagnosis and early intervention decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with PJI. If treatment is delayed, Lyme disease, caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, can lead to the formation of biofilms and degradative matrix metalloproteinase enzymes, which can result in implant failure and loosening.

However, most reported Lyme PJI cases have been treated with early irrigation and débridement followed by postoperative antibiotics. Early treatment is crucial to decrease the bacterial burden and minimize the adverse outcomes of PJI.

### Serious bacterial infections acquired during treatment of patients given a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease - United States [^115rM1d3]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

A woman in her 60s with autoimmune neutropenia, mixed connective tissue disease, and degenerative arthritis received a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease neuropathy. She was treated with IV immunoglobulin every three weeks via a tunneled venous catheter with an implanted subcutaneous port. After undergoing treatments for over ten years, she developed fevers and neck pain and was hospitalized. The catheter was removed, and cultures of blood and the catheter tip yielded methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. She was treated with IV antibiotics via a newly placed PICC and, although advised to remove the PICC after completing the antibiotic course, she chose to keep it for further IV immunoglobulin therapy.

Two months later, she was readmitted for recurrent fevers. The PICC was removed, and cultures of the tip grew coagulase-negative Staphylococcus; blood cultures were negative. She was treated with IV antibiotics and discharged.

The patient subsequently received a new implanted subcutaneous venous catheter and restarted IV immunoglobulin therapy, after which she was readmitted for fever and back pain. Blood cultures were positive for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, and magnetic resonance imaging indicated inflammation of the lumbar facet joints, epidural space, and paraspinal muscles, consistent with infection. Despite appropriate antibiotic treatment, her back pain worsened, and she required surgical drainage of a paraspinal abscess.

### Chronic Lyme disease [^114DXqw5]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic Lyme disease is a poorly defined diagnosis that is usually assigned to patients experiencing prolonged, unexplained symptoms or those with alternative medical diagnoses. Data do not support the notion that chronic, treatment-refractory infection with *Borrelia burgdorferi* is responsible for the myriad of conditions often labeled as chronic Lyme disease. Prolonged symptoms following the successful treatment of Lyme disease are uncommon but can, in rare cases, be severe. Extended courses of antibiotics neither prevent nor improve these symptoms and are associated with considerable harm.

### Serious bacterial infections acquired during treatment of patients given a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease - United States [^111c8ujq]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

The term "chronic Lyme disease" is used by some health care providers as a diagnosis for various constitutional, musculoskeletal, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Patients with a diagnosis of chronic Lyme disease have been provided a wide range of medications as treatment, including long courses of intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Studies have not shown that such treatments lead to substantial long-term improvement for patients, and they can be harmful. This report describes cases of septic shock, osteomyelitis, Clostridium difficile colitis, and paraspinal abscess resulting from treatments for chronic Lyme disease. Patients, clinicians, and public health practitioners should be aware that treatments for chronic Lyme disease can carry serious risks.

### Depen [^116ZNnNe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The principal rule of treatment with Depen in rheumatoid arthritis is patience, as the onset of therapeutic response is typically delayed. Two to three months may be required before the first evidence of a clinical response is noted [see Clinical Pharmacology].

When treatment with Depen has been interrupted because of adverse reactions or other reasons, the drug should be reintroduced cautiously by starting with a lower dosage and increasing slowly.

- **Initial therapy**: The currently recommended dosage regimen begins with a single daily dose of 125 mg or 250 mg. This dose is thereafter increased at one to three month intervals by 125 mg or 250 mg/day, as patient response and tolerance indicate. If a satisfactory remission of symptoms is achieved, the dose associated with the remission should be continued [see Maintenance Therapy]. If there is no improvement and no signs of potentially serious toxicity appear after two to three months of treatment with doses of 500–750 mg/day, increases of 250 mg/day at two to three month intervals may be continued until a satisfactory remission occurs [see Maintenance Therapy] or signs of toxicity develop [see Warnings and Precautions]. If there is no discernible improvement after three to four months of treatment with 1000 to 1500 mg of penicillamine/day, it may be assumed the patient will not respond and Depen should be discontinued.

### Perspectives on "chronic Lyme disease" [^112xcyjJ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

There is much controversy about the treatment of Lyme disease with respect to two poorly defined entities: "chronic Lyme disease" and "posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome". In the absence of direct evidence that these conditions are the result of a persistent infection, some mistakenly advocate extended antibiotic therapy (≥ 6 months), which can do great harm and has resulted in at least one death. The purpose of this brief report is to review what is known from clinical research about these conditions to assist both practicing physicians and lawmakers in making sound and safe decisions with respect to treatment.

### Diagnosis and treatment of Lyme arthritis [^111XG7DD]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

In the United States, Lyme arthritis is the most common feature of late-stage Borrelia burgdorferi infection, usually beginning months after the initial bite. In some cases, earlier phases are asymptomatic, and arthritis is the presenting manifestation. Patients with Lyme arthritis experience intermittent or persistent attacks of joint swelling and pain in one or a few large joints.

Serologic testing is the mainstay of diagnosis. Synovial fluid polymerase chain reaction for B. burgdorferi DNA is often positive before treatment but is not a reliable marker of spirochetal eradication after therapy. This article reviews the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of Lyme arthritis.

### Current guidelines, common clinical pitfalls, and future directions for laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease, United States [^117UB8f9]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical considerations and common pitfalls:

- **Timing of testing — window period**: As with all serologic tests, clinicians must consider the timing of a patient's illness when ordering and interpreting Lyme disease tests. Serologic analysis has low sensitivity during the first few weeks of infection while the antibody response is still developing. This period is known as the window period and is common to all serologic tests. Patients with illnesses suspicious for early Lyme disease but lacking typical erythema migrans (EM) can present a diagnostic dilemma because serologic test results might be negative at this point. In these cases, treatment can be administered at the discretion of the clinician, but serologic analysis is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

- **Clinical approach to diagnosis of early Lyme disease, United States**: Given the gradual geographic expansion of Lyme disease, testing may be warranted for patients with signs and symptoms of Lyme disease who were exposed in areas that border known disease-endemic regions. For a more detailed discussion of symptoms as they relate to pretest probability, see section on exposure and pretest probability. For the recommended 2-tiered testing protocol, refer to specific guidelines. STARI, Southern tick-associated rash illness; EM, erythema migrans.

Background seropositivity is a major consideration when testing for Lyme disease. In a seroepidemiologic study conducted in New York, 5% of study participants were found to have antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi. Seropositivity can result from previous exposure and does not necessarily indicate active infection.

### Association between duration of symptoms and severity of disease at first presentation to paediatric rheumatology: Results from the Childhood Arthritis Prospective Study [^111YErxy]. Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

The results of this study demonstrate that many children have experienced a long duration of symptoms prior to their first assessment by a pediatric rheumatologist, with a median total duration of 4.6 months. For more than 20% of children, this duration extended beyond one year. An interesting association between normal ESR at presentation and longer duration of symptoms at first presentation might suggest that a diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis may not be considered if normal inflammatory markers are observed, thus delaying a referral to specialist pediatric rheumatology care. The symptom duration was shortest in those presenting with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), presumably because these children are typically very unwell with high inflammatory markers. The longest symptom duration was seen among children with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Although it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from this observation, the possibility exists that if children are undergoing treatment for psoriasis, joint complaints may be initially overlooked.

### Merging patches, an atypical presentation of disseminated cutaneous Lyme disease: A case report [^115rXYg7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Lyme disease, spread by the Ixodes tick, is typically associated with a single "bull's eye rash" that emergency physicians are comfortable recognizing and treating during the summer months when this disease is most prevalent. However, Lyme disease can also present in disseminated forms that are more difficult to diagnose.

- **Case report**: We describe a phenomenon of disseminated Lyme with multiple rash complexes that is unrecognized by clinicians. A 65-year-old woman with no prior medical history presented with flu-like symptoms, including headache, nausea, and arthralgias, as well as a nonpruritic rash on her lower limbs. On physical examination, multiple red, blanching patches with a diameter of up to 20 cm were seen. Although she was initially thought to have a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug reaction, as her skin biopsy for Borrelia burgdorferi was negative, an immunoglobulin M test for B. burgdorferi was found to be positive during her emergency department visit. Despite the diverging results, a diagnosis of early-disseminated Lyme was made. She was discharged home on a 3-week course of oral doxycycline, and a complete resolution of her symptoms was noted on a follow-up visit.

With the incidence of Lyme disease and its atypical presentations on the rise, the emergency physician should be aware of the other rashes associated with this disease, particularly those linked to disseminated cutaneous Lyme. Early diagnosis of the disseminated forms of Lyme is critical to prevent the occurrence of li

### Lyme arthritis: A 50-year journey [^1135NeTv]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Lyme arthritis (LA) was recognized as a separate entity in 1975 because of the geographic clustering of children often diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in Lyme, Connecticut. After the identification of erythema migrans as a common early feature of the illness, a prospective study of such patients implicated Ixodes scapularis ticks in disease transmission. In 1982, the causative agent, now called Borrelia burgdorferi, was cultured from these ticks and from Lyme disease patients.

Subsequently, it was shown that LA could usually be treated successfully with oral antibiotics, but sometimes required intravenous antibiotics. Yet, a small percentage of patients developed a dysregulated, proinflammatory immune response leading to persistent postinfectious synovitis with vascular damage, cytotoxic and autoimmune responses, and fibroblast proliferation, a lesion similar to that of rheumatoid arthritis. The message from postinfectious LA for other autoimmune arthritides is that a complex immune response with autoimmune features can begin with a microbial infection.

### Meclofenamate sodium [^117DqZSw]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of meclofenamate sodium capsules and other treatment options before deciding to use meclofenamate sodium capsules. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS).

Meclofenamate sodium capsules are indicated for the following:

- **Reduction of fever in adults**: For relief of mild to moderate pain in adults.
- **Relief of signs and symptoms of juvenile arthritis**: For relief of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.
- **Relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis**: For treatment of primary dysmenorrhea.
- **Acute or long-term use in the relief of signs and symptoms of the following**:
	- Ankylosing spondylitis
	- Acute painful shoulder (acute subacromial bursitis/supraspinatus tendinitis)
	- Acute gouty arthritis

Meclofenamate sodium capsules are also indicated for the treatment of idiopathic heavy menstrual blood loss (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and PRECAUTIONS). As with all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, selection of meclofenamate sodium capsules requires a careful assessment of the benefit/risk ratio (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Meclofenamate sodium capsules are not recommended in children because adequate studies to demonstrate safety and efficacy have not been carried out.

### Initial presentation and time to treatment in early Lyme disease [^115cRXFG]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). High credibility.

The erythema migrans (EM) rash is an important initial diagnostic sign of early Lyme disease. We tested the hypothesis that patients who noticed EM first differed from those who noticed viral-like symptoms first. "EM First" participants (167/271, 61.6%) had shorter illness duration before treatment (5.0 versus 6.2 days, P = 0.019), were more likely to have seen or removed a tick (P = 0.048) and to be non-Hispanic White (P = 0.025), and were less likely to present with disseminated lesions at the time of diagnosis (P = 0.003) than "Symptoms First" participants (104/271, 38.4%). In multivariate analyses, EM First participants had a 22% decrease in time to treatment (P = 0.012) compared with Symptoms First participants, suggesting that initial presentation affects time to treatment. In a large minority of patients, EM may not be the initial sign or symptom of early Lyme disease. There is a need for rapid diagnostics and improved physician awareness of the varied manifestations of early Lyme disease.

### Treatment of post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms-a systematic review [^112AwhKu]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

In studies on interventions, the prognosis of early Lyme disease after antibiotic treatment is usually good, and the rate of residual symptoms is low. However, some patients experience residual symptoms and unspecific symptoms such as fatigue and cognitive impairment after Lyme disease. Depending on the severity of these symptoms and their functional impact, some authors refer to this incomplete resolution of symptoms after treatment as post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms (PTLDs) or post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS).

To provide a framework for further research, a case definition of PTLDS was proposed. To fulfill criteria for PTLDS, patients are required to have a documented episode of Lyme disease, have received a recommended course of antibiotic therapy with resolution or stabilization of the objective manifestations of Lyme disease, have non-specific symptoms (persistent or relapsing) that started within six months of the Lyme disease diagnosis and lasted for at least six months after completion of antibiotic therapy, and have no other condition that explains the symptoms.

The origin of these symptoms remains a matter of emotive debate. A recent prospective study reports an increase of unspecific symptoms of 6% after an episode of Lyme disease compared with the general population. An elaborated analysis of this cohort mainly identified cognitive-behavioral variables, such as negative illness perceptions and poorer physical and social functioning, as well as higher baseline scores for depression, anxiety, fatigue, and pain, as predictors.

### Imaging in Lyme neuroborreliosis [^112tQATT]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation of Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) can vary widely, partly due to the genetic differences in spirochetal strains. Individual variations in immunological response and the possibility of co-infections may also explain the wide spectrum of symptoms encountered. The skin is primarily affected, and erythema migrans can be observed. About one-third to half of patients with LNB recall a tick bite or a rash.

The most common neurological manifestation of LNB in adults is Bannwarth syndrome with painful radiculoneuritis and aseptic meningitis; the former is most prominent in Europe and the latter in North America. LNB with facial nerve palsy is commonly encountered on both continents. Rarer manifestations from the nervous system include meningoencephalitis, encephalomyelitis, cerebral vasculitis, and peripheral neuropathy. LNB may occasionally present to the ophthalmologist with optic neuropathies and papilledema due to raised intracranial pressure.

The distinction between early and late LNB is made from the duration of neurological symptoms of less or more than six months, with more than 95% of cases classified as early disease. Most LNB patients respond well to antibiotic treatment, but some experience persistent complaints. A definition for post-Lyme disease syndrome has been suggested to include subjective symptoms of fatigue, cognitive symptoms, and/or widespread musculoskeletal pain starting within six months after completed treatment. Post-Lyme disease syndrome is not discussed in this article.

Considerable heterogeneity existed regarding inclusion criteria, type of intervention, treatment duration, measured outcomes, and methods of outcome assessment. Combined estimates for efficacy outcomes were not justified due to heterogeneous study criteria as well as differences in reporting of the outcome measures.

- **Risk of bias assessment**: Assessment of risk of bias in the included studies showed one study with a low risk of bias in all assessed items, while two studies had ratings of high risk of bias in several items.

Murray et al. reported a non-pharmacological intervention on PTLDS, with a high risk of bias for items such as allocation concealment (block randomization in an unblinded setting leads to a predictable allocation process), blinding of participants and personnel/blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, and other biases (considerable imbalances regarding measurements of the respective outcomes at baseline).

In the study by Cameron, the assessment of risk of bias was high for allocation concealment, incomplete outcome data, and other biases due to the estimated sample size not being met, and considerable imbalances.

### Lyme vaccine: issues and controversies [^113kSeFS]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The development of an effective vaccine for Lyme disease represents a major advance in controlling the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the United States. It has a definite place in the total approach to controlling this disease. Its use should be restricted to individuals who are at moderate to high risk of exposure to infected vector ticks. Vaccinated individuals should not become complacent about other personal protection measures, as the vaccine is not uniformly effective, and protective antibody levels decay rapidly. Booster doses will be necessary, but the intervals have not yet been determined.

There is a theoretical concern about the possible induction of inflammatory arthritis through an autoimmune mechanism; however, there is no evidence that this condition has clinical relevance. The impact of lawsuits on vaccine recommendations and use remains to be determined. Continued surveillance for rare long-term side effects should address the medical risk issue. Alternative primary vaccine administration schedules are currently under study and could lead to regimens permitting the achievement of protective immunity in six months or less. The vaccine is not approved for use in children under the age of 15 years.

### Association between duration of symptoms and severity of disease at first presentation to paediatric rheumatology: Results from the Childhood Arthritis Prospective Study [^115RKb1P]. Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Children in this study were participants in the Childhood Arthritis Prospective Study (CAPS), an ongoing prospective longitudinal inception cohort study aiming to follow children presenting with new-onset inflammatory arthritis for a minimum of five years. The overall aim of this study is to identify genetic and environmental predictors of short- and long-term outcomes of inflammatory arthritis, including treatment response in children. It also seeks to determine the relative contributions of socio-demographic, clinical, psychological, laboratory, genetic factors, and treatment in explaining outcomes. The study was launched in September 2001 and aims to recruit 1,100 children from five tertiary referral centers in England as well as Scotland: Royal Liverpool Children's Hospital, Liverpool; Booth Hall Children's Hospital, Manchester; Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle; Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow; and Great Ormond Street Hospital, London.

All children aged ≤ 16 years, either presenting to the pediatric rheumatology outpatient clinic or admitted as inpatients with newly diagnosed inflammatory arthritis in one or more joints persisting for at least two weeks, according to parent/child history, are invited to participate. Exclusion criteria include septic arthritis, haemarthrosis, arthritis caused by malignancy or trauma, and connective tissue disorders such as SLE, MCTD, or dermatomyositis. The initial invitation was made by the pediatric rheumatologist and was followed-up by the research nurse after parents had time to read the study information sheet.

### Six versus 2 weeks treatment with doxycycline in European Lyme neuroborreliosis: a multicentre, non-inferiority, double-blinded, randomised and placebo-controlled trial [^117LpNjV]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

European Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) typically presents with painful meningoradiculitis and/or cranial neuritis, accompanied by malaise and fatigue. More rare clinical manifestations include plexus neuritis, mononeuritis, and central nervous system (CNS) syndromes such as myelitis, vasculitis, and encephalitis. There is a clear consensus that patients with LNB should be treated with antibiotics as soon as possible. However, the choice of antibiotic type and treatment duration remains a topic of discussion.

Intravenously administered beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillin G, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime) and orally administered doxycycline are proven effective and exhibit relatively good cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration. Orally administered doxycycline has been shown to be non-inferior to intravenous ceftriaxone in typical LNB and is probably effective in LNB with mainly CNS involvement. In line with this knowledge, the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) guidelines from 2010 recommend treatment with either a beta-lactam antibiotic or doxycycline in adults. The final choice of antibiotic type depends on individual factors such as age, tolerability, pregnancy, breastfeeding, and preferred mode of administration. According to the guidelines, patients with encephalitis, myelitis, or vasculitis should be treated with intravenous ceftriaxone.

The recommendations regarding treatment duration are divergent. The EFNS guidelines recommend 2 weeks for early LNB, defined as pretreatment symptom duration under 6 months, and 3 weeks for late LNB.

### Clinical usefulness of intrathecal antibody testing in acute Lyme neuroborreliosis [^115iLP3U]. European Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to examine the diagnostic sensitivity and temporal course of intrathecal Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) antibody production in acute Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB). We recruited consecutive adult patients with an LNB diagnosis based on strict selection criteria. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSFs) were obtained, and clinical examinations were performed pre-treatment, and then at 13 days and 4 months post-treatment.

Pre-treatment, a positive Bb antibody index (AI) was detected in 34 of 43 patients (79%). All nine of the pre-treatment Bb AI-negative patients, and 26 of the 34 pre-treatment Bb AI-positive patients, reported a symptom duration of less than 6 weeks. Eight patients, all Bb AI positive, reported a symptom duration of 6 weeks or longer. Consequently, the pre-treatment diagnostic sensitivity of Bb AI was 74% when symptom duration was less than 6 weeks, and 100% when the duration was 6 weeks or longer.

Three patients converted from negative to positive Bb AI status post-treatment. The six patients who were persistently Bb AI negative had lower CSF cell count and protein levels at presentation, compared with patients who tested positive for Bb AI. In conclusion, the diagnostic sensitivity of Bb AI is suboptimal in acute early LNB. Repeated post-treatment Bb AI testing, to confirm or reject an LNB diagnosis, is unreliable, as the majority of initially Bb AI-negative patients remained negative at follow-up.

### Pediatric antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis: A multicenter case-control study [^114DX4Np]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

Few factors have consistently been linked to antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis (ARLA). We sought to identify clinical and treatment factors associated with pediatric ARLA.

- **Objective**: We performed a case-control study in three pediatric rheumatology clinics in a Lyme-endemic region from 2000 to 2013. Eligible children were aged ≤ 18 years with arthritis and had positive testing for Lyme disease by Western blot. Cases included 49 children with persistently active arthritis despite ≥ 8 weeks of oral antibiotics or ≥ 2 weeks of parenteral antibiotics. Controls included 188 children whose arthritis resolved within three months of starting antibiotics. We compared preselected demographic, clinical, and treatment factors between groups using logistic regression.

- **Results**: Characteristics positively associated with ARLA were age ≥ 10 years, prolonged arthritis at diagnosis, knee-only arthritis, and worsening after starting antibiotics. In contrast, children with fever, severe pain, or other signs of systemic inflammation were more likely to respond quickly to treatment. Secondarily, low-dose amoxicillin and treatment nonadherence were also linked to a higher risk of ARLA. Greater antibiotic use for children with ARLA was accompanied by higher rates of treatment-associated adverse events (37% vs. 15%) and resultant hospitalization (6% vs. 1%).

- **Conclusion**: Older children and those with prolonged arthritis, arthritis limited to the knees, or a poor initial response to antibiotics are more likely to have antibiotic-refractory disease and treatment-associated toxicity. Children with severe symptoms of systemic inflammation respond more quickly to treatment.

### Basal ganglia volume in unmedicated patients with schizophrenia is associated with treatment response to antipsychotic medication [^115hHQQx]. Psychiatry Research (2014). Low credibility.

We investigated the relationship between basal ganglia volume and treatment response to the atypical antipsychotic medication risperidone in unmedicated patients with schizophrenia. Basal ganglia volumes, including the bilateral caudate, putamen, and pallidum, were measured using the Freesurfer automated segmentation pipeline in 23 subjects. Additionally, baseline symptom severity, duration of illness, age, gender, time off medication, and exposure to previous antipsychotic were measured.

- **Findings**:
	- Treatment response was significantly correlated with all three regions of the bilateral basal ganglia (caudate, putamen, and pallidum), baseline symptom severity, duration of illness, and age.
	- Treatment response was not correlated with gender, time off antipsychotic medication, or exposure to previous antipsychotic medication.
	- The caudate volume demonstrated the strongest correlation with treatment response and was significantly negatively correlated with patient age.
	- Caudate volume was not significantly correlated with any other measure.

We demonstrated a novel finding that the caudate volume explains a significant amount of the variance in treatment response over the course of 6 weeks of risperidone pharmacotherapy, even when controlling for baseline symptom severity and duration of illness.

### Clinical and laboratory characteristics during a 1-year follow-up in European Lyme neuroborreliosis: A prospective cohort study [^116cpysK]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

In this prospective study of a well-defined cohort of Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) patients with close clinical and laboratory follow-up for 12 months, we made several interesting observations.

The predominant presenting symptoms and findings were fatigue, localized pain, malaise, radiculopathy, and facial palsy. Two patients had solely facial palsy without any accompanying symptoms, which could easily be confused with Bell's palsy. Thirteen patients with definite and one with possible LNB presented with solely newly emerged subjective symptoms: 12 with radicular pain and one with headache. In contrast, one previous study found no patients with definite LNB with solely subjective symptoms. Others, however, describe a typical symptom debut with radicular pain, which is typically aggravated at night and is resistant to analgesics. There is a risk of diagnostic delay in such patients, as LNB is often only acknowledged at the debut of paresis. Only one patient in our cohort had a confirmed CNS syndrome, which is fewer than previously reported. A possible inclusion bias to the treatment trial was discussed in a previous publication.

The median duration of symptoms before treatment was 21 days. This is less than in previous studies, but the range was wide, and three patients had late LNB (defined as symptom duration for more than six months). All three improved after treatment. Facial palsy was associated with shorter symptom duration before treatment, whereas other clinical variables were not. This is in line with previous studies and not surprising, as facial palsy is a conspicuous neurological finding.

### Colocalization of radicular pain and erythema migrans in patients with Bannwarth syndrome suggests a direct spread of Borrelia into the central nervous system [^117MNewA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common tick-transmitted disease in the northern hemisphere. In Europe, the majority of cases are due to infection with *Borrelia afzelii* and *Borrelia garinii*, whereas in North America, LB is nearly exclusively caused by *Borrelia burgdorferi*. Differences in the distribution of these etiologic agents likely contribute to the variation in the clinical presentation of LB in North America and Europe. Indeed, *B. afzelii* has the greatest propensity to cause skin manifestations, *B. garinii* is the main cause of central nervous system (CNS) involvement, whereas infection with *B. burgdorferi* often leads to arthritis. With all three species, the first sign of infection is usually an erythema migrans (EM) skin lesion that develops within days to a few weeks at the site of tick bite and inoculation of *B. burgdorferi sensu lato* (Lyme borrelia) into skin. In untreated individuals, the causative agent may disseminate, presumably hematogenously, to affect other organs and tissues, resulting in secondary skin lesions (multiple EM) and/or involvement of the CNS, heart, or joints.

In Europe, Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) is the second most common clinical manifestation of disseminated LB (after multiple EM). Bannwarth syndrome, a painful meningoradiculoneuritis, is the most typical LNB manifestation in adults. Almost 60% of patients with Bannwarth syndrome have EM before the onset of neurological involvement.

Epidemiological data from Sweden suggest that tick bites on the head are more often associated with LNB than bites at other locations. Furthermore, based on these observations, there is a need for further research into the spatial distribution of tick bites and their relation to the development of Lyme neuroborreliosis.

### Effect of prolonged antibiotic treatment on cognition in patients with Lyme borreliosis [^117WjqCA]. Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

In this study, we report secondary outcomes of the main trial, the PLEASE study. The analyses include only patients who were randomly assigned to a study group, received at least one dose of ceftriaxone (modified intention-to-treat population), and displayed sufficient performance validity at baseline, as indicated by an Amsterdam Short Term Memory Test score of 83 or higher. For descriptive purposes, we also classified individuals at baseline as having clinically impaired cognitive performance using multivariate normative comparisons based on a large Dutch normative data set from the Advanced Neuropsychological Diagnostic Infrastructure.

We compared the three study groups at week 14 (end of treatment) using analysis of covariance, including baseline domain score as a covariate. Missing data at week 14 were imputed if they occurred in less than 5% of the cases, using the mean of the treatment group at that assessment moment. We performed linear mixed models to estimate the duration of the potential intervention effect, which included all three post-treatment assessments at 14, 26, and 40 weeks. All models contained the baseline value of the dependent variable, time, study group treatment, and time-by-treatment interaction.

The α level was set at 0.05 (two-tailed), and 95% confidence intervals are reported when appropriate. For pairwise comparisons of the five domains among the three study groups at different endpoints, a Bonferroni correction was used by adjusting the α to 0.01 to reduce the probability of family-wise (type I) error. Sensitivity analyses included all analyses without imputation. SPSS software version 22 was used for statistical analysis.

### Point: Antibiotic therapy is not the answer for patients with persisting symptoms attributable to Lyme disease [^116uesU4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

It is not well understood why some patients develop a subjective syndrome that includes considerable fatigue, musculoskeletal aches, and neurocognitive dysfunction after receiving standard antibiotic courses for the treatment of Lyme disease. Some practitioners use the term "chronic Lyme disease" and order prolonged courses of oral and parenteral antibiotics, believing that persistent infection with Borrelia burgdorferi is responsible. However, well-performed prospective studies have found neither evidence of chronic infection nor a benefit worthy of long-term antibiotic therapy for these patients. Such extended antibiotic therapy poses hazards and cannot be viewed as acceptable. The term "chronic Lyme disease" should be discarded as misleading; rather, the term "post-Lyme disease syndrome" better reflects the postinfectious nature of this condition. Further research is necessary to understand possible mechanisms of these chronic symptoms following Lyme disease as well as to find effective therapies.

### Persistent symptoms after treatment of Lyme disease [^1146ujc9]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Low credibility.

Most patients with Lyme disease will fully recover with recommended antibiotic therapy. However, some patients report persisting nonspecific symptoms after treatment, referred to as post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms (PTLDs) or syndrome (PTLDS), depending on the degree to which the individual's symptoms impact their quality of life. PTLDs occur in a portion of patients diagnosed with chronic Lyme disease (CLD), a controversial term describing different patient populations, diagnosed based on unvalidated tests and criteria.

Practitioners should review the evidence for the Lyme disease diagnosis and not overlook unrelated conditions. Evidence shows that prolonged antibiotic therapy provides little benefit and carries significant risk. Further research to elucidate the mechanisms underlying persistent symptoms after Lyme disease and to understand CLD is needed.
