## Question

How quickly should I correct hyponatremia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how quickly to correct hyponatremia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context, especially symptom severity and whether the hyponatremia is acute or chronic. Then, I should verify the immediate treatment goals for severe symptoms. Next, I will review correction limits for chronic hyponatremia and how risk factors modify those limits. After that, I need to check what to do if overcorrection occurs. Finally, I will integrate emerging evidence and synthesize a practical, stepwise approach with monitoring and safety checks.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because everything hinges on it. Severe symptoms such as seizures, coma, or respiratory compromise indicate hyponatremic encephalopathy and mandate emergent therapy, whereas mild symptoms or asymptomatic cases allow for a more measured approach, and the distinction between acute (< 48 hours) and chronic (> 48 hours) hyponatremia drives the safe correction rate due to brain adaptation and osmotic demyelination risk [^a48cfaad] [^0feedf3c].

> For severely symptomatic hyponatremia, I should act immediately. Wait, let me verify the initial target and method. Bolus 3% hypertonic saline is preferred over continuous infusion because it achieves a faster, more predictable rise with less overcorrection; the goal is to raise serum sodium by about 4–6 mEq/L within 1–2 hours to reverse cerebral edema, with a hard limit of no more than 10 mEq/L in the first 24 hours, and to repeat 100 mL boluses up to three times if symptoms persist, while monitoring closely for clinical improvement and sodium response [^a48cfaad] [^5f4beb21] [^9b935b38].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about chronic hyponatremia. I need to ensure I apply the conservative limits correctly. For chronic hyponatremia, the general safe correction is 8–12 mEq/L in 24 hours and no more than 18 mEq/L in 48 hours, but if the patient has high-risk features for osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) — such as sodium ≤ 105 mEq/L, alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, hypokalemia, or advanced liver disease — I should tighten the limit to 4–6 mEq/L in 24 hours and not exceed 8 mEq/L in 24 hours, with even stricter caution in cirrhosis where AASLD recommends 4–6 mEq/L/day and not exceeding 8 mEq/L/day [^cf662663] [^939d0f17] [^c6181535].

> I should double-check what to do if overcorrection happens, because that is where harm occurs. If sodium rises by more than 8–10 mEq/L in 24 hours in high-risk patients, or more than 10–12 mEq/L in 24 hours in standard-risk patients, I need to actively relower sodium using desmopressin and hypotonic fluids (typically D5W), and I should stop any ongoing sodium-raising therapy; this relowering strategy is supported by guidelines and observational data and should be implemented promptly even if the patient is asymptomatic, given the delayed onset of ODS [^d71ddf22] [^6051a4e3] [^60df6d83].

> Next, I should review emerging evidence that challenges slower correction, but I need to be cautious about confounding. Recent observational studies and a 2025 meta-analysis suggest that faster correction may be associated with lower mortality and shorter length of stay, yet these are nonrandomized and vulnerable to confounding by indication and comorbidity; conversely, contemporary cohorts still identify ODS cases, often in patients with classic risk factors, so I should not abandon conservative limits in high-risk patients while acknowledging uncertainty in lower-risk groups [^7a0afd8d] [^67c65547] [^a69d55f3].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach and make sure it aligns with guidelines. First, stabilize and treat severe symptoms with 3% saline boluses to achieve a 4–6 mEq/L rise rapidly, then pause and reassess. Second, for chronic or unknown-duration hyponatremia, target 8–12 mEq/L in 24 hours (max 18 mEq/L in 48 hours) in standard-risk patients, and 4–6 mEq/L in 24 hours (max 8 mEq/L in 24 hours) in high-risk patients. Third, monitor sodium every 2–4 hours initially, track urine output to anticipate aquaresis, and consider proactive or reactive desmopressin to prevent overcorrection. Fourth, if overcorrection occurs, relower promptly with desmopressin and hypotonic fluids and recalibrate the plan [^90dd948b] [^cf662663] [^fc1bb7cf] [^60df6d83].

> But wait, what if the hyponatremia is acute and the patient is profoundly hyponatremic with seizures? In that scenario, rapid correction up to roughly 130 mEq/L can be justified because brain adaptation has not occurred and the immediate threat is cerebral edema; however, I should confirm the acuity and stop once symptoms abate to avoid overshooting into ranges that risk ODS in case the duration was actually longer than presumed [^71e6b1d1] [^90dd948b].

> I need to ensure I address special populations. In cirrhosis, stick to 4–6 mEq/L/day and avoid exceeding 8 mEq/L/day. In exercise-associated hyponatremia, use 3% saline boluses and avoid early isotonic or hypotonic fluids. In renal replacement therapy, anticipate rapid shifts and consider CRRT with adjusted dialysate sodium or staged correction to stay within safe limits [^c6181535] [^102f8b73] [^908c4563].

> Finally, I should confirm that my plan is individualized and monitored. No single rate fits all; the correction speed must balance the urgency of reversing cerebral edema against the risk of ODS, guided by symptoms, chronicity, baseline sodium, and risk factors, with frequent lab checks and a low threshold to relower if the trajectory is too fast. If I find myself relying on formulas, I should verify with serial measurements because formulas often underestimate or overestimate the sodium rise, especially when aquaresis emerges [^90dd948b] [^015d1386] [^b4cd5c38].

Correct hyponatremia based on symptom severity and chronicity: for **severe symptoms** (seizures, coma, respiratory arrest), give 3% saline 100 mL boluses (2 mL/kg if < 10 kg) repeated up to three times to raise sodium by 4–6 mEq/L rapidly, then stop and reassess [^90dd948b] [^0287f3a1]. For **chronic hyponatremia**, limit correction to ≤ 8 mEq/L in 24 hours (≤ 6 mEq/L if high risk) to avoid osmotic demyelination; if overcorrected, administer desmopressin and give hypotonic fluids to relower sodium [^cf662663] [^d71ddf22] [^6051a4e3]. Monitor sodium every 2–4 hours initially, then every 4–6 hours, and adjust therapy to stay within safe limits [^5f4beb21].

---

## General principles of correction

- **Severity and chronicity**: Correction depends on symptom severity and whether hyponatremia is acute (< 48 hours) or chronic (> 48 hours) [^90dd948b] [^0feedf3c].

- **Acute hyponatremia**: Rapid correction is safer because brain adaptation is incomplete; aim for 4–6 mEq/L initial rise to reverse cerebral edema [^90dd948b] [^a48cfaad].

- **Chronic hyponatremia**: Slow correction is critical to avoid osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS); limit to ≤ 8 mEq/L in 24 hours (≤ 6 mEq/L if high risk) [^cf662663] [^939d0f17].

---

## Correction rates based on clinical scenarios

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended correction rate** |
|-|-|
| Severe symptomatic hyponatremia (seizures, coma, respiratory arrest) | - 3% saline 100 mL bolus (2 mL/kg if < 10 kg) <br/> - Repeat up to three times <br/> - Target 4–6 mEq/L rise in 1–2 hours <br/> - Stop once symptoms improve [^90dd948b] [^0287f3a1] |
| Chronic hyponatremia (asymptomatic or mild symptoms) | - ≤ 8 mEq/L in 24 hours <br/> - ≤ 18 mEq/L in 48 hours <br/> - ≤ 6 mEq/L in 24 hours if high risk (alcoholism, malnutrition, liver disease, hypokalemia) [^cf662663] [^939d0f17] |
| Unknown duration (assume chronic) | - ≤ 8 mEq/L in 24 hours <br/> - ≤ 18 mEq/L in 48 hours [^cf662663] [^939d0f17] |

## Risks of rapid correction

Rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause **osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS)** — a delayed, potentially irreversible neurologic injury with dysarthria, dysphagia, spastic quadriparesis, and locked-in syndrome [^0feedf3c] [^82bc3099]. Risk increases with lower baseline sodium, chronicity, alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, liver disease, and hypokalemia [^cf662663] [^bcbfb0d7].

---

## Management of overcorrection

If sodium rises too quickly, **take immediate action**:

- **Desmopressin**: 2–4 mcg IV/SQ every 8 hours to halt aquaresis [^6051a4e3].

- **Hypotonic fluids**: Give 5% dextrose in water to relower sodium [^60df6d83].

- **Monitor closely**: Check sodium every 2–4 hours until stable [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Frequent monitoring**: Every 2–4 hours initially, then every 4–6 hours as stable [^notfound].

- **Urine output**: Track for abrupt aquaresis that can cause overcorrection [^5f4beb21].

- **Clinical status**: Reassess neurologic symptoms regularly [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Hypertonic saline**: Use boluses rather than continuous infusion to reduce overcorrection risk [^5f4beb21].

- **Formulas**: Use Adrogué–Madias or similar tools, but monitor closely as they can underestimate or overestimate correction [^015d1386] [^b4cd5c38].

- **Individualize**: Tailor correction to patient-specific factors and response [^e98ac58b].

---

Correct hyponatremia by aligning the correction rate with symptom severity and chronicity: **rapid initial correction for severe symptoms**, then **slow, controlled correction for chronic cases**, with vigilant monitoring and readiness to relower if overcorrection occurs.

International guidelines designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia have been widely accepted for a decade. On the basis of the results of a recent large retrospective study of patients hospitalized with hyponatremia, it has been suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of rise of the serum sodium concentration; the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration has been questioned. These assertions are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. After reviewing the history of that controversy, the evidence supporting the guidelines, and the validity of data challenging them, we conclude that current safeguards should not be abandoned. To do so would be akin to discarding your umbrella because you remained dry in a rainstorm. The authors of this review, who represent 20 medical centers in nine countries, have all contributed significantly to the literature on the subject. We urge clinicians to continue to treat severe hyponatremia cautiously and to wait for better evidence before adopting less stringent therapeutic limits.

### The challenge of hyponatremia [^e98ac58b]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypotonic hyponatremia often challenges clinicians on many counts. Despite similar serum sodium concentrations, clinical manifestations can range from mild to life threatening. Some patients require active management, whereas others recover without intervention. Therapeutic measures frequently yield safe correction, yet the same measures can result in osmotic demyelination. To address this challenge, we present a practical approach to managing hyponatremia that centers on two elements: a diagnostic evaluation directed at the pathogenesis and putative causes of hyponatremia, the case-specific clinical and laboratory features, and the associated clinical risk; and a management plan tailored to the diagnostic findings that incorporates quantitative projections of fluid therapy and fluid losses on the patient's serum sodium, balances potential benefits and risks, and emphasizes vigilant monitoring. These principles should enable the clinician to formulate a management plan that addresses expeditiously three critical questions: Which of the determinants of the serum sodium are deranged and what is the underlying culprit? How urgent is the need for intervention? What specific therapy should be instituted and which are the associated pitfalls?

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^1b780606]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For the past decade, most physicians treating severe hyponatremia have followed international guidelines that recommend limiting the rate of correction to avoid serious iatrogenic neurologic complications, most notably osmotic demyelination. Although these guidelines are based on small retrospective case series, they have been widely accepted by expert clinicians and are designed to minimize the risk of complications that can occur when correcting severe hyponatremia. – Established practice has recently been challenged by the publication of a retrospective analysis of hospital administrative data derived from a cohort of over 17,000 patients hospitalized with hyponatremia. On the basis of the results of that study, an accompanying editorial suggested that hyponatremia guidelines have gone too far in limiting the rate of correction; its authors questioned the need for therapeutic caution and frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration. We believe such conclusions are unwarranted and potentially dangerous; they are reminiscent of a controversy that began many years ago. A review of that controversy, and of how current guidelines came to be, will explain the reason for our position.

### Correction rates and clinical outcomes in hospitalized adults with severe hyponatremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7a0afd8d]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia treatment guidelines recommend limiting the correction of severe hyponatremia during the first 24 hours to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). Recent evidence suggests that slower rates of correction are associated with increased mortality.

Objective

To evaluate the association of sodium correction rates with mortality among hospitalized adults with severe hyponatremia.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, LILACS, Web of Science, CINAHL, and international congress proceedings for studies published between January 2013 and October 2023.

Study Selection

Comparative studies assessing rapid (≥ 8–10 mEq/L per 24 hours) vs slow (< 8 or 6–10 mEq/L per 24 hours) and very slow (< 4–6 mEq/L per 24 hours) correction of severe hyponatremia (serum sodium < 120 mEq/L or < 125 mEq/L plus severe symptoms) in hospitalized patients.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Pairs of reviewers (N. A.F. J.R.M. J.M. A. A.C.) independently reviewed studies, extracted data, and assessed each included study's risk of bias using ROBINS-I. Cochrane methods, PRISMA reporting guidelines, and the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to rate the certainty of evidence were followed. Data were pooled using a random-effects model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were in-hospital and 30-day mortality, and secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay (LOS) and ODS.

Results

Sixteen cohort studies involving a total of 11 811 patients with severe hyponatremia were included (mean [SD] age, 68.22 [6.88] years; 56.7% female across 15 studies reporting sex). Moderate-certainty evidence showed that rapid correction was associated with 32 (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.55–0.82) and 221 (odds ratio, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11–0.79) fewer in-hospital deaths per 1000 treated patients compared with slow and very slow correction, respectively. Low-certainty evidence suggested that rapid correction was associated with 61 (risk ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.45–0.67) and 134 (risk ratio, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.28–0.44) fewer deaths per 1000 treated patients at 30 days and with a reduction in LOS of 1.20 (95% CI, 0.51–1.89) and 3.09 (95% CI, 1.21–4.94) days, compared with slow and very slow correction, respectively. Rapid correction was not associated with a statistically significant increased risk of ODS.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, slow correction and very slow correction of severe hyponatremia were associated with an increased risk of mortality and hospital LOS compared to rapid correction.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^e6f1a16b]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Guidelines of hyponatraemia treatment

Hypotonic hyponatraemia is a clinical state where there is a relative excess of water to sodium content in the extracellular fluid. Acute hyponatraemia is clinically important as it can cause significant morbidity and mortality associated with rapid development of symptomatic cerebral oedema. Prompt treatment to raise the serum sodium concentration in this setting is life-saving. Chronic hyponatraemia, even if asymptomatic, is associated with many adverse outcomes including prolonged hospitalisation, gait instability, falls, fractures, and increased bone loss. Diverse strategies to correct chronic hyponatraemia have been recommended and success of such treatment is dependent on the underlying aetiology for hyponatraemia. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatraemia may trigger an osmotic demyelination syndrome resulting in serious neurological deficits and death.

The methodological quality of guideline development and consensus statements can be assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) process. This tool is used to systematically evaluate six guideline domains including scope, stakeholder involvement, editorial independence, rigour of development, clarity, and applicability. Nagler et al. identified five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements after a comprehensive search of English and non-English publications, guideline databases, and professional society websites. Their recommendations differed with respect to classification of hyponatraemia, diagnostic tests, doses of saline to use for correction, limits for the rise in serum sodium concentration, and the most appropriate second line therapies for management. The overall quality of these publications (measured by the AGREE tool) was mixed.

Should we be surprised that individual hyponatraemia guidelines "failed" this test of quality? Arguably, the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia cannot be subjected to this sort of rigorous analysis because of the low level of evidence available to help various expert panels and guideline groups write internationally consistent advice. For example, hyponatraemia occurring within 48 hours is an arbitrary cut-off for determining the presence of acute hyponatraemia, the desired rate of correction for hyponatraemia in most settings is not universally agreed, availability of certain recommended therapies is country dependent and impacted by differing regulatory indications for drugs, and even the biochemical threshold for defining hyponatraemia varies widely in the literature. Furthermore, many of the clinical algorithms require initial assessment of the extracellular fluid volume to determine if a hyponatraemic patient is hypovolaemic, euvolaemic, or hypervolaemic. In practice, this physical examination of fluid balance can be subject to misinterpretation if the clinical signs are subtle.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: expert panel recommendations [^13e94bb6]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious, but often overlooked, electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death as a result of osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the 6 years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary and a panel of hyponatremia experts (which included all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal current management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia that are based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent published data in this field.

### Treatment of hyponatremia [^6e8f49c0]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We review literature from the past 18 months on the treatment of hyponatremia. Therapy must address both the consequences of the untreated electrolyte disturbance (including fatal cerebral edema due to acute water intoxication) and the complications of excessive therapy (the osmotic demyelination syndrome).

Recent Findings

Correction of hyponatremia by 4–6 mEq/l within 6 h, with bolus infusions of 3% saline if necessary, is sufficient to manage the most severe manifestations of hyponatremia. Planning therapy to achieve a 6 mEq/l daily increase in the serum sodium concentration can avoid iatrogenic brain damage by staying well clear of correction rates that are harmful. Conservative correction goals are wise because inadvertent overcorrection is common. Administration of desmopressin to halt a water diuresis can help prevent overcorrection; if overcorrection occurs, therapeutic relowering of the serum sodium concentration is supported by data in experimental animals and was found to be safe in a small observational clinical trial. Even mild and apparently asymptomatic hyponatremia may lead to falls because of impaired gait, and an increased likelihood of fracture because of hyponatremia-induced osteoporosis, a newly described entity. Recently approved vasopressin antagonists now make it possible to normalize the serum sodium concentration on a chronic basis, but practical considerations have limited their use.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^c2eeb022]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Analytical limitations of serum sodium measurements must also be considered when setting correction goals and limits. Because of unavoidable imprecision, a laboratory report indicating that the serum sodium has increased by 8 mmol/L might, in reality, reflect an increase of 10 mmol/L. For that reason, when planning therapy, the targeted rate of correction should not be too close to rates that can result in patient harm.

Administration of desmopressin (a synthetic antidiuretic hormone) either after or in anticipation of a water diuresis has been used to reverse or prevent inadvertent excessive correction of hyponatremia. Both the European Clinical Practice Guidelines and the US/Irish expert panel suggest that relowering of the serum sodium should be considered if correction limits have been exceeded. However, the approach should depend on the relative risks of injury from excessive correction. The strongest case for relowering the serum sodium to prevent osmotic demyelination can be made in patients at very high risk of developing the disorder (those with a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L or patients with heavy alcohol use, severe hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease). It would be reasonable to relower the serum sodium in such patients if it has increased by > 8 mmol/L in < 24 hours. On the other hand, patients who have rapidly become hyponatremic due to self-induced water intoxication related to psychosis or endurance exercise often develop a spontaneous water diuresis that rapidly brings the serum sodium back to normal; because their risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome is extremely low, the US/Irish expert panel deemed efforts to prevent or reverse excessive correction to be unnecessary. Similarly, in most patients presenting with a sodium > 120 mmol/L, relowering the serum sodium after correction by > 8 mmol/L or even > 12 mmol/L was not recommended. In patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L without major risk factors for osmotic demyelination, initial correction by 8–12 mmol/L is more than necessary, but unlikely to be harmful unless the 48-hours limit of 18 mmol/L is exceeded; the panel deemed relowering of the serum sodium to be optional after correction by > 10–12 mmol/L but recommended that further increases in serum sodium should be avoided for the next 24 hours. Other experts have adopted the stricter limit of 8 mmol/L in 24 hours for all patients.

### Rate of correction and all-cause mortality in patients with severe hypernatremia [^541c761a]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Some of the rationale supporting current expert opinion recommending controlled correction of hypernatremia rests on a perceived symmetry with correction of hyponatremia. While it is appealing to group these 2 common sodium disorders together, published data do not support this approach. The evidence supporting slow correction of hyponatremia is supported by animal studies, numerous case reports and large observational studies. In contrast, there are no convincing reports of even 1 adult harmed by rapid correction of hypernatremia. From a physiological perspective the risk of neurological complications seems to be much higher with rapid correction of hyponatremia, as the adaptations of brain cells to hypernatremia are much slower than to hyponatremia. Also, while the risk of complication associated with rapid correction is more common with chronic hyponatremia compared with acute hyponatremia, chronic hypernatremia is considerably less common than acute hypernatremia. Our results were comparable for patients with hypernatremia on admission compared with those who were diagnosed during hospitalization, also supporting the safety of rapid correction of hypernatremia even when there is no clear documentation of an acute condition.

The 30-day mortality was alarmingly high in the reported cohort. This is in line with previous studies of severe hypernatremia. The absolute difference in survival between rapidly and slowly corrected patients was very large and remained so after adjustment for potential confounders. Interestingly, the size of the absolute difference in survival was comparable at 30 days and at 1 year following documentation of severe hypernatremia. This might suggest that the different mortality rates do not represent differences in the patient populations unaccounted by the statistical analysis, but rather the results of the treatment strategies for severe hypernatremia, namely the rate of correction. An additional support to this hypothesis is the strong correlation reported between the absolute sodium correction in the first 24 hours and patient survival. This implies that the high mortality rates known to be associated with severe hypernatremia might be partly attributed to lack of aggressive rehydration, which might improve patient outcomes.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia [^12fc5713]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with severe (serum sodium ≤ 120 mEq/L), symptomatic hyponatremia can develop life-threatening or fatal complications from cerebral edema if treatment is inadequate and permanent neurologic disability from osmotic demyelination if treatment is excessive. Unfortunately, as is true of all electrolyte disturbances, there are no randomized trials to guide the treatment of this challenging disorder. Rather, therapeutic decisions rest on physiologic principles, animal models, observational studies, and single-patient reports. European guidelines and recommendations of an American Expert panel have come to similar conclusions on how much correction of hyponatremia is enough and how much is too much, but there are important differences. We review the evidence supporting these recommendations, identifying areas that rest on relatively solid ground and highlighting areas in greatest need of additional data.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^ecf0d2d2]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia is a common electrolyte disorder associated with significant complications and controversies regarding its optimal management. Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements have attempted to provide clinicians with evidence-based diagnostic and treatment strategies for hyponatraemia. Recently published guidance documents differ in their methods employed to review the quality of available evidence. Nagler et al. used the Appraisal of Guideline for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument in a systematic review of guidelines and consensus statements for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia. Nagler and colleagues highlighted the variability in methodological rigour applied to guideline development and inconsistencies between publications in relation to management of hyponatraemia (including the recommended rate of correction of a low serum sodium concentration). These differences could cause confusion for practising physicians managing patients with hyponatraemia. Please see related article: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/12/231.

### Criteria for hyponatremic overcorrection: systematic review and cohort study of emergently ill patients [^67d24404]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disturbance amongst hospitalized patients. An overly rapid rate of correction of chronic hyponatremia is believed to increase the risk of poor clinical outcomes including osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). There is disagreement in the literature regarding the definition of hyponatremic overcorrection.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of all English language studies to identify those that calculated sodium correction rate and classified patients' overcorrection status. We then identified all patients who presented to our hospital's emergency department between 2003 and 2015 with a corrected serum sodium ≤ 116 mmol/L. All methods from the systematic review for sodium correction rate calculation and overcorrection status were applied to this cohort.

Results

We identified 24 studies citing 9 distinct sodium correction rate methods and 14 criteria for overcorrection. Six hundred twenty-four patients presenting with severe hyponatremia (median initial value 113 mMol) were identified. Depending on the method used, the median sodium correction rates in our cohort ranged from 0.271 to 1.13 mmol/L per hour. The proportion of patients classified with overcorrection with the different criteria varied almost 11-fold, ranging from 8.5 to 89.9%.

Conclusion

Published methods disagree regarding the calculation of sodium correction rates and the definition of hyponatremic overcorrection. This leads to wide variations in sodium correction rates and the prevalence of overcorrection in patient cohorts. Definitions based on ODS risk are needed.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^694c3309]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Our treatment of hyponatremia should be informed by the best possible data, addressing two critical questions: How much correction is enough and how much is too much? Valid answers to these questions require studies of populations at high risk of complications from both excessive and inadequate correction of hyponatremia — patients with very low serum sodium. A study of individuals diagnosed with MRI-documented myelinolysis in the Swedish National Patient Register during 1997–2011 identified 83 patients with the disorder; 86.7% of patients were hyponatremic (all chronic), with a median sodium level at admission of 104 mmol/L, and all but six had been corrected by > 8 mmol/L in 24 hours. To be reliable, such studies will require rigorous methods to quantify increases in serum sodium throughout the hospital course and to accurately identify all complications — not just the most severe. In the future, those methods might include sophisticated software. But for now, meticulous chart review by hand, the method used when "osmotic demyelination syndrome" was given its name 37 years ago, remains the best approach.

Thankfully, changes in practice patterns have made osmotic demyelination syndrome less common than it was in the 1980s. On the basis of what we know today, correction of a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L by > 10 mmol/L within 24 hours or by > 18 mmol/L within 48 hours should be avoided — not because raising the serum sodium too rapidly commonly causes osmotic demyelination syndrome but because it can cause the syndrome. It has always been clear that overly rapid correction of hyponatremia does not inevitably lead to osmotic demyelination; rather, it is associated with a higher risk of osmotic demyelination.

The longer the duration of hyponatremia and the lower the serum sodium, the greater the risk for injury from excessive correction. If the sodium is ≤ 105 mmol/L or if there are additional risk factors for osmotic demyelination syndrome (alcohol use disorder, hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease), correction by > 8 mmol/L per day should be considered excessive. The cost of limiting correction (more frequent blood draws and perhaps a somewhat longer hospitalization) is trivial when compared with the devastating consequences that can affect even surviving patients with osmotic demyelination syndrome. We strongly believe that abandoning established safeguards now is a bit like discarding your umbrella because you have remained dry in a rainstorm. We urge clinicians to continue to treat severe hyponatremia cautiously and to wait for better evidence before adopting less stringent therapeutic limits.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^c4869d2e]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What was known:

In patients with chronic hyponatremia plasma sodium should be gradually corrected to prevent osmotic demyelination.
Recent observational studies have reported positive experiences with oral urea for the treatment of hyponatremia, but factors associated with the correction rate are unknown.

This study adds:

Older age, lower baseline plasma sodium and higher cumulative urea dose increase the correction rate of hyponatremia during treatment with oral urea.
Combining oral urea with fluid restriction may further increase the correction rate of hyponatremia.

Potential impact:

In patients with hyponatremia who are older or have a low initial plasma sodium, oral urea may need to be given for a shorter duration without fluid restriction.
Our study also adds to the growing body of evidence that oral urea generally is a safe and effective treatment for hyponatremia.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with liver disease, AASLD 2021 guidelines recommend to set the goal rate of increase of serum sodium of 4–6 mEq/L per 24-hour period (not exceeding 8 mEq/L per 24-hour period) to ameliorate the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome when correction of chronic hyponatremia is indicated in patients with cirrhosis.

### Hypertonic saline for hyponatremia: meeting goals and avoiding harm [^ed8f360d]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypertonic saline has been used for the treatment of hyponatremia for nearly a century. There is now general consensus that hypertonic saline should be used in patients with hyponatremia associated with moderate or severe symptoms to prevent neurological complications. However, much less agreement exists among experts regarding other aspects of its use. Should hypertonic saline be administered as a bolus injection or continuous infusion? What is the appropriate dose? Is a central venous line necessary? Should desmopressin be used concomitantly and for how long? This article considers these important questions, briefly explores the historical origins of hypertonic saline use for hyponatremia, and reviews recent evidence behind its indications, dosing, administration modality and route, combined use with desmopressin to prevent rapid correction of serum sodium, and other considerations such as the need and degree for fluid restriction. The authors conclude by offering some practical recommendations for the use of hypertonic saline.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^7d6a53a1]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypotonic hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L with low osmolality) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalised adult patients. The diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia may be complex, costly, and controversial. Hyponatraemia has diverse aetiologies and is additionally defined clinically by its duration, "acute" (< 48 hours) versus "chronic" (> 48 hours), and by the presence or absence of symptoms. Management can be challenging particularly in the emergency setting where different treatment options may help or indeed harm individual patients. It is perhaps surprising that management of this electrolyte disorder has a limited evidence base in part due to the paucity of high quality randomised controlled trials. Multiple clinical practice and consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia have been published by local, national, and international organisations. These guidelines represent genuine efforts to address the diagnostic challenges and controversies in its management, particularly in relation to the rate of correction for the serum sodium concentration. The systematic review by Nagler et al. reviewing the quality of recent published guidelines and consensus statements for diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia, has highlighted important variations in both their development and recommendations.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of overly rapid correction, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to intervene promptly to re-lower the serum sodium concentration if it increases > 10 mmol/L during the first 24 hours or > 8 mmol/L in any 24-hour period thereafter.

### Disorders of sodium and water balance [^1eb0921f]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Dysnatremias occur simultaneously with disorders in water balance. The first priority is to correct dehydration; once the patient is euvolemic, the sodium level can be reassessed. In unstable patients with hyponatremia, the clinician should rapidly administer hypertonic saline. In unstable patients with hypernatremia, the clinician should administer isotonic intravenous fluid. In stable patients with either hyponatremia or hypernatremia, the clinician should aim for correction over 24 to 48 hours, with the maximal change in serum sodium between 8 to 12 mEq/L over the first 24 hours. This rate of correction decreases the chances of cerebral edema or osmotic demyelination syndrome.

### Treatment of severe hyponatremia: conventional and novel aspects [^71e6b1d1]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a frequent electrolyte disorder. A hyponatremia is called acute severe (< 115 mM) when the duration has been < 36 to 48 h. Such patients often have advanced symptoms as a result of brain edema. Acute severe hyponatremia is a medical emergency. It should be corrected rapidly to approximately 130 mM to prevent permanent brain damage. In contrast, in chronic severe hyponatremia (> 4 to 6 d), there is no brain edema and symptoms are usually mild. In such patients, a number of authors have recommended a correction rate < 0.5 mM/h to approximately 130 mM to minimize the risk of cerebral myelinolysis. Sometimes it is not possible to diagnose whether a severe hyponatremia is acute or chronic. In such cases, an initial imaging procedure is helpful in deciding whether rapid or slow correction should be prescribed. The modalities of treatment of severe hyponatremia have so far consisted of infusions of hypertonic saline plus fluid restriction. In the near future, vasopressin antagonists will become available. Preliminary experience has already demonstrated their efficiency of inducing a sustained water diuresis and a correction of hyponatremia.

### Complications and management of hyponatremia [^5b33816b]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hyponatremia causes significant morbidity, mortality, and disability. This review considers the literature of the past 18 months to improve understanding of these complications and to identify therapeutic strategies to prevent them.

Recent Findings

Acute hyponatremia causes serious brain swelling that can lead to permanent disability or death. A 4-6mEq/l increase in serum sodium is sufficient to reverse impending herniation. Brain swelling is minimal in chronic hyponatremia, and to avoid osmotic demyelination, correction should not exceed 8mEq/l/day. In high-risk patients, correction should not exceed 4-6mEq/l/day. Inadvertent overcorrection of hyponatremia is common and preventable by controlling unwanted urinary water losses with desmopressin. Even mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with increased mortality, attention deficit, gait instability, osteoporosis, and fractures, but it is not known if the correction of mild hyponatremia improves outcomes.

Summary

Controlled trials are needed to identify affordable treatments for hyponatremia that reduce the need for hospitalization, decrease hospital length of stay, and decrease morbidity. Such trials could also help answer the question of whether hyponatremia causes excess mortality or whether it is simply a marker for severe, lethal, underlying disease.

### Revisiting new data on the mortality benefit of rapid correction of hyponatremia: Déj à Vu all over again [^5ccfec94]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Studies in the 1980s linking rapid correction of severe, chronic hyponatremia to the osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) led to a major controversy that eventually gave way to consensus guidelines. Efforts to limit correction to ≤ 8 mmol/L per day in patients at high risk of developing ODS became common practice. Recent studies have questioned these guidelines, suggesting that ODS is rare and that slow correction may increase mortality. In this review, we revisit the history of the controversy and find that these claims have persisted for four decades. Older studies supporting faster correction are flawed by referral bias while newer studies are limited by confounding as comorbidities influence rates of both mortality and hyponatremia correction. While both old and new studies emphasize the rarity of MRI-documented ODS after rapid correction, they were not conducted in hyponatremic patients who were at risk for ODS. Old studies reporting hyponatremic deaths due to cerebral edema overestimate its true incidence and new studies reporting an association of mortality and slow rates of sodium correction do not document cerebral edema as a common contributor to death. Further research is required to better define the incidence of both ODS and cerebral edema in patients at risk for these complications. Until then, we conclude that the risks of rapid correction-including irreversible neurological damage-necessitate caution. Clinicians should continue to prioritize slow, controlled sodium correction to protect high-risk patients from harm.

### Hyponatremia treatment guidelines 2007: expert panel recommendations [^d18691e4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic disorder of electrolytes, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. In addition, overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic deficits and death, and optimal treatment strategies for such cases are not established. An expert panel assessed the potential contributions of aquaretic nonpeptide small-molecule arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) antagonists to hyponatremia therapies. This review presents their conclusions, including identification of appropriate treatment populations and possible future indications for aquaretic AVPR antagonists.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^b611ef4b]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder. Multiple organizations have published guidance documents to assist clinicians in managing hyponatremia. We aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of these documents.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and websites of guideline organizations and professional societies to September 2014 without language restriction for Clinical Practice Guidelines (defined as any document providing guidance informed by systematic literature review) and Consensus Statements (any other guidance document) developed specifically to guide differential diagnosis or treatment of hyponatremia. Four reviewers appraised guideline quality using the 23-item AGREE II instrument, which rates reporting of the guidance development process across six domains: scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, applicability, and editorial independence. Total scores were calculated as standardized averages by domain.

Results

We found ten guidance documents; five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements. Overall, quality was mixed: two clinical practice guidelines attained an average score of > 50% for all of the domains, three rated the evidence in a systematic way and two graded strength of the recommendations. All five consensus statements received AGREE scores below 60% for each of the specific domains. The guidance documents varied widely in scope. All dealt with therapy and seven included recommendations on diagnosis, using serum osmolality to confirm hypotonic hyponatremia, and volume status, urinary sodium concentration, and urinary osmolality for further classification of the hyponatremia. They differed, however, in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Eight guidance documents advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset (< 48 h) hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h) or asymptomatic cases, recommended treatments were NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. Eight guidance documents recommended limits for speed of increase of sodium concentration, but these varied between 8 and 12 mmol/L per 24 h. Inconsistencies also existed in the recommended dose of NaCl, its initial infusion speed, and which second line interventions to consider.

Conclusions

Current guidance documents on the assessment and treatment of hyponatremia vary in methodological rigor and recommendations are not always consistent.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatremia: a review [^90dd948b]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder and it affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia is defined by a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and most commonly results from water retention. Even mild hyponatremia is associated with increased hospital stay and mortality.

Observations

Symptoms and signs of hyponatremia range from mild and nonspecific (such as weakness or nausea) to severe and life-threatening (such as seizures or coma). Symptom severity depends on the rapidity of development, duration, and severity of hyponatremia. Mild chronic hyponatremia is associated with cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and increased rates of falls and fractures. In a prospective study, patients with hyponatremia more frequently reported a history of falling compared with people with normal serum sodium levels (23.8% vs 16.4%, respectively; P < .01) and had a higher rate of new fractures over a mean follow-up of 7.4 years (23.3% vs 17.3%; P < .004). Hyponatremia is a secondary cause of osteoporosis. When evaluating patients, clinicians should categorize them according to their fluid volume status (hypovolemic hyponatremia, euvolemic hyponatremia, or hypervolemic hyponatremia). For most patients, the approach to managing hyponatremia should consist of treating the underlying cause. Urea and vaptans can be effective treatments for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure, but have adverse effects (eg, poor palatability and gastric intolerance with urea; and overly rapid correction of hyponatremia and increased thirst with vaptans). Severely symptomatic hyponatremia (with signs of somnolence, obtundation, coma, seizures, or cardiorespiratory distress) is a medical emergency. US and European guidelines recommend treating severely symptomatic hyponatremia with bolus hypertonic saline to reverse hyponatremic encephalopathy by increasing the serum sodium level by 4 mEq/L to 6 mEq/L within 1 to 2 hours but by no more than 10 mEq/L (correction limit) within the first 24 hours. This treatment approach exceeds the correction limit in about 4.5% to 28% of people. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may cause osmotic demyelination, a rare but severe neurological condition, which can result in parkinsonism, quadriparesis, or even death.

Conclusions and Relevance

Hyponatremia affects approximately 5% of adults and 35% of patients who are hospitalized. Most patients should be managed by treating their underlying disease and according to whether they have hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Urea and vaptans can be effective in managing the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis and hyponatremia in patients with heart failure; hypertonic saline is reserved for patients with severely symptomatic hyponatremia.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^cf662663]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Practice Guidelines

After weighing the evidence, the European Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended that correction of hyponatremia be limited to 10 mmol/L in the first day of treatment and 8 mmol/L for every subsequent day thereafter. An expert panel that included six physicians from the United States and one from Ireland (which we will call the "US/Irish expert panel") came to similar conclusions, but with some added nuance (expressed in italics). For chronically hyponatremic patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L (for example, outpatients drinking conventional volumes of water or treated with thiazides and hospital-acquired hyponatremia with a known duration > 48 hours) who were at normal risk of developing osmotic demyelination, the panel recommended a correction limit of 10–12 mmol/L in any 24-hour period and 18 mmol/L in any 48-hour period and a minimum correction of 4–8 mmol/L. The panel recommended increased vigilance for patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L at heightened risk of osmotic demyelination. Factors reported to be associated with a higher risk of osmotic demyelination include sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L, alcohol use disorder, hypokalemia, malnutrition, or advanced liver disease. In these high-risk patients, the US/Irish expert panel recommended that correction should not exceed 8 mmol/L in any 24-hour period and that the minimum daily correction goal should be 4–6 mmol/L. In patients without major risk factors for osmotic demyelination, the panel noted that correction by 8–12 mmol/L in the first day of therapy was greater than necessary, but unlikely to cause harm as long as the 2-day increment does not exceed 18 mmol/L.

### Hyponatremia treatment guidelines-have they gone too far? [^f24f927c]. NEJM Evidence (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte abnormality affecting hospitalized patients. 1 It is an independent predictor for mortality and is associated with increased length of hospital stay and higher costs. The most serious potential complication is hyponatremic encephalopathy, a medical emergency that can result in death or irreversible brain injury if inadequately treated. 2 Hypertonic saline is a safe and effective means of correcting hyponatremia. 2–4 A rare yet serious complication from excessive correction of chronic hyponatremia is the development of cerebral demyelination.

### Overcorrection of hyponatremia is a medical emergency [^45ce3032]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Overcorrection of hyponatremia is a medical emergency. Excessive correction usually results from the unexpected emergence of a water diuresis after resolution of the cause of water retention. The concurrent administration of desmopressin and 5% dextrose in water can be given to cautiously re-lower the serum sodium concentration when therapeutic limits have been exceeded. Nephrologists should be equally aggressive in correcting hyponatremia and in un-correcting it when their patients get too much of a good thing.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^bcbfb0d7]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Subsequently, several studies confirmed that osmotic demyelination was associated with more rapid rates of correction of chronic hyponatremia. – Excluding case series on the basis of patient referrals, studies of patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L that include data on correction rates and outcomes are presented in Table 1. The frequency of osmotic demyelination varied widely among studies, depending on pretreatment serum sodium, correction rate, and method of identifying post-therapeutic neurologic sequelae. However, it is apparent that in patients with chronic hyponatremia, the lower the serum sodium and the larger the increase, the more likely that osmotic demyelination will be identified.

Table 1
Post-treatment neurologic sequelae in studies of patients with serum sodium concentrations ≤ 120 mmol/L

When osmotic demyelination syndrome was first described, it was widely believed that to avoid potentially fatal neurologic complications of severe symptomatic hyponatremia, it was important to rapidly raise the serum sodium to a "safe" level above 120 mmol/L and, according to some experts, to as high as 130 mmol/L. At a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L, it becomes impossible to both raise the serum sodium to a "safe" level and avoid correction by > 12 mmol/L per day; a choice must be made between the risks of persistent, severe hyponatremia, and the risks of osmotic demyelination. Because a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L is uncommon, a letter was sent to all members of the American Society of Nephrology seeking data on patients with a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L who had been recently treated, regardless of outcome. Data on 56 patients obtained from 40 medical centers confirmed that outcomes depend on the chronicity of hyponatremia, as previously defined: While none of the 18 patients with acute hyponatremia suffered complications, regardless of correction rate, 14 of 28 patients with chronic hyponatremia corrected by > 12 mmol/L in 24 hours developed post-therapeutic neurologic complications; in most, the clinical course was consistent with CPM (a delayed onset of neurologic symptoms beginning 2–6 days after initial improvement), but only three had CPM documented by imaging. The amount of correction over 48 hours was also associated with post-therapeutic complications: 14 of 27 chronic patients (52%) corrected by > 18 mmol/L in 48 hours were affected. All patients corrected by > 12 mmol/L in 24 hours had also been corrected by > 18 mmol/L in 48 hours, and all but one corrected by < 12 mmol/L in 24 hours were corrected by < 18 mmol/L in 48 hours.

### Management of hyponatremia in the ICU [^9c2bc8f2]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is common in critical care units. Avoidance of neurologic injury requires a clear understanding of why the serum sodium (Na) concentration falls and why it rises, how the brain responds to a changing serum Na concentration, and what the goals of therapy should be. A 4 to 6 mEq/L increase in serum Na concentration is sufficient to treat life-threatening cerebral edema caused by acute hyponatremia. In chronic (> 48 h), severe (< 120 mEq/L) hyponatremia, correction by > 8 to 10 mEq/L/d risks iatrogenic osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS); therefore, a 4 to 6 mEq/L daily increase in serum Na concentration should be the goal in most patients. With the possible exception of hyponatremia caused by heart failure or hepatic cirrhosis, a rapid initial increase in serum Na for severe symptoms and avoidance of overcorrection are best achieved with 3% saline given in either a peripheral or central vein. Inadvertent overcorrection can be avoided in high-risk patients with chronic hyponatremia by administration of desmopressin to prevent excessive urinary water losses. In patients with hyponatremia with oliguric kidney failure, controlled correction can be achieved with modified hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapies. ODS is potentially reversible, even in severely affected patients who are quadriplegic, unresponsive, and ventilator dependent. Supportive care should be offered several weeks before concluding that the condition is hopeless.

### Disorders of water imbalance [^d84fe6e6]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Disorders of water imbalance manifest as hyponatremia and hypernatremia. To diagnose these disorders, emergency physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion, especially in the high-risk patient, because clinical presentations may be nonspecific. With severe water imbalance, inappropriate fluid resuscitation in the emergency department may have devastating neurological consequences. The rate of serum sodium concentration correction should be monitored closely to avoid osmotic demyelination syndrome in hyponatremic patients and cerebral edema in hypernatremic patients.

### Hyponatremia: clinical diagnosis and management [^942c05b7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common clinical problem in hospitalized patients and nursing home residents. It also may occur in healthy athletes after endurance exercise. The majority of patients with hyponatremia are asymptomatic and do not require immediate correction of hyponatremia. Symptomatic hyponatremia is a medical emergency requiring rapid correction to prevent the worsening of brain edema. How fast we should increase the serum sodium levels depends on the onset of hyponatremia and still remains controversial. If the serum sodium levels are corrected too rapidly, patients may develop central pontine myelinolysis, but if they are corrected too slowly, patients may die of brain herniation. We review the epidemiology and mechanisms of hyponatremia, the sensitivity of women to hyponatremic injury, the adaptation and maladaptation of brain cells to hyponatremia and its correction, and the practical ways of managing hyponatremia. Because the majority of hyponatremia is caused by the non-osmotic release of vasopressin, the recent approval of the vasopressin receptor antagonist conivaptan for euvolemic hyponatremia may simplify hyponatremia management. However, physicians should be aware of the risk of rapid correction of hyponatremia, hypotension, and excessive fluid intake.

### Severe hyponatremia correction, mortality, and central pontine myelinolysis [^67c65547]. NEJM Evidence (2023). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND: In clinical practice, sodium correction rates are frequently limited in patients with severe hyponatremia to prevent neurologic complications. The implications of correction rates on overall mortality and length of hospital stay are unclear. METHODS: In this multicenter observational study, we evaluated the association of sodium correction rates with mortality, length of stay, and central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) in patients hospitalized with severe hyponatremia (admission serum sodium level less than 120 mEq/l). RESULTS: The cohort included 3274 patients. A correction rate of less than 6 mEq/l/24 hours was observed in 38%, 6 to 10 mEq/l/24 hours was observed in 29%, and greater than 10 mEq/l/24 hours was observed in 33%. Compared with 6 to 10 mEq/l/24 hours, a correction rate of less than 6 mEq/l/24 hours exhibited higher in-hospital mortality in multivariable-adjusted and propensity score–weighted analyses. Compared with 6 to 10 mEq/l/24 hours, a correction rate of greater than 10 mEq/l/24 hours was associated with lower in-hospital mortality and shorter length of stay in multivariable analyses. Seven patients with CPM were identified, with five of seven developing CPM despite a sodium correction rate of less than or equal to 8 mEq/l/24 hours. Six of seven patients who developed CPM had alcohol use disorder, malnutrition, hypokalemia, or hypophosphatemia. CONCLUSIONS: Limiting the sodium correction rate was associated with higher mortality and longer length of stay. Whether the sodium correction rate influences neurologic complications needs further evaluation.

### Desmopressin to prevent rapid sodium correction in severe hyponatremia: a systematic review [^fc1bb7cf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hyponatremia is common among inpatients and is associated with severe adverse outcomes such as osmotic demyelination syndrome. Current guidelines recommend serum sodium concentration correction targets of no more than 8 mEq/L per day in patients at high risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome. Desmopressin is recommended to control high rates of serum sodium concentration correction in severe hyponatremia. However, recommendations are based on limited data. The objective of this study is to review current strategies for DDAVP use in severe hyponatremia.

Methods

Systematic literature search of 4 databases of peer-reviewed studies was performed and study quality was appraised.

Results

The literature search identified 17 observational studies with 80 patients. We found 3 strategies for desmopressin administration in hyponatremia: 1) proactive, where desmopressin is administered early based on initial serum sodium concentration; 2) reactive, where desmopressin is administered based on changes in serum sodium concentration or urine output; 3) rescue, where desmopressin is administered after serum sodium correction targets are exceeded or when osmotic demyelination appears imminent. A proactive strategy of desmopressin administration with hypertonic saline was associated with lower incidence of exceeding serum sodium concentration correction targets, although this evidence is derived from a small case series.

Conclusions

Three distinct strategies for desmopressin administration are described in the literature. Limitations in study design and sample size prevent definitive conclusions about the optimal strategy for desmopressin administration to correct hyponatremia. There is a pressing need for better quality research to guide clinicians in managing severe hyponatremia.

Acute hyponatremia can cause death if cerebral edema is not treated promptly. Conversely, if chronic hyponatremia is corrected too rapidly, osmotic demyelination may ensue, which also potentially is lethal. However, these severe complications of hyponatremia are relatively uncommon and often preventable. More commonly, hyponatremia predicts mortality in patients with advanced heart failure or liver cirrhosis. In these conditions, it generally is assumed that hyponatremia reflects the severity of the underlying disease rather than contributing directly to mortality. The same assumption holds for the recently reported associations between hyponatremia and mortality in patients with pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, pneumonia, and myocardial infarction. However, recent data suggest that chronic and mild hyponatremia in the general population also are associated with mortality. In addition, hyponatremia has been associated with mortality in long-term hemodialysis patients without residual function in whom the underlying disease cannot be responsible for hyponatremia. These new data raise the question of whether hyponatremia by itself can contribute to mortality or it remains a surrogate marker for other unknown risk factors. We review hyponatremia and mortality and explore the possibility that hyponatremia perturbs normal physiology in the absence of cerebral edema or osmotic demyelination.

Figure 7.
Principles of management of acute vs chronic hyponatremia, and potential risks. Intensity of shading is a visual representation of osmolality. In acute hyponatremia, cerebral osmolar adaptation has not yet occurred so it is acceptable to allow (or induce) rapid correction of serum sodium, with low risk of ODS. We advocate a cutoff of hyponatremia duration less than 24 hours rather than 48 hours to maximize the safety of this approach. In hyponatremia with severe symptoms of any (or unknown) duration, emergency management with bolus hypertonic saline is indicated to prevent progression of potentially life-threatening cerebral edema (see "Emergency Management of Severe Hyponatremia"). Once the target initial increment of serum sodium rise is achieved (eg, 4–6 mmol/L) and/or if symptoms improve, ongoing correction is determined by duration of hyponatremia. If duration is unknown, it is safest to assume it to be chronic and aim for gradual correction. In chronic hyponatremia, gradual correction of serum sodium allows for restoration of brain tissue osmolality toward the normal range with the import or synthesis of osmolytes (sodium, potassium, organic osmolytes as discussed in Fig. 3), and slow exit of excess intracellular water. The typical target rate of correction is 5 to 8 mmol/L per 24 hours, or lower for those with risk factors for ODS. If rapid correction of serum sodium above the target rate occurs (overcorrection, eg, > 10 mmol/L within 24 hours), it is advised to relower serum sodium (eg, with IV dextrose 5%, and/or desmopressin (DDAVP), see "In Case of Overcorrection: Relowering of Plasma Sodium" below) to prevent the rare complication of ODS. ODS can occur as a consequence of rapid exit of intracellular water damaging the myelin sheath, particularly in the pons, and can cause devastating neurological outcomes or death. Onset of symptoms of ODS is often delayed. Subsequent correction after relowering should be gradual.

### Diagnosis and management of disorders of body tonicity-hyponatremia and hypernatremia: core curriculum 2020 [^861c01c9]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Overall body fluid concentration is regulated within a narrow range by the concerted action of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis to influence water intake through thirst and water excretion via the effect of vasopressin, or antidiuretic hormone, on renal collecting duct water permeability. Sodium is the principal extracellular cation; abnormalities in overall effective body fluid concentration, or tonicity, manifest as disturbances in serum sodium concentration. Depending on its severity and chronicity, hyponatremia can lead to significant symptoms, primarily related to central nervous system function. Failure to correct hyponatremia can lead to permanent neurologic damage, as can over rapid correction. It is thus essential to stay within specific limits for correction, particularly for chronic hyponatremia. Hypernatremia also leads to central nervous system dysfunction, although goals for its correction rate are less well established. This Core Curriculum article discusses the normal regulation of tonicity and serum sodium concentration and the diagnosis and management of hypo- and hypernatremia.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) — acute in-hospital treatment recommendations — Oral and IV hypotonic or isotonic hydration should be avoided early in the management of EAH, although it may be appropriate in certain clinical contexts once sodium correction has been initiated or hypovolemia is confirmed. Recommendation grade: 1C. With suspected EAH, and particularly in those with altered mental status, sodium estimation should be obtained as rapidly as possible after hospital arrival. Recommendation grade: 1A. A rapid assessment for signs and symptoms of cerebral edema or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema should be done in all patients with possible EAH. Recommendation grade: 1A. Severe EAH biochemically confirmed or symptomatic EAH should be treated with a 100-mL bolus of IV HTS, which can be repeated twice at 10-min intervals (3 doses in total) or until improvement of neurologic symptoms, with the aim of acutely increasing serum sodium concentration by about 4 to 5 mmol·L−1 and reversing cerebral edema. Recommendation grade: 1A.

### Hyponatremia demystified: integrating physiology to shape clinical practice [^4781b0ea]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is one of the most common problems encountered in clinical practice and one of the least-understood because accurate diagnosis and management require some familiarity with water homeostasis physiology, making the topic seemingly complex. The prevalence of hyponatremia depends on the nature of the population studied and the criteria used to define it. Hyponatremia is associated with poor outcomes including increased mortality and morbidity. The pathogenesis of hypotonic hyponatremia involves the accumulation of electrolyte-free water caused by either increased intake and/or decrease in kidney excretion. Plasma osmolality, urine osmolality, and urine sodium can help to differentiate among the different etiologies. Brain adaptation to plasma hypotonicity consisting of solute extrusion to mitigate further water influx into brain cells best explains the clinical manifestations of hyponatremia. Acute hyponatremia has an onset within 48 hours, commonly resulting in severe symptoms, while chronic hyponatremia develops over 48 hours and usually is pauci-symptomatic. However, the latter increases the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome if hyponatremia is corrected rapidly; therefore, extreme caution must be exercised when correcting plasma sodium. Management strategies depend on the presence of symptoms and the cause of hyponatremia and are discussed in this review.

Regarding medical management for portal hypertension, more specifically with respect to management of ascites (correction of hyponatremia), AASLD 2021 guidelines recommend to set the goal rate of increase of serum sodium of 4–6 mEq/L per 24-hour period (not exceeding 8 mEq/L per 24-hour period) to ameliorate the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome when correction of chronic hyponatremia is indicated in patients with cirrhosis.

### Vasopressin receptor antagonists for the treatment of hyponatremia: systematic review and meta-analysis [^33f332b8]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia, the effect of vasopressin antagonists is yet undefined.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Setting & Population

In- and outpatients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia.

Selection Criteria For Studies

We included all RCTs regardless of publication status or language.

Intervention

Vasopressin antagonists with or without fluid restriction versus placebo or no treatment with or without fluid restriction.

Outcomes

Response rate defined as normalization of serum sodium level or significant increase in serum sodium level at 3–7 days (primary) and later, change from baseline serum sodium level at 3–7 days and later, adverse events, rate of rapid sodium level correction, and rate of hypernatremia.

Results

15 RCTs were identified. Vasopressin antagonist treatment significantly increased response rate both early (RR, 3.15; 95% CI, 2.27–4.37; 11 trials) and late (RR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.79–2.89; 4 trials). Response rates were high in trials assessing mostly euvolemic patients and those assessing mostly hypervolemic patients, with greater effect estimate in the former. Change from baseline serum sodium level was significantly increased both early (weighted mean difference, 5.27 mEq/L; 95% CI, 4.27–6.26, 13 trials) and late (weighted mean difference, 3.49 mEq/L; 95% CI, 2.56–4.41, 8 trials). Although there was an increased rate of rapid sodium correction (RR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.26–5.08, 8 trials) with vasopressin antagonists, hypernatremia rates were not significantly higher (RR, 2.21; 95% CI, 0.61–7.96; 5 trials), adverse events were not increased, and there were no reports of osmotic demyelination syndrome.

Limitations

Significant heterogeneity in the primary outcome.

Conclusions

Vasopressin antagonists are effective for the treatment of hypervolemic and euvolemic hyponatremia.

### Hypertonic saline for hyponatremia: risk of inadvertent overcorrection [^015d1386]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Data regarding dosage-response relationships for using hypertonic saline in treatment of hyponatremia are extremely limited. Objectives of this study were to assess adherence to previously published guidelines (limiting correction to < 12 mEq/L per d and < 18 mEq/L per 48 h) in treating hyponatremia with hypertonic saline and to determine the predictive accuracy of the Adrogué-Madias formula.

Design, Setting, Participants & Measurements

A retrospective review was conducted of all 62 adult, hyponatremic patients who were treated with hypertonic saline during 5 yr at a 528-bed, acute care, teaching hospital.

Results

Median infusion rate was 0.38 ml/kg per h, increasing serum sodium concentration by 0.47 ± 0.05 mEq/L per h, 7.1 ± 0.6 mEq/L per 24 h, and 11.3 ± 0.7 mEq/L per 48 h. In 11.3% of cases, the increase was > 12 mEq/L per 24 h and in 9.7% was > 18 mEq/L per 48 h. No patient's rate was corrected by > 25 mEq/L per 48 h. Among patients with serum sodium < 120 mEq/L, the observed increase in sodium exceeded the rise predicted by the Adrogué-Madias formula in 74.2%; the average correction in overcorrectors was 2.4 times the predicted. Inadvertent overcorrection was due to documented water diuresis in 40% of cases.

Conclusions

The Adrogué-Madias formula underestimates increase in sodium concentration after hypertonic saline therapy. Unrecognized hypovolemia and other reversible causes of water retention pose a risk for inadvertent overcorrection. Hypertonic saline should be infused at rates lower than those predicted by formulas with close monitoring of serum sodium and urine output.

### Severe hyponatremia in the emergency department incidence of cerebral edema and risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome [^a69d55f3]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Treatment strategies in severe hyponatremia aim at rapid sodium correction to prevent or treat cerebral edema but limit sodium rise to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). The true risk of edema or ODS in ED patients is unknown.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study of patients admitted to the ED of a tertiary hospital from January 2013 to December 2018 with plasma sodium ≤ 125mmol/L. The rate of cerebral edema at presentation and the rate of ODS that developed during the stay were determined based on imaging studies and clinical evaluation. Secondary analyses looked at the association between overly rapid sodium correction (> 8mmol/L) at 24h, ODS risk, mortality, and length of stay.

Results

The primary analysis group comprised 852 patients; 318 (37%) of these presented with severe symptoms. Four patients (0.5%) with cerebral edema and 11 patients (1.3%) with ODS were detected. Alcoholism, liver disease, and malnutrition were identified as risk factors for ODS. While overly rapid correction showed no association with ODS in the primary analysis group, it became the predominant risk factor in a reduced dataset with a more accurate estimate of 24-h sodium correction. Correction rate had no impact on mortality or length of stay.

Conclusions

Given the low rate of cerebral edema even in severely symptomatic patients, aggressive treatment may not be necessary in most cases. The risk to develop ODS seems to be higher than the risk of brain edema. Since we found no beneficial impact of a liberal correction strategy, current treatment limits should stay in place.

### Brain volume regulation in response to hypo-osmolality and its correction [^0feedf3c]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia exerts most of its clinical effects on the brain. An acute onset (usually in < 24 hours) of hyponatremia causes severe, and sometimes fatal, cerebral edema. Given time, the brain adapts to hyponatremia, permitting survival despite extraordinarily low serum sodium concentrations. Adaptation to severe hyponatremia is critically dependent on the loss of organic osmolytes from brain cells. These intracellular, osmotically active solutes contribute substantially to the osmolality of cell water and do not adversely affect cell functions when their concentration changes. The adaptation that permits survival in patients with severe, chronic (> 48 hours' duration) hyponatremia also makes the brain vulnerable to injury (osmotic demyelination) if the electrolyte disturbance is corrected too rapidly. The reuptake of organic osmolytes after correction of hyponatremia is slower than the loss of organic osmolytes during the adaptation to hyponatremia. Areas of the brain that remain most depleted of organic osmolytes are the most severely injured by rapid correction. The brain's reuptake of myoinositol, one of the most abundant osmolytes, occurs much more rapidly in a uremic environment, and patients with uremia are less susceptible to osmotic demyelination. In an experimental model of chronic hyponatremia, exogenous administration of myoinositol speeds the brain's reuptake of the osmolyte and reduces osmotic demyelination and mortality caused by rapid correction.

### Evaluation of serum sodium correction rates for management of hyponatremia in hospitalized patients [^45aa6020]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Appropriate correction of hyponatremia can reduce complications such as osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS).

Objective

To evaluate rates of serum sodium correction in hyponatremic hospitalized patients and identify factors associated with higher rates of overcorrection.

Methods

This is an institutional review board-approved single-center, retrospective chart review of patients ≥ 18 years of age with at least 1 serum sodium < 130 mEq/L during hospitalization. The primary end point was percentage of patients appropriately corrected for hyponatremia. Appropriate correction was defined as a sodium change ≤ 12 mEq/L over 24 hours and 18 mEq/L over 48 hours, and overcorrection was defined as an increase in serum sodium exceeding these cutoffs. Secondary end points included incidence of ODS, poor neurological outcome, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital lengths of stay (LOSs), and in-hospital mortality.

Results

Of 234 patients evaluated, 100 were included. Mean age was 72 ± 16 years, and 47% were male. Overcorrection occurred in 14 patients. There was no incidence of ODS. Rates of poor neurological outcome (P = 0.77), ICU (P = 0.09) and hospital LOS (P = 0.13), and in-hospital mortality (P = 0.20) were similar between appropriately corrected and overcorrected patients. Using a logistic regression analysis, severe hyponatremia (serum sodium < 120 mEq/L; P = 0.0122) and history of alcohol use disorder (P < 0.001) were risk factors found to be associated with overcorrection.

Conclusion and Relevance

Overcorrection of hyponatremia occurred in 14% of patients in this study. To minimize this risk, further caution should be taken when managing patients presenting with identified risk factors.

### Where Do the salt and water Go? A case of profound hyponatremia [^3661cbcd]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment of profound hyponatremia is challenging. Severe symptoms mandate correction by 4 to 6 mEq/L within hours, but with risk factors for osmotic demyelination, daily correction should be < 8 mEq/L. With a therapeutic window this narrow, clinicians would like to know how serum sodium (SNa) concentration will respond to their therapy. Based on isotopic measurements, Edelman showed SNa level to be a function of exchangeable sodium and potassium divided by total-body water. Edelman defined this relationship with linear regression yielding an equation of the form y = mx + b, where y is SNa level, x is exchangeable sodium and potassium divided by total-body water, m is the slope, and b is the intercept. Edelman said that the intercept of his regression "probably is a measure of the quantity of osmotically inactive exchangeable sodium and potassium per unit of body water". Predictive formulas are derived from Edelman's original linear regression, some including and some omitting the regression's intercept. We illustrate the performance and limitations of these formulas using comprehensive data for electrolyte and fluid balance obtained during the treatment of a critically patient who presented with an SNa concentration of 101 mEq/L.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^c07aa03b]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

The efficacy of oral urea was reported as early as the 1980s, but its use remained rather limited. In recent years oral urea was "rediscovered", with several observational studies reporting positive experiences for the treatment of hyponatremia. A recent systematic review confirmed that oral urea is an effective, safe and inexpensive treatment option for SIAD despite the lack of data from randomized controlled trials.

With the use of oral urea for SIAD becoming more widespread, it is also becoming increasingly important to better understand which clinical factors determine the hyponatremia correction rate during treatment. For example, several studies have shown that a lower baseline plasma sodium concentration predicts more rapid correction of hyponatremia, but it is not known whether this also pertains to treatment with oral urea. Previous studies also identified specific parameters that were associated with the response to therapy, including urine osmolality for fluid restriction and body weight for hypertonic saline. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate which clinical factors are associated with hyponatremia correction. To address this, we analyzed the hyponatremia correction rate during oral urea treatment in 140 patients from two university medical centers.

### A mathematical approach to severe hyponatremia and hypernatremia in renal replacement therapies [^908c4563]. Seminars in Dialysis (2021). Medium credibility.

Severe dysnatremias are perplexing problems in patients undergoing renal replacement therapy on a chronic or acute basis. The ability to manipulate sodium concentration in the dialysate or replacement solutions is limited. Compounding dialysate or replacement fluids to alter sodium concentration could result in errors. Rapid correction of hyponatremia or hypernatremia due to equilibrium with dialysate or replacement solutions could lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome or cerebral edema respectively. Continuous renal replacement therapy is the preferred dialysis modality in patients with severe dysnatremias. In this article, we present simple formulas to determine the rate of hypotonic or hypertonic solutions needed to mitigate rapid correction of dysnatremias. These formulas can be used readily by the clinician at bedside.

### Caution of overdependence on formulas while treating hyponatremia [^b4cd5c38]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Use of online formulas to treat hyponatremia is a common practice. We report here that while using the same goal of correction and type of infusate to treat a patient with hyponatremia, a large discrepancy in infusion rate is obtained from using the 2 commonly available online equations. When the therapy fluid is less concentrated saline (0.9%), Adrogue's formula poses the risk of large amount of volume being administered for only a small change in serum sodium concentration. This may be detrimental especially in patients with congestive heart failure. When the therapy fluid is hypertonic saline (3%), these formulas may result in overly rapid correction. We should, thus, never use these formulas blindly in the management of patients with hyponatremia.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^f84ee988]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Severity

Hyponatremia is considered as severe if [Na] is < 115 or 110 mmol/L. In addition, all cases of hyponatremia treated with hypertonic or isotonic saline infusion, including hypovolemia with hyponatremia and absence of overt neurological manifestations, should be considered as severe because of the risks from saline infusion. Saline infusion for hypovolemic hyponatremia carries arguably the highest risk of inadvertently rapid rise in[Na].

Target Serum Sodium Concentration

The targeted rise in [Na] depends on the perceived urgency of treatment. In patients with pronounced hyponatremic symptoms, regardless of chronicity, a rapid rise of 4 to 6 mEq/L is recommended. Further rises may be required if symptoms persist after the initial rise in [Na]. For chronic hyponatremia, previous recommendations set a maximal rate of rise in [Na] at 12 mEq/L in the first 24 hours and a maximal final [Na] of 125 to 130 mEq/L. Because osmotic myelinolysis was observed in patients achieving the desired rate of rise in [Na], the current target rise in [Na] is set at 6 to 8 mEq/L in 24 hours, 12 to 14 mEq/L in 48 hours, and 14 to 16 mEq/L in 72 hours. Prevention of hypernatremia during treatment of hyponatremia is imperative.

Regarding medical management for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to management of severely symptomatic patients, initial management, AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend to consider administering bolus or continuous infusions of 3% hypertonic saline in patients with a sodium concentration of < 125 mEq/L and moderate or severe symptoms. Recognize that bolus infusion improves sodium concentration more quickly with less overcorrection.

### Lithium [^82bc3099]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hyponatremia

Lithium can cause hyponatremia by decreasing sodium reabsorption by the renal tubules, leading to sodium depletion. Therefore, it is essential for patients receiving lithium treatment to maintain a normal diet, including salt, and an adequate fluid intake (2500 to 3000 mL) at least during the initial stabilization period. Decreased tolerance to lithium has also been reported to ensue from protracted sweating or diarrhea and, if such occur, supplemental fluid and salt should be administered under careful medical supervision and lithium intake reduced or suspended until the condition is resolved. In addition, concomitant infection with elevated temperatures may also necessitate a temporary reduction or cessation of medication.

Symptoms are also more severe with faster-onset hyponatremia. Mild hyponatremia (i.e., serum Na > 120 mEq/L) can be asymptomatic. Below this threshold, clinical signs are usually present, consisting mainly of changes in mental status, such as altered personality, lethargy, and confusion. For more severe hyponatremia (serum Na < 115 mEq/L), stupor, neuromuscular hyperexcitability, hyperreflexia, seizures, coma, and death can result. During treatment of hyponatremia, serum sodium should not be elevated by more than 10 to 12 mEq/L in 24 hours, or 18 mEq/L in 48 hours. In the case of severe hyponatremia where severe neurologic symptoms are present, a faster infusion rate to correct serum sodium concentration may be needed. Patients rapidly treated or with serum sodium < 120mEq/L are more at risk of developing osmotic demyelination syndrome (previously called central pontine myelinolysis). Occurrence is more common among patients with alcoholism, undernutrition, or other chronic debilitating illness. Common signs include flaccid paralysis, dysarthria. In severe cases with extended lesions patients may develop a locked-in syndrome (generalized motor paralysis). Damage often is permanent. If neurologic symptoms start to develop during treatment of hyponatremia, serum sodium correction should be suspended to mitigate the development of permanent neurologic damage.

### Recent developments in the management of acute and chronic hyponatremia [^02a35807]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of the study is to review recent studies on the management of acute and chronic hyponatremia.

Recent Findings

In acute symptomatic hyponatremia, bolus infusion of hypertonic saline improves hyponatremia and neurological status more quickly than continuous infusion. In chronic hyponatremia, newly identified predictors of nonresponse to fluid restriction include a high urine osmolality (> 500mOsm/kg) and high urine sodium (> 133mmol/l). Vasopressin-receptor antagonists effectively raise the serum sodium concentration in patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia but have a risk of overcorrection, even at low doses. Several observational studies now support the use of urea for a more gradual correction of hyponatremia without a risk of overcorrection. Recently identified risk factors for overcorrection include lower serum sodium at presentation, polydipsia, hypovolemia, and early urine output during treatment. Specific treatments with potential efficacy are the use of intravenous albumin for hyponatremia because of liver cirrhosis, and fludrocortisone for hyponatremia in tuberculous meningitis.

Summary

The recent data will help to further optimize and personalize the management of patients with acute and chronic hyponatremia. However, most data are still observational and retrospective. Therefore, the field is in need of prospective studies comparing interventions for chronic hyponatremia and focusing on patient-relevant outcomes.

### Does uremia protect against the demyelination associated with correction of hyponatremia during hemodialysis? A case report and literature review [^0f092e3c]. Seminars in Dialysis (2003). Low credibility.

Rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia is known to cause demyelination syndromes, which are attributed to the rapid shift of water out of the brain. In uremic patients with hyponatremia, depending on the dialysate sodium concentration and delivered Kt/V, serum sodium levels may be rapidly corrected inadvertently during the hemodialysis (HD) session. It is not known whether uremic patients are as susceptible to the development of demyelination as patients with normal renal function. Since urea diffuses slowly across the blood-brain barrier, it can act as an effective osmole between plasma and the brain if levels are changed abruptly. During HD, blood urea levels drop suddenly and significantly and cerebral edema may develop (dialysis disequilibrium syndrome). This effect may counteract the fluid shift out of the brain during correction of hyponatremia. Therefore, theoretically, uremic patients may be less prone to develop demyelination. We present a patient with renal failure whose hyponatremia was corrected rapidly during HD to illustrate the potential problem. The patient tolerated rapid correction of hyponatremia without sustaining any neurologic damage. We performed a literature search looking for similar case reports and reviewed the scientific evidence behind the above hypothesis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^a2b2894e]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Guidelines received the highest scores for scope and purpose (median 62%; range 28% to 92%) and clarity of presentation (median 47%; range 27% to 75%), and lowest scores for applicability (median 19%; range 10% to 68%) and editorial independence (median 19%; range 2% to 79%).

Initial appraisal results differed more than one point on the Likert scale between two or more reviewers for 143/230 items (62%). The majority of discrepancies were found in the domain 'Clarity of Presentation', with 90% of items differing more than one point. Group discussion resulted in 287/920 (31%) of individual entries being changed. Finally, no scores differed more than two points and for 82% of items, scores were the same or within one point of each other. Major reasons for changing an entry were a change of own opinion after clarification of the opinion of other reviewers during the group discussion (180/920 entries; 20% entries); aiming for consistency between entries given same available data (39/920; 4%); re-evaluation of the score in light of a noted comment during the appraisal process (30/920; 3%); correction for available data that were overlooked during the initial appraisal (22/920; 2%); misinterpretation of the question during the initial appraisal (6/920; 0.7%); adjusting for arbitrary scoring of items that were felt to be inapplicable for some reason (3/920; 0.3%); adjusting for inconsistent approach to deal with the assumption that a criterion was fulfilled even if this was not clearly mentioned (4/920; 0.4%); and data entry error (3/920, 0.3%). Overall, this resulted in 29/60 (48%) of standardized domain scores being downgraded by a maximum of 10% and 10/60 (17%) of standardized domain scores being upgraded with a maximum of 10%; the remaining 35% remained unchanged.

Synthesis of recommendations

The included guidance documents addressed three major themes: diagnosis, treatment, and speed of correction.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^5f4beb21]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

For patients presenting with severe symptoms, the European Clinical Practice Guidelines and US/Irish expert panel both advocate bolus infusions of hypertonic saline in an effort to raise the serum sodium by 5 mmol/L (European) or by 4–6 mmol/L (US/Irish) within a few hours. An increase of this magnitude is sufficient to markedly reduce intracranial pressure and can reverse impending brain herniation. Bolus infusion of hypertonic saline has been reported to achieve the desired increment in serum sodium more rapidly than a continuous infusion of 3% saline, and it is associated with better clinical outcomes.

After treatment with either isotonic saline or hypertonic saline given by bolus or continuous infusion, the serum sodium often increases by more than intended. Indeed, the risk of "overshooting the mark" is one of the stated reasons for setting conservative correction goals when treating patients for severe hyponatremia. However, the main reason for an excessive rise in serum sodium is not an excessive dose of saline; rather, it is the sudden elimination of a large volume of dilute urine. If the cause of water retention and hyponatremia resolves, a water diuresis (often called an aquaresis) will emerge during treatment and can increase serum sodium by more than 2 mmol/L per hour. For this reason, in patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L, it is important to measure the serum sodium frequently and to monitor urine output carefully during treatment.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^2784c628]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

As ODS can be a devastating outcome, overcorrection should be scrupulously avoided to reduce risk. For this reason, recommended sodium correction targets often err on the conservative side for safety, particularly in those with risk factors for ODS for whom a daily correction limit of 6 to 8 mmol/L per 24 hours is endorsed by US expert opinion guidelines (Table 4). It is the net 24-hour change in pNa rather than the precise hourly rate of correction that is most important.

Table 4.
Recommended plasma sodium concentration daily correction targets and limits in current hyponatremia guidelines

The management of patients who develop ODS is outside the scope of this review, but in brief, there are no established therapies. To maintain correction within the goal range, relowering of serum sodium with hypotonic fluid and/or desmopressin may be required if pNa targets are surpassed, and can still be beneficial even for those who have developed early symptoms of ODS (see "In Case of Overcorrection: Relowering of Plasma Sodium"). Case reports describe good outcomes after treatment of ODS with glucocorticoids, plasmapheresis, IV immunoglobulin, and zolpidem; however, it is unclear if improvements occurred as the result of these interventions. Glucocorticoids have been assessed in animal models of ODS and have shown reduced histological damage, but there are conflicting data with respect to mortality benefit. Nevertheless, glucocorticoid therapy after overcorrection is recommended in US expert guidelines for those with baseline a pNa less than 120 mmol/L. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that administration of osmolytes such as urea or myo-inositol can protect against myelinolysis but they are not routinely recommended for this particular indication (see "Urea" for urea use). Plasmapheresis, which may remove "myelotoxins" from the circulation, and/or restore organic osmolytes, is the experimental therapy most frequently reported to have benefit and requires further evaluation. Supportive care measures such as intubation and ventilation, and in patients who survive, prolonged neurorehabilitation may be required. Optimal management of ODS when it does occur is an important area for future research.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^da27b5c4]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to management of hyponatremia, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to limit the use of hypertonic saline in the management of hypervolemic hyponatremia to the rare cases presenting with life-threatening complications. Consider administering hypertonic saline in patients with severe hyponatremia expected to get liver transplantation within a few days. Correct the serum sodium concentration slowly (≤ 8 mmol/L per day), once an attenuation of symptoms has been obtained, to avoid irreversible neurological sequelae, such as osmotic demyelination.

### Principles of management of severe hyponatremia [^f3154383]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Accurate diagnosis of the cause, pathogenesis and chronicity, and monitoring during treatment are the critical parts of the management of severe hyponatremias. We stress that calculation errors are possible even with the best formulas, and frequent monitoring of the patient during therapy is absolutely essential to ensure optimal chances for recovery.

### Current treatment practice and outcomes. report of the hyponatremia registry [^5180895f]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

Current management practices for hyponatremia (HN) are incompletely understood. The HN Registry has recorded diagnostic measures, utilization, efficacy, and outcomes of therapy for eu- or hypervolemic HN. To better understand current practices, we analyzed data from 3087 adjudicated adult patients in the registry with serum sodium concentration of 130 mEq/l or less from 225 sites in the United States and European Union. Common initial monotherapy treatments were fluid restriction (35%), administration of isotonic (15%) or hypertonic saline (2%), and tolvaptan (5%); 17% received no active agent. Median (interquartile range) mEq/l serum sodium increases during the first day were as follows: no treatment, 1.0 (0.0–4.0); fluid restriction, 2.0 (0.0–4.0); isotonic saline, 3.0 (0.0–5.0); hypertonic saline, 5.0 (1.0–9.0); and tolvaptan, 4.0 (2.0–9.0). Adjusting for initial serum sodium concentration with logistic regression, the relative likelihoods for correction by 5 mEq/l or more (referent, fluid restriction) were 1.60 for hypertonic saline and 2.55 for tolvaptan. At discharge, serum sodium concentration was under 135 mEq/l in 78% of patients and 130 mEq/l or less in 49%. Overly rapid correction occurred in 7.9%. Thus, initial HN treatment often uses maneuvers of limited efficacy. Despite an association with poor outcomes and availability of effective therapy, most patients with HN are discharged from hospital still hyponatremic. Studies to assess short- and long-term benefits of correction of HN with effective therapies are needed.

### Hypertonic saline and desmopressin: a simple strategy for safe correction of severe hyponatremia [^1eea8c2b]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Prompt correction of severe hyponatremia is important, but correction also must be limited to avoid iatrogenic osmotic demyelination. Expert opinion recommends that serum sodium level not be increased by more than 10–12 mEq/L in any 24-hour period and/or 18 mEq/L in any 48-hour period. However, inadvertent overcorrection is common, usually caused by the unexpected emergence of a water diuresis.

Study Design

Quality improvement report.

Setting & Participants

All 25 patients admitted to a community teaching hospital between October 1, 2008, and September 30, 2011, who were treated for serum sodium level < 120 mEq/L with concurrently administered desmopressin and hypertonic saline solution.

Quality Improvement Plan

Concurrently administered desmopressin (1–2 µg parenterally every 6–8 hours) and hypertonic saline with weight-based doses adjusted to increase the serum sodium concentration by 6 mEq/L, avoiding inadvertent overcorrection of severe hyponatremia.

Outcomes

Rate of correction of hyponatremia, predictability of response to the combination, adverse events related to therapy.

Measurements

Rate of correction of hyponatremia at 4, 24, and 48 hours; administered dose of 3% saline solution, salt tablets, and potassium; predicted increase in serum sodium level.

Results

Mean changes in serum sodium levels during the first and second 24 hours of therapy were 5.8 ± 2.8 (SD) and 4.5 ± 2.2 mEq/L, respectively, without correction by > 12 mEq/L in 24 hours or > 18 mEq/L in 48 hours and without a decrease during therapy. There was no significant difference between actual and predicted increases during the first 24 hours. There was no adverse effect associated with therapy.

Limitations

Without concurrent controls, we cannot be certain that outcomes are improved. Balance studies were not performed.

Conclusions

Combined 3% saline solution and desmopressin appears to be a valid strategy for correcting severe hyponatremia, but studies comparing the regimen with other therapeutic strategies are needed.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis / hyponatremia in COVID-19 [^af1f3990]. Pituitary (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte alteration among hospitalized patients and it has been reported in 20–40% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection. Multiple causes of hyponatremia have been hypothesized in these patients. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) has been considered one of the main reasons leading to hyponatremia in this condition. SIAD can be secondary to cytokines release, in particular IL-6. Positive pressure ventilation can be another cause of hyponatremia due to SIAD. Other possible etiologies of hyponatremia in COVID-19 patients can be related to secondary hypocortisolism, nausea, vomiting, heart and kidney damage. Similar to many other clinical conditions, there is strong evidence that hyponatremia is associated with a worse prognosis also in patients with COVID-19 infection. In particular, hyponatremia has been identified as an independent risk of ICU transfer, need of non-invasive ventilation and death. Hyponatremia in COVID-19 patients is in principle acute and symptomatic and should be treated as such, according to the published guidelines. Therefore, patients should be initially treated with i.v. hypertonic saline (3% NaCl) infusion and serum [Na +] should be frequently monitored, in order to remain within a safe rate of correction. There is evidence showing that serum [Na +] correction is associated with a better outcome in different pathologies, including COVID-19 infection.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to administer IV infusion of a crystalloid solution (0.9% saline or a balanced crystalloid, 0.5–1.0 mL/kg/hour) to restore extracellular volume in patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia.

### Serum sodium correction rate and the outcome in severe hyponatremia [^c593bd6a]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We investigated the serum sodium correction rate on length of hospitalization and survival rate, in severe chronic hyponatremic patients at the Emergency Department (ED).

Design

An observational study using clinical chart review.

Setting

The ED of the University Hospital of Marcianise, Caserta, Italy with approximately 30,000 patients visits a year.

Type Of Participants

We reviewed sixty-seven patients with severe hyponatremia subdivided in 2 subgroups: group A consisting of 35 patients with serum sodium correction rate < 0.3mmol/h and group B consisting of 32 patients with serum sodium correction rate between < 0.5 and ≥ 0.3mmol/h.

Intervention

Emergency patients were evaluated for serum sodium correction rate for hyponatremia by clinical chart review.

Measurements and Main Results

Severe hyponatremia was defined as a serum sodium level < 120mmol/l. Mean serum sodium correction rate of hyponatremia was of 0.17 ± 0.09% in group A and 0.41 ± 0.05% in group B (p < 0.001 vs group A). The length of hospital stay was 10.7 ± 3.7days for group A, and it was significantly decreased to 3.8 ± 0.4days for group B (p < 0.005 vs group A). In addition we observed that correction rate of hyponatremia in group A was associated with a significantly lower survival rate (25%) in comparison to group B (60%) (p < 0.001 vs group A).

Conclusion

We observed that serum sodium correction rate ≥ 0.3 and < 0.5mmol/h was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay and a major survival rate.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: stay the course [^5f164812]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Historical Background

In the early 1980s, studies in experimental animals found that rapid correction of hyponatremia could induce brain lesions similar to those found in patients with central pontine myelinolysis (often referred to by its abbreviated name, CPM). These findings sparked a clinical controversy. Prominent experts at the time asserted that rapid correction of severe hyponatremia was needed for survival, that CPM was extremely rare and occurs in patients who were never hyponatremic, and that animal models and case reports in humans were flawed because brain lesions were found outside the pons and only after extremely large, rapid increases in serum sodium, often resulting in hypernatremia. Neurologic sequelae in patients with hyponatremia were attributed to hypoxia instead of a complication of therapy.

In 1986, the term "osmotic demyelination syndrome" (often referred to by its abbreviated name, ODS) was introduced. Reporting on the course of eight patients who had developed clinical features of CPM after correction of severe hyponatremia (sodium ≤ 115 mmol/L and ≤ 105 mmol/L in four of the eight patients) by > 12 mmol/L per day, the article suggested that neurologic complications of severe hyponatremia should be described in clinical rather than anatomical terms. The patients exhibited a stereotypical course characterized by gradual neurologic deterioration, with clinical features suggestive of CPM, beginning 3–6 days after partial or complete correction of severe, chronic hyponatremia. The clinical course was often biphasic: initial improvement in hyponatremic symptoms followed by a delayed onset of new neurologic findings. Because initial brain images were often negative, they were deemed confirmatory rather than essential for the diagnosis. A literature review of patients with sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L found that over half of those corrected by > 12 mmol/L per day had developed neurologic complications after vigorous therapy — often after initially presenting with limited symptoms; half of those had CPM documented by imaging or autopsy, while in most of the others, CPM had been diagnosed clinically. By contrast, all 13 cases with sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L who had been corrected by < 12 mmol/L per day recovered uneventfully.

### Treatment of hyponatremic encephalopathy in the critically ill [^ab8fa94a]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Hyponatremic encephalopathy, symptomatic cerebral edema due to a low osmolar state, is a medical emergency and often encountered in the ICU setting. This article provides a critical appraisal and review of the literature on identification of high-risk patients and the treatment of this life-threatening disorder.

Data Sources, Study Selection, and Data Extraction

Online search of the PubMed database and manual review of articles involving risk factors for hyponatremic encephalopathy and treatment of hyponatremic encephalopathy in critical illness.

Data Synthesis

Hyponatremic encephalopathy is a frequently encountered problem in the ICU. Prompt recognition of hyponatremic encephalopathy and early treatment with hypertonic saline are critical for successful outcomes. Manifestations are varied, depending on the extent of CNS's adaptation to the hypoosmolar state. The absolute change in serum sodium alone is a poor predictor of clinical symptoms. However, certain patient specific risks factors are predictive of a poor outcome and are important to identify. Gender (premenopausal and postmenopausal females), age (prepubertal children), and the presence of hypoxia are the three main clinical risk factors and are more predictive of poor outcomes than the rate of development of hyponatremia or the absolute decrease in the serum sodium.

Conclusions

In patients with hyponatremic encephalopathy exhibiting neurologic manifestations, a bolus of 100mL of 3% saline, given over 10 minutes, should be promptly administered. The goal of this initial bolus is to quickly treat cerebral edema. If signs persist, the bolus should be repeated in order to achieve clinical remission. However, the total change in serum sodium should not exceed 5 mEq/L in the initial 1–2 hours and 15–20 mEq/L in the first 48 hours of treatment. It has recently been demonstrated in a prospective fashion that 500mL of 3% saline at an infusion rate of 100mL per hour can be given safely. It is critical to recognize the early signs of cerebral edema (nausea, vomiting, and headache) and intervene with IV 3% sodium chloride as this is the time to intervene rather than waiting until more severe symptoms develop. Cerebral demyelination is a rare complication of overly rapid correction of hyponatremia. The principal risk factors for cerebral demyelination are correction of the serum sodium more than 25 mEq/L in the first 48 hours of therapy, correction past the point of 140 mEq/L, chronic liver disease, and hypoxic/anoxic episode.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^04a32936]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

For hypervolemic asymptomatic hyponatremia, seven guidance documents recommended fluid restriction as the first-line treatment (Table 3). Three guidance documents advocated concomitant salt restriction, without clear dose recommendations, and one to avoid hypotonic infusion solution. Three additionally proposed loop diuretics and three others generally stated to treat the underlying disease, whereas one advised to consider stopping diuretics. One guideline additionally proposed demeclocycline and two proposed vasopressin receptor antagonists as a second-line treatment for refractory hyponatremia, whereas one guideline specifically recommended against both demeclocycline and vasopressin receptor antagonists.

Targets and limits of speed of correction

Table 4 shows the key recommendations. The key areas include targets and limits for increase in serum sodium concentration.

Seven guidance documents provided targets or aims for the increase in serum sodium concentration in case of symptomatic and/or acute hyponatremia. Seven guidance documents provided limits for the increase in serum sodium concentration that should not be surpassed. Five did so independent of symptoms. Limits usually varied between 8 to 12 mmol/L during the first 24 hours and 18 mmol/L during the first 48 hours, irrespective of whether hyponatremia was acute or chronic. Three guidance documents set a stricter limit of < 8 mmol/L during the first 24 hours in cases where the patient was believed to be high risk for developing osmotic demyelination syndrome. Four discussed what to do in case of overcorrection, i.e. to stop current treatment and to consider re-lowering serum sodium concentration by starting hypotonic infusion and administering 1 to 4 μg desmopressin every 6 to 8 hours.

### Association between an increase in serum sodium and in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients [^043d0203]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Our findings differ from previous observational studies that found that correction of dysnatremia was independently associated with lower mortality. Darmon et al found that a higher serum sodium correction rate between day 1 and day 3 of admission was associated with a lower day 28 mortality in ICU patients. Furthermore, in an observational study of ICU patients with hyponatremia (< 135 mmol/L), a lower mortality was found in patients with corrected hyponatremia compared with patients without correction. Unfortunately, mild hyponatremia (125–135 mmol/L) was not assessed separately, and no information was given at what time after admission correction of hyponatremia had occurred. Our findings also differ from findings in hospitalized non-ICU patients, where mortality was higher for patients with persistent hyponatremia in their final sodium value.

The large cohort size from different types of ICU covering a long period of time is a strength of our study. Further strengths were that severe and mild hyponatremia were assessed separately and that Δ48 hr-[Na] was also studied in patients with normal or high serum sodium concentrations. Also, in our study, we uniformly studied serum sodium assessed by the direct ion-selective method. This is important because serum sodium may differ substantially if direct and indirect ion-selective methods are applied, especially in ICU patients. Direct ion-selective methods are mostly preferred over the indirect method.

### Hyponatremia in the cancer patient [^519168a1]. Kidney International (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte disorder observed in a wide variety of malignancies and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Newer cancer therapies have improved patient outcomes while contributing to new cases of hyponatremia. Patients should be monitored closely for the development of vasopressin- and non-vasopressin-mediated hyponatremia. Acute and symptomatic forms of hyponatremia require urgent intervention, and recent findings support the correction of chronic "asymptomatic" hyponatremia. Optimizing hyponatremia may reduce medical costs, and improve cancer survival likelihood and quality of life. In this article, we review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of hyponatremia in the cancer patient.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^03756c2f]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Potential reasons for a less pronounced effect on mortality in SIAD (if this is a true effect confirmed in future studies) are unclear and remain speculative. It has been shown that paradoxically, mortality rate seems to be lower in patients with pronounced hyponatremia (< 120 mmol/L) compared to patients with a milder hyponatremia. Interestingly, the degree of hyponatremia varies according to hyponatremia etiology, and notably, SIAD seems to predispose to very low sodium concentrations. In patients with pNa below 120 mmol/L, the therapeutic approach has been shown to be different, with a higher percentage of ICU admission and of hypertonic saline administration as well as a more rapid initial sodium correction rate. This could possibly explain the lower mortality rates but higher ICU admission rates in these patients. However, since exact sodium concentrations were not known, this remains speculative. An alternative explanation for the "protective" role of SIAD might be the exact opposite, that is, that patients with SIAD had milder hyponatremia. Finally, the severity of the intercurrent diseases, medical complications during hospitalization, or the proportion of patients receiving palliative care might not have been distributed in a comparable way in both groups.

Regardless of cause, hyponatremia as a whole is associated with increased mortality, and timely diagnosis and treatment are important in improving clinical outcomes.

### Mild chronic hyponatremia in the ambulatory setting: significance and management [^be299382]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Mild chronic hyponatremia, as defined by a persistent (> 72 hours) plasma sodium concentration between 125 and 135 mEq/L without apparent symptoms, is common in ambulatory patients and generally perceived as being inconsequential. The association between increased mortality and hyponatremia in hospitalized patients in various settings and etiologies is widely recognized. This review analyzes the significance of mild chronic hyponatremia in ambulatory subjects and its effects on mortality and morbidity. It addresses whether this disorder should even be treated and if so, which patients are likely to benefit from treatment. The available approaches to correct hyponatremia in such patients in the context of recently published panel-generated recommendations and guidelines are described.

### Rapid correction of severe hyponatremia after hysteroscopic surgery-a case report [^35eecc33]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, the recently published guidelines for the rapid correction of severe symptomatic acute hyponatremia were not yet released at the time of the event reported here. Contrary to these guidelines, NaCl was administered as a continuous infusion, whereas the guidelines favour the bolus administration of 150 mL 3% NaCl or 2 mL/kg. This should be repeated every 20 min until a significant change in the sodium level occurs. The patient received a total of 500 mL of 3% NaCl in 1 h, resulting in the amount as recommended by the guidelines. The infusion rate was subsequently reduced to 50 mL/h for six more hours to avoid overcorrection.

To date, no data from controlled trials exists, which examine the best, or the maximal, correction rate in acute iatrogenic isotonic hyponatremia. A correction rate of 25 mEq/L is generally recommended within 48 h until the sodium in the serum is above 120 mEq/L, but without reaching normal or hypernatremic levels. Despite this, most publications report significantly higher correction rates, even correcting as rapidly as the initial sodium level decreased. Encephalopathy or pontine myelysis did not occur in any of these cases and patients were reported to have recovered fully after therapy. An overview of reported cases in the literature with severe hyponatremia during hysteroscopic surgery is provided in Table 1. None of these publications reported a detrimental effect associated with the rapid correction of hyponatremia. More so, all patients recovered fully, even in cases with very low sodium levels.

### Clinical factors associated with hyponatremia correction during treatment with oral urea [^35c74267]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition to the identification of factors associated with hyponatremia correction, this study also gives a useful impression of how oral urea is currently positioned in the treatment of hyponatremia.

The majority of patients first received fluid restriction, indicating that oral urea is typically started as second-line treatment, which is in line with the guidelines. When oral urea was started, it was usually combined with fluid restriction and this combination led to a greater rise of plasma sodium during the first 2 days of treatment. Fluid restriction was likely not identified in the main analysis because fluid restriction was frequently liberalized during treatment. Garrahy and colleagues also showed that the effect of fluid restriction plateaus after a couple of days. For clinical practice it would be relevant to know whether oral urea should always be combined with fluid restriction or whether it can also be given as first-line treatment without fluid restriction. A previous retrospective study analyzed the effects of oral urea as first-line treatment without fluid restriction in cancer patients with SIAD-induced hyponatremia. The correction rate in this previous study was in fact higher (5 mmol/L in 24 h), which may be attributable to the lower baseline plasma sodium (123 mmol/L) or low solute intake in patients with cancer. In another recent study, oral urea was also given without fluid restriction and produced a more modest rise in plasma sodium (2 mmol/L in 7 days). However, this study was performed in an ambulatory setting in which transient causes for AVP release are less common than in hospitalized patients; patients also had a higher baseline plasma sodium (132 mmol/L). To address this issue more conclusively, a randomized controlled trial comparing oral urea with or without fluid restriction would be desirable.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: from pathophysiology to management [^493a79da]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

After achieving an initial modest sodium increase, sufficient to prevent acute outcomes related to raised ICP, the focus turns to prevention of further rapid sodium rise to avoid overcorrection and ODS. Indeed, often the real challenge in managing severe hypotonic hyponatremia of chronic (> 24 hours) or unknown duration is to prevent this potentially deleterious overshoot. Relowering of serum sodium with IV 5% dextrose, with or without desmopressin to reduce urine output may be required, typically in a high-dependency setting, to maintain sodium rise ideally to 5 to 8 mmol above baseline within 24 hours, with a limit of no more than 10 to 12 mmol within 24 hours (see "In Case of Overcorrection: Relowering of Plasma Sodium"). In patients with risk factors for ODS (see Table 3), one should aim for even slower corrections, 4 to 6 mmol within 24 hours and a limit of 8 mmol/L in any 24-hour period, especially as such an increment is generally sufficient to prevent adverse clinical outcomes from acute hyponatremia-associated increase in ICP (see "Acute Severe Hyponatremia").

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis / hyponatremia in COVID-19 [^626afa2b]. Pituitary (2024). Medium credibility.

Besides the risk represented by an overly rapid correction of hyponatremia, also inappropriate treatment strategies may lead to negative consequences. This aspect has been covered by an afore mentioned retrospective study, which analyzed 247 patients with COVID-19 infection and hyponatremia (mostly mild), admitted to a tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain. EFV was clinically assessed in 208 patients and in 57.2% it was considered normal. Most patients with hyponatremia and a normal EFV were incorrectly treated with isotonic saline solution. A higher mortality rate was observed in these patients, compared to those correctly treated or left untreated, which was possibly attributed by the authors to the higher rate of uncorrected hyponatremia, yet not statistically significant, and to fluid overload.

We found five clinical practice guidelines and five consensus statements covering the diagnostic approach to and treatment of hyponatremia. Although most used serum osmolality, volume status, urinary sodium, and urinary osmolality to guide differential diagnosis, they differed in classification thresholds, what additional tests to consider, and when to initiate diagnostic work-up. Most advocated hypertonic NaCl in severely symptomatic, acute onset hyponatremia and NaCl 0.9%, fluid restriction, and cause-specific therapy for hypovolemic, euvolemic, and hypervolemic hyponatremia, respectively. However, they somewhat differed in the limits for speed of increase in serum sodium concentration and which specific medications to use. The reasons for offering different recommendations are undoubtedly multifactorial. They may in part be explained by the fact that recommendations were issued by organizations differing in context and scope. It is also very likely that some variability in guidance arose through limitations in the evidence available for guideline developers to base their recommendations on. In the most recent guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia, 98% of the graded recommendations were based on very low and low level of evidence, while none were based on a high level of evidence. The lack of high quality evidence may have increased the part opinion had to play in framing the recommendations. In addition, the evidence that was available may have been interpreted differently dependent on the importance for decision making given to certain outcomes (e.g. serum sodium concentration). Finally, differences in personal experience due to differing availability of medications may partly explain possible differences in perception of uncertainties around drug safety.

### Association of hyponatremia with bone mineral density and fractures: a narrative review [^9a7db41f]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Recent studies suggest a possible association of hyponatremia with osteoporosis, falls and bone fractures. The objectives of this narrative review were to further explore this association and the related pathophysiological mechanisms and to suggest a practical approach to patients with osteoporosis or chronic hyponatremia in clinical practice. We conducted an extensive PubMed search until October 2022 with the combination of the following keywords: 'hyponatremia' or 'sodium' or 'SIADH' and 'fractures' or 'bone' or 'osteoporosis', as MeSH Terms. Review of numerous observational studies confirms a significant independent association of, even mild, hyponatremia with two- to three-fold increase in the occurrence of bone fractures. Hyponatremia is a risk factor for osteoporosis with a predilection to affect the hip, while the magnitude of association depends on the severity and chronicity of hyponatremia. Chronic hyponatremia also increases the risk for falls by inducing gait instability and neurocognitive deficits. Besides the detrimental impact of hyponatremia on bone mineral density and risk of falls, it also induces changes in bone quality. Emerging evidence suggests that acute hyponatremia shifts bone turnover dynamics towards less bone formation, while hyponatremia correction increases bone formation. The key unanswered question whether treatment of hyponatremia could improve osteoporosis and lower fracture risk highlights the need for prospective studies, evaluating the impact of sodium normalization on bone metabolism and occurrence of fractures. Recommendations for clinical approach should include measurement of serum sodium in all individuals with fracture or osteoporosis. Also, hyponatremia, as an independent risk factor for fracture, should be taken into consideration when estimating the likelihood for future fragility fracture and in clinical decision-making about pharmacological therapy of osteoporosis. Until it is proven that normalization of sodium can lower fracture occurrence, correcting hyponatremia cannot be universally recommended on this basis, but should be decided on a case-by-case basis.

### Hyponatremia: mechanisms and newer treatments [^b1019cab]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the neural and renal mechanisms of osmotic homeostasis, provide a rationale for the sensitivity of the central nervous system to hyponatremia, and outline modern approaches to therapy of acute and chronic hyponatremia.

Methods

Review of relevant literature with focus on physiologic mechanisms.

Results

With careful monitoring, acute hyponatremia can be managed, while minimizing risks both of continued hyponatremia and the osmotic demyelination that can occur with overly rapid correction of severe hyponatremia. Chronic hyponatremia due to disorders of volume regulation (congestive heart failure or cirrhosis) or to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone release can be managed effectively with vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists, but there is no evidence that controlling the hyponatremia enhances survival associated with the underlying diseases.

Conclusions

Therapy in the acute setting balances the risk of the osmotic disturbance with the risk of overly rapid correction. The V2 receptor antagonist tolvaptan has enhanced our ability to improve chronic hyponatremia in conditions such as congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone hypersecretion.

### A low initial serum sodium level is associated with an increased risk of overcorrection in patients with chronic profound hyponatremia: a retrospective cohort analysis [^be330dd8]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Risk of overcorrection

Risk factors for ODS included an initial SNa of < 105 mEq/L and overcorrection. International guidelines recommend avoidance of overcorrection in the management of patients with hyponatremia; however, risk factors for overcorrection have not been fully investigated. In contrast, avoidance of overcorrection or ODS may lead to prolonged or inadequate management of patients with hyponatremia, leading to undercorrection in clinical practice. We need to develop an optimal treatment strategy to assure a safe correction rate of SNa to achieve an appropriate correction while avoiding overcorrection. With this point of view, we conducted this retrospective study to determine the risk factors for overcorrection and believe that our results will guide physicians in the management of these patients. Our study revealed that a low level of SNa at presentation was associated with overcorrection, with an adjusted OR of 1.19 for every 1 mEq/L decrease (0.84 for every 1 mEq/L increase). This meant that a 4 mEq/L lower SNa level doubled the risk of overcorrection. Although several previous retrospective studies have indicated that the SNa at presentation was lower in patients with overcorrection compared to those without, a direct association between the SNa levels and risk of overcorrection has not been evaluated previously. Our results alert clinicians to be cautious of the incremental risk of overcorrection when patients present with low SNa levels.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyponatremia, more specifically with respect to patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia, ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend to prioritize rapid fluid resuscitation over concerns regarding an overly rapid rise in serum sodium concentration in patients with hemodynamic instability.

In Case of Overcorrection: Relowering of Plasma Sodium

Overcorrection of serum sodium can occur as a consequence of any sodium-raising intervention, or may occur spontaneously with the resolution of a reversible stimulus for AVP secretion or cessation of excessive water input, and subsequent aquaresis. There is no evidence that spontaneous overcorrection of chronic (> 48 h) hyponatremia is any safer than iatrogenic overcorrection. To maintain the rate of correction within the target range, "relowering" of serum sodium can be achieved with administration of hypotonic fluid, with or without iatrogenic AVP therapy (desmopressin, DDAVP) to suspend urine output (see Figs. 8 and 10), and of course ceasing any active sodium-increasing therapy. Because the symptoms of ODS are delayed by several days, relowering remains essential for patients who are asymptomatic — but may also improve symptoms and outcomes for those with early clinical ODS.
