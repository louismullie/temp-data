## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which term refers to the stage of human prenatal development that begins around the second week of pregnancy and ends around the eighth week. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise timing and whether "weeks" here are counted from fertilization or from the last menstrual period. Then, I should verify which developmental stage matches that interval. Next, I will review the other options to ensure they do not fit the timing. Finally, I will confirm the correct answer and briefly justify it with a source.

> Let me first confirm the timing frame. The question says "roughly the second week of pregnancy through roughly the eighth week". In clinical obstetrics, pregnancy dating is typically from the first day of the last menstrual period, so "week 2" LMP corresponds to about fertilization and "week 8" LMP corresponds to about 6 weeks post-fertilization, which aligns with the embryonic period in standard descriptions of human development.

> Now, I need to check which stage matches that interval. The embryonic stage in humans spans from shortly after fertilization through the end of the seventh or eighth week of pregnancy, which is exactly the window described in the question, so the embryonic stage fits the timing precisely [^0f87caed].

> Wait, let me verify the alternatives so I don't jump to conclusions. Fertilization is a single event at the beginning, not a multi-week stage, so option A is incorrect. The fetal stage begins after the embryonic period, typically around week 9 LMP, so option B is too late for this interval. Viability refers to the ability of a fetus to survive outside the uterus and is a gestational-age concept rather than a developmental stage, so option D does not match the question about a stage of development [^0f87caed] [^6056ae3e].

> Hold on, I should double-check the exact endpoints to be sure. Authoritative sources consistently define the embryonic period as lasting from about 2 weeks after fertilization until the end of the seventh or eighth week of pregnancy, which corresponds to the timing in the question, confirming that the correct answer is the embryonic stage [^0f87caed].

> Conclusion: The correct answer is C. embryonic stage, because it encompasses the period from roughly the second week through the eighth week of pregnancy, whereas fertilization is an event, the fetal stage begins later, and viability is a separate concept related to extrauterine survival rather than a developmental stage [^0f87caed] [^0f87caed] [^6056ae3e].

The correct answer is **C. embryonic stage**. This stage begins around the second week after fertilization and lasts until the end of the eighth week, during which major organ systems and body structures form. After this, the **fetal stage** begins at about the ninth week and continues until birth [^0f87caed].

## Definitions and timelines of prenatal development stages

Prenatal development in humans is divided into distinct stages, each characterized by specific developmental milestones:

| **Stage** | **Timeline** | **Key developmental milestones** |
|-|-|-|
| Fertilization | Day 0 | Fusion of sperm and egg to form a zygote [^b75e202e] |
| Embryonic stage | Weeks 2–8 | - Formation of major organ systems <br/> - Neural tube development <br/> - Limb bud formation <br/> - Heart development [^0f87caed] |
| Fetal stage | Week 9–birth | - Continued growth and maturation of organ systems <br/> - Development of external features <br/> - Rapid brain development [^b75e202e] |

## Detailed explanation of the embryonic stage

The embryonic stage spans from approximately the second week after fertilization through the eighth week. During this period, the embryo undergoes rapid development, including:

- **Implantation**: The embryo implants into the uterine wall around day 8–10 post-fertilization [^b75e202e].
- **Neurulation**: Formation of the neural tube, which will develop into the brain and spinal cord.
- **Organogenesis**: Development of major organ systems, including the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract.
- **Limb development**: Formation of limb buds and initial development of fingers and toes.
- **Placental development**: Establishment of the placenta, which provides nutrients and oxygen to the developing embryo.

---

## Comparison with other options

- **A. Fertilization**: This is the initial event of conception, not a developmental stage spanning several weeks.
- **B. Fetal stage**: This begins after the embryonic stage, around the ninth week of pregnancy, and continues until birth.
- **D. Viability**: This refers to the ability of the fetus to survive outside the uterus, typically around 24 weeks of gestation, and is not a developmental stage.

---

## Clinical significance of the embryonic stage

The embryonic stage is **critical for normal development**, and disruptions during this period can lead to congenital anomalies or developmental disorders. Understanding this timeline is essential for prenatal care, genetic counseling, and medical decision-making during early pregnancy [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **C. embryonic stage**, which spans from approximately the second week through the eighth week of pregnancy and is characterized by the formation of major organ systems and body structures.

Words and concepts based on those expressions matter. As clinicians, we must be consistent when discussing the concept of viability. It has been said that there is something about a crisis that gives us clarity. We are currently facing a crisis of demarcation for providing optimal options to patients. Our patients and society look to us for guidance. Clinicians, our patients, the courts, legislatures, and the general public need this clarity. With this call to action for individuals to evaluate their use of the term viable, there is opportunity for professional organizations to clarify this confusion as well. If we do not get this right, how can we expect individuals outside of the medical profession to understand what it means for a pregnancy or fetus to be viable?

Functional status is the patient's ability to perform normal daily activities required to meet basic needs, fulfill usual roles, and maintain health and well-being, with walking ability a component. A nonviable limb is a condition in which loss of motor function, neurological function, and tissue integrity cannot be restored with treatment, whereas a salvageable limb has potential to secure viability and preserve motor function to the weight-bearing portion of the foot if treated.

Perinatal death reporting — vital records and uncertain viability — All live births, regardless of gestational age, are reported as vital record events, and infant deaths involve both a certificate of live birth and a certificate of death with linked information to include cause-of-death information; the fetal death certificate or report is a single document that includes maternal demographic information, selected maternal risk factors, labor and delivery information, and fetal details including weight, gestational age, and cause of death. In circumstances of uncertain viability, if the infant is determined to be a live birth, the event is reported regardless of birth weight, length of gestation, survival time, or other clinical information (eg, Apgar score), whereas if fetal death is determined, reporting is by the obstetric health care provider on the basis of state criteria, including weight, gestational age, and cause of death; a flow diagram for determining appropriate reporting was developed by the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems.

### Myocardial viability testing: all STICHed up, or about to be REVIVED? [^0bdf1ff3]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Patients with ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction frequently undergo myocardial viability testing. The historical model presumes that those who have extensive areas of dysfunctional-yet-viable myocardium derive particular benefit from revascularization, whilst those without extensive viability do not. These suppositions rely on the theory of hibernation and are based on data of low quality: taking a dogmatic approach may therefore lead to patients being refused appropriate, prognostically important treatment. Recent data from a sub-study of the randomized STICH trial challenges these historical concepts, as the volume of viable myocardium failed to predict the effectiveness of coronary artery bypass grafting. Should the Heart Team now abandon viability testing, or are new paradigms needed in the way we interpret viability? This state-of-the-art review critically examines the evidence base for viability testing, focusing in particular on the presumed interactions between viability, functional recovery, revascularization and prognosis which underly the traditional model. We consider whether viability should relate solely to dysfunctional myocardium or be considered more broadly and explore wider uses of viability testingoutside of revascularization decision-making. Finally, we look forward to ongoing and future randomized trials, which will shape evidence-based clinical practice in the future.

Are the STICH viability results definitive?

The main STICH trial demonstrated that a routine strategy of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) did not reduce mortality in patients with ILVD, compared to medical therapy alone, but on extended follow-up a survival benefit became apparent. Subsequent sub-analyses suggest a selective approach might be appropriate, as most of this benefit occurred in patients aged < 60 years, those with three-vessel coronary disease and very severely impaired LV function, as well as those with a good exercise capacity at baseline.

As outlined above, the presence of viability has long been held as a key criterion for selecting patients with ILVD for revascularization. The results of the recent STICH viability study were, therefore, disruptive in two ways: first, because they demonstrated no link between the presence of viability and the benefit of CABG and second, because they demonstrated no relationship between improvement in LV function and clinical outcomes. Before abandoning viability testing, however, the results merit critical scrutiny.

Viability testing was only mandated in the early phase of the STICH trial and, thereafter, the use of viability testing was at the discretion of clinicians managing these patients at the enrolling centers. Both SPECT and DSE were permitted, with fundamentally different definitions used for each: DSE required the presence of both viability and resting dysfunction, whereas SPECT required the presence of only viability, regardless of resting function. Neither the decision to perform a viability test nor the use of the result to guide management was by randomized allocation and as such, when assessing the interaction between viability and outcome, caution should be applied. Most importantly, the results suggest that patients with extensive viability were strongly favoured for inclusion in the trial, with 81% of patients having 'extensive' viable myocardium, defined as > 5 dysfunctional-but-viable segments on DSE or > 11 viable segments on SPECT. Of the 601 patients included, 19% did not meet these criteria and were defined as having 'no viable myocardium'. Of these 19%, 54 patients underwent CABG and 60 had medical therapy alone. Despite the high mortality rate (30 events in each arm at 10 years), there was therefore insufficient statistical power to reliably exclude a difference in this population or to test for an interaction between viability status and outcome. Conversely, for the 81% of patients with a large amount of viable myocardium (mean age 61 years), there appeared to be a substantial benefit from CABG over 10 years (Figure 3).

### Fetal assessment near the limits of viability [^78b1960a]. Seminars in Perinatology (2013). Low credibility.

Assessments of gestational age are critical in dealing with the pregnancy at the limits of viability, 22-25-weeks gestation, where neonatal outcomes reveal very significant differences from week to week. The obstetrical team can estimate gestational age within a window of 7–10 days during this critical threshold at the window of viability via determination of last menstrual period, bimanual exam, early pregnancy test, and/or ultrasound. One must also take into account the impact of maternal disease processes, congenital abnormalities, number of fetus(es), and/or fetal growth restriction, along with ongoing evaluation and parental involvement in this decision-making process during the peri-viability period.

### A lexicon for first-trimester US: society of radiologists in ultrasound consensus conference recommendations [^6056ae3e]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

First-trimester ultrasound (US) terminology — cardiac activity and viability language is specified as follows: Cardiac is a scientifically accurate adjective as endorsed by ACOG, and the rate of cardiac activity, as documented on M-mode, should be reported as beats per minute. The terms 'live', 'living', and 'viable' have been used frequently to refer to any pregnancy with cardiac activity; We recommend against the use of all these terms in the first trimester. Fetal viability has been defined as the ability of a fetus to survive in the extrauterine environment and thus is not applicable in the first trimester. Avoiding the terms 'nonviable' and 'pregnancy of uncertain viability' is therefore recommended. Likewise, a US examination in the first trimester should be called first-trimester US or early pregnancy US and not a 'viability' scan.

shows the effect of the mesoionic compound on the viability of human melanoma cell lines evaluated 24 and 48 h after treatment with different concentrations of MI-D (2.5–75 μ). Time- and dose-dependent effects were shown by MI-D on the four cell lines studied.

The viability of MEL-85 cells was reduced to 56% after a 24 h treatment with 10 μ MI-D (Figure 2A). At this time of incubation, 75 μ MI-D diminished the viability by ∼82%. When a treatment of 48 h was used, the maximum cytotoxic effect (100%) was reached starting from 50 μ. A measure of 5 μ MI-D reduced the number of viable cells to 27% after 48 h incubation.

SK-MEL cells also had their viability diminished by MI-D treatment (Figure 2B). After 24 h, 25 μ MI-D reduced the viability to ∼30% and at 50 μ to 17%. When the concentration was raised to 75 μ, there were no viable cells after 24 h incubation. A volume of 10 μ MI-D reduced the viability to 30% after 48 h. At this time, there was more than 90% of cell death using 50 μ MI-D.

### Indications for outpatient antenatal fetal surveillance: ACOG committee opinion, number 828 [^e2944297]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Antenatal fetal surveillance — guidance scope and decision-making — notes that antenatal fetal surveillance might begin at a gestational age when delivery would be considered for perinatal benefit. It emphasizes that shared decision making between the pregnant individual and the clinician is critically important when considering or offering antenatal fetal surveillance for individuals with pregnancies at high risk for stillbirth or with multiple comorbidities, and that this can be particularly important in situations that involve fetal structural or genetic anomalies or when initiating antenatal fetal surveillance around the threshold of viability, where the pregnant individual's goals for pregnancy care are critical in decision making. The document states that Table 1 presents suggestions for the timing and frequency of antenatal fetal surveillance for specific conditions and that the guidance offered in this Committee Opinion should be construed only as suggestions; this guidance should not be construed as mandates or as all encompassing. It further explains that there is a paucity of evidence for the efficacy of antenatal fetal surveillance and for evidence-based recommendations on timing and frequency; consequently, for most conditions, recommendations are largely based on expert consensus and relevant observational studies.

### Definitions, terminology and standards for reporting of births and deaths in the perinatal period: international classification of diseases (ICD-11) [^8a41f2a9]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Lower thresholds for reporting of deaths

ICD‐11 recommends including all stillbirths and deaths following live birth if gestational age is at least 154 days (≥ 22 +0 weeks). When gestational age is unavailable, the birth weight proxy (≥ 500 g) can be used. If the gestational age and birth weight are unknown it is recommended to include the case in the perinatal mortality statistics if there is a strong probability the event occurred after the defined reporting point for perinatal mortality.

Fetal deaths

National reporting requirements for fetal deaths vary, with legal thresholds often closer to the boundaries of fetal viability for example, 20 +0 to 28 +0 weeks (140–196 days) than the start of the fetal period. Recording fetal deaths from 140 days (20 +0 weeks) in local health data collection systems can improve capture and accuracy of reporting from 22 +0 weeks. The lower limit used for data recording should be specified in the statistics produced.

Deaths following live birth

ICD‐11 recommends recording all deaths following live birth, regardless of gestational age. Disparities in capturing and recording neonatal deaths, especially at lower gestational ages, pose a challenge for international comparisons of mortality rates. To address this, ICD‐11 offers clear reporting guidelines to ensure consistency across countries (see below).

Recording of pregnancy losses occurring before the perinatal period

A spontaneous abortion (or miscarriage) is the spontaneous loss of pregnancy (i.e. embryo or fetus) prior to 154 days (22 +0 weeks) gestation. To enable consistency in comparison across countries, spontaneous pregnancy losses < 154 days should always be classified as miscarriages and those ≥ 154 days as stillbirths for international reporting, regardless of local reporting requirements.

Recording of other events in the perinatal period

The above guidance relates to stillbirth and neonatal mortality only and does not include induced abortions, a minority of which occur at or after 154 days (22 +0 weeks).

Artificial termination of an ongoing pregnancy (also referred to as induced abortion, legal abortion, fetal reduction) is defined by ICD‐11 as the complete expulsion or extraction from a woman of an embryo or a fetus (irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy), following a deliberate interruption of an ongoing pregnancy by medical or surgical means, which is not intended to result in a live birth.

All events meeting the definition of artificial termination of pregnancy should be reported in mortality statistics but must be clearly distinguishable from spontaneous abortions and stillbirths. Whilst transient signs of life may be present in later‐gestation termination, these should never be coded as live births and neonatal deaths.

Viability Testing of Revascularization Therapy

How important is viability testing before going forward with a revascularization procedure? The issue of viability testing remains controversial. 48 A 2002 meta‐analysis by Allman et al 68 suggested that there was a close association between testing for viability and improved survival following revascularization therapy versus medical therapy alone. While, if there was an absence of viability, then there was no difference in survival outcome between revascularization therapy versus medical therapy. In this analysis of > 3000 patients with CAD and LV dysfunction (EF 32%), viability testing was assessed using thallium perfusion, fluorodeoxyglucose metabolic imaging, or dobutamine echocardiography. In patients showing areas of viability, revascularization resulted in an annual mortality rate of 3.2% over an average of 25 months compared with 16% with the medical treatment alone (no revascularization) groups (P < 0.0001). Thus, there was a 79.6% reduction in annual mortality by revascularizing areas of viability compared with no revascularization. In patients without viability, there was no difference in annual mortality between revascularizing (7.7%) or medical therapy (6.2%). This analysis would therefore favor the use of viability testing. A recent subanalysis of the PARR‐2 (PET and Recovery Following Revascularization‐2) study analyzed 182 patients with LV dysfunction and CAD who underwent assessment for PET mismatch between perfusion and active metabolism. Patients with larger amounts of mismatch (and therefore larger amounts of hibernating myocardium) had better clinical outcomes (less cardiac death, MI, or cardiac hospitalization) with revascularization therapy. 69 However, the STICH (Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure) trial called into question the importance of viability testing. Among 1212 patients enrolled in the trial who had severe CAD and an LVEF < 35%, 610 had viability testing (single‐photon emission computed tomography and/or dobutamine echocardiography) and were randomized to medical therapy plus coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or medical therapy alone. There was no significant interaction between viability status and treatment with respect to mortality. The assessment of viability did not identify patients with a different survival benefit from CABG. 70 Of note, at 5 years, there was no significant reduction in mortality with CABG versus medical therapy. 71 There was a modest 8% reduction in mortality with revascularization compared with medical therapy alone reported at 10 years of follow‐up. 72 Did this trial spell the end to viability testing for the issue of revascularization? There were a number of criticisms regarding the viability issue in the STICH trial including the following: tests such as MRI or PET may have been more accurate for viability than single‐photon emission computed tomography or dobutamine echocardiography performed in the STICH trial, with only less than half of the total patients enrolled in STICH having viability testing; 40% of the patients enrolled were asymptomatic; patients were not assessed for ischemia; postoperative LV volumes were not reported; and other weaknesses continue to be debated. 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78 A follow‐up article by the STICH group monitored patients out to > 10 years and again concluded that myocardial viability testing did not help delineate the benefits of revascularization with CABG versus medical therapy in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. 79 However, this study did show that increases in LVEF were only observed in those patients who had evidence for viability, irrespective of whether the patients received CABG plus medical therapy or medical therapy alone, suggesting that at least the diagnosis of viability was associated with eventual recovery of some degree of function. Another fairly recent study failed to show an overall benefit of PET imaging for management of patients with CAD and LV dysfunction, although some subpopulations may benefit. 80 Arora et al 81 also observed mixed results when assessing usefulness of PET imaging to predict recovery of LV perfusion and EF following CABG. However, a more recent study showed that viability testing using MRI (low‐dose dobutamine for contractile reserve and late gadolinium enhancement for visualization of scar) could predict improvement in long‐term functional recovery of the left ventricle, although this improvement in function was considerably delayed and required up to 35 months. In this study, the presence of contractile reserve best predicted earlier ventricular functional improvement. 82 Thus, debate continues about the usefulness of viability testing as a management tool for whether to go forward with revascularization procedures.

### Viability and outcomes with revascularization or medical therapy in ischemic ventricular dysfunction: a prespecified secondary analysis of the REVIVED-BCIS2 trial [^ed0f1c80]. JAMA Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

In the Revascularization for Ischemic Ventricular Dysfunction (REVIVED-BCIS2) trial, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) did not improve outcomes for patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction. Whether myocardial viability testing had prognostic utility for these patients or identified a subpopulation who may benefit from PCI remained unclear.

Objective

To determine the effect of the extent of viable and nonviable myocardium on the effectiveness of PCI, prognosis, and improvement in left ventricular function.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prospective open-label randomized clinical trial recruiting between August 28, 2013, and March 19, 2020, with a median follow-up of 3.4 years (IQR, 2.3–5.0 years). A total of 40 secondary and tertiary care centers in the United Kingdom were included. Of 700 randomly assigned patients, 610 with left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 35%, extensive coronary artery disease, and evidence of viability in at least 4 myocardial segments that were dysfunctional at rest and who underwent blinded core laboratory viability characterization were included. Data analysis was conducted from March 31, 2022, to May 1, 2023.

Intervention

Percutaneous coronary intervention in addition to optimal medical therapy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Blinded core laboratory analysis was performed of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging scans and dobutamine stress echocardiograms to quantify the extent of viable and nonviable myocardium, expressed as an absolute percentage of left ventricular mass. The primary outcome of this subgroup analysis was the composite of all-cause death or hospitalization for heart failure. Secondary outcomes were all-cause death, cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, and improved left ventricular function at 6 months.

Results

The mean (SD) age of the participants was 69.3 (9.0) years. In the PCI group, 258 (87%) were male, and in the optimal medical therapy group, 277 (88%) were male. The primary outcome occurred in 107 of 295 participants assigned to PCI and 114 of 315 participants assigned to optimal medical therapy alone. There was no interaction between the extent of viable or nonviable myocardium and the effect of PCI on the primary or any secondary outcome. Across the study population, the extent of viable myocardium was not associated with the primary outcome (hazard ratio per 10% increase, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.93–1.04) or any secondary outcome. The extent of nonviable myocardium was associated with the primary outcome (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.00–1.15), all-cause death, cardiovascular death, and improvement in left ventricular function.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that viability testing does not identify patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy who benefit from PCI. The extent of nonviable myocardium, but not the extent of viable myocardium, is associated with event-free survival and likelihood of improvement of left ventricular function.

### Practice bulletin no. 175: ultrasound in pregnancy [^039cb238]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

First-trimester ultrasound — early pregnancy viability and reporting includes that presence or absence of cardiac activity should be reported, and an embryo should be visible by transvaginal ultrasonography with a mean gestational sac diameter of 25 mm or greater. With transvaginal examinations, cardiac motion should be observed when the embryo is 7 mm or greater in length, and if an embryo less than 7 mm in length is seen without cardiac activity, a subsequent ultrasound examination at a later time may be needed to assess the presence or absence of cardiac activity. Fetal number should be reported, amnionicity and chorionicity should be documented to the extent possible for all multiple gestations, and embryonic or fetal anatomy should be assessed as appropriate for the gestational age.

### Myocardial viability and survival in ischemic left ventricular dysfunction [^479db158]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

The assessment of myocardial viability has been used to identify patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction in whom coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG) will provide a survival benefit. However, the efficacy of this approach is uncertain.

Methods

In a substudy of patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction who were enrolled in a randomized trial of medical therapy with or without CABG, we used single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT), dobutamine echocardiography, or both to assess myocardial viability on the basis of prespecified thresholds.

Results

Among the 1212 patients enrolled in the randomized trial, 601 underwent assessment of myocardial viability. Of these patients, we randomly assigned 298 to receive medical therapy plus CABG and 303 to receive medical therapy alone. A total of 178 of 487 patients with viable myocardium (37%) and 58 of 114 patients without viable myocardium (51%) died (hazard ratio for death among patients with viable myocardium, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.48 to 0.86; P = 0.003). However, after adjustment for other baseline variables, this association with mortality was not significant (P = 0.21). There was no significant interaction between viability status and treatment assignment with respect to mortality (P = 0.53).

Conclusions

The presence of viable myocardium was associated with a greater likelihood of survival in patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction, but this relationship was not significant after adjustment for other baseline variables. The assessment of myocardial viability did not identify patients with a differential survival benefit from CABG, as compared with medical therapy alone.

In our experiments, however, we find a certain fraction of cells proliferating after having received absorbed doses of 20 Gy and above. Most models of cell survival do not take into account this fraction of cells, which are still proliferating at very high values of the absorbed dose. Therefore, we add a term δS to the traditional equation of survival fraction S as follows:

where S is the survival fraction, D₀ is the mean lethal dose for which the survival fraction S = [1/e], D is the administered absorbed dose, n is the extrapolation number at D = 0 that might be interpreted as the number of sublethal events and δS is the extrapolation number at infinite absorbed dose that might be interpreted as either a methodological uncertainty number or a fraction of highly radioresistant cells.

The survival fraction of the MTT assay gives the probability or fraction of viable cells, W (V) that includes both apoptotic and proliferating cells. On the other hand, the survival ratio of the 3 H-thymidine assay gives the fraction of cells proliferating (L) and thus also viable (V). This fraction or probability can be written as W (V ∩ L). To guarantee sterile conditions, we wish to evaluate the probability of viable cells able to proliferate after irradiation. This is equal to the conditional probability W (L ∣ V) of cell proliferation (L) given that the cells are viable (V) after the irradiation exposure, which is well defined only when W (V) > 0:

where W (L ∣ V) is the probability of proliferation of cells still viable after radiation, W (L ∩ V) is the probability of cells to proliferate and being viable, that is, S (3 H-thymidine) and W (V) is the probability of cells being viable, that is, S (MTT).

### 2021: the American Association for Thoracic Surgery expert consensus document: coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure [^76095f39]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Ischemic cardiomyopathy — diagnostic testing for ischemia and viability may aid decision-making. In addition to standard coronary angiography and echocardiography, assessment of myocardial ischemia and viability may be helpful in patients with ICM, especially those with HF and other high-risk features. Stress echocardiography and nuclear stress-test imaging are commonly used to assess ischemia, and late gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance (LGE-CMR), dobutamine echocardiography, single-photon emission computed tomography, and F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography can be used to assess myocardial viability. Most of the members of this expert panel favor LGE-CMR for viability assessment, but this is based on limited data and indirect comparisons. Algorithms have proposed medical management over revascularization if the transmural extent of the LGE-CMR–measured scar is > 50% of wall thickness, a cutoff that has a 90% negative predictive value for segmental recovery after revascularization; however, a recent study demonstrated that more than one-third of myocardial segments with a transmural extent of LGE > 50% showed improved wall motion after CABG.

In 107 patients with coronary disease and severe left ventricular dysfunction, we examined the prognostic power of viability identified by dobutamine stress echocardiography. At a mean follow-up of 27 months, patients with viable myocardium who underwent revascularization had a significant survival advantage over all other patients (2-year survival 83.5% vs 57.2%, p = 0.0037).

from survival fractions from the MTT assay.

Using the n and D₀ data from the proliferation test given in Table 1, the absorbed dose D w = E−6 corresponding to one viable proliferating cell was calculated. From the results displayed in Figure 3, the absorbed dose D w = E−6 was estimated to be around 100 Gy. No significant difference was found in the absorbed dose D w = E−6 for the probability W(L ∣ V) = 10⁻⁶ of cells not affected between the cases δS ≠0 and = 0 for cell proliferation (3 H-thymidine).

Using the n and D₀ data from the cell viability MTT assay in Table 2, the absorbed dose D w = E−6 was estimated to be around 200 Gy when using the data obtained at δS = 0, but as high as 800 Gy when δS ≠0. Thus, the cells seem to be viable up to very high doses. The most critical safety issue is, however, that the cells injected into the patient do not proliferate. Thus, a hypothetical absorbed dose around 100 Gy is, according to our findings, sufficient for reaching the negligible probability (10 −6) for cell division.

In our studies of the plating efficiency, we observed a reduction in the total number of cells, which means that both cell division and survival are diminished. There is no visual difference in the observed cell survival pattern at day 20 in four cell cultures of malignant karyotype and one of normal karyotype. This observation confirms that we, in vitro, have apparently normal-looking cells 1 week after irradiation and that all the cells were dead and could not form colonies 4 weeks after irradiation, that is, 100 Gy is a safe dose for sterilisation with two million malignant brain tumour cells to be used for immunisation.

Thus based on the present investigation of the intrinsic cellular radiation sensitivity of nontransfected cells, we recommend an absorbed dose of 100 Gy for sterilisation of the 2 million cells used for immunisation of patients in the clinical study.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy — imaging techniques for LV structure, scar and viability: An LVEF of ≤ 35% is the most common criterion for candidacy of CRT, and echocardiography has been considered the single most useful diagnostic test in the evaluation of heart failure patients according to the ACC/AHA; for measurement accuracy, M-mode (only for diameters) and/or 2D measurements and LV volume indexes using Simpson's method of discs or 3D echocardiography should be utilized, with echo contrast applied when 2D windows are suboptimal; when echocardiography is non-diagnostic, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) can be utilized to enhance LV size and functional assessment and to analyze scar, while end-diastolic myocardial thickness < 6 mm is highly suggestive of transmural scar; finally, definitive determination of viability by CMR or dobutamine-stress echocardiography may be imperative to a successful outcome, and right ventricular size and function are recognized as important predictors of outcome in patients undergoing CRT.

### Improving the quality and reproducibility of flow cytometry in the lung. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^86232e06]. American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology (2019). High credibility.

Flow cytometry panel design and viability controls in lung samples — Panels should be tested and adjusted before experiments to clearly define cells and markers, and all panels should include a viability dye, particularly when using digested tissue. The use of light-scattering properties (FSC vs. SSC) as a sole method to assess viability is not sufficient; when excessive debris cannot be mitigated, a fluorescent DNA-binding dye compatible with the fluorescence panel design can be used on fixed samples to differentiate between dead cells and nonnucleated debris. To define truly positive populations in multicolor experiments, use of fluorescence-minus-one controls is highly recommended, and FSC (cell size) and SSC (cell granularity) should be used only in conjunction with specific cell markers and not on their own.

Anatomy (dating) ultrasound — antenatal ultrasonography is described as an integral part of routine antenatal care used to assess fetal growth and anatomy and to detect fetal anomalies, and it is recommended as an accurate method of determining gestational age, fetal number, viability, anatomic survey, placental location, amniotic fluid, and assessment of pelvic organs. The optimal timing of the complete fetal anatomy ultrasound is in the second trimester between 18 and 22 weeks' gestation, ultrasonography should be performed by technologists or providers who have undergone specific training and only when a valid medical indication for examination is present, and routine clinical scanning of every pregnant patient using real‑time B‑mode (2‑D) imaging is not contraindicated. The standard ultrasound evaluation includes fetal presentation, amniotic fluid volume, fetal cardiac activity, placental position, fetal biometry, and fetal number plus an anatomic survey.

### Brain vulnerability and viability after ischaemia [^70289889]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2021). High credibility.

The susceptibility of the brain to ischaemic injury dramatically limits its viability following interruptions in blood flow. However, data from studies of dissociated cells, tissue specimens, isolated organs and whole bodies have brought into question the temporal limits within which the brain is capable of tolerating prolonged circulatory arrest. This Review assesses cell type-specific mechanisms of global cerebral ischaemia, and examines the circumstances in which the brain exhibits heightened resilience to injury. We suggest strategies for expanding such discoveries to fuel translational research into novel cytoprotective therapies, and describe emerging technologies and experimental concepts. By doing so, we propose a new multimodal framework to investigate brain resuscitation following extended periods of circulatory arrest.

Myocardial viability imaging background — Normal myocardium uses free fatty acids and glucose, while ischemic myocardium increases its use of glucose and consumes it at a higher rate than normal. The purpose of a viability scan is to identify ischemic but viable tissue in a patient with apparent scar or left ventricular dysfunction on other imaging that may represent chronic ischemia at rest. Viable tissue is defined by normal perfusion or areas of increased glucose uptake in regions of reduced perfusion ("hibernating" myocardium), and its presence may benefit from restored perfusion from revascularization.

Finally, to confirm the initial observation and to investigate whether viability scales linearly or non-linearly withlevels, we analyzed viability over the full range ofexpression by dividing the whole population into five homogenously distributed subpopulations from the lowest (subpopulation 1) to the highest (subpopulation 5) expression levels (0–20%, 20–40%, etc.) (Figure 4B). Viability was negatively associated withlevels (Pearson r = -0.895) (Figure 4C and Table S2). While the difference was statistically significant only between subpopulations 2 and 5 (P = 0.02), viability scaled linearly withlevels: it was similar in the 0–20% and 20–40% subpopulations and then decreased linearly from the 20–40% subpopulation to the top 20%. These results show thatexpression impacts viability not only at the highest expression levels but also at more moderate, non-extreme levels.

### Human embryo implantation in vitro: a standardized framework for basic research and clinical translation [^4f4aa887]. Fertility and Sterility (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite decades of advances in assisted reproductive technology, implantation failure remains a major barrier to achieving pregnancy, contributing significantly to infertility and early pregnancy loss. Our understanding of this process, referred as a "black box", is limited by the inability to observe it directly inside the uterus and the poor translatability of animal models. For decades, knowledge has relied solely on the Carnegie Collection, a limited set of histological specimens that precludes molecular or chronological analysis. The emergence of extended in vitro embryo culture systems offers a powerful opportunity to study the dynamic molecular and cellular events of human embryo implantation in real time. This review summarizes the current knowledge gained from the Carnegie specimens and most recent embryo culture platforms. We highlight the limitations of existing in vitro cultures, particularly the absence of a suitable maternal endometrial environment, and underscore the need for more physiologically relevant systems. To unify research efforts and enhance clinical translatability, we propose a standardized framework for defining stages and assessing human embryo viability based on morphological, temporal, and functional criteria. Establishing these benchmarks will allow for meaningful comparison across studies and accelerate the development of advanced models for investigating the causes of implantation failure and other pathologies manifesting later in pregnancy such as preeclampsia. Adoption of a standardized framework is an essential step that will accelerate the development of patient-specific diagnostics and novel therapeutics to improve fertility care.

Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

This is an executive summary of a workshop on the management and counseling issues of women anticipated to deliver at a periviable gestation (broadly defined as 20 0/7 through 25 6/7 weeks of gestation), and the treatment options for the newborn. Upon review of the available literature, the workshop panel noted that the rates of neonatal survival and neurodevelopmental disabilities among the survivors vary greatly across the periviable gestations and are significantly influenced by the obstetric and neonatal management practices (eg, antenatal steroid, tocolytic agents, and antibiotic administration; cesarean birth; and local protocols for perinatal care, neonatal resuscitation, and intensive care support). These are, in turn, influenced by the variations in local and regional definitions of limits of viability. Because of the complexities in making difficult management decisions, obstetric and neonatal teams should confer prior to meeting with the family, when feasible. Family counseling should be coordinated with the goal of creating mutual trust, respect, and understanding and should incorporate evidence-based counseling methods. Since clinical circumstances can change rapidly with increasing gestational age, counseling should include discussion of the benefits and risks of various maternal and neonatal interventions at the time of counseling. There should be a plan for follow-up counseling as clinical circumstances evolve. The panel proposed a research agenda and recommended developing educational curricula on the care and counseling of families facing the birth of a periviable infant.

### Bile proteome reveals biliary regeneration during normothermic preservation of human donor livers [^e4c2bcad]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

At 150 min of NMP, a total of 680 proteins were significantly different between livers with high vs low biliary viability. One-hundred and seventy-four of these were enriched in livers with a high biliary viability score, and 506 in livers with a low biliary viability score. GO analysis with functional enrichment of these proteins revealed a significant upregulation of regenerative processes, such as cell population proliferation, cellular signaling, cellular migration, and immune response processes in livers with high biliary viability scores. Furthermore, we observed a marked increase in proteins related to extracellular exosomes. Livers with low biliary viability scores showed increased abundances of proteins involved in translation initiation, and various (small molecule) metabolic processes (Fig. 4c). These differences are also observed, to different degrees, in all other comparisons of histological BDI score and time point (BDI low; 30 min, BDI high; 30 min, BDI low; 150 min; Fig. S 2). Observations of regenerative processes were not apparent in comparisons of histological BDI group only (high vs low BDI score; Fig. S 3), suggesting that regenerative processes are not a result of the level of biliary injury the liver has sustained, but rather the ability of the liver to respond to that injury. This was further confirmed by comparison of livers with high and low biochemical biliary viability scores, regardless of histological BDI injury. Livers with high biochemical biliary viability show increased abundance of regenerative processes, albeit to a lesser degree, while livers with low biochemical biliary viability maintain abundance of translation and metabolic processes (Fig. S 4). Furthermore, the abundance of individual proteins associated with these regenerative processes showed a clear distinction between livers with high and low biliary biochemical viability scores in both high histological BDI (Fig. 4d) and low histological BDI (Fig. 4e).

### Viability by MRI or PET would not have changed the results of the STICH trial [^ff02aea3]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The assessment of myocardial viability in the Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure (STICH) trial of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy did not identify patients who had a survival benefit from coronary artery bypass grafting compared to medical therapy alone. Viability testing was performed with either single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), dobutamine echocardiography (DE), or both. The question has been raised as to whether the addition of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) imaging may have changed these results. Comparisons of the important similarities and differences of these viability imaging techniques, as well as of the design and limitations of the STICH viability substudy, suggest that the addition of MRI or PET imaging for viability assessment would not change the study results. The results of the STICH viability substudy are probably not a reflection of the modality of viability testing used, but rather an indication of the substantive effect of optimal medical therapy.

### Longitudinal drug synergy assessment using convolutional neural network image-decoding of glioblastoma single-spheroid cultures [^b7a21ccc]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Image Processing Allows for Cell Viabilities Prediction

To assess drug interactions, the estimated cell viability effect of each drug or its combination should match the actual measured viability. To estimate this viability from the images, we applied contrast maximization, median filters, blurring, rescaled the images, and applied a Dense Convolutional Neural Network architecture. The measured viability based on CellTiter-Glo ATP measurements (CTG 3D) was taken to train the image-based model built on day 18 data. From this pre-trained model, viabilities were estimated at earlier time points, including days 8, 11, 15, and 18 (Figure 2A). Scatter plots of predicted on each day versus observed on day 18 viabilities are depicted in Figure 2B. As expected, a strong relation between observed and predicted viabilities can be seen on day 18 (adj R -squared = 0.984; P -value < 2.2e−16). This robust association was weaker when looking at earlier time points that indicate changes in predicted cell viabilities over time (day 15: adj R -squared = 0.730; P -value < .001 day 11: adj R -squared = 0.590; P -value < .001; day 8: adj R -squared = 0.429; P -value < .001). Additional model validation was performed and results can be found in Supplementary Figures S9 – S10.

### Practice bulletin no. 175: ultrasound in pregnancy [^80ab6474]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound in pregnancy — optimal timing for obstetric ultrasonography emphasizes indication-driven scheduling and dating accuracy: For patients with uncertain or unreliable menstrual dating or with an indication to confirm viability, first-trimester ultrasonography is most accurate, and in these instances, a dating ultrasound examination should be obtained at the first prenatal visit. When used as part of combined first-trimester screening or integrated screening for aneuploidy, an ultrasound examination with nuchal translucency measurement before 14 0/7 weeks of gestation provides accurate dating of pregnancy, but a complete anatomic assessment is not possible before at least 14 weeks of gestation. In the absence of other specific indications, the optimal time for a single ultrasound examination is at 18–22 weeks of gestation, which allows for a survey of fetal anatomy in most women and an accurate estimation of gestational age; at 18–22 weeks of gestation, anatomically complex organs such as the fetal heart and brain can be imaged with sufficient clarity to allow detection of many major malformations.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^9ca51f16]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Radionuclide imaging — tracers, viability assessment, and detection limits: Several radionuclide tracers allow viable myocytes to be imaged directly, including the SPECT tracers 201Tl chloride, 99mTc sestamibi, and tetrofosmin, and the PET tracers 18F 2-fluorodeoxyglucose and 82Rb; these techniques are the only commonly available methods for assessing viability directly, though their relatively low resolution limits detection of the smallest areas of myocardial infarction (MI). Phantom studies suggest that myocyte loss as little as 4% of the myocardium can be detected, corresponding to 5 to 10 g of muscle; ECG-gated imaging provides a reliable assessment of myocardial motion, thickening, and global function, and evolving applications include sympathetic innervation imaging with 123I-labeled meta-iodobenzylguanidine, matrix metalloproteinase activation, and assessment of myocardial metabolism.

### Improving the quality and reproducibility of flow cytometry in the lung. An official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^db0f9391]. American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society lung flow cytometry — overview guidance emphasizes that performing high-quality flow cytometry experiments requires design based on the specific investigator's research question, and lung tissue digestion methods require optimization for the desired cell type(s) and their viability. Furthermore, investigators should also consider the different pulmonary regions (airway, parenchyma, etc.) and if the tissue is normal or diseased, as these factors may alter the digestion. All flow cytometry samples should include an appropriate viability dye in their panel design, and flow cytometry data analysis then should be restricted to viable cells, as nonviable cells exhibit nonspecific fluorescence (Figure 1); it is not sufficient to use the light scatter properties of cells (forward scatter [FSC] vs. side scatter [SSC]) to define cell viability. When defining individual cell populations, investigators should generally focus on defining cell type using standard markers and then describing how conditions alter surface expression (activation markers, etc.) or the frequency of cell populations. Reports of flow cytometry data for publication should include information on the antibodies (clone, commercial source, conjugated fluorophores, and dilution), the cytometer, and a clear gating strategy for how cells are defined, and placement of flow cytometry data on repositories is encouraged as a part of publication.

### Clinical evaluation of tuberculosis viability microscopy for assessing treatment response [^48c066a0]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Tuberculosis quantitative viability microscopy with fluorescein diacetate staining for metabolically active bacteria accurately predicted the concentration of culturable M. tuberculosis in sputum. Viability microscopy took < 1 hour and was less resource-intensive, requiring only basic skills that were already available, whereas quantitative culture took weeks and required more laboratory equipment and expertise. Over the first 9 days of tuberculosis treatment, viability microscopy reliably predicted changes in culturable M. tuberculosis concentrations.

Viability and quantitative culture changes appeared to separate into 2 distinct patterns during early treatment depending on whether patients had MDR tuberculosis. For patients with non-MDR tuberculosis, after 3 days, treatment mean viability and quantitative culture results fell by > 90% and by day 9 by 99.6%. This concurs with early bactericidal activity and serial sputum colony count studies of tuberculosis treatment response, which reported exponential isoniazid-mediated decline in culturable M. tuberculosis during the first days of treatment, followed by slower rifampicin-mediated killing. Acid-fast microscopy changed little during early treatment, so results diverged from viability and quantitative culture as treatment continued. In contrast to these results for patients with non-MDR tuberculosis, viability and quantitative culture for the few patients with MDR tuberculosis differed significantly because they did not decrease during early treatment.

### Small molecule inhibitors of RAS-effector protein interactions derived using an intracellular antibody fragment [^64773526]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

We carried out cell viability studies using a monolayer culture system with two human cancer cell lines with different RAS family member mutations (DLD-1 KRAS G13D and HT1080 NRAS Q61K). A dose response was carried out with Abd-2, Abd-4, 5, 6 and 7. Figure 5c (DLD-1) and 5d (HT1080) show cell viability in the presence of 0–20 μM compound after 72 h (Supplementary Fig. 7 shows viability at 24 and 48 h). The lowest-affinity compounds, Abd-2 and Abd-4, show no effect on cell viability even at the highest doses (these compounds also do not show activity in the RAS biosensor BRET assay). Compounds Abd-5 and Abd-6 have an effect on the viability (with Abd-5 showing a greater effect on DLD-1 viability); but even at 20 μM and after 72 h, there are surviving cells following incubation with either compound. The most potent compound is Abd-7 (whose in vitro Kd is 51 nM) with an IC 50 of 8 μM in DLD-1 and 10 μM in HT1080 at 72 h (similar values for the IC 50 were found after 48 h (Supplementary Fig. 7f). These results showed that the ability of our chemical series to affect cancer cell viability relates to their binding properties, and that Abd-7 is the most cell-potent inhibitor affecting the viability of cancer cell lines in a single digit to low micromolar range.

### Extent of viability to predict response to cardiac resynchronization therapy in ischemic heart failure patients [^8cf18f0f]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) varies significantly among individuals. Preliminary data suggest that the presence of myocardial viability may be important for response to CRT. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the extent of viability could predict response to CRT after 6 mo.

Methods

Sixty-one consecutive patients with advanced heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction < 35%, QRS duration > 120 ms, and chronic coronary artery disease were included. To determine the extent of viability all patients underwent nuclear imaging with 18F-FDG SPECT before implantation. Clinical and echocardiographic parameters were assessed at baseline and after 6 mo of follow-up.

Results

The presence of myocardial viability was directly related to an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction after 6 mo of CRT. Furthermore, the extent of viability in responders (n = 38) was significantly larger compared with that of nonresponders (n = 23; 12 ± 3 vs. 7 ± 3 viable segments, P < 0.01). Moreover, the optimal cutoff value to predict clinical response to CRT was identified at an extent of 11 viable segments or more (in a 17-segment model), yielding a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 87%.

Conclusion

The presence of myocardial viability is directly related to response to CRT in patients with ischemic heart failure. Interestingly, using a cutoff level of 11 viable segments or more, the extent of viability could be used to predict response. Therefore, evaluation for myocardial viability may be considered in the selection process for CRT.

### Impact of stereochemical replacement on activity and selectivity of membrane-active antibacterial and antifungal cyclic peptides [^96a10a02]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

In Series 3 and 4, all the tested cyclic peptides showed higher cell viability against all four mammalian cells compared to their respective parent peptides (Fig. 2C1–C4, D1–D4). In Series 3, among the tested cyclic peptides (15c, 16c, and 20c), consistently higher cell viability was observed for 15c and 16c against all four types of mammalian cells compared to 20c. At 200 µg/mL, cyclic peptides 15c and 16c displayed 76–81%, 72–77%, 80–82%, and 64–69% cell viability against lung, kidney, liver, and skin cells, respectively. However, compared to parent peptide p3, at 200 µg/mL, 20c showed only a marginal improvement, if any, with 62%, 55%, 73%, and 49% cell viability against lung, kidney, liver, and skin cells, respectively. Moreover, it is important to note that, except for skin cells, at 100 µg/mL, 15c and 16c showed > 90% cell viability against lung, kidney, and liver cells (Fig. 2C1–C4).

Similarly, in Series 4, peptides 15d and 16d showed higher cell viability compared to the parent peptide p4 with 61–65%, 67–72%, 74–77%, and 47–50% cell viability at 200 µg/mL against lung, kidney, liver, and skin cells respectively (Fig. 2D1–D4). Among all the tested cyclic peptides, maximum cell viability was observed for 15c and 16c, aligning well with the hemolysis data.

MACs viability

Viability of MACs obtained from high-HDL patients was 23% higher than that of cells from low-HDL subjects (111.6 ± 32.7 vs. 90.5 ± 28.6%, p = 0.002). Effect of HDL on viability was still significant (ESM 113.0 ± 45.4 vs. 93.1 ± 42.2%, p = 0.037) beyond the effects of covariates and with an independent role for eGFR (p = 0.047). To investigate high-HDL contribution to MACs protection from oxidative stress, MACs were incubated for 1-h with 1 mM H 2 O 2. Cell viability decreased in both groups (high-HDL, n. 20: 109.2 ± 31.7% vs. high-HDL + H 2 O 2 74.5 ± 40.8%, p < 0.0001; low-HDL, n. 19: 88.3 ± 25.5% vs. low-HDL + H 2 O 2 72.3 ± 22.5%, p = 0.004; Fig. 2), with a percent decrease in viability that was significantly higher in MACs from high-HDL than from low-HDL subjects (33.4 ± 24.0% vs. 17.1 ± 19.1%; p = 0.025). Viability measured after exposure to oxidative stress was directly correlated with viability at baseline in the whole sample (r = 0.655, p < 0.0001) as well in high- (r = 0.729, p < 0.0001) and low-HDL groups (r = 0.619, p = 0.005) (Fig. 2).

Distinguishing cytostatic and cytotoxic drug effects

To further explore the biological implications of GR values, we looked more closely at the balance between cell birth, death, and arrest in our dataset. A value of GR = 1 corresponds to unperturbed proliferation resulting in identical numbers of viable cells in drug-treated and control cultures; GR = 0 corresponds to no increase in viable cell number; and GR < 0 to net cell loss. In principle, the GR = 0 condition could arise because all cells in a culture arrest in a viable state (true cytostasis) or because the number of cells that die equals the number born during the assay. To distinguish these possibilities, we compared the fraction of dead cells to GR values across all drugs, concentrations, and cell lines (Fig. 4d). We observed the anticipated negative correlation between GR value and dead cell fraction but with high dispersion around the trend line: at GR = 0, the fraction of dead cells varied from 0 to 48% (median = 12%). We then compared the drug-induced change in S-phase and dead cell fractions (for −0.1 < GR < 0.1) and found that birth and death balanced (S-phase and death fractions within 5% of each other) fully in ~44% of conditions, resulting in the absence of net cell growth. In a further ~24% of conditions, high cell death was accompanied by low S-phase fraction (i.e. when the difference was > 10%); these are likely cases in which GR = 0 is a transient phenomenon preceding cell death (many anti-cancer drugs exert their cytotoxic effects after several days of delay). The opposite scenario of low cell death with high S-phase fraction (observed in ~7% of conditions) may reflect adaptation: maximum drug effect likely occurred at an earlier time point and by 72 h, cells had resumed S-phase (Fig. 4e). In such cases, the underlying assumption in GR calculations that growth rate is constant is violated and time-dependent GR measurements are required (Fig. 3c–e). Based on this analysis, we conclude that true cytostatic cell-cycle arrest is likely to occur in only ~25% of GR = 0 conditions, or ~2% of all conditions assayed in total with balanced proliferation and death about twice as common.

### Dalfampridine [^5e442bbc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with use of dalfampridine in pregnant women. Administration of dalfampridine to animals during pregnancy and lactation resulted in decreased offspring viability and growth at clinically relevant doses [see Data]. In the

U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.

Data

Animal Data

Oral administration of dalfampridine to pregnant rats and rabbits throughout organogenesis resulted in no evidence of developmental toxicity in either species. The highest doses tested (10 mg/kg/day in rats, 5 mg/kg/day in rabbits), which were associated with maternal toxicity, are approximately 5 times the MRHD on a body surface area (mg/m2) basis.

Oral administration of dalfampridine (0, 1, 3, and 9 to 6 mg/kg/day; high dose reduced during the second week of dosing) to female rats throughout pregnancy and lactation resulted in decreased offspring viability at the highest dose tested and decreased body weight in offspring at the mid and high doses. The no-effect dose for pre-and postnatal developmental toxicity in rats (1 mg/kg/day) is less than the MRHD on a mg/m2basis.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of dalfampridine in human milk, the effects of dalfampridine on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for dalfampridine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from dalfampridine or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in patients younger than 18 years of age have not been established.

### Blastocyst culture and transfer in clinically assisted reproduction: a committee opinion [^4b7e6c1f]. Fertility and Sterility (2018). Medium credibility.

Blastocyst culture and transfer in in vitro fertilization (IVF) — theoretical advantages and culture approaches — include potential for higher implantation and/or birth rates, selection of the most viable embryo(s), fewer embryos transferred, and better timing with the endometrium because implantation in vivo generally occurs on days 5–7; culture systems may use two sequential media or a single medium, and studies indicate a single-step medium supports blastocyst development equivalently to sequential media. Determining prospectively, for each patient, whether extended culture will increase the likelihood of a healthy baby compared with cleavage-stage transfer remains challenging due to an inability to predict which cleavage-stage embryos will develop into viable blastocysts.

### The emerging role of viability testing during liver machine perfusion [^09421bf1]. Liver Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

The transplant community continues to be challenged by the disparity between the need for liver transplantation and the shortage of suitable donor organs. At the same time, the number of unused donor livers continues to increase, most likely attributed to the worsening quality of these organs. To date, there is no reliable marker of liver graft viability that can predict good posttransplant outcomes. Ex situ machine perfusion offers additional data to assess the viability of donor livers before transplantation. Hence, livers initially considered unsuitable for transplantation can be assessed during machine perfusion in terms of appearance and consistency, hemodynamics, and metabolic and excretory function. In addition, postoperative complications such as primary nonfunction or posttransplant cholangiopathy may be predicted and avoided. A variety of viability criteria have been used in machine perfusion, and to date there is no widely accepted composition of criteria for clinical use. This review discusses potential viability markers for hepatobiliary function during machine perfusion, describes current limitations, and provides future recommendations for the use of viability criteria in clinical liver transplantation.

### Obstetric care consensus # 10: management of Stillbirth: (replaces practice bulletin number 102, March 2009) [^77ee8621]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Obstetric care consensus — definition and reporting thresholds — fetal death is defined as the delivery of a fetus showing no signs of life based on absent breathing, heartbeats, umbilical cord pulsation, or definite voluntary movements. Reporting is suggested for fetal deaths at 20 weeks or greater of gestation (if known) or for a weight greater than or equal to 350 g if gestational age is unknown. The cutoff of 350 g is the 50th percentile of weight at 20 weeks of gestation. US vital statistics data are collected for fetal deaths with a stated or presumed period of gestation of 20 weeks or more, and terminations for life-limiting fetal anomalies and for previable premature rupture of membranes are specifically excluded and classified as terminations of pregnancy. The term stillbirth is preferred among parent groups and is used in this document.

### Dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics proteins are a targetable feature of human tumors [^6ee887fe]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Short-term growth-inhibition assay

Cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 2000 cells/well. To generate GI 50 curves, cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or an eight-log serial dilution of drug. Each treatment condition was represented by at least three replicates. Three days after drug addition, cell viability was measured using Cell Titer Glo® (Promega). Relative viability was then calculated by normalizing luminescence values for each treatment condition to control treated wells. To generate GI 50 curves for drug combinations, slight modifications are made. Primary drug was applied and diluted as above while the second drug was kept at a constant concentration across all wells except the DMSO-only condition. Viability for all primary drug dilutions was then calculated relative to luminescence values from the secondary drug-only condition. We plot the viability vs. concentration curve for drug A (normalized appropriately to the viability of cells treated with DMSO in media control). Next, we plot the viability vs. concentration curve for drug A in the presence of a fixed dose of drug B (this time normalizing to the viability of cells treated with drug B alone). Sensitization of cells to drug A by drug B is evidenced by a leftward shift in the curve. Dose–response curves were fit using Graph pad/ Prism 6 software.

### Defining safe criteria to diagnose miscarriage: prospective observational multicentre study [^8389353b]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Objectives To validate recent guidance changes by establishing the performance of cut-off values for embryo crown-rump length and mean gestational sac diameter to diagnose miscarriage with high levels of certainty. Secondary aims were to examine the influence of gestational age on interpretation of mean gestational sac diameter and crown-rump length values, determine the optimal intervals between scans and findings on repeat scans that definitively diagnose pregnancy failure.)

Design Prospective multicentre observational trial.

Setting Seven hospital based early pregnancy assessment units in the United Kingdom.

Participants 2845 women with intrauterine pregnancies of unknown viability included if transvaginal ultrasonography showed an intrauterine pregnancy of uncertain viability. In three hospitals this was initially defined as an empty gestational sac < 20 mm mean diameter with or without a visible yolk sac but no embryo, or an embryo with crown-rump length < 6 mm with no heartbeat. Following amended guidance in December 2011 this definition changed to a gestational sac size < 25 mm or embryo crown-rump length < 7 mm. At one unit the definition was extended throughout to include a mean gestational sac diameter < 30 mm or embryo crown-rump length < 8 mm.

Main outcome measures Mean gestational sac diameter, crown-rump length, and presence or absence of embryo heart activity at initial and repeat transvaginal ultrasonography around 7–14 days later. The final outcome was pregnancy viability at 11–14 weeks' gestation.

Results The following indicated a miscarriage at initial scan: mean gestational sac diameter ≥ 25 mm with an empty sac (364/364 specificity: 100%, 95% confidence interval 99.0% to 100%), embryo with crown-rump length ≥ 7 mm without visible embryo heart activity (110/110 specificity: 100%, 96.7% to 100%), mean gestational sac diameter ≥ 18 mm for gestational sacs without an embryo presenting after 70 days' gestation (907/907 specificity: 100%, 99.6% to 100%), embryo with crown-rump length ≥ 3 mm without visible heart activity presenting after 70 days' gestation (87/87 specificity: 100%, 95.8% to 100%). The following were indicative of miscarriage at a repeat scan: initial scan and repeat scan after seven days or more showing an embryo without visible heart activity (103/103 specificity: 100%, 96.5% to 100%), pregnancies without an embryo and mean gestational sac diameter < 12 mm where the mean diameter has not doubled after 14 days or more (478/478 specificity: 100%, 99.2% to 100%), pregnancies without an embryo and mean gestational sac diameter ≥ 12 mm showing no embryo heartbeat after seven days or more (150/150 specificity: 100%, 97.6% to 100%).

Conclusions Recently changed cut-off values of gestational sac and embryo size defining miscarriage are appropriate and not too conservative but do not take into account gestational age. Guidance on timing between scans and expected findings on repeat scans are still too liberal. Protocols for miscarriage diagnosis should be reviewed to account for this evidence to avoid misdiagnosis and the risk of terminating viable pregnancies.

eFigure 3. Timing of Prenatal Care Initiation for Pregnancies Exposed to Teratogenic Medications Considering Any Pregnancy eFigure
4. Timing of Prenatal Care Initiation for Pregnancies Exposed to Teratogenic Medications Considering Pregnancies Viable Up to the Assessed Gestational Week. By 15 weeks, teratogenic exposures had occurred for 48. 9% of all teratogen-exposed pregnancies; prenatal care initiation occurred after 15 weeks for 1810 with live deliveries and 2975 with nonlive outcomes. We summarized the number of pregnancy episodes exposed to teratogenic medications and the timing of initiation of prenatal care considering 3 cutoffs commonly used in current state abortion laws: 6, 15, and 22 weeks' gestation.

For each gestational period, we categorized pregnancies with teratogen exposure regarding timing of prenatal care initiation as the first prenatal care visit before teratogen exposure, the first prenatal care visit after teratogen exposure but within the evaluated gestational period, or the first prenatal care visit after the evaluated gestational period or no prenatal care. Among pregnancies with prenatal care, median time to initiation was 56 days. In 81. 5% of pregnancies with a live birth, a prenatal care visit occurred during the first trimester compared with
46. 0% of pregnancies with a nonlive birth. Finally, among pregnancies exposed to teratogenic medications within 22 weeks' gestation, prenatal care was initiated before teratogen exposure in only 8612 of 15 749 with live deliveries and was initiated after 22 weeks or never occurred in 1696.

### Acidosis overrides oxygen deprivation to maintain mitochondrial function and cell survival [^8e7e1cb6]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Sustained cellular function and viability of high-energy demanding post-mitotic cells rely on the continuous supply of ATP. The utilization of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for efficient ATP generation is a function of oxygen levels. As such, oxygen deprivation, in physiological or pathological settings, has profound effects on cell metabolism and survival. Here we show that mild extracellular acidosis, a physiological consequence of anaerobic metabolism, can reprogramme the mitochondrial metabolic pathway to preserve efficient ATP production regardless of oxygen levels. Acidosis initiates a rapid and reversible homeostatic programme that restructures mitochondria, by regulating mitochondrial dynamics and cristae architecture, to reconfigure mitochondrial efficiency, maintain mitochondrial function and cell survival. Preventing mitochondrial remodelling results in mitochondrial dysfunction, fragmentation and cell death. Our findings challenge the notion that oxygen availability is a key limiting factor in oxidative metabolism and brings forth the concept that mitochondrial morphology can dictate the bioenergetic status of post-mitotic cells.

### Standard terminology for fetal, infant, and perinatal deaths [^be5f18c3]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Vital event definitions — suggested reporting language: "Vital events are best defined and reported as follows:" Live birth is "The complete expulsion or extraction from the mother of a product of human conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy, which, after such expulsion or extraction, breathes or shows any other evidence of life such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, regardless of whether the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached", with the clarification that "Heartbeats are to be distinguished from transient cardiac contractions; respirations are to be distinguished from fleeting respiratory efforts or gasps". Fetal death is "Death before the complete expulsion or extraction from the mother of a product of human conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy that is not an induced termination of pregnancy. The death is indicated by the fact that, after such expulsion or extraction, the fetus does not breathe or show any other evidence of life such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles".

### AXL confers intrinsic resistance to osimertinib and advances the emergence of tolerant cells [^7789bc89]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

We next examined the effect of knockdown of HER3, MET, and AXL on the viability of PC-9 and PC-9GXR cells, which have exon 19 deleted and the T790M mutation in EGFR. In the absence of osimertinib, knockdown of HER3, MET, and AXL using specific siRNAs resulted in the inhibition of PC-9 and PC-9GXR cell viability by 30–40%, 25%, and less than 20%, respectively (Fig. 1c). Osimertinib inhibited the viability of both PC-9 and T790M-positive PC-9GXR cells by 50%, consistent with its activity as third-generation EGFR-TKI. In the presence of osimertinib for 72 h, knockdown of MET did not affect cell viability, while knockdown of HER3 or AXL further decreased the viability of PC-9 and PC-9GXR cells to about 20%. These results suggested that AXL and HER3 may have promoted the survival of a subset of EGFR -mutated NSCLC cells in which the EGFR signal was inhibited by the 72-h exposure to osimertinib. In comparison to osimertinib treatment, when PC-9 and PC-9GXR cells were treated with siRNA specific for EGFR, cell viability was reduced by 25–30%. Knockdown of HER3 also reduced cell viability by 25–30%, but knockdown of AXL only marginally reduced cell viability. These results are consistent with previous findings that heterodimerization of EGFR and HER3 contributes to the maintenance of oncogenic signaling in EGFR -mutated NSCLC cells. Under these experimental conditions, dual knockdown of EGFR and either AXL or HER3 showed greater reductions in cell viability compared with the knockdown of EGFR alone (Fig. 1d). Interestingly, dual knockdown of HER3 and AXL decreased cell viability as effectively as the dual knockdown of EGFR and AXL, suggesting an interaction between AXL and EGFR or HER3.

### Cracking the code: predicting tumor microenvironment enabled chemoresistance with machine learning in the human tumoroid models [^30152457]. NPJ Biomedical Innovations (2025). Medium credibility.

Within each drug treatment, there were significant differences in cancer cell viability between tumoroid cell compositions (Fig. 2A–G). In tumoroids treated with carboplatin, the lowest viability was found in compositions 1 and 3, which were solely composed of OVCAR3 cells, with 0.563 ± 0.027 and 0.580 ± 0.031 mean normalized viability ± standard error of the mean, respectively. The tumoroids with the highest viability in response to carboplatin were compositions 11 and 21, with 0.954 ± 0.021 and 0.887 ± 0.035 normalized viability, respectively, which both contained 500 U937s. Similarly, compositions 1 and 3 had the lowest viability of all the tumoroid compositions when treated with paclitaxel (0.782 ± 0.016 and 0.781 ± 0.023, respectively), PACMA31 (0.517 ± 0.012 and 0.568 ± 0.021, respectively), or N773 (0.641 ± 0.018 and 0.680 ± 0.012). However, the tumoroid compositions with the highest viability varied between drug treatments. For paclitaxel, the highest viability was found in tumoroid compositions 14 and 5 (1.04 ± 0.025 and 1.01 ± 0.023, respectively), which both contained all four cell types. For PACMA31, the highest viability was found in tumoroid compositions 11 and 7 (0.956 ± 0.021 and 0.900 ± 0.029, respectively), which both contained U937s. For N773, the highest viability was found in tumoroid compositions 14 and 11 (1.00 ± 0.039 and 0.976 ± 0.037), which both contained U937s. Finally, SC144 deviated the most from the other drugs, with the lowest viability being recorded in tumoroid compositions 20 and 10 (0.786 ± 0.029 and 0.865 ± 0.030), which both contained 500 human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and the highest viability in tumoroid compositions 15 and 1 (1.06 ± 0.026 and 1.04 ± 0.035), which were quite different from each other in terms of cell composition. ANOVAs were performed to compare viability across tumoroid compositions for each drug treatment, and p values were reported in a heatmap (Fig. 2G). In Fig. 2G, the most significant differences were clustered in the left half of the heatmap, corresponding to comparisons of compositions 1, 2, and 3 (the cancer cell-only conditions) with the other 20 compositions that also contained non-tumor cells. Paclitaxel, PACMA31, and N773 treatment yielded the most significant differences in viability. Interestingly, a similar cluster of significant differences exists in both the carboplatin and PACMA31 treatment groups (Fig. 2G). Upon examination, these clusters correspond to the increased chemoresistance of composition 11 (with macrophages and cancer cells) compared to compositions 12–20, comprising three or four cell types (all contain MSCs and endothelial cells) (see Fig. 1A, B, Table 1).

### Comparison of left ventriculography and coronary arteriography with positron emission tomography in assessment of myocardial viability [^3afcd9b6]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Assessment of viability of myocardium after an ischemic insult is an important clinical question that affects decisions pertaining to potential revascularization. The results of contrast left ventriculograms and coronary angiography were compared to positron emission tomography (PET) in 64 patients with coronary artery disease and reduced left ventricular function.

Hypothesis

The study was undertaken to determine the relative utility of the invasive studies in the assessment of viability.

Methods

Right anterior oblique ventriculograms were assessed for hypokinesis, akinesis, or dyskinesis in six segments. The PET scans were assessed for viability by visual estimation of flourodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in six segments that corresponded to the segments analyzed on the ventriculograms.

Results

Of a total of 373 segments successfully analyzed by PET, 272 were judged to be viable (normal or hypokinetic) by contrast ventriculography. Of these, 253 (93%) were considered viable by PET. Of 177 segments deemed either normal or mild-to-moderately hypokinetic by ventriculography, 170 (94%) were viable by PET. Of 95 severely hypokinetic segments, 83 (84%) were viable by PET. Of 79 akinetic segments, 44 (56%) were considered viable by PET. For segments that were dyskinetic and thought to be nonviable by ventriculography, 19 of 22 (86%) were also considered nonviable by PET. For 294 segments for which a determination on viability was made based on the presence of wall motion on the ventriculogram (normal, hypokinetic, ordyskinetic; not akinetic), there was excellent agreement with PET (93%; p < 0.001). In 49 patients there was akinesis in no more than one segment in either the anterior or inferior territories, indicating the potential for assessment of viability by ventriculography in at least two of three segments in each territory. Coronary anatomy was analyzed to assess whether coronary patency could help in assessing viability. Segments supplied by patent arteries were more likely to be viable by PET than segments supplied by occluded arteries (p < 0.001). Akinetic segments were more likely to be supplied by occluded arteries (56 vs. 23, 72%). Dyskinetic segments were predominantly nonviable by PET (86%) and were usually supplied by occluded arteries (77%).

Conclusion

In patients in whom the assessment of viability is clinically relevant, the presence of systolic inward motion on the contrast left ventriculogram correlates well with segment viability by PET, while outward or dyskinetic movement correlates well with nonviability. Thus, the use of PET to assess viability in many patients may be unnecessary.

### Care of late intrauterine fetal death and stillbirth: green-top guideline no. 55 [^ce016d5c]. BJOG (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for stillbirth, more specifically with respect to management of subsequent pregnancy, monitoring, RCOG 2025 guidelines recommend to offer fetal biometry and amniotic fluid measurement, with additional Doppler flow velocimetry of the umbilical artery where appropriate, in patients in a subsequent pregnancy after late intrauterine fetal demise associated with placental dysfunction or in unexplained cases, at a minimum of every 3–4 weeks from 26–28 weeks of gestation.

### Standard terminology for fetal, infant, and perinatal deaths [^37a2935e]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Fetal death — definition and gestational subcategories specify that a fetus is defined from 8 weeks after conception until term while in the uterus and that fetal death is defined as death before the complete expulsion or extraction from the mother of a product of human conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy that is not an induced termination of pregnancy, with death indicated by absence of breathing or other evidence of life such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles; heartbeats and respirations are to be distinguished from transient or fleeting efforts. For statistical purposes, fetal deaths are further subdivided as "early" (20–27 weeks' gestation) or "late" (≥ 28 weeks' gestation), the term "stillbirth" is used to describe fetal deaths at 20 weeks' gestation or more, for international comparisons stillbirth is defined as at or after 28 weeks' gestation, and fetuses that die in utero before 20 weeks' gestation are categorized specifically as miscarriages.

### Relationship between extent of residual myocardial viability and coronary flow reserve in patients with recent myocardial infarction [^f114cbb1]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The presence of viability in an infarct zone implies an intact microvasculature. We hypothesized that coronary flow reserve (CFR), which assesses the microcirculation, would correlate with the extent of viability in infarction zones.

Methods

CFR was measured after stenting in 17 patients with single vessel disease > 48 hours from infarction. Viability was determined with use of single-photon emission computed tomography sestamibi imaging.

Results

Sestamibi uptake in the infarct zone correlated with CFR in the infarct artery (r = 0.62, P = 0.008) and sestamibi uptake in the infarct zone was greater in patients with normal CFR than in patients with abnormal CFR (61.9 ± 9.1% vs 46.3 ± 9.6%, P = 0.004). In addition, CFR was greater in patients with viability compared with patients without viability (2.4 ± 1.3 vs 1.4 ± 0.4, P = 0.015).

Conclusions

CFR correlates with the extent of viability after infarction. Preserved CFR in an infarct-related artery implies preserved viability.

EMBRYONIC AND FETAL DEVELOPMENT

To understand ART procedures and their potential risks, background knowledge of embryonic and fetal development is necessary. The initial fusion of egg and sperm gametes results in a diploid zygote (Figure 2). Cleavage divisions of the zygote occur every 12 to 24 hours, with individual cells at this stage termed a blastomere. At one day after the eight‐cell stage the zygote becomes a morula, at which time all cells are totipotent. The morula subsequently develops into a blastocyst on day 5. Natural implantation occurs during days 8 to 9.

FIGURE 2
Embryology. After ovulation and fertilization, the oocyte develops into a zygote which implants in the uterine wall. After implantation, the zygote will continue to develop until delivery.

Advances in culture media have led to a shift in IVF from cleavage stage embryo transfer to blastocyst stage transfer, with the belief that blastocyst transfer will improve uterine and embryonic synchronicity and enable self‐selection of viable embryos, leading to improved rates of live birth. PGT, when indicated, is now also performed at the blastocyst stage. However, it remains unclear whether the day of transfer has a beneficial effect on live birth and pregnancy rates.

Embryonic development extends from fertilization through the 10th week of pregnancy, during which time organs and body structures are formed. Fetal development begins at the 11th week (the 9th week after fertilization) and continues until birth. Embryonic and fetal development are precisely temporally and spatially organized. This elegant process is guided both by genomic mechanisms and by the environment, including maternal nutrition.

### Viability of cartilage grafts in various forms [^dafd5e98]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The viability of cartilage grafts, in many forms, has been researched since the using of cartilage grafts in surgical procedures. Cryopreservation period and viability of cartilage grafts have remained unclear. This study was performed to investigate the durability, viability, and behavior of fresh or cryopreserved cartilage grafts when used as autografts or allografts in various forms. Six cartilage grafts (1 of each preparation type; 3 blocks and 3 diced) were prepared by wrapping with Surgicel or autogenous fascia, or they were left bare. After the graft preparation stage, the cartilage grafts were inserted into pockets prepared on the dorsum of each rabbit. Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 (6 rabbits in each group) received autogenous fresh grafts, allogenous fresh grafts, autogenous cryopreserved grafts, and allogenous cryopreserved grafts, respectively. All cartilage grafts were implanted for 2 months. At the end of the second month, specimens were harvested and analyzed. The bare grafts provided the most viable specimens. There was no significant difference between the frozen or fresh and allograft or autograft groups with respect to viability and resorption ratios. The bare block graft, in all groups, survived significantly more than the other graft types. Allografts (homografts), similar autografts, did not create major problems, and they had excellent host tolerance and low antigenicity, especially when the perichondrium was removed. Viability and durability of the bare grafts (diced and block) were better than fascia or Surgicel-wrapped cartilage graft forms.

### A simple and improved method to determine cell viability in burn-injured tissue [^6a32d1fc]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cell viability is paramount to wound healing in burn injury. Current methods to determine depth of burn injury in the research setting are based on the subjective visualization of cell viability using hematoxylin and eosin staining. The purpose of this study was to develop a simplified method of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) staining to identify viable cells in frozen sections of human burn tissue that can be used in the research setting.

Materials and Methods

After surgical excision, human burn tissue was processed for histologic evaluation. Tissues were fixed and protected with sucrose incubation before cryopreservation. An LDH staining method was developed and evaluated for prolonged stain stability. To evaluate cellular viability in the tissues as demonstrated by enzymatic activity of LDH, digital images of tissue sections were obtained immediately after and 1 mo after staining.

Results

The cryopreserved sections of deep partial thickness human burn tissue revealed cellular viability throughout the tissue with the exception of the most superficial region of the tissue. Unlike the hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections, clear demarcation of cellular viability was evident in the LDH-stained sections.

Conclusions

Our simplified protocol identifies, without ambiguity, the viability of the cellular elements in deep partial thickness and full thickness burn injured tissue.

### Standard terminology for fetal, infant, and perinatal deaths [^bf433b35]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Live birth — definition states that a live birth is defined as the complete expulsion or extraction from the mother of a product of human conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy, which, after such expulsion or extraction, breathes or shows any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, regardless of whether the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached, and that heartbeats are to be distinguished from transient cardiac contractions; respirations are to be distinguished from fleeting respiratory efforts or gasps.

### Insulin lispro [^2a766ed1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Data

Human Data

Published data from retrospective studies and meta-analyses do not report an association with insulin lispro and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when insulin lispro is used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish or exclude the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations including small sample size, selection bias, confounding by unmeasured factors, and some lacking comparator groups.

Animal Data

In a combined fertility and embryo-fetal development study, female rats were given subcutaneous insulin lispro injections of 1, 5, and 20 units/kg/day (0.2, 0.8, and 3 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit insulin lispro/kg/day, based on units/body surface area, respectively) from 2 weeks prior to cohabitation through Gestation Day 19. There were no adverse effects on female fertility, implantation, or fetal viability and morphology. However, fetal growth retardation was produced at the 20 units/kg/day-dose as indicated by decreased fetal weight and an increased incidence of fetal runts/litter.

In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits, insulin lispro doses of 0.1, 0.25, and 0.75 unit/kg/day (0.03, 0.08, and 0.2 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit insulin lispro/kg/day, based on units/body surface area, respectively) were injected subcutaneously on Gestation days 7 through 19. There were no adverse effects on fetal viability, weight, and morphology at any dose.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Available data from published literature suggests that exogenous human insulin products, including insulin lispro, are transferred into human milk. There are no adverse reactions reported in breastfed infants in the literature. There are no data on the effects of exogenous human insulin products, including insulin lispro, on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for insulin, any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Insulin Lispro or from the underlying maternal condition.

### Prognostic interaction between viability and residual myocardial ischemia by dobutamine stress echocardiography in patients with acute myocardial infarction and mildly impaired left ventricular function [^524b638c]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) accurately detects viable myocardium and residual ischemia in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The prognostic interaction of viability and ischemia has not been completely clarified in these patients. This study assesses the long-term effect of viability, ischemia, or their combination on survival in patients with AMI and mildly impaired left ventricular (LV) function. Four hundred eleven patients (age 57 ± 9 years) underwent predischarge DSE (up to 40 microg/kg/min plus atropine if needed) after uncomplicated AMI and were prospectively followed for 23 months (range 1 to 78). According to DSE findings, patients were divided into 4 groups: viability only, ischemia only, combination of viability and ischemia, and scar. Adverse outcome occurred in 64 patients: 34 patients had hard events (9 cardiac deaths, 25 nonfatal AMI) and 30 patients had unstable angina requiring hospitalization. The combination of viability and ischemia, diabetes mellitus, and non-Q-wave AMI were significant predictors of all events at univariate and multivariate analysis. The same variables were also univariate predictors of hard events, but multivariate analysis indicated only the combination of viability and ischemia and diabetes as independent predictors. The event-free survival of patients with combined viability and ischemia was significantly lower (hazard ratio 3 [95% confidence interval 1.8 to 11]) compared with patients with ischemia only. Thus, viability and ischemia show a significant adverse prognostic interaction in patients with AMI and preserved LV function.

### Impact of tissue handling and size modification on septal chondrocyte viability [^dadf483c]. The Laryngoscope (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The physical modification of cartilage grafts during rhinoplasty risks chondrocyte death at the margins where the tissue is cut. This study compares chondrocyte viability between diced, scaled, and pate samples in human models, and further computes percent chondrocyte viability as a function of sequential dicing size in a computational model.

Methods

Septal cartilage from 11 individuals was prepared as follows: diced (1mm cubic), scaled (shaved to < 1mm thickness~translucent), pate (0.02g of scraped cartilage surface), positive control (2 ×2mm diced), and negative control (2 ×2mm diced soaked in 70% EtOH). Viability analysis was performed using Live/Dead assay™ and confocal microscopy. Numerical simulation of cartilage dicing in 0.05mm increments was performed using MATLAB assuming 250 chondrocytes/mm 3 with each average chondrocyte size of 65μm 2.

Results

Chondrocyte viability was similar between 1mm diced cartilage, scaled cartilage, and positive control samples (p > 0.05). Conversely, pate samples had significantly less viability compared to positive controls, diced samples, and scaled samples (all p < 0.01 after Bonferroni correction). Pate samples had similar chondrocyte viability compared to negative controls (p = 0.36). On computational modeling, cartilage viability decreased to 50% as the diced sample was cut from 1mm edge length to 0.7–0.8mm. Similarly, cartilage viability decreased to 26% at 0.55–0.65mm, 11% at 0.4–0.5mm, and < 5% at < 0.4mm edge length.

Conclusion

Modifying septal cartilage grafts into 1mm diced or scaled samples maintains ideal chondrocyte viability whereas pate preparations result in significant chondrocyte death. According to computational analysis, chondrocyte viability sharply decreases as the cartilage is diced below 0.7–0.8mm.

### Head lice [^37ad9b74]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Head lice — etiologic agent and life cycle are characterized by adults that are 2 to 3 mm long with 6 legs; females live up to 3 to 4 weeks and can lay up to 10 eggs per day, with eggs attached within ~ 2 mm of the scalp. Eggs hatch in 8 to 9 days (varying from 7 to 12 days), and after hatching nymphs pass through 3 nymph stages during the next 9 to 12 days before adulthood; females begin laying viable eggs ~ 1.5 days after becoming adults, and the cycle repeats approximately every 3 weeks if not treated. With a first case, pruritus may not develop for 4 to 6 weeks; head lice usually survive for less than 1 day away from the scalp and nits cannot hatch at temperatures lower than those near the scalp, and head lice are specific to humans and cannot be transferred between humans and pets.

### Autograft cellular contribution to spinal fusion and effects of intraoperative storage conditions [^58b88488]. Spine (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
Representative μCTs at 8 weeks in coronal and sagittal planes demonstrating differences in bone formation between viable (A), partially devitalized (B), and devitalized (C) autograft groups. Viable (A) and partially devitalized (B) autografts had bilateral fusions bridging the TPs in spines graded as fused. Devitalized (C) autograft lacked bone bridging between the TPs. μCT indicates microcomputed tomography; TP, transverse process.

Next, we investigated how the storage of bone impacts adherent cell viability. Ex vivo cell viability results are presented in Figure 3 and Table 2, with results normalized to the baseline (T = 0) cell viability. Viability for both sheep and cow bone left out dry declined quickly with time and followed similar trends (Figure 3 A). After 1 hour, viability dropped to 67% and 49% for cow and sheep bone, respectively. This viability decline continued, though less drastically, at 2 and 4 hours to 47% and 40% for cow bone, and 38% and 26% for sheep bone. Aggregated results (Figure 3 B) showed highly significant decreases in viability relative to baseline at 1, 2, and 4 hours to 63%, 46%, and 37%, respectively (all P < 0.001).

Figure 3
Adherent bone cell viability after 1, 2, or 4 hours. A, Sheep (n ≥ 3) and cow bone (n ≥ 8) cell viability both decreased in a similar manner when left out to dry after harvest. B, Combined sheep and cow bone cell viability decreased to 63% after 1 hour, 46% after 2 hours, and 37% after 4 hours. Data are presented as mean values ± SEM. * denotes P < 0.05, ** denotes P < 0.01, and ** denotes P < 0.001 relative to T = 0 hour cell viability.

TABLE 2
Adherent Bone Cell Viability in Cow and Sheep Bone

To determine whether losses in adherent cell viability can be prevented, sheep bone was either left out dry or immersed in saline for 4 hours; viability results are shown in Figure 4 and Table 3. Viability for dried samples dropped to 21% after a 4-hour drying period, which was significantly lower than the baseline viability (P < 0.001). Samples immersed in saline had statistically similar viability at both time points (P = 0.71).

### The effect of centrifugation on viability of fat grafts: an evaluation with the glucose transport test [^64bfcfea]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

An up-to-date, simple, but useful technique to evaluate the viability of fat grafts prior to transplant is lacking. The purpose of this study is to introduce the glucose transport test - a new method to evaluate the viability of fat grafts after they are subjected to different centrifugal forces in vitro.

Method

Fat grafts were harvested from healthy patients who underwent liposuction for body contouring. The glucose transport test was performed to evaluate the viability of fat grafts after centrifugation with different forces (1000–4000 rpm). An MTT assay was also performed with the same experimental protocol for comparison. Routine histological examination was done in all groups to examine possible structural destruction after centrifugation.

Results

When compared with the group not subjected to centrifugation, the glucose transport test showed a significant decrease in viability of fat grafts in all of the other four groups (all p < 0.001). There was a linear reduction of viability in fat grafts with the increase in centrifugal force (all p < 0.03). MTT assay showed similar findings on the viability of fat grafts in all five groups and correlated well with the glucose transport test (r = 0.9870). Histology showed significantly distorted and fractured adipocytes when the centrifugal force reached 4000 rpm.

Conclusion

Our study demonstrates the harmful effect on the viability of fat grafts with an increase in centrifugal force and, for the first time, that the glucose transport test may be an effective and potentially useful method to evaluate the viability of fat grafts in a clinical setting.

### Salvage of contaminated osteochondral allografts: the effects of chlorhexidine on human articular chondrocyte viability [^bd31bba1]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Because chondrocyte viability is imperative for successful osteochondral allograft transplantation, sterilization techniques must provide antimicrobial effects with minimal cartilage toxicity. Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) is an effective disinfectant; however, its use with human articular cartilage requires further investigation.

Purpose

To determine the maximal chlorhexidine concentration that does not affect chondrocyte viability in allografts and to determine whether this concentration effectively sterilizes contaminated osteoarticular grafts.

Study Design

Controlled laboratory study.

Methods

Osteochondral plugs were subjected to pulse lavage with 1-L solutions of 0.002%, 0.01%, 0.05%, and 0.25% CHG and cultured for 0, 1, 2, and 7 days in media of 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Chondrocyte viability was determined via LIVE/DEAD Viability Assay. Plugs were contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus and randomized to 4 treatment groups. One group was not contaminated; the 3 others were contaminated and received no treatment, saline pulse lavage, or saline pulse lavage with 0.002% CHG. Serial dilutions were plated and colony-forming units assessed.

Results

The control group and the 0.002% CHG group showed similar cell viability, ranging from 67% ± 4% to 81% ± 22% (mean ± SD) at all time points. In the 0.01% CHG group, cell viability was reduced in comparison with control by 2-fold at day 2 and remained until day 7 (P < .01). The 0.05% and 0.25% CHG groups showed a 2-fold reduction in cell viability at day 1 (P < .01). At day 7, cell viability was reduced to 15% ± 18% (4-fold decrease) for the 0.05% CHG group and 10% ± 19% (6-fold decrease) for the 0.25% CHG group (P < .01). Contaminated grafts treated with 0.002% CHG demonstrated no colony-forming units.

Conclusion

Pulse lavage with 0.002% CHG does not cause significant cell death within 7 days after exposure, while CHG at concentrations > 0.002% significantly decreases chondrocyte viability within 1 to 2 days after exposure and should therefore not be used for disinfection of osteochondral allograft. Pulse lavage does not affect chondrocyte viability but cannot be used in isolation to sterilize contaminated fragments. Overall, 0.002% CHG was shown to effectively decontaminate osteoarticular fragments.

Clinical Relevance

This study offers a scientific protocol for sterilizing osteochondral fragments that does not adversely affect cartilage viability.

### Erythrocyte viability in blood salvaged during total joint arthroplasty with cement [^5fdab379]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Erythrocyte salvage, the collection of a patient's blood shed from the surgical wound, is one aspect of blood management. Previous investigators have examined salvaged blood for content; however, to our knowledge, none have examined the viability of erythrocytes after exposure to the chemical and thermal reactions produced by motorized instruments and polymethylmethacrylate during surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine the viability of salvaged erythrocytes from patients undergoing primary total joint arthroplasty with cement.

Methods

Erythrocyte viability studies were performed on specimens from three subjects with use of a double isotope-labeling technique employing chromium-51 and technetium-99m. With use of a fresh blood specimen obtained prior to surgery and a specimen of salvaged blood that had been recycled, washed, and filtered with use of the Cell Saver, the viability of the Cell-Saver-processed erythrocytes, labeled with chromium-51, was calculated on the basis of the technetium-99m-labeled red blood-cell mass.

Results

The mean erythrocyte viability (and standard deviation) in blood salvaged with use of the Cell Saver was 88.0% ± 3.8%. The standard of the American Association of Blood Banks for minimum erythrocyte viability in adequately cross-matched allogeneic blood or predeposited autologous blood is 70%.

Conclusions

The high rate of viability of the erythrocytes in this study shows that the Cell Saver is a valuable adjunct to other blood management techniques for patients having total joint arthroplasty. We believe that the very high mean rate of erythrocyte viability and the extremely small standard deviation in our three subjects, as compared with the standards of the American Association of Blood Banks, made additional study subjects unnecessary.

### Predictors for basal ganglia viability after mechanical thrombectomy in proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion [^64f1b480]. Clinical Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Background/Purpose

In acute proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion covering the lenticulostriate arteries (LSA), ischemic tolerance of basal ganglia is limited due to supposed lack of collateral supply. However, in several patients, basal ganglia (BG) infarction was absent after successful mechanical thrombectomy (MTE). Purpose of our study was to evaluate predictors for BG viability in stroke patients despite prolonged MCA mainstem occlusion.

Material/Methods

We retrospectively reviewed all stroke patients from our local registry with MCA mainstem occlusion after mechanical thrombectomy between November 2009 and October 2016. All patients underwent non-enhanced post-interventional cranial CT imaging (NCCT) and were classified according to 6 patterns of BG viability: complete: putamen (P) and globus pallidus (GP); partial: P or GP, and combination of complete or partial BG and/or adjacent white matter/cortical (WMC) viability. We compared viability patterns with respect to pre-interventional stroke imaging including NCCT, CT-angiography (CTA), CT perfusion (CTP); demographics, pre- and intra-procedural data and occurrence of post-procedural intracerebral hematoma (ICH). CTP imaging of the affected and contralateral BG-territories were obtained separately and CTA-collateral score (CS) was assessed.

Results

A significant correlation between higher collateral score and viability of GP (OR = 1.949; p = .011), P (OR = 2.039, p = .011), and the combination of GP, P and WMC (OR = 2.767, p = .007) was revealed. Higher relative CBV ratio (rCBVR) was significantly associated with viability of the pattern GP + WMC (univariate: OR = 3.160, p = .014; multivariate: OR = 6.058; p = .021).

Conclusion

CTA collateral score and rCBVR were predictive for BG viability in stroke patients after successful MTE in prolonged complete MCA-mainstem and LSA occlusion.

### Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride (actoplus Met) [^51cebe41]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Data

Human Data

Published data from postmarketing studies have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when metformin was used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any metformin-associated risk because of methodological limitations, including small sample size and inconsistent comparator groups.

Animal Data

Pioglitazone and Metformin HCl

Animal reproduction studies were not conducted with the combined products in ACTOPLUS MET. The following data are based on studies conducted with the individual components of ACTOPLUS MET.

Pioglitazone

Pioglitazone administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis did not cause adverse developmental effects at a dose of 20 mg/kg (~5 times the 45 mg clinical dose), but delayed parturition and reduced embryo-fetal viability at 40 and 80 mg/kg, or ≥ 9 times the 45 mg clinical dose, by body surface area. In pregnant rabbits administered pioglitazone during organogenesis, no adverse developmental effects were observed at 80 mg/kg (~35 times the 45 mg clinical dose), but reduced embryo-fetal viability at 160 mg/kg, or ~69 times the 45 mg clinical dose, by body surface area. When pregnant rats received pioglitazone during late gestation and lactation, delayed postnatal development, attributed to decreased body weight, occurred in offspring at maternal doses of 10 mg/kg and above or ≥ 2 times the 45 mg clinical dose, by body surface area.

Metformin HCl

Metformin HCl did not cause adverse developmental effects when administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits up to 600 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. This represents an exposure of about 2 to 6 times a 2,000 mg clinical dose based on body surface area (mg/m2) for rats and rabbits, respectively.

### Physical examination and… [^dc1ab307]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

20, 21 Ultrasound dating is considered accurate to within four to seven days in the first trimester, 10 to 14 days in the second trimester, and 21 days in the third trimester. 9, 21 Pregnancy dating should be confirmed with auscultation of fetal heart tones between 10 and 12 weeks, and with fetal quickening between 16 and 18 weeks in women who have been pregnant before or between 18 and 19 weeks in first pregnancies. 32 Infectious Diseases BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS Universal screening for bacterial vaginosis is not supported by current evidence. A recent systematic review found that screening and subsequent treatment of infection does not prevent delivery before 37 weeks' gestation, but decreases the risk of low birth weight and premature rupture of membranes.
35.

VARICELLA Maternal varicella can have significant fetal effects, including congenital varicella syndrome and neonatal varicella; infection can occur from approximately five days before to two days after birth. Maternal shingles is not a risk for the infant because of passive maternal immunity. There is some evidence to support assessing the mother's varicella history at the first prenatal visit, with serologic testing for those with a negative history. Women who test negative for immunoglobulin G should avoid exposure to varicella during pregnancy and be offered vaccination postpartum. 41 Intrapartum treatment is also recommended for women with group B streptococcus bacteriuria occurring at any stage of pregnancy, and for women with unknown group B streptococcus status and risk factors, and for women with a history of group B streptococcus bacteriuria during pregnancy.
41. POSTTERM PREGNANCY A Cochrane review of induction at 41 weeks' gestation versus expectant management to 42 weeks' gestation concluded that perinatal death was less common among women induced at 41 weeks, although it was rare in both groups. Although there is no evidence that prenatal testing decreases perinatal death with postterm pregnancy, the standard of care is twice-weekly nonstress testing and weekly assessment of amniotic fluid volume beginning at 41 weeks' gestation.

### Guidance on the limits to the number of embryos to transfer: a committee opinion [^ec63364e]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Embryo transfer limits — patients with a favorable prognosis are provided as recommended upper limits. Transfer of a euploid embryo should be limited to one, regardless of patient age, and patients < 35 years of age should be strongly encouraged to receive a single-embryo transfer, regardless of the embryo stage; for patients between 35 and 37 years of age, strong consideration should be made for a single-embryo transfer. For patients between 38 and 40 years of age, no more than 3 untested cleavage-stage embryos or 2 blastocysts should be transferred, and patients 41–42 years of age should plan to receive no more than 4 untested cleavage-stage embryos or 3 blastocysts.

Results

Early human embryo developmental kinetics and morphology

Eighty-five cryopreserved human zygotes were cultured for different time periods ranging from 2.3 to 64.9 h (Fig. 1). Developmental kinetics of each embryo were translated from frames to hours on the basis that an image frame was captured every 5 min. All timing intervals between the one- and nine-cell stages were measured for each embryo unless removed for molecular or chromosomal analysis before reaching this stage of development. We began by examining previously reported parameters including the duration of the first cytokinesis, the time between the two- and three-cell, and time between the three- and four-cell stages(Supplementary Table 1). The median duration of the first cytokinesis was 20 min (range 15 min to 2.9 h); the time from two- to three-cell stage was 11.4 h (range 0–16.8 h); and the median time between the three- and four-cell stage was 1.3 h (range 0–22.1 h). Besides evaluating previously identified imaging parameters, we also measured the time between pronuclei disappearance (PNd) and the start of the first cytokinesis, a recently described parameter that has been linked to human embryo viability, but not to the chromosomal status. As shown in Supplementary Table 1, the median for the time between PNd and the start of the first cytokinesis was 2.7 h (range 15 min to 22.2 h), suggesting that the wide range of this parameter might reflect underlying differences in embryo developmental potential.

### Effects of different levels of crushing on the viability of rabbit costal and nasal septal cartilages [^f3ac7e15]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Cartilage grafts are frequently used in nasal surgery for structural and/or aesthetic purposes. The literature holds contradictory reports concerning the effect of crushing on the viability of cartilage grafts.

Methods

Nasal septal and costal cartilage grafts were harvested from 12 New Zealand rabbits. Each nasal septal and costal cartilage was divided into five equal pieces. One of the pieces was left intact and the remaining four were prepared as slightly, moderately, severely, or significantly crushed. The cartilage pieces were then autoimplanted into the paravertebral skin of the rabbits. The animals were euthanized 4 months later and the effect of crushing on cartilage grafts was assessed pathologically.

Results

The viability of the chondrocytes was found to be decreased as the level of crushing increased. The mean chondrocyte viability rates for the intact, slightly crushed, moderately crushed, severely crushed, and significantly crushed cartilages were 88, 75, 51, 41, and 13 percent for the septal cartilages and 94, 83, 62, 32, and 26 percent for the costal cartilages, respectively. The differences between the mean viability rates of septal and costal cartilage groups were statistically not significant.

Conclusions

The level of crushing determines the rate of viability for the crushed cartilage. Viability rates and the clinical properties of the slightly crushed cartilage grafts at long-term follow-up may be similar to those of the intact cartilage grafts. However, severe or significant crushing leads to a decrement in the viability of the chondrocytes and may cause unpredictable degrees of volume loss at long-term follow-up.

### Obstetric care consensus no. 6: periviable birth [^60ac7e2d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Table 2 — recommendations for periviable birth emphasize system planning and multidisciplinary counseling. Based on anticipated neonatal or maternal complications, antepartum transport to a center with advanced levels of neonatal or maternal care is recommended when feasible and appropriate (Best practice). Prenatal and postnatal counseling regarding anticipated short-term and long-term neonatal outcome should take into consideration anticipated gestational age at delivery and variables that may alter survival and adverse newborn outcomes (for example, fetal sex, multiple gestation, suspected major fetal malformations, antenatal corticosteroid administration, birth weight, and response to initial newborn resuscitation) (Best practice). Family counseling should be provided by a multidisciplinary team that includes obstetrician–gynecologists and other obstetric providers, maternal–fetal medicine specialists, if available, and neonatologists; maternal and neonatal outcomes should be considered, and follow-up counseling should be provided when relevant new information emerges (Best practice). A predelivery plan made with the parents, family, or both should be recognized as a general plan that may be modified as the neonate's condition and response are evaluated; a stepwise approach concordant with neonatal circumstances and condition and with parental wishes, with regular reevaluation and potential redirection, is appropriate (Best practice). Recommendations regarding specific interventions tailored to gestational age and other clinical data, taking into account individual family preferences and values, are summarized in Table 3.
