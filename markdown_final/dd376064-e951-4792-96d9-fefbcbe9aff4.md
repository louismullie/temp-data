## Question

risperidone injectable

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about long-acting injectable risperidone (RLAI) for schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic rationale for using RLAI versus oral risperidone. Then, I should evaluate efficacy across patient populations and trial designs, including first-episode versus chronic illness. Next, I will review safety and mortality data, followed by cost-effectiveness. After that, I should check current guideline positions and dosing consensus. Finally, I will synthesize which patients benefit most, practical implementation steps, and key evidence gaps to guide decision-making.

> Let me start with the pharmacologic profile because it frames why we might expect different clinical performance from an LAI. RLAI (microsphere formulation) provides biweekly intramuscular dosing with a delayed release that yields lower peak concentrations and reduced peak–trough fluctuation versus oral risperidone while maintaining overall exposure bioequivalence of the active moiety, which could decrease peak-related adverse effects and trough-related relapse risk, at least theoretically [^116hHF8C]. Wait, let me verify the receptor engagement claim: PET data show post-injection D2 occupancy around 71% at 25 mg and 74% at 50 mg, with pre-injection occupancies remaining largely within the therapeutic window, supporting the usual 25–50 mg every-2-weeks range for maintenance efficacy [^1172Ls4G]. I should confirm dose-conversion expectations: clinical PK work suggests approximations of LAI 25 mg ≈ oral 3–4 mg/day, 37.5 mg ≈ 5–6 mg/day, and 50 mg ≈ 6–8 mg/day, which aligns with expert dosing consensus for risperidone microspheres [^112GkmCb] [^113sr21u].

> Next, I should review efficacy, and I need to be careful to separate first-episode from chronic cohorts. In a high-quality first-episode trial, RLAI was associated with a markedly lower 12-month relapse rate versus oral risperidone (5% vs 33%), suggesting a large adherence-mediated advantage early in illness; hold on, let me verify if sample size and design could inflate the effect — despite the dramatic relative risk reduction, the direction and magnitude are consistent with heightened adherence benefits in the early course of schizophrenia, making this a clinically meaningful signal in first-episode care [^116YsS33]. By contrast, in chronic or unstable illness under close monitoring, two major effectiveness RCTs found no significant advantage of RLAI over oral SGAs on time to relapse or hospitalization, implying that frequent clinical contact may mitigate adherence differences between formulations, thereby blunting any LAI benefit signal [^112GkmCb] [^113CHif8].

> I should double-check broader synthesis because single trials can mislead. A meta-analysis comparing LAIs with matched oral antipsychotics across multiple agents, including risperidone, found no significant differences in relapse, response, global discontinuation, or most tolerability outcomes, supporting overall non-inferiority rather than superiority of LAIs versus oral formulations in typical RCT conditions; this aligns with the observation that intensive trial monitoring tends to normalize adherence in both arms and obscure real-world advantages [^112CMbxi]. But wait, what about real-world cohorts and registries? A large Taiwanese study suggested worse utilization outcomes with RLAI versus FGA LAIs; hold on, I should not over-interpret this because selection bias is substantial — clinicians may preferentially channel sicker, nonadherent patients to RLAI, inflating observed events despite potential adherence benefits, so confounding by indication likely explains much of the paradoxical signal [^111DtFW2] [^112CMbxi]. Finally, Cochrane's risperidone depot review underscores that high-quality, outcome-complete head-to-head data are limited, reinforcing the need for cautious interpretation across heterogeneous evidence bases [^111dC77T].

> Now, safety and tolerability — let me verify equivalence versus oral therapy. A high-quality meta-analysis across same-molecule RCTs reported no significant differences between LAIs and orals for 96.6% of 119 adverse event outcomes, with similar discontinuation for adverse events, serious adverse events, and mortality; small differences included more akinesia and LDL change but lower prolactin change with LAIs, which is an interesting and somewhat counterintuitive but replicated signal in the pooled data [^111fJnGq]. I should confirm individual RLAI data: short-term risperidone LAI trials generally show modest weight changes and mild EPS rates, with low injection-site pain, consistent with the meta-analytic picture of broad tolerability equivalence to oral risperidone [^116kwQw2] [^116kwQw2].

> Mortality is a critical check — let me ensure no hidden safety penalty. A large RCT meta-analysis found no difference in all-cause or suicide mortality for LAIs versus placebo or versus oral antipsychotics; there was a trend toward lower mortality in short-duration studies, which could reflect early stabilization benefits, but this was not statistically significant and should be interpreted cautiously [^116XXR5D].

> Cost and resource utilization deserve attention because acquisition costs are higher. In a VA randomized trial of unstable schizophrenia, RLAI increased medication costs but did not reduce total healthcare costs or improve quality of life versus oral antipsychotics; hold on, I should be careful not to generalize across settings — these findings reflect monitoring-intensive care where adherence support may already be robust and may not capture potential cost offsets in less structured settings or in first-episode programs [^112jfc3T].

> I need to check guideline positions and dosing consensus to anchor practice. The 2023 WHO guidance recommends considering LAIs, including risperidone, as an alternative to oral antipsychotics for adults with psychotic disorders requiring long-term treatment, emphasizing shared decision-making and individualized balancing of effectiveness, side effects, and preferences, which fits the mixed but generally non-inferior evidence base [^113Qe4hb]. Let me verify dosing consensus: expert panels endorse 25–50 mg every 2 weeks for most patients, with high agreement around LAI dosing and the principle of confirming oral tolerability first, aligning with PK-based equivalencies from the switching literature [^113sr21u] [^115D1zku].

> Which patients benefit most? I should prioritize first-episode schizophrenia, where relapse prevention appears maximally impacted by LAI-mediated adherence — this is where the risk–benefit and outcomes advantage is most compelling and practical adherence gains are clinically consequential [^116YsS33]. For chronic, clinically stable patients, RLAI is a reasonable non-inferior maintenance alternative that can support preference for less frequent dosing and structured adherence without clear superiority over orals under close follow-up; for chronically unstable patients already in high-intensity care, RCTs have not demonstrated superiority on hospitalization outcomes, so expectations should be managed and decisions individualized around adherence history, prior response, and patient preference [^115D1zku] [^113CHif8]. Let me also consider treatment-resistant schizophrenia: a 6-month trial comparing 50 mg versus 100 mg RLAI showed equivalent improvements without dose-response separation, suggesting that beyond certain thresholds, higher dosing may not yield additional benefit, and clozapine remains the gold standard for TRS comparisons [^112b4HxL].

> Practical implementation matters — let me verify switching logistics and risks. Initiation typically requires a three-week oral risperidone overlap to bridge delayed release from microspheres, with steady-state achieved over several injections; direct switch protocols with overlap are feasible and widely used in practice [^116kwQw2]. Hold on, I should also check switching from FGA LAIs: randomized data indicate that switching from haloperidol or fluphenazine decanoate to RLAI can increase early discontinuation and weight gain, so I need to weigh metabolic trade-offs and discuss them upfront in shared decision-making [^114jMyNE]. I should not forget system barriers: reimbursement hurdles, clinic infrastructure for injections, and stigma can limit access; proactively addressing coverage, leveraging pharmacy-based administration where available, and normalizing LAIs early in the treatment conversation can mitigate these obstacles [^1117MVGd] [^114hNxb6].

> Pulling this together, I need to clearly define the clinical role. RLAI is a pharmacokinetically rational, guideline-endorsed maintenance option that is broadly non-inferior to oral antipsychotics in RCT settings and appears particularly advantageous for preventing relapse in first-episode schizophrenia where adherence fragility is highest; in chronic illness under close monitoring, it performs similarly to oral treatment on relapse and hospitalization, with a tolerability profile largely comparable to oral risperidone and no excess mortality signal, but with higher drug acquisition costs that may not be offset in intensively managed systems [^113Qe4hb] [^116YsS33] [^115D1zku] [^113CHif8] [^111fJnGq] [^116XXR5D] [^112jfc3T]. Therefore, I should recommend prioritizing RLAI in first-episode programs and for individuals with documented or anticipated nonadherence who value structured dosing and can access injection services, and I should individualize its use in chronic populations with transparent discussion of equivalent efficacy, metabolic trade-offs, logistics, and costs within a shared decision-making framework [^113Qe4hb] [^113sr21u] [^112GkmCb].

> Finally, I should flag evidence gaps and how they inform practice. There remains a need for pragmatic, real-world randomized studies with less intensive monitoring to quantify the adherence-mediated effectiveness advantage of RLAI over oral agents in chronic schizophrenia; current mixed findings likely reflect the adherence-equalizing effect of trial protocols, so external validity to usual care is limited and warrants cautious extrapolation in either direction [^115D1zku] [^112CMbxi].

Risperidone injectable is a long-acting antipsychotic for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, typically dosed **25–50 mg IM q2weeks** [^113sr21u] with **3 weeks of oral overlap** [^112GkmCb] [^116kwQw2] at initiation [^notfound]. It **improves adherence** [^1122Q47B] and **reduces relapse** [^116YsS33], and common adverse effects include EPS, weight gain, and prolactin elevation [^111fJnGq], warranting monitoring for metabolic and movement disorders [^112b2175]. Compared with oral risperidone, the LAI has similar efficacy [^112CMbxi] [^113CHif8] but better adherence [^1122Q47B]; versus first-generation LAIs, it has fewer EPS [^111DtFW2] [^111vK2Wc] but more metabolic effects [^114jMyNE]. Use is supported by WHO for long-term psychotic disorders, balancing effectiveness, side effects, and patient preference [^113Qe4hb].

---

## Pharmacological properties

- **Mechanism of action**: Dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonism, reducing psychotic symptoms [^112b2175].

- **Pharmacokinetics**: Microsphere formulation with delayed release [^111vK2Wc]; peak levels at ~4 weeks, steady state by ~3 months [^116hHF8C].

- **Half-life**: ~3–6 days after release, enabling biweekly dosing [^116hHF8C] [^112b2175].

---

## Clinical indications

Indications include **maintenance therapy for schizophrenia** and schizoaffective disorder [^113Qe4hb] to improve adherence and reduce relapse; in select cases, it is used off-label [^114Wnvxj] for maintenance in bipolar disorder [^114gG2mX].

---

## Dosage and administration

- **Initial dose**: 25 mg IM every 2 weeks; adjust to 37.5 or 50 mg based on response [^112b2175] [^113sr21u].

- **Oral overlap**: Continue oral risperidone for 3 weeks after first injection [^112GkmCb] [^116kwQw2].

- **Injection site**: Gluteal muscle [^111vK2Wc]; rotate sites to minimize reactions [^112b2175].

---

## Clinical efficacy

Clinical efficacy includes **significant improvements** in PANSS and CGI scores [^112b2175] [^116kwQw2]. In first-episode schizophrenia, relapse rates are lower than with oral risperidone [^116YsS33], and adherence is improved, with fewer hospitalizations compared with oral antipsychotics.

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Common adverse effects**: EPS, weight gain, prolactin elevation, sedation, injection-site reactions [^111fJnGq] [^112b2175].

- **Serious adverse effects**: Tardive dyskinesia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, metabolic syndrome.

- **Comparison to oral risperidone**: Similar overall safety; lower prolactin change but more akinesia and anxiety [^111fJnGq].

---

## Patient adherence and quality of life

Adherence is better than with oral antipsychotics, reducing **relapse and hospitalization** [^1122Q47B]. Quality of life also improves, with better **HRQoL and functioning** vs placebo [^114KF7CA].

---

## Comparative effectiveness

Compared with **oral risperidone**, efficacy is similar [^112CMbxi] [^115D1zku], but adherence is better [^112Y3hQW] and relapse is lower in first-episode patients [^116YsS33]. Compared with **first-generation LAIs**, there are fewer EPS [^111DtFW2] but more metabolic effects [^114jMyNE].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

WHO guidelines recommend considering **LAIs**, including risperidone, for long-term treatment of psychotic disorders while balancing effectiveness, side effects, and patient preference [^113Qe4hb]. Expert consensus supports **LAIs** for patients with adherence issues or frequent relapse [^115yvxZo] [^113Qe4hb].

---

## Practical considerations and barriers

Key practical barriers include **higher cost** than oral antipsychotics, which may limit access [^112jfc3T]; reduced patient acceptance due to **stigma and injection discomfort** [^1117MVGd]; and the need for **regular clinic visits** and trained staff [^114hNxb6].

Regarding the medical management for schizophrenia, specifically concerning long-acting injectable antipsychotics, the WHO 2023 guidelines recommend considering the offer of a long-acting injectable antipsychotic (such as fluphenazine, haloperidol, paliperidone, risperidone, or zuclopenthixol) as an alternative to oral antipsychotics in adult patients with psychotic disorders (including schizophrenia) who require long-term treatment. This recommendation should carefully balance effectiveness, side effects, and individual preferences.

### A comparison of the effectiveness of risperidone, haloperidol and flupentixol long-acting injections in patients with schizophrenia — a nationwide study [^111DtFW2]. Schizophrenia Research (2015). Low credibility.

Risperidone long-acting injection (RLAI), the first licensed long-acting second-generation antipsychotic (SGA), has not yet been studied in terms of its effectiveness compared with first-generation antipsychotic (FGA) LAIs.

- **Methods**: The differences in the effectiveness of RLAI and two other FGA LAIs, haloperidol and flupentixol, were assessed by conducting a one-year pre-post study based on the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database. Effectiveness was defined as reduced medical care utilization and relapse prevention.

- **Results**: A decreased number of relapses were identified in the haloperidol injection group in the post-LAI period compared to the pre-LAI period (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.05). The RLAI group had the largest number of acute admissions and relapses, the longest duration of admission (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.005), and the lowest utilization of anticholinergic agents, such as benzodiazepine (BZD) and SGAs (except oral risperidone), among all LAI groups in the post-LAI period.

- **Conclusions**: According to the results of this observational study, we suggest that the effectiveness of RLAI is not superior to that of FGA (haloperidol or flupentixol) LAIs, but RLAI might have fewer adverse effects.

### Safety and tolerability of long-acting injectable versus oral antipsychotics: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies comparing the same antipsychotics [^111fJnGq]. Schizophrenia Research (2016). High credibility.

We aimed to assess whether long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs), initiated in a loading strategy or overlapping with oral antipsychotics (OAPs) and which cannot be stopped immediately, are associated with greater safety or tolerability issues than OAPs.

Method: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LAIs and OAPs, including only LAI-OAP pairs of the same OAP, allowing oral risperidone and paliperidone as comparators for either risperidone or paliperidone LAI. Primary outcome was treatment discontinuation due to adverse events. Secondary outcomes included serious adverse events, death, one or more adverse event, and individual adverse event rates.

Results: Across 16 RCTs (n = 4902, mean age = 36.4 years, males = 65.8%, schizophrenia = 99.1%) reporting on 119 adverse event outcomes, 55 (46.2%) adverse events were reported by two or more studies allowing a formal meta-analysis. Out of all 119 reported adverse events, LAIs and OAPs did not differ significantly regarding 115 (96.6%). LAIs were similar to OAPs regarding the frequency of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events, serious adverse events, all-cause death, and death for reasons excluding accident or suicide. Compared to OAPs, LAIs were associated with significantly more akinesia, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol change, and anxiety. Conversely, LAIs were associated with significantly lower prolactin change.

Conclusion: LAIs and OAPs did not differ on all serious and more than 90% of individual adverse events. However, more studies focusing on adverse event frequencies are needed.

### Safety and efficacy of long-acting risperidone in schizophrenia: A 12-week, multicenter, open-label study in stable patients switched from typical and atypical oral antipsychotics [^116kwQw2]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The safety and efficacy of the first long-acting injectable atypical antipsychotic, risperidone, were assessed in stable patients with schizophrenia switched from oral antipsychotic medications.

- **Method**: Data were collected between July 1, 2001, and October 25, 2002. The study population included patients from clinics, hospitals, and physicians' offices. After a 4-week run-in period, symptomatically stable patients with schizophrenia (DSM-IV) who had been taking haloperidol (N = 46), quetiapine (N = 45), or olanzapine (N = 50) received 25 mg of long-acting risperidone. The oral antipsychotics were continued for 3 weeks after the first injection of long-acting risperidone. Injections were administered every 2 weeks at 25 mg up to a maximum dose of 50 mg for 12 weeks in this multicenter, open-label study.

- **Results**: Long-acting risperidone was well tolerated. Of the 141 patients who participated in the study, the most frequently reported adverse events were insomnia (16%), headache (15%), psychosis (11%), and agitation (11%). The mean increase in body weight was 0.4 kg. No other clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities or significant electrocardiogram changes were observed during the 12-week treatment. Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale total scores were reduced during treatment with long-acting risperidone. Improvements in symptoms of schizophrenia were observed with long-acting risperidone at week 4 and continued through the 12-week treatment with significant reductions in total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores at week 8 (-2.5, p < .01).

### Long-acting injectable risperidone: Efficacy and safety of the first long-acting atypical antipsychotic [^112b2175]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

The authors assessed the efficacy and safety of the first long-acting atypical antipsychotic, long-acting injectable risperidone, in patients with schizophrenia.

- **Method**: In a 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study, patients received intramuscular injections every 2 weeks of placebo or long-acting risperidone (25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg). The primary measure of efficacy was the change in total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.

- **Results**: Of the 554 patients who were enrolled, 400 entered the double-blind study, and 370 received at least one postbaseline assessment. Mean changes in score of -6.2, -8.5, and -7.4 on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale were seen at endpoint for the 25-, 50-, and 75-mg risperidone groups, respectively; all three change scores were significantly different from that seen with placebo (+2.6). Improvements in positive and negative symptoms were also significantly greater in patients receiving risperidone.

	- Long-acting risperidone was well tolerated. Adverse events related to extrapyramidal symptoms were spontaneously reported by 13% of patients receiving placebo and 10% of patients in the 25-mg risperidone group, with higher rates in the 50-mg and 75-mg groups. The severity of extrapyramidal symptoms was mild at baseline and throughout the trial in each treatment group. Mean weight changes were small in the 25-, 50-, and 75-mg risperidone groups (0.5 kg, 1.2 kg, and 1.9 kg, respectively). Injection site pain was rated as low by the patients, consistent with the investigators' pain ratings.

- **Conclusions**: Long-acting risperidone showed significant efficacy and was well tolerated.

### Cost and cost-effectiveness in a randomized trial of long-acting risperidone for schizophrenia [^112jfc3T]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

The effect of long-acting injectable (LAI) risperidone on health care costs was determined in a multisite clinical trial among Veterans Health Administration patients with unstable schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, established by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (N = 369). Participants were randomized between 2006 and 2009 to receive either long-acting risperidone or a physician's choice of oral antipsychotic. Health care utilization and cost were tracked in administrative data, and medication administered by the trial was recorded on case report forms. Medication cost was based on unit costs to the US Medicaid program. Economic outcomes were assessed with the Quality of Well-Being instrument.

Participants randomized to LAI risperidone (n = 187) incurred $14,916 per quarter in total health care costs, which was not significantly different from the $13,980 cost incurred by the control group (P = 0.732) (n = 182). The LAI group incurred $3,028 per quarter in medication cost, significantly more than the $1,913 incurred by the control group (P = 0.003). Hospitalization costs were $7,088 in the experimental group and $6,891 in the control group (P = 0.943); outpatient costs were $11,888 in the experimental group and $12,067 in the control group (P = 0.639). LAI risperidone did not result in better outcomes when evaluated by a measure of schizophrenia symptoms or an assessment of health-related quality of life and incurred more adverse events.

### Does formulation matter? A systematic review and meta-analysis of oral versus long-acting antipsychotic studies [^112CMbxi]. Schizophrenia Research (2017). Low credibility.

Recently, many authors have highlighted the potential advantages of a broader prescription of long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) based on various assumptions, including favorable pharmacokinetic features. In this systematic review, data from randomized controlled trials comparing LAIs versus the oral formulation of the same antipsychotic were meta-analyzed to ascertain whether the route of administration may be associated with a different efficacy and tolerability profile.

Of 21 included studies, 18 contributed to the meta-analysis, providing data for risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, zuclopenthixol, fluphenazine, and haloperidol. For all drugs, the number of dropouts for any reason (primary outcome) did not differ between the two formulations, except for a small effect in favor of LAI aripiprazole (2 comparisons; 986 patients; relative risk (RR) 0.78; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.64 to 0.95).

Similarly, no differences emerged in terms of dropouts for adverse events, extrapyramidal symptoms, prolactin increase (except for a small advantage for LAI risperidone), weight gain, non-response rate, relapse rate, and dropouts for inefficacy (except for a small advantage for oral olanzapine). Data on aripiprazole proved to be of high quality according to the GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation), indicating confidence that the effect estimate is close to the true effect. Data on risperidone were of moderate quality, while data on olanzapine, fluphenazine, zuclopenthixol, and haloperidol were of low quality.

### Strategies for improving compliance in treatment of schizophrenia by using a long-acting formulation of an antipsychotic: Clinical studies [^1122Q47B]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). High credibility.

Despite evidence showing the importance of continuous medication in preventing relapse in patients with schizophrenia and the harmful consequences that relapse can have, clinical efforts often focus on hospital-based treatment or treatment of acute exacerbations of schizophrenia rather than on ensuring appropriate and effective relapse prevention. Inadequate compliance with antipsychotic treatment further detracts from the goal of long-term management of schizophrenia. However, appropriate use of injectable, long-acting antipsychotic medications, especially atypical antipsychotics, has the potential to increase compliance and thus improve the long-term prognosis of patients with schizophrenia. A long-acting formulation of the atypical antipsychotic risperidone has undergone large-scale clinical testing, showing significant improvement in measures of disease severity while maintaining an acceptable side effect profile.

### Comparison of SGA oral medications and a long-acting injectable SGA: the PROACTIVE study [^115D1zku]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2015). High credibility.

Until relatively recently, long-acting injectable (LAI) formulations were only available for first-generation antipsychotics, and their utilization decreased as the use of oral second-generation antipsychotics (SGA) increased. Although registry-based naturalistic studies show LAIs reduce rehospitalization more than oral medications in clinical practice, this is not seen in recent randomized clinical trials. The PROACTIVE (Preventing Relapse Oral Antipsychotics Compared to Injectables Evaluating Efficacy) relapse prevention study incorporated efficacy and effectiveness features.

At eight U.S. academic centers, 305 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were randomly assigned to LAI risperidone (LAI-R) or physician's choice oral SGAs. Patients were evaluated during the 30-month study by masked, centralized assessors using two-way video and were monitored biweekly by on-site clinicians and assessors who knew the treatment assignment. Relapse was evaluated by a masked Relapse Monitoring Board.

Differences between LAI-R and oral SGA treatment in time to first relapse and hospitalization were not significant. Psychotic symptoms and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total score improved more in the LAI-R group. In contrast, the LAI group had higher Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms Alogia scale scores. There were no other between-group differences in symptoms or functional improvement. Despite the advantage for psychotic symptoms, LAI-R did not confer an advantage over oral SGAs for relapse or rehospitalization. Biweekly monitoring, not focusing specifically on patients with demonstrated risk factors, may account for the lack of significant differences.

### Mortality risk associated with long-acting injectable antipsychotics: A systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials [^116XXR5D]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2016). High credibility.

Long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics (LAI-APs) have several advantages over oral medications, but deaths reported in Japan during the early post-marketing phase vigilance period have raised safety concerns. We conducted a series of meta-analyses to assess whether LAI-APs affect the mortality of patients with schizophrenia. Three categorical meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were performed to compare all-cause death (primary outcome) and death due to suicide: individual and pooled LAI-APs vs. placebo, individual and pooled LAI-APs vs. oral antipsychotics (OAPs), and head-to-head comparisons of LAI-APs.

The risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs were calculated. We identified 52 RCTs (53 comparisons; total participants = 17,416, LAI-APs = 11,360, OAP = 3,910, and placebo = 2,146; mean study duration [weeks]: LAI-APs vs. placebo = 28.9, LAI-APs vs. OAPs = 64.5). Neither pooled nor individual LAI-APs (aripiprazole, fluphenazine, olanzapine, paliperidone, and risperidone) differed from the placebo regarding the incidences of all-cause death (pooled LAI-APs: RR = 0.64, P = 0.37) and death due to suicide (pooled LAI-APs: RR = 0.98, P = 0.98).

However, in a subgroup meta-analysis of only short-duration RCTs (≤ 13 weeks), pooled LAI-APs exhibited a trend toward a lower incidence of all-cause death than placebo (RR = 0.29, P = 0.08). Pooled LAI-APs (aripiprazole, fluphenazine, haloperidol, olanzapine, paliperidone, risperidone, and zuclopenthixol) did not differ from pooled OAPs regarding all-cause death (pooled LAI-APs: RR = 0.71, P = 0.30) and death due to suicide (pooled LAI-APs: RR).

### Pharmacokinetics and tolerability of long-acting risperidone in schizophrenia [^116hHF8C]. Schizophrenia Research (2004). Low credibility.

The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of long-acting risperidone (Risperdal Consta) were evaluated in a multicenter, prospective, open-label, 15-week study of 86 patients with schizophrenia. Subjects stabilized on 2, 4, or 6 mg of oral risperidone once daily for at least 4 weeks were assigned to receive intramuscular injections of 25, 50, or 75 mg of risperidone, respectively, every 2 weeks for 10 weeks. The 90% confidence intervals for the intramuscular/oral ratios of the mean steady-state plasma-AUC, corrected for dosing interval, and the average plasma concentration of the active moiety (risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone) were within the range of 80–125%, indicating bioequivalence of the intramuscular and oral formulations. However, mean steady-state peak concentrations of the active moiety were 25–32% lower with intramuscular than oral dosing (P < 0.05), and fluctuations in plasma active-moiety levels were 32–42% lower with the intramuscular than oral regimen. Symptoms of schizophrenia continued to improve after switching from oral to intramuscular dosing. Long-acting risperidone was well tolerated both locally and systemically. Although overall bioequivalence of the two formulations was established, the differences in pharmacokinetic profiles between the two formulations indicate potential benefits for long-acting risperidone.

### Treatment of schizophrenia with long-acting fluphenazine, haloperidol, or risperidone [^112Y3hQW]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2007). Low credibility.

Long-acting antipsychotic medication injections are thought to help improve medication adherence in schizophrenia. Theoretical advantages of long-acting antipsychotic injections over oral medications include guaranteed delivery of medication, reliable monitoring of treatment adherence, and an increased opportunity for the treatment team to intervene as soon as a patient misses a dose. Clinical research and expert opinion support the use of long-acting injection antipsychotic medications as maintenance treatment for patients with a history of medication nonadherence.

Approximately 15% of schizophrenia patients in maintenance antipsychotic treatment receive depot preparations. In one recent study, 29.9% of patients with schizophrenia and a recent history of antipsychotic nonadherence were currently being prescribed a long-acting injection antipsychotic medication. In the United States, psychiatrists tend to select long-acting injection medications for patients who have persistent psychotic symptoms and who frequently receive more than one antipsychotic medication. Use of depot antipsychotic medications may be increased among African Americans and patients with substance use problems.

Three antipsychotic medications are currently available in the United States as long-acting injections: fluphenazine decanoate (FD) or enanthate, haloperidol decanoate (HD), and long-acting injectable risperidone (LAR). These medications differ from one another in their pharmacokinetic and side-effect profiles.

### Second-generation antipsychotic long-acting injections in bipolar disorder: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Wnvxj]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

The meta-analysis included seven RCTs (n = 1192), of which three were open label and four were double blind. Six of the RCTs involved the use of risperidone LAI and one involved aripiprazole LAI.

- **Study categorization**: For the meta-analysis, studies were categorized into placebo-controlled (n = 4 RCTs) and active-controlled (n = 4 RCTs). Since the study by Vieta et al. contained three arms (risperidone LAI vs. placebo vs. oral olanzapine), it appeared in both categories. Risperidone LAI vs. placebo was categorized under placebo-controlled, while risperidone LAI vs. oral olanzapine was categorized under active-controlled.

- **Study-defined relapse rate (placebo-controlled studies only)**: Pooled data from four placebo-controlled studies favored SGA LAIs for study-defined relapse rate, as shown in Figure 2, with a statistically significant difference between the two groups.

- **Primary safety outcome**: All-cause discontinuation (placebo-controlled studies only) was significantly less in the SGA LAIs group compared to the placebo group, as shown in Figure 3.

- **Primary efficacy outcome (active-controlled studies only)**: Active-controlled studies evaluated various oral antipsychotics or TAU against risperidone LAI. There was no statistically significant difference between SGA LAIs and active control, as shown in Figure 4. However, there was significant heterogeneity, which reduced to 0% when the study by Vieta et al. was removed.

### Equivalent switching dose from oral risperidone to risperidone long-acting injection: a 48-week randomized, prospective, single-blind pharmacokinetic study [^112GkmCb]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

This study explored the equivalent switching dose from oral risperidone to risperidone long-acting injection, which had been under debate. Conducted among hospitalized patients, it included an adequate study period and optimal control of drug compliance to determine the equivalent switching dose.

- **Method**: Fifty symptomatic, stable hospitalized patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia were randomly assigned to receive either daily oral risperidone or risperidone long-acting injection every two weeks. Patients on an oral risperidone dose of 4 mg/day or less were given 25 mg of risperidone long-acting injection. Those taking an oral dose of more than 4 mg/day but of 6 mg/day or less received 37.5 mg of risperidone long-acting injection, and those on more than 6 mg/day were administered 50 mg. Clinical efficacy, side effects, metabolic safety, drug tolerance, and serum concentration of risperidone metabolites were assessed repeatedly. The study ran from March 2004 to May 2005.

- **Result**: Forty-five patients (90%) completed the study. No significant differences were observed in PANSS scores between the two groups. However, the risperidone long-acting injection group showed reduced UKU Side Effect Rating Scale total scores (p = .048), Simpson-Angus Scale scores (p = .028), prolactin levels (p = .046), and serum concentrations of risperidone metabolites (p = .028).

### Effectiveness of switching from long-acting injectable fluphenazine or haloperidol decanoate to long-acting injectable risperidone microspheres: an open-label, randomized controlled trial [^114jMyNE]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). High credibility.

This multisite randomized trial addressed the risks and benefits of staying on long-acting injectable haloperidol or fluphenazine versus switching to long-acting injectable risperidone microspheres.

From December 2004 through March 2008, adult outpatients with a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders-Patient Edition diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who were taking haloperidol decanoate (n = 40) or fluphenazine decanoate (n = 22) were randomly assigned to stay on their long-acting injectable medication or switch to risperidone microspheres. They were followed for 6 months under the study protocol and an additional 6 months of naturalistic follow-up. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to examine the primary outcome, which was the time to treatment discontinuation. Random regression models were used to examine secondary outcomes.

Groups did not differ significantly in time to treatment discontinuation through 6 months of protocol-driven treatment. However, when the 6-month naturalistic follow-up period was included, time to treatment discontinuation was significantly shorter for individuals assigned to switch than for individuals assigned to stay (10% of stayers discontinued versus 31% of switchers; p = 0.01). Groups did not differ with respect to psychopathology, hospitalizations, sexual side effects, new-onset tardive dyskinesia, or new-onset extrapyramidal symptoms. However, those randomized to switch to long-acting injectable risperidone microspheres had greater increases in body mass.

### Long-acting injectable risperidone for relapse prevention and control of breakthrough symptoms following a recent first episode of schizophrenia. A randomized clinical trial [^116YsS33]. JAMA Psychiatry (2015). High credibility.

Long-acting, injectable, second-generation antipsychotic medication has tremendous potential to bring clinical stability to persons with schizophrenia; however, long-acting medications are rarely used following a first episode of schizophrenia. This study's objective was to compare the clinical efficacy of the long-acting injectable formulation of risperidone with the oral formulation in the early course of schizophrenia.

This was a randomized clinical trial performed at a university-based research clinic between 2005 and 2012, involving eighty-six patients with recent onset of schizophrenia. Participants were randomized to receive either long-acting injectable risperidone or oral risperidone. Within each group, participants were further simultaneously randomized to receive either cognitive remediation to improve cognitive functioning or healthy-behaviors training to enhance lifestyle habits and well-being. An intent-to-treat analysis was conducted from October 4, 2012, to November 12, 2014.

- **Interventions**: A 12-month trial assessed the effects of long-acting injectable vs oral risperidone, and cognitive remediation vs healthy-behaviors training.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary focus was on psychotic relapse and control of breakthrough psychotic symptoms.

- **Results**: Of the 86 patients randomized, 3 refused treatment in the long-acting injectable risperidone group. The psychotic exacerbation and/or relapse rate was significantly lower for the long-acting risperidone group compared to the oral group (5% vs 33%; χ² = 11.1; P < .001; relative risk reduction of 84.7%). Long-acting injectable risperidone better controlled mean levels of hallucinations.

### Second international consensus study of antipsychotic dosing (ICSAD-2) [^113sr21u]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). High credibility.

Since the introduction of chlorpromazine and haloperidol seven decades ago, the number of drugs for psychosis has steadily increased. New drug entities and formulations have resulted in dozens of treatment options for schizophrenia and other major psychiatric disorders. Competent use of drugs for psychosis requires clinical experience and knowledge of sound dosing practices. Such practices routinely include dose increases to achieve symptomatic and functional improvement, gradual dose reduction to find tolerable and effective maintenance doses, and switching among agents and formulations. This occurs in 15%–20% of patients treated with drugs for psychosis each year.

Remarkably, however, consensus remains elusive on how to dose individual drugs for psychosis, including changing from one to an approximately equivalent dose of another, especially with newer agents. Establishing clinically equivalent dose estimates and dosing recommendations contributes to optimizing the use of drugs for psychosis in clinical practice, informing practice guideline development, and designing and interpreting clinical research.

- **Methods of estimating dosing equivalencies**: Estimating dosing equivalencies and establishing dosing recommendations have limitations and can yield values that vary substantially. Equivalent doses for many older drugs for psychosis, such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol, were supported by dose–effect relationships based on laboratory pharmacodynamic data, such as in vitro affinity at cerebral dopamine receptors. This preclinical approach does not account for important interindividual differences.

### Long-acting injectable antipsychotics: Where do they fit in the treatment plan [^115yvxZo]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics have the potential to improve adherence and outcomes for patients with serious mental illness but are underused. Understanding the suitability of LAIs involves identifying patients who may benefit from their use. It is essential to monitor treatment adherence and ensure the safe and effective use of LAIs in patients with schizophrenia and related disorders.

### Long-acting risperidone and oral antipsychotics in unstable schizophrenia [^113CHif8]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Long-acting injectable risperidone, a second-generation antipsychotic agent, may improve adherence to treatment and outcomes in schizophrenia, but it has not been tested in a long-term randomized trial involving patients with unstable disease.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned patients in the Veterans Affairs (VA) system who had schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and who had been hospitalized within the previous 2 years or were at imminent risk for hospitalization to receive 25 to 50 mg of long-acting injectable risperidone every two weeks or a psychiatrist's choice of an oral antipsychotic. All patients were followed for up to 2 years. The primary endpoint was hospitalization in a VA or non-VA psychiatric hospital. Symptoms, quality of life, and functioning were assessed in blinded videoconference interviews.

- **Results**: Of 369 participants, 40% were hospitalized at randomization, 55% were hospitalized within the previous 2 years, and 5% were at risk for hospitalization. The rate of hospitalization after randomization was not significantly lower among patients who received long-acting injectable risperidone than among those who received oral antipsychotics (39% after 10.8 months vs. 45% after 11.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.63 to 1.20). Psychiatric symptoms, quality of life, scores on the Personal and Social Performance scale of global functioning, and neurologic side effects were not significantly improved with long-acting injectable risperidone as compared to control treatments.

### Comparison of the effects of different routes of antipsychotic administration on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics [^111vK2Wc]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Clinicians face a dilemma when choosing between short-acting atypical antipsychotics and long-acting conventional antipsychotics. Atypical antipsychotics offer better safety and efficacy, while depot formulations of conventional antipsychotics provide more reliable drug delivery, reduced differences in peak and trough plasma levels, and greater dosing precision. Risperidone was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as the first atypical long-acting antipsychotic medication, given as biweekly gluteal injections. This long-acting formulation is synthesized using a microsphere encapsulation process; the gradual hydrolysis of the copolymer encapsulating the drug provides a steady release of medication. Consistent with other long-acting medications, plasma drug level fluctuation is reduced more with long-acting than with oral risperidone. Analyses are currently underway to further examine safety outcomes with long-acting risperidone.

### Long-acting injectables: A strategy to mitigate nonadherence in bipolar disorder [^1117MVGd]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). High credibility.

Whether a patient will be receptive towards receiving a long-acting injectable (LAI) depends on how the option is communicated, and LAIs should not be considered as a punitive treatment. If considering an antipsychotic medication for bipolar disorder, LAIs should be offered during the initial treatment discussion to normalize their use in the early management of bipolar disorder. Discussing LAIs early in the disease course can reduce stigma and the perception that they should only be used as a "last resort".

As part of shared decision-making, the initial conversation should discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of LAIs and the patient's treatment goals. Additionally, providers should take the time to review the expanding list of available LAI formulations.

Identifying what an individual values most in a medication, ranging from the tolerability profile to dosing frequency, can enhance the collaborative nature of treatment, strengthen the therapeutic alliance, and optimize care. If an LAI antipsychotic is selected, the various aspects of care should be adequately discussed.

- **Practical limitations and obstacles**: Reimbursement barriers and the impact of telehealth from COVID‐19 are significant considerations. Since several LAIs are new, insurers may be reluctant to authorize coverage. If an individual is uninsured, identifying applicable patient-assistance programs will be needed. Additionally, with the rise of telehealth, healthcare providers are often seeing their patients virtually, making administering an LAI logistically challenging. Being aware of community resources is crucial.

### Health-related quality of life in patients with schizophrenia during treatment with long-acting, injectable risperidone [^114KF7CA]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The study investigates the impact of treatment with long-acting, injectable risperidone versus placebo on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with schizophrenia. Results are discussed in the context of HRQoL in the general U.S. population.

- **Method**: Patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia entered a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. After screening, previous antipsychotics were discontinued, and oral risperidone was titrated up to a dose of 4 mg/day over 1 week. Patients were then randomly assigned to receive placebo (N = 92) or long-acting risperidone (25 mg [N = 93], 50 mg [N = 97], or 75 mg [N = 87] every 2 weeks) for 12 weeks. HRQoL was measured using the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36-item questionnaire (SF-36).

- **Results**: At week 12, patients receiving long-acting risperidone had improved significantly (p < .05) in five domains of the SF-36 (bodily pain, general health, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health) compared with patients receiving placebo. The effect was greatest for the 25-mg group, with significant improvement versus placebo in six domains (p < .05). At baseline, all SF-36 domain scores except bodily pain were significantly lower (p < .05) than normal values in all groups. With placebo, scores in all eight domains remained below normal values after 12 weeks, while patients receiving long-acting risperidone showed improvement in HRQoL toward normal levels, with clinically meaningful improvements in all mental-health domains. In the 25-mg group, scores in seven domains were not statistically different from normal values after 12 weeks.

### Comparative effectiveness of long-acting injectable risperidone vs. long-acting injectable first-generation antipsychotics in bipolar disorder [^114gG2mX]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare the treatment effectiveness between long-acting injectable risperidone and long-acting injectable first-generation antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder.

- **Method**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients with bipolar disorder aged 15 years or higher, who were newly administered long-acting injectable antipsychotics between June 1, 2004, and December 31, 2011, were included. The clinical outcome indexes were hospitalization for any mood, manic/mixed, or depressive episodes. In addition, the all-cause discontinuation of long-acting injectable antipsychotic treatment was also assessed.

- **Results**: A total of 3,916 patients with bipolar disorder were extracted. Compared with risperidone, the use of first-generation antipsychotics was associated with a higher rate of hospitalization for any mood episode and major depressive episode. However, there was no statistically significant difference in treatment discontinuation rate between risperidone and first-generation antipsychotics.

- **Limitations**: Information for the severity of mood symptoms, social support, lifestyle, neurological, and metabolic adverse effects was not available in this database. In addition, we only measured severe mood episodes with hospitalization as our outcome index. It may not be possible to generalize our findings to mild mood episodes.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings suggested that patients treated with long-acting injectable risperidone might be superior to first-generation antipsychotics.

### Early use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in bipolar disorder type I: An expert consensus [^114hNxb6]. Bipolar disorders (2025). Low credibility.

The requirement for additional resources and infrastructure for LAI use, compared to oral medications, can be a key accessibility barrier. Traditionally, healthcare facilities such as clinics and hospitals, with staff experienced in caring for patients with psychiatric disorders, have been required to administer LAIs. Such facilities should exist within manageable distances of the patient and be open at convenient times. Adequate staffing levels are also critical. In regions where these needs are not being met, especially in lower-resourced settings, the likelihood of non-attendance is increased. While home visits to administer injections may represent an alternative approach, these can also be limited by low staffing levels or other barriers. Pharmacists have increasingly been employed to deliver LAIs, representing an important advancement in access because pharmacies are among the most ubiquitous and accessible healthcare settings.

The post-COVID-19 healthcare landscape may also be a barrier to clinicians adopting new treatment strategies. The administration of LAIs was suspended in some areas during the COVID-19 pandemic because it was considered an "elective" procedure. The suspension prompted the American Psychiatric Association to issue specific COVID-19 pandemic guidance on the administration of LAIs, encouraging clinics, hospitals, and other medical facilities to include the ongoing use of LAIs for patients with high-risk chronic illness as a necessary procedure, noting that treatment withdrawal.

### Risperidone dose for schizophrenia [^115hrA5n]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Risperidone is a widely used antipsychotic drug for people with schizophrenia. It is important to balance gaining the most positive effects with the least negative outcomes. The optimal dose of risperidone is the focus of this review.

- **Objectives**: To determine risperidone dose-response relationships for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Groups Trials Register (July 2008) for all relevant references.

- **Selection criteria**: All relevant randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs).

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved disagreements through discussion with a third member of the team. When insufficient data were provided, we contacted the study authors. For homogeneous dichotomous data, we calculated fixed-effect relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (MD).

- **Main results**: A consistent finding when risperidone ultra-low doses were administered was that more people left early due to insufficient response.

### Second-generation antipsychotic long-acting injections in bipolar disorder: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1173rAPu]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Data sources, search strategy, and study selection: The search strategy aimed to comprehensively cover studies assessing second-generation antipsychotic long-acting injections (SGA LAIs) in bipolar disorder. Data were independently extracted, analyzed, verified, and quality-assessed. Searches were conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and LILACS. The studies focused on publications from January 2000 to October 2016, following the market introduction of SGA LAIs post-2000, with no language restrictions. Relevant studies found in the identified studies were manually searched by reviewing references. Manufacturers of SGA LAIs were contacted to identify ongoing or unpublished studies. The initial search in April 2016 and rerun in October 2016 resulted in 30 additional studies.

The search strategy included the following domains:

- **Disease**: bipolar*, mood disorder*, mania*, manic-depression*, hypomania*
- **Treatment**: antipsychotic*, neuroleptic*, psychotropic*, atypical*, second generation antipsychotic*, SGA*, aripiprazole, olanzapine, paliperidone, risperidone
- **Formulation**: depot*, long-acting inject*, LAI*, prolonged release inject*, sustained release inject*

The identification, screening, and inclusion/exclusion of studies are illustrated in the PRISMA flow diagram (see Figure 1).

2.3 Screening, data extraction, and analysis: ARP screened titles of all retrieved studies, excluding only those that were clearly non-relevant during the title screening phase.

### Open trial of injectable risperidone for methamphetamine dependence [^111GBUM8]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

We tested the acceptability and tolerability of long-acting injectable risperidone for methamphetamine (MA) dependence in an open trial, with the hypothesis that participants would reduce MA use. Participants were also evaluated for changes in neurocognitive function and psychiatric symptomatology.

Participants with MA dependence (n = 34) entered a 7-day open-label run-in with oral risperidone. Those who tolerated oral risperidone (n = 22) began treatment with long-acting injectable risperidone 25 mg intramuscular medication, with subsequent injections every 2 weeks for a total of 4 injections. Participants remained on oral risperidone during the first 3 weeks after the initial injection. They were offered 8 weekly individual sessions of relapse prevention counseling.

At baseline, participants reported using MA an average of 4.1 days per week (SD = 1.9). The estimated mean days of MA use per week while on injections was 1.0 (95% confidence interval = 0.6–1.4), with days of use decreasing significantly from baseline through week 8 (β = -0.27; 95% confidence interval: -0.38 to -0.16; P < 0.001). Mean week 6 risperidone + 9-OH risperidone plasma levels for participants abstinent from MA from weeks 5 to 8 (n = 7, 63.6%) were 18.8 ng/mL (SD = 6.6), compared with 12.3 ng/mL (SD = 4.0) for those not abstinent (n = 4; P = 0.075). No serious adverse events occurred.

Verbal memory improved at week 4 compared with baseline (P < 0.05). Participation in this trial of injectable risperidone was associated with reductions in MA use as well as some positive benefits on verbal memory. However, these results are

### Early use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in bipolar disorder type I: An expert consensus [^1159ZSb3]. Bipolar disorders (2025). Low credibility.

**Accessibility challenges — availability/reimbursement**: Guidelines are important for HCP awareness regarding the suitability of a treatment and for making informed treatment decisions. Although some guidelines, such as the International College of Neuropsychopharmacology guidelines, do consider the use of LAIs for BP‐I, they do not yet have a major role in other international guidelines for BP‐I, including the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments guidelines, the British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines, the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry guidelines, and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists guidelines. It is important to note that international guidelines may be made obsolete early on if the latest findings are available soon after publication. Communication between HCPs and governments is crucial to highlight the benefits of LAIs for BP‐I in the public and private health sectors. If a medication is licensed and recommended by experts worldwide, it may be more likely to be accepted into reimbursement schemes and provide the confidence needed for HCPs to prescribe.

### Long-acting injectable antipsychotics: An underutilized treatment option [^113d8ohM]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

In this issue, Kane and colleagues report on the efficacy of aripiprazole long-acting injection (LAI) in the treatment of an acute episode of schizophrenia. At 10 weeks of treatment, both psychopathology and functioning improved in patients treated with aripiprazole compared to placebo, with an acceptable tolerability and safety profile. The outcomes suggest that aripiprazole long-acting is a viable treatment option for patients experiencing an acute episode of schizophrenia.

### A PET study evaluating dopamine D2 receptor occupancy for long-acting injectable risperidone [^1172Ls4G]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Long-acting injectable risperidone represents the first clinically available depot atypical antipsychotic. This study utilized positron emission tomography (PET) to evaluate its dopamine D2 binding profile at doses of 25, 50, or 75 mg administered every two weeks.

After achieving stabilization with one of these doses, nine patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder underwent [(11)C]raclopride PET scans to measure D2 occupancy. Participants were scanned twice during the two-week injection interval: within three days after injection (post-injection) and within five days before the next injection (pre-injection). Plasma samples were collected simultaneously to measure levels of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone.

- **Results**: Mean post- and pre-injection D2 occupancy levels for the 25, 50, and 75 mg doses were 71.0% and 54.0%, 74.4% and 65.4%, and 81.5% and 75.0% respectively. There was a significant correlation between the dose and plasma concentrations of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone. The estimated plasma concentration associated with 50% D2 occupancy (ED50) was 11.06 ng/ml. Prolactin levels were not correlated with drug levels or D2 occupancy.

- **Conclusions**: All three doses of injectable risperidone showed peak D2 occupancy levels above the 65% threshold associated with optimal clinical response. The 75 mg dose approximated the 80% threshold linked to an increased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. Doses of 25 or 50 mg should provide therapeutic efficacy while minimizing the risk of these symptoms.

### Second international consensus study of antipsychotic dosing (ICSAD-2) [^112eVvKj]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

Clinical practice is increasingly moving towards the use of newer long-acting injectable (LAI) formulations of second-generation drugs for psychosis. This trend is supported by findings of reduced risk for hospitalization and death. The present survey expands the number of such newer formulations reviewed from one to eight. Dosing of risperidone microspheres remained stable between the two surveys, and the level of dosing consensus was highest overall for LAIs in ICSAD-2.

There was also general agreement on the need to confirm drug tolerability prior to initiating treatment with an LAI agent. Only 15% of participants indicated establishing tolerability "sometimes", "rarely", or "never" before administering an LAI drug. This suggests that special circumstances may sometimes justify bypassing tolerability testing and can be explored in future research.

### Remission in schizophrenia: Results from a 1-year study of long-acting risperidone injection [^111sbbj7]. Schizophrenia Research (2005). Low credibility.

Although treatment advances have improved outcomes in schizophrenia, definitions of remission and recovery are still evolving. Recently proposed criteria for remission (mild or less on multiple core-symptom ratings for at least 6 months) have been applied to a 1-year study of long-acting risperidone injection.

- **Methods**: In a 50-week, open-label trial, stable patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who received long-acting risperidone injection every 2 weeks were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Remission criteria for the PANSS were applied; global illness severity (Clinical Global Impressions) and patient-rated health status (36-Item Short-form Health Survey) were measured.

- **Results**: Groups were identified by initial remission status (excluding the time component). Although considered clinically "stable", 68.2% (394/578) did not meet the symptom-severity component of remission criteria at baseline. Following long-acting, injectable risperidone treatment, 20.8% (82) of non-remitted patients achieved symptom remission for at least 6 months, with significant decreases in mean PANSS total and cluster scores (P < 0.0001) and significantly improved patient-rated health status (P < 0.0001). The percentage of patients rated as not ill, very mild, or mild increased from 39% to 88%. Among 31.8% (184/578) of patients meeting the symptom-severity component of remission criteria at baseline, 84.8% (156) maintained these criteria at endpoint.

- **Conclusions**: Among previously "stable", non-remitted patients, many achieved symptom remission after long-acting risperidone treatment.

### Can authorities appreciably enhance the prescribing of oral generic risperidone to conserve resources? Findings from across Europe and their implications [^117R5wBL]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Retrospective observational studies were undertaken on the utilization of long-acting risperidone injections versus total risperidone (N05AX08), which was available throughout the study period, as well as paliperidone (N05AX13) before and after the availability of generic oral risperidone.

The European countries chosen provide a range of differences in geographical location, population size, approaches to the financing of healthcare, and strategies for pricing generics and enhancing the utilization of generics versus originators, which aligns with recommended guidance.

Only administrative databases were used in each country to assess the utilization and expenditure patterns of atypical antipsychotic drugs because the perspective of the study was that of health authorities. These authorities typically have the greatest knowledge concerning existing and planned initiatives and reforms in their countries. The databases, which are regularly audited, are included in Box 1. Box 1 also contains details of patients included within the national health service of each country, typically encompassing 100% or close to 100% of the population unless stated otherwise (e.g. in Ireland), given the principles of equity and solidarity within European healthcare systems. There are also typically limited patient co-payments.

The utilization of different atypical antipsychotics was calculated in terms of defined daily dose (DDD), which is defined as 'the average maintenance dose of a drug when used in its major indication in adults'.

### Effectiveness of a psychosocial intervention for relapse prevention in patients with schizophrenia receiving risperidone via long-acting injection [^111m8Km2]. Psychiatry Research (2010). Low credibility.

Schizophrenia is a chronic disorder characterized by relapses alternating with periods of full or partial remission. We examined whether combined therapy with a psychosocial intervention for relapse prevention (PIRP) and risperidone administered by long-acting injection (RLAI) would be more effective in reducing relapses than RLAI with treatment-as-usual (TAU) among outpatients with schizophrenia. We conducted a prospective, controlled study over 2 years in 46 patients with schizophrenia receiving RLAI, with 21 patients in the PIRP group and 25 in the TAU control group. The 1- and 2-year relapse rates were lower, and medication compliance was higher, in the PIRP group than in the TAU group. Cox proportional analysis revealed that time from baseline to relapse was associated with RLAI discontinuation. These results indicate that PIRP can be effective in maintaining medication compliance, and that discontinuation of long-acting atypical antipsychotics might predict the next relapse. However, these results need to be replicated in studies with larger samples.

### Second international consensus study of antipsychotic dosing (ICSAD-2) [^116MpUA4]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

ICSAD-2 builds on the methods and results of the original consensus study, ICSAD-1. The study includes 26 drugs for psychosis: 15 orally administered agents, 7 long-acting injectables (LAIs), and 4 short-acting injectables (SAIs). A total of 18 drugs were included in both ICSAD-1 and ICSAD-2:

- **Oral agents**: Aripiprazole, haloperidol, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, and ziprasidone.
- **Short-acting injectables (SAIs)**: Haloperidol, triflupromazine, ziprasidone, and zuclopenthixol.
- **Long-acting injectables (LAI)**: Risperidone microspheres.

Drugs for psychosis were included if they received FDA regulatory approval in 2000 or later (as a proxy for global marketing) or if they failed to achieve dosing consensus in ICSAD-1. Some agents were included again in ICSAD-2 if a specific dosing discrepancy was identified, including:

1. The 95% effective dose (ED95) based on dose–response analyses reported was less than half of the ICSAD-1 maximum dose (e.g. oral quetiapine).
2. The World Health Organization (WHO) daily defined dose (DDD) was higher than the ICSAD-1 maximum dose (e.g. SAI triflupromazine HCl).
3. The DDD was lower than the ICSAD-1 initial dose (e.g. SAI zuclopenthixol acetate).

Oral risperidone, an agent with well-established and widespread international use, was included in ICSAD-2 as a control to assess the comparability of ICSAD-1 and ICSAD-2 survey processes and results. Reference agents for estimating clinically equivalent doses included olanzapine 20 mg/day for orally administered agents and LAIs, and injectable haloperidol 5 mg for S.

### Treatment of schizophrenia with long-acting fluphenazine, haloperidol, or risperidone [^114BjR1U]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with schizophrenia who initiate long-acting antipsychotic injections commonly exhibit evidence of nonadherence with oral antipsychotic medications in the months before their first injection. Patients starting fluphenazine decanoate (FD), haloperidol decanoate (HD), and long-acting risperidone (LAR) also commonly receive prescriptions for other classes of psychotropic medications. Treatment with long-acting antipsychotic medications is often brief, usually lasting no longer than 7–10 weeks.

Detailed clinical research is needed to determine the role of medication-related factors, such as dosing, tolerability, and efficacy, as well as other key clinical and psychosocial factors that contribute to the early discontinuation of depot antipsychotic medications. More importantly, research is needed to develop intervention strategies that will enhance the continuity of depot antipsychotic therapy in community treatment.

### Association between discontinuation due to withdrawal of consent and use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics: A meta-analysis of randomized trials for schizophrenia [^113iDbbk]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2021). Low credibility.

We investigated the association between discontinuation due to withdrawal of consent (DWC) in schizophrenia trials and the use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAI-APs). In two categorical meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, we compared DWC: individual and pooled LAI-APs vs. (1) placebo and (2) oral antipsychotics (OAPs). We also conducted a single-group meta-analysis to calculate the average DWC and a meta-regression analysis to examine the association between the results of the meta-analyses and factors related to study design, treatment, and patients.

We identified 52 studies (total adult patients = 18,675, LAI-APs = 12,613, placebo = 2,083, and OAPs = 3,979; median study duration = 32 weeks). DWC was higher for LAI-aripiprazole than for the placebo [risk ratio (95% confidence interval) = 1.70 (1.23–2.39)].

- **Pooled and individual LAI-APs comparison**: Neither pooled nor individual LAI-APs differed from the placebo for fluphenazine, olanzapine, paliperidone, and risperidone or from the OAPs for aripiprazole, fluphenazine, haloperidol, olanzapine, paliperidone, risperidone, and zuclopenthixol.

- **Average discontinuation due to withdrawal of consent (DWC)**: The average DWC of each LAI-AP was as follows: LAI-aripiprazole = 10.98%, LAI-fluphenazine = 7.65%, LAI-flupenthixol = 3.33%, LAI-haloperidol = 6.71%, LAI-olanzapine = 10.50%, LAI-paliperidone = 10.38%, LAI-perphenazine = 7.06%, LAI-risperidone = 10.39%, LAI-zuclopenthixol = 4.45%, pooled LAI-APs = 9.88%, and placebo = 11.17%.

- **Meta-regression analysis**: Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that publication year (β = 0.02), percentage of males (β = 0.02), and mean age (β = 0.05) were associated with an average DWC for pooled.

### Second international consensus study of antipsychotic dosing (ICSAD-2) [^1179NWAV]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

The average number of participants responding to the 13 agents previously included in ICSAD-1 increased significantly between the two surveys (31.2 (SD = 12.7) vs. 54.8 (SD = 17.3), p = 0.001). There were changes to the equivalent dose for one oral agent (paliperidone), the initial dose for one oral agent (haloperidol), dosing ranges for six oral agents (all but olanzapine and sertindole), and the maximum dose for five oral agents (haloperidol, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, and ziprasidone). Overall, dosing trended modestly lower in ICSAD-2. Average changes to the oral initial dose, dosing range, and maximum dose were −4%, −16% to +3%, and −6%, respectively.

Oral risperidone clinical equivalency and dosing recommendations were unchanged other than a small difference in dosing range (reduced from 4–6 mg/day to 3–6 mg/day) and maximum dose (reduced from 8.5 to 8.0 mg/day), indicating consistency between the two survey results. There were small changes to the dosing recommendations for three SAIs. For the fourth, triflupromazine HCl, there were several-fold reductions in equivalency and dosing recommendations between surveys. For all SAIs, the level of consensus remained very low, with an average CV of 78%.

There were no differences in clinical equivalency and dosing recommendations for risperidone microspheres between surveys. A complete set of updated clinical equivalencies and dosing recommendations for all drugs for psychosis included in ICSAD-1 and ICSAD-2 are provided.

### Risperidone (depot) for schizophrenia [^111dC77T]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Risperidone is the first new-generation antipsychotic drug made available in a long-acting injection formulation.

- **Objectives**: To examine the effects of depot risperidone for the treatment of schizophrenia or related psychoses in comparison with placebo, no treatment, or other antipsychotic medication. The objective also includes critically appraising and summarizing evidence on the resource use, cost, and cost-effectiveness of risperidone (depot) for schizophrenia.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register (December 2002, 2012, and October 28, 2015). We also checked the references of all included studies and contacted industry and authors of included studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised clinical trials comparing depot risperidone with other treatments for people with schizophrenia and/or schizophrenia-like psychoses.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality, and extracted data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD). We assessed the risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE.

- **Main results**: Twelve studies, with a total of 5723 participants, were randomised to the following comparison treatments: risperidone depot versus placebo. Outcomes of relapse and improvement in mental state were neither measured nor reported. In terms of other primary outcomes, more people receiving placebo left the study early by 12 weeks (1 RCT, n = 400, RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.63).

### Early use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in bipolar disorder type I: An expert consensus [^112K8R6f]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Currently, long-acting injectables (LAIs) are rarely prescribed for the treatment of people living with bipolar disorder type I (BP-I). According to the advisors, key characteristics of a patient typically offered an LAI include very severe symptoms, sub-optimal adherence to orally administered antipsychotics, and having experienced multiple relapses. Historically, LAI use was limited to the treatment of patients with schizophrenia, while for BP-I, LAIs were employed as a treatment of "last resort". This may be due to healthcare providers (HCPs) perceiving BP-I as a "milder" disorder in comparison to schizophrenia and having a preconceived (yet unsubstantiated) notion of a patient's preference for oral antipsychotics. These opinions may stem from an overall lack of awareness of the benefits of LAIs. LAIs have only recently begun to be indicated for the treatment of patients living with BP-I and have been slow to appear in major guidelines. In addition to the lack of awareness, the limited presence in guidelines presents further barriers to use, including issues with healthcare reimbursement.

However, there is mounting evidence to support LAI use in the treatment of patients living with BP-I, particularly in early disease. Worldwide studies demonstrate that treatment with LAIs, such as flupenthixol and risperidone, early in the disease course was well tolerated and resulted in better outcomes compared to oral medications (such as olanzapine and quetiapine), including relapse prevention. A recent review of evidence from six mirror-image studies of LAIs for the treatment of BP-I substantiates these findings. These studies indicate that early intervention with LAIs can lead to improved patient outcomes and may offer significant advantages in managing the disorder effectively.

### Second-generation antipsychotic long-acting injections in bipolar disorder: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^112CQr4t]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Further studies, particularly high-quality, active-controlled studies, are warranted for conclusive evidence. There are four SGA LAIs (aripiprazole LAI, olanzapine LAI, paliperidone LAI, and risperidone LAI) on the market, but only studies involving risperidone LAI and aripiprazole LAI were found. Further research on SGA LAIs, preferably comparing with active control and in a more pragmatic, real-world setting, will add a significant evidence base in this area. Data on aripiprazole LAI are limited due to there being only a single RCT and a lack of any active control studies. Further research comparing aripiprazole LAI with active control is warranted.

Research on paliperidone LAIs and olanzapine LAI also merits consideration. However, olanzapine LAI poses significant logistical issues due to the post-injection syndrome, thus requiring patients to be observed for three hours post-injection. This may be a significant barrier to prescribing and to any future research.

### Second-generation antipsychotic long-acting injections in bipolar disorder: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111QNb1e]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

- **Comparison to other studies**: Details of literature reviews of FGA and SGA LAIs in bipolar disorder are described by Prajapati et al 15, highlighting the differences between this study and previous reviews. Gigante et al 13 and Bond et al 22 reviewed evidence of FGAs and SGA LAIs in bipolar disorder and concluded that FGA LAI should not be a first choice due to the risk of induction of depression, but suggested risperidone LAI is effective in bipolar disorder. Samalin et al 14 carried out a review of SGA LAIs in bipolar disorder and concluded that risperidone LAI may be considered for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder, but more evidence is required. While these literature reviews provide a useful overview of the subject, they generally lack the scientific rigour of systematic reviews 15. Recently, Chou et al 24 authored an article titled "A Systemic Review and Experts' Consensus for Long‐acting Injectable Antipsychotics in Bipolar Disorder". This was an expert consensus; details on the review process and methodology were not reported. In addition, all aforementioned studies included only one SGA LAI, namely, risperidone LAI, and none included a meta-analysis.

As far as we are aware, this is the first meta-analysis focusing on SGA LAIs in bipolar disorder that included more than one SGA LAI. The only other meta-analysis on this topic was by Kishi et al 25, and there are significant differences between the two meta-analyses in terms of included studies, methodology, and some results. Our meta-analysis includes studies of risperidone LAI and aripiprazole LAI, whereas Kishi et al included different parameters.

### A cross-sectional study of plasma risperidone levels with risperidone long-acting injectable: Implications for dopamine D2 receptor occupancy during maintenance treatment in schizophrenia [^1173VFH6]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

While 65%-80% occupancy of dopamine D2 receptors with antipsychotics has been proposed to achieve optimal therapeutic response during the acute treatment of schizophrenia, it remains unclear whether it is also necessary to maintain D2 receptor occupancy within this "safe" window for ongoing maintenance treatment. The data are especially scarce for long-acting antipsychotic formulations.

Clinically stable patients with schizophrenia (DSM-IV) receiving a stable dose of risperidone long-acting injectable (LAI) as antipsychotic monotherapy for at least 3 months and free of any psychiatric hospitalization over the past 6 months were included. Dopamine D2 receptor occupancy levels at trough were estimated from plasma concentrations of risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone immediately before the intramuscular injection of risperidone LAI, using a 1-site binding model derived from our previous positron emission tomography data. This study was conducted from October to December 2011.

Thirty-six patients were included in this study (mean ± SD age, 49.3 ± 14.0 years; mean ± SD dose and interval of injections, 38.2 ± 11.6 mg and 16.5 ± 14.0 days, respectively). Mean ± SD D2 receptor occupancy was 62.1% ± 15.4%; 52.8% of the subjects (n = 19) did not demonstrate an occupancy of ≥ 65%. On the other hand, 13.9% (n = 5) showed a D2 occupancy as high as over 80% at the estimated trough.

More than half of patients taking risperidone LAI maintained clinical stability without achieving continuous blockade of dopamine D2 receptors ≥ 65% in real-world clinic settings.

### SPL drug information for risperidone [^113TgTw1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of risperidone PO (also known as Risperdal) in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 10 mL/min, the following guidelines should be observed:

- **Initial dosing**: Start at a dose of 0.5 mg. Do not exceed a frequency of BID (twice daily).
- **Titration**: Titrate slowly and monitor for QT prolongation.
- **Dosage increase**: May increase to dosages above 1.5 mg twice daily at intervals of at least one week at a slower rate.

### A six month randomized controlled trial of long acting injectable risperidone 50 and 100mg in treatment resistant schizophrenia [^112b4HxL]. Schizophrenia Research (2014). High credibility.

It has been suggested that atypical antipsychotic drugs (A-APDs), other than clozapine, may be effective in improving positive symptoms in some patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) if both the dose is higher and the duration of the trial longer than those ineffective in non-TRS (NTRS) patients. This hypothesis was tested with long-acting injectable risperidone (Risperdal Consta®, RLAI).

One hundred sixty TRS patients, selected for persistent moderate-severe delusions or hallucinations, or both, were randomized to receive RLAI, either 50mg or 100mg biweekly, in a six-month, outpatient, double-blind, multicenter trial. We hypothesized that RLAI, 100mg, would be more effective than RLAI, 50mg. However, both doses produced clinically significant and equivalent improvement in PANSS Total, Positive, and Negative subscale scores, as well as key cognitive, global, and functional measures, with increasing response during the course of the study. This confirms the value of longer clinical trial durations for patients with TRS, but not the superiority of the higher dose.

The overall response rate was comparable to that previously reported for clozapine and high-dose olanzapine, another A-APD, in TRS. Both doses of RLAI were equally well tolerated, causing minimal extrapyramidal side effects and few dropouts. Plasma levels of the active moiety, risperidone + 9-hydroxyrisperidone, during treatment with RLAI 100mg, were comparable to those for 6–8 mg/day oral risperidone, which have not been effective in TRS. Further study of RLAI, ≥ 50–100mg biweekly, should compare it with clozapine.

### Second-generation antipsychotic long-acting injections in bipolar disorder: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^112HQQB1]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**

- **Primary outcome measures**: Our systematic review and meta-analysis found that on primary outcome measures, that is, study-defined relapse rate and all-cause discontinuation, SGA LAIs performed better than placebo but not when compared with oral active control. It is worth noting that three of the four active-controlled studies are open label; two of them are pilot studies and the number of patients in active control studies is less than half that of placebo-controlled studies. However, the active-controlled study by Vieta et al. was of high quality (Jadad score = 5) with a larger sample size (n = 260), in which SGA LAI was less effective than oral olanzapine (RR 1.63, 95% CI = 1.12 to 2.37). The study by Vieta et al. contained three arms: risperidone LAI, placebo, and oral olanzapine, and used a double dummy design, that is, placebo LAI was given to patients assigned to the oral olanzapine group and placebo oral was given to patients assigned to the risperidone LAI and placebo LAI group.

- **Limitations of RCTs**: It is also argued that participants in the RCTs are more likely to adhere to their oral medication owing to the extra care and monitoring they receive during studies compared to real-world patients. This may have favored the active control group and can be a limitation of RCTs comparing SGA LAIs with oral active control. This limitation could be overcome by designing double-blind RCTs with a double dummy, that is, giving LAI placebo for the oral active control group and giving oral placebo for the SGA LAI group, as in the study by Vieta et al. Such a design would make the study scientifically robust.

### Can authorities appreciably enhance the prescribing of oral generic risperidone to conserve resources? Findings from across Europe and their implications [^112TpxB5]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

There was considerable variation in the utilisation of oral generic versus originator risperidone by the end of the study period in each of the four principal countries. Similarly, there was considerable variation between the four countries in the price reduction of oral generic risperidone (expenditure/DDD) versus pre-patent loss prices by the end of the study period.

- **Maximum utilisation**:
	- Utilisation of paliperidone (oral and injectable) as a percentage of total selected antipsychotic utilisation varied across the various European countries and regions.

- **General trends**:
	- In both Scotland and Sweden, the high utilisation of generic risperidone at low prices resulted in expenditure for atypical antipsychotic drugs increasing at a lower rate than utilisation. Utilisation of the selected atypical antipsychotic drugs in Scotland increased by 53% between 2005 and 2010, but expenditure increased by only 42%. In Sweden, utilisation increased by 20% after the introduction of oral generic risperidone until August 2011, with expenditure increasing by only 13%.

### Optimal dosing with risperidone: updated recommendations [^113iQuuw]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Drug dosages utilized during controlled clinical trials are not always optimal for patients encountered in day-to-day practice. The original trials of risperidone, a novel antipsychotic, suggested that an initial target dose of 6 mg/day was appropriate, but these trials were necessarily conducted among patients who were chronically impaired, hospitalized, and often partly drug-resistant.

- **Data sources**: Relevant data relating to the dosage of risperidone were identified through an online (MEDLINE) search using the keywords risperidone, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder dementia, bipolar disorder, and dose. These were supplemented by a review of international and U.S. Congress abstracts in which the dose of risperidone was specifically described.

- **Conclusion**: On the basis of naturalistic studies, clinical audits, phase 4 trials, positron emission tomography data, and 5 years of clinical experience, the currently recommended target dose of risperidone is 4 mg/day for most patients, with less-rapid titration than previously recommended. Moreover, a lower dose than this and slower titration may be appropriate for elderly patients, young patients, and first-episode patients.

### Should we be prescribing fluphenazine long-acting injectable formulation [^116mqqAL]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Fluphenazine is a phenothiazine high-potency typical antipsychotic theorized to primarily exert both its therapeutic effects and side effects through the alteration of D2 receptor activity within the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal pathways. This antipsychotic has a long history of use in the United States, being the third antipsychotic approved by the FDA. Its 1959 oral formulation approval was preceded by the approvals of oral perphenazine in 1957 and oral chlorpromazine in 1954. Nine years after the oral formulation of fluphenazine was approved, the long-acting injectable (LAI) "depot" formulation was approved — the first approval of an antipsychotic LAI by the FDA. Until the approval of depot formulation haloperidol in 1986, this was the only long-acting injectable available on the market. Until 2021, fluphenazine was the only long-acting injectable on the WHO essential medicine list. Early studies indicated that this long-acting formulation was at least as effective as oral antipsychotics for the management of schizophrenia, although contemporary articles recommended caution with dosing amounts and intervals to minimize side effects and to take individual patient history into account.

Although fluphenazine LAI has a long history of use for the treatment of schizophrenia, its usage has declined as other, ostensibly more benign or efficacious, depot formulations have entered the market. However, there have been very few studies specifically evaluating fluphenazine LAI head-to-head against newer options.

### Second international consensus study of antipsychotic dosing (ICSAD-2) [^112JVXRg]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

This comparison is important as the clinical use of drugs for psychosis does not always align with manufacturers' recommendations. These recommendations may not always reflect what will eventually be identified as optimal dosing for newer products. The history of drug dosing for psychosis is marked by notable changes in practice trends over time among all such drugs, as well as for specific agents. There is evidence of controversial "high-dose" regimens exceeding typical maximum dosing guidance of ⩾1000 mg chlorpromazine equivalents per day. The discovery that expert opinion is thus far aligned with product monograph dosing for newer drugs for psychosis may offer reassurance that a refined understanding of dosing is emerging. The high level of agreement also may reflect, to some extent, limited clinical experience with newer agents and the corresponding influence of manufacturers' recommendations on clinical practice.

### Should we be prescribing fluphenazine long-acting injectable formulation [^112MJnfA]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Low credibility.

As noted above, not all long-acting injectables have the same dosing interval — although clinically, the intervals are often adjusted to target refractory symptoms. The half-life of fluphenazine decanoate is roughly 1 week, and it is most frequently given as an injection every 2 weeks. There are reports that fluphenazine reaches peak serum levels rapidly, although the exact rate varies considerably in the literature.

One experimental paper from 1979 noted peak serum levels were reached between 1 and 8 hours after injection, with significant variation between patients. Another experimental paper from 1985 noted peak serum levels occurring generally in less than 24 hours, again with a very significant variation between patients. This phenomenon has been noted essentially since the approval of the long-acting injectable formulation.

The specific applications of this phenomenon vary between clinicians, with some reporting no need for oral overlap — especially in cases of likely patient non-adherence — while others recommend an oral overlap during the first two weeks after initiation. There have been no well-controlled studies of either technique, although a retrospective data analysis noted heterogeneity in clinician application of oral overlap. The biweekly dose of fluphenazine decanoate given is 1.25 times the daily oral dose.

A q4week depot version of fluphenazine exists, but the risks of this enanthate formulation included a high risk of depression, extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), and possibly hypotension and other serious cardiac side effects.

### Early use of long-acting injectable antipsychotics in bipolar disorder type I: An expert consensus [^112AMi1b]. Bipolar Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

This consensus discussed the benefits of long-acting injectables (LAIs) in the management of bipolar disorder type I (BP-I), particularly during early stages of the disease. It also identified barriers to overcome, while providing potential solutions to aid key stakeholders in making informed treatment decisions. The main consensus recommendations were as follows:

- **Consensus recommendation 1**: It is important to move away from the preconceived notion that LAIs can be used only for patients living with BP-I experiencing the most severe disease. Communication of potential early benefits is key to avoid perpetuating stigmatization of patients.

- **Consensus recommendation 2**: If antipsychotic therapy is included in the pharmacologic treatment plan, LAIs should be initiated as early as possible in the disease course, ideally at the first manic episode, to aid in improving long-term outcomes.

- **Consensus recommendation 3**: A collaborative focus on the direct involvement of all stakeholders in the decision-making process should support a more positive patient experience, better care quality, and improved health outcomes (e.g. reduced relapse and hospitalization, and reduced burden on healthcare systems).

- **Consensus recommendation 4**: With careful outcome tracking and a systematic approach to medication changes, logical and strategic combination pharmacotherapy can be designed to minimize unnecessary exposure to redundant, ineffective, or otherwise superfluous psychotropic agents.

- **Consensus recommendation 5**: The generation of additional evidence for the use of LAIs early in the disease course is important.

### Treatment of schizophrenia with long-acting fluphenazine, haloperidol, or risperidone [^114EKstD]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2007). Low credibility.

Fewer than 1 in 10 depot patients continued on long-acting injections for 180 days following the first injection. The mean duration of depot treatment episodes was significantly longer for HD patients than for FD patients. The period from the first to last injection of the treatment episode was also significantly longer for patients treated with HD than FD, while the mean depot MPR over the first 90 days was significantly greater for patients treated with HD than either FD or LAR. At the same time, patients treated with LAR, which has the shortest recommended dosing interval, received a significantly larger number of injections during their depot treatment episodes than patients treated with FD or HD.

- **Characteristics of schizophrenia patients during treatment with FD, HD, or LAR**: During depot treatment, a substantial proportion of the patients also received antidepressant medications, anxiolytics/hypnotics, and mood stabilizers as well as oral antipsychotic medications. The oral antipsychotic medication was frequently the oral formulation of the depot medication.

- **Oral antipsychotic medication treatment of patients with schizophrenia during the first 90 days after starting FD, HD, and LAR**: After controlling for several background characteristics, the overall median length of depot treatment or STR was significantly greater for LAR and HD than FD. In stratified analyses, the duration of LAR treatment episodes was significantly greater than FD episodes for males, patients 45–64 years old.

### Direct transition to long-acting risperidone — analysis of long-term efficacy [^115CH2so]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2005). Low credibility.

This report presents data from the extension phase of a 6-month trial that evaluated the efficacy of risperidone long-acting injectable (RLAI) in stable psychotic patients requiring a treatment change. Patients continued to receive RLAI every two weeks for a maximum of 12 months from study entry. Symptoms were assessed using the PANSS after 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment (or at the treatment endpoint). Remission severity criteria were defined as ≤ 3 points in all PANSS items suggested by the Remission in Schizophrenia Working Group. A total of 715 patients (63% male) entered the extension phase, and 508 completed the 12-month study.

The mean PANSS total score at Day 0 was 74.9 ± 22.7. This was significantly reduced after 1 month (67.7 ± 22.3, p ≤ 0.001), with continued improvements over the 12 months of the study until the treatment endpoint (59.7 ± 21.9). Significant improvements from Day 0 to endpoint were also seen in the scores for all PANSS subscales and symptom factors. The proportion of patients who met the PANSS severity criteria for remission increased from 29% at Day 0 to 60% at the endpoint, and the proportion of patients who met these criteria for ≤ 6 months increased from 24% at Month 6 to 45% at the endpoint. Treatment with RLAI for up to 12 months provided significant and sustained improvements in symptom control in patients with schizophrenia, which may help patients achieve and remain in remission.

### Clinical outcomes of long-acting injectable risperidone in patients with bipolar I disorder: A 1-year retrospective cohort study [^115FWqEm]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

We explored the effect of risperidone long-acting injection (LAI) treatment on patients with bipolar I disorder in a real-world setting.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective cohort study, 469 patients with bipolar I disorder were enrolled, treated with risperidone LAI and different oral antipsychotics, and followed for 1 year. Concomitant medications such as mood stabilizers, antidepressants, anxiolytics, hypnotics, or anticholinergics were administered. Based on risperidone LAI use and treatment compliance, patients were classified into four groups:
	- The first long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAI1) group (compliant patients receiving risperidone LAI treatment) (N = 44)
	- The second long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAI2) group (non-compliant patients receiving risperidone LAI treatment) (N = 33)
	- The first non-LAI (NLAI1) group (compliant patients receiving oral medications) (N = 337)
	- The second non-LAI (NLAI2) group (non-compliant patients receiving oral medications) (N = 55).

	- The rate of re-hospitalization, length of hospital stay, and rate of emergency room visits were assessed.

- **Results**: Compared with the non-LAI groups, the LAI groups had a longer mean duration of illness (8.5 years, P = 0.0001), a higher rate of admission due to mood episodes (P < 0.0001), depressive episodes (P < 0.0001), or manic episodes (P = 0.0002), and a higher rate of emergency room visits (P = 0.0003) before enrollment. After a 1-year follow-up, re-hospitalization rates were significantly lower in the LAI1 group than before enrollment for any episodes (P = 0.0001).
