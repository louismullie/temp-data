## Question

A 56-year-old man with a 5-year history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension presents for his annual check-up. He is obese (BMI 33 kg/m²) and has a history of hyperlipidemia. He reports no symptoms. His physical exam is unremarkable. Laboratory results show normal ALT and AST levels, HbA1c of 7.2%, and no evidence of viral hepatitis. You are considering screening for liver disease related to his metabolic risk factors.

According to current guidelines, what is the most appropriate initial step to assess this patient's risk of cirrhosis related to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, and does the presence of normal liver enzymes affect your decision?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the most appropriate initial step is to assess the risk of cirrhosis related to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis in a 56-year-old man with type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who has normal ALT and AST, and whether normal liver enzymes change the screening decision. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's risk category and whether guidelines recommend screening despite normal enzymes. Then, I should verify the recommended first-line noninvasive test and why it is preferred. Next, I will review the stepwise algorithm and thresholds that trigger secondary testing or referral. Finally, I should consider special caveats, such as age-adjusted cutoffs and the role of liver enzymes, and synthesize a clear recommendation with next steps.

> Let me first confirm the risk category. This patient has type 2 diabetes, obesity, and multiple cardiometabolic risk factors, which places him in a high-risk group for MASLD and clinically significant fibrosis. Importantly, normal aminotransferases do not exclude advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis in MASLD, so I should not be reassured by normal ALT/AST alone [^0c8ec408] [^e69fce25].

> Wait, let me verify the screening recommendation itself. Multiple high-credibility guidelines advise screening adults with T2DM or prediabetes for advanced fibrosis risk using a calculated FIB-4 index, even when liver enzymes are normal, because a substantial fraction of patients with T2DM harbor clinically significant fibrosis that is silent biochemically [^de346799] [^eee854b5] [^4b03df31].

> I need to check the first-line test and why it is chosen. The Fibrosis-4 index is the recommended initial noninvasive test in primary care and endocrinology settings because it is simple, inexpensive, widely available, and validated for MASLD risk stratification. It uses age, AST, ALT, and platelets, and performs well to exclude advanced fibrosis when low [^c7c93ad4] [^db37cc2e] [^a66e5a1b].

> Hold on, I should verify the stepwise algorithm and thresholds. If FIB-4 is less than 1.3, the negative predictive value for advanced fibrosis is high, and the patient can generally be managed in primary care with periodic reassessment. If FIB-4 is 1.3 or higher, secondary noninvasive testing is indicated, preferably with transient elastography or ELF, and if FIB-4 is 2.67 or higher, the risk of clinically significant fibrosis is high and direct referral to gastroenterology or hepatology is advised [^4e458367] [^3492f88a] [^ec05836f].

> Let me consider special caveats. I initially thought normal liver enzymes might obviate screening, but that would be a mistake. Normal ALT/AST can miss advanced disease, so screening should proceed regardless of enzyme levels in high-risk patients. Also, in adults older than 65, a higher FIB-4 threshold of 2.0 is used to improve specificity, and in those under 35, FIB-4 has lower accuracy, so clinical judgment and secondary testing may be needed even with intermediate scores [^0c8ec408] [^2a703d7f].

> Next, I should review the downstream implications. If secondary testing confirms advanced fibrosis, guidelines support cirrhosis-based management without biopsy in many cases, including HCC surveillance and variceal screening when indicated, and consideration of disease-modifying therapy such as resmetirom for MASH with significant fibrosis, alongside aggressive management of metabolic comorbidities and lifestyle interventions [^cc105321] [^bfcdb9a2] [^457a0b24].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. The most appropriate initial step is to calculate the FIB-4 index now, because the patient has T2DM, obesity, and multiple cardiometabolic risk factors, and normal ALT/AST does not exclude advanced fibrosis. Based on the FIB-4 result, I will follow the stepwise pathway to secondary testing or referral as indicated [^de346799] [^eee854b5] [^c7c93ad4].

---

The most appropriate initial step is to **calculate the FIB-4 index** [^c7c93ad4] for this 56-year-old man with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and hypertension, even though his liver enzymes are normal [^de346799]. Normal ALT/AST **does not exclude** advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis in MASLD/MASH [^0c8ec408], and guidelines recommend FIB-4 as the first-line, noninvasive test to stratify fibrosis risk in high-risk patients [^e30d71d8] [^b4f7d3f4]. If FIB-4 is≥ 1.3, proceed to transient elastography or ELF [^3492f88a]; if≥ 2.67, refer to hepatology for further evaluation and management [^ec05836f].

---

## Rationale for screening despite normal liver enzymes

Normal ALT/AST **does not exclude** advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis in MASLD/MASH [^0c8ec408]; up to 20% of patients with type 2 diabetes may have clinically significant fibrosis despite normal enzymes [^e40d94d5]. Thus, guidelines recommend screening high-risk patients — including those with T2DM, obesity, or metabolic syndrome — using noninvasive fibrosis assessment [^b2528ed3] [^eca0a018].

---

## Recommended initial screening tool: FIB-4 index

The **FIB-4 index** is the recommended first-line, noninvasive test to assess fibrosis risk in MASLD/MASH [^c7c93ad4]. It incorporates age, AST, ALT, and platelet count and is validated for risk stratification in primary care and endocrinology settings [^db37cc2e]. It is cost-effective, widely available, and endorsed by major societies, including AASLD, ADA, and EASL-EASD-EASO [^e69fce25] [^e30d71d8].

---

## Interpretation of FIB-4 results and subsequent steps

| **Fib-4 score** | **Interpretation** | **Recommended next step** |
|-|-|-|
| < 1.3 | Low risk of advanced fibrosis | - Routine follow-up<br/> - Repeat FIB-4 every 1–2 years in high-risk patients [^a29777eb] |
| 1.3–2.67 | Intermediate risk | - Confirm with transient elastography (FibroScan) or ELF test [^3492f88a] [^e30d71d8] |
| > 2.67 | High risk of advanced fibrosis | - Refer to hepatology<br/> - Consider liver stiffness measurement or MRI-PDFF [^ec05836f] [^311653da] |

---

## Clinical implications of detecting advanced fibrosis

Detecting advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis alters management: it prompts aggressive metabolic risk control, lifestyle intervention, and surveillance for complications such as HCC and esophageal varices [^bfcdb9a2]. Early identification enables timely intervention to slow or reverse fibrosis progression [^6f78733d].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initial test**: Calculate FIB-4 index in this high-risk patient, even with normal liver enzymes [^de346799].
- **Normal enzymes**: Do not exclude advanced fibrosis; screen regardless [^0c8ec408].
- **Next steps**: Use FIB-4 thresholds to guide transient elastography/ELF or hepatology referral [^3492f88a] [^ec05836f].

---

The most appropriate initial step is to **calculate the FIB-4 index** [^c7c93ad4] to stratify fibrosis risk, because normal ALT/AST does not exclude advanced disease in a high-risk patient with T2DM and obesity [^0c8ec408].

### A pragmatic management approach for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatosis and steatohepatitis [^4a18df3f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Obesity and associated insulin resistance induce a chronic metaboinflammatory state that lead to injury and dysfunction of multiple organs resulting in a cluster of noncommunicable diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a histologically active form of MASLD and characterized by greater injury and inflammation and progresses to cirrhosis with greater certainty than steatosis alone. The progression to cirrhosis is characterized by increasing fibrosis. The goal of treatment of MASLD/MASH was to improve the metaboinflammatory state i.e., the root cause of the liver disease and to prevent fibrosis progression to cirrhosis whereas in those who already have cirrhosis need additional care to prevent portal hypertension-related outcomes. Fibrosis regression is thus a key objective of treatment. The recent approval of resmetirom for MASH with fibrosis and the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for obesity and type 2 diabetes has increased awareness of these NCDs and resulted in the growing demand for liver assessment and care in obese individuals. Patients with MASLD also have multiple metabolic comorbidities which represent competing threats to life, and the care of the patient requires both assessment of the totality of the risk and a more holistic approach integrating the care of all of the threats to life. Here, we provide a pragmatic and easily implementable risk-based approach to the evaluation and management of MASLD.

### How to identify the patient with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis who will progress to cirrhosis [^1d5e4626]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) figures prominently into the clinical hepatology landscape. NAFLD represents a disease spectrum comprising simple steatosis, steatosis with elevated liver enzymes, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the entity with clear potential for fibrosis progression. Risk factors associated with fibrosis progression in NASH include histologic findings of lobular inflammation and any fibrosis as well as clinical comorbidities that include type 2 diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard in evaluating NASH; however, noninvasive methods are accumulating evidence for a growing role in identifying patients at increased risk to develop NASH, fibrosis, and potentially cirrhosis.

### A gastroenterologist's approach to improving metabolic health in MASLD [^1a5ffe60]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Gastroenterologists are often the first to encounter patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. While MASLD can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality in this population. This heightened risk is largely driven by the strong association between MASLD and CVD risk factors, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Therefore, addressing metabolic health is a fundamental component of MASLD management. Gastroenterologists play a key role in identifying metabolic risk factors, recommending lifestyle, and pharmacologic interventions, in consultation with specialists or multidisciplinary care teams when appropriate. This review provides a practical framework for integrating metabolic health optimization into routine MASLD care, equipping gastroenterologists with the necessary tools to improve both liver-related and overall patient outcomes.

### Clinical care pathway for the risk stratification and management of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^e40d94d5]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Screening for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) Step 1: identify patients at risk for clinically significant fibrosis prioritizes patients with clinically significant hepatic fibrosis (fibrosis stage 2 or higher) and reports that screening patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) diagnosed with fibrosis stage F2 or higher was cost-effective. We identified 3 groups known to be at greatest risk of NAFLD/NASH-related fibrosis: (1) patients with T2D, in whom as many as 20% have clinically significant fibrosis; we recommend clinicians screen all patients with T2D; (2) patients with 2 or more metabolic risk factors, supported by a study of 271,906 patients with NAFLD and an 1.8-fold higher risk of progression to cirrhosis or HCC with each additional metabolic trait; therefore, we recommend that clinicians screen patients with 2 or more metabolic conditions for NAFLD-related clinically significant hepatic fibrosis; and (3) patients with incidental hepatic steatosis or elevated aminotransferases, as studies suggest that 11% of those with incidentally discovered hepatic steatosis might be at high risk for advanced hepatic fibrosis. The metabolic conditions include central obesity; raised serum triglycerides, ≥150 mg/dL, or specific treatment; reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, <40 mg/dL in men and <50 mg/dL in women, or specific treatment; hypertension, systolic blood pressure ≥130 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥85 mm Hg, or specific treatment; and raised fasting plasma glucose, between 100 mg/dL and 125 mg/dL.

### Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease [^e86fa92c]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in the United States. It is characterized by steatosis in the liver and is potentially reversible. Risk factors include obesity, type 2 mellitus, and other metabolic disorders. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a more severe form of MASLD, puts patients at risk for cirrhosis, liver decompensation, and liver cancer. Diet, exercise, and weight loss are the cornerstones of management. Although only 1 medication has been approved for treatment of MASH, other pharmacotherapies and surgeries that aid weight loss and optimize metabolic risk factors can be used. Early diagnosis and intervention are important to prevent progression to cirrhosis and its complications, including cancer.

### Recommendations (...) [^01df9f7f]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice • For most persons with diabetes, A1C should be at 7% or lower to decrease the occurrence of microvascular disease. • An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker should be used to treat hypertension. • Patients should receive a high-intensity statin if they have at least a 7. 5% risk of atherosclerotic CVD. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in persons with diabetes mellitus. In 1999 and again in 2007, the American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association joined together to release statements on preventing CVD in persons with diabetes. New data have emerged since the publication of these statements; therefore, an updated guideline has been released. The ADA now states that an A1C of ≥ 6. 5% or previous criteria for fasting glucose or two-hour glucose may be used for diagnosing diabetes.

Recommendations OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY Persons who are overweight or obese should reduce their energy intake, and should receive counseling that certain changes in lifestyle can result in a maintainable weight loss, which has a variety of health benefits. If weight loss cannot be achieved with these changes alone, pharmacologic therapy and surgery, which have been shown to typically result in more weight loss compared with lifestyle changes or placebo, may also be options. Pharmacologic Therapy. Medications to assist with weight loss are appropriate for persons with a body mass index of 25 to 30 kg per m 2 and comorbidities, or persons with a body mass index greater than 30 kg per m 2, regardless of the presence of comorbidities. Surgery. Persons with a body mass index of at least 40 kg per m 2, or at least 35 kg per m 2 with a related comorbidity, who are not able to lose weight via behavioral or pharmacologic therapy may benefit from bariatric surgery.

It is the most effective option for significant and maintainable weight loss in persons with severe obesity. BLOOD GLUCOSE Some studies indicate that the possible risks of intensive glycemic control may outweigh the benefits in certain populations, including those with a history of severe hypoglycemia, and a shorter life expectancy because of older age, frailty, or comorbidities. Less strict A1C goals can be used in these persons. Additionally, less strict goals can be used for patients if the goal is hard to meet even with intensive self-management education, counseling, and treatment with medications aimed at lowering glucose levels. For most persons, A1C should be at 7% or lower to decrease the occurrence of microvascular disease. To lower A1C to this level, mean plasma glucose should be 150 to 160 mg per dL, fasting and premeal glucose should be less than 130 mg per dL, and postprandial glucose should be less than 180 mg per dL. Stricter goals might be beneficial in certain patient populations such as those without significant heart disease, shorter disease duration, or longer life expectancy; however, these should be implemented only if they do not cause significant hypoglycemia or adverse effects. BLOOD PRESSURE Recent randomized controlled trials evaluating intensive blood pressure lowering to less than 130 mm Hg have determined that there is no benefit in reducing the risk of coronary events. There is no evidence to indicate that intensive blood pressure lowering in persons with diabetes should be a universal recommendation, and more studies are needed to determine the proper goals in persons with risk factors.

### EASL-EASD-EASO clinical practice guidelines on the management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) [^bfaf1a0d]. Journal of Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously termed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is defined as steatotic liver disease (SLD) in the presence of one or more cardiometabolic risk factor(s) and the absence of harmful alcohol intake. The spectrum of MASLD includes steatosis, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH, previously NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis and MASH-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This joint EASL-EASD-EASO guideline provides an update on definitions, prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment for MASLD. Case-finding strategies for MASLD with liver fibrosis, using non-invasive tests, should be applied in individuals with cardiometabolic risk factors, abnormal liver enzymes, and/or radiological signs of hepatic steatosis, particularly in the presence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) or obesity with additional metabolic risk factor(s). A stepwise approach using blood-based scores (such as FIB-4) and, sequentially, imaging techniques (such as transient elastography) is suitable to rule-out/in advanced fibrosis, which is predictive of liver-related outcomes. In adults with MASLD, lifestyle modification - including weight loss, dietary changes, physical exercise and discouraging alcohol consumption - as well as optimal management of comorbidities - including use of incretin-based therapies (e.g. semaglutide, tirzepatide) for T2D or obesity, if indicated - is advised. Bariatric surgery is also an option in individuals with MASLD and obesity. If locally approved and dependent on the label, adults with non-cirrhotic MASH and significant liver fibrosis (stage ≥2) should be considered for a MASH-targeted treatment with resmetirom, which demonstrated histological effectiveness on steatohepatitis and fibrosis with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. No MASH-targeted pharmacotherapy can currently be recommended for the cirrhotic stage. Management of MASH-related cirrhosis includes adaptations of metabolic drugs, nutritional counselling, surveillance for portal hypertension and HCC, as well as liver transplantation in decompensated cirrhosis.

### Natural history and progression of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease [^d5d3eac3]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

The natural history of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously referred to as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is complex and long. A minority of patients develop inflammation and risk progressive fibrosis that can result in cirrhosis. Progression to cirrhosis occurs in 3-5% of patients and often takes more than 20 years. This narrative review presents an update on the natural history of MASLD, discussing studies and risk estimates for progression to severe outcomes, such as decompensated cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. We highlight the dynamic progression of liver damage, how to identify patients whose disease progresses over time, and how risk factors might be mitigated to reduce the risk for disease progression.

Steatotic liver disease (MASLD) biopsy and cirrhosis management—If cirrhosis is suspected based on NITs, clinical data, or imaging findings, then cirrhosis-based management may be initiated without a liver biopsy, and identification of cirrhosis should prompt screening for HCC and esophageal varices. Liver biopsy should be considered when NITs suggest significant fibrosis (≥ F2), especially if additional evaluation suggests the presence of “at-risk” MASH, when NIT assessment is indeterminate, when aminotransferases are persistently elevated (> 6 mo), or when additional alternate diagnoses are suspected.

Clinical practice guidelines can facilitate diagnosis and management of patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH), although their implementation to date has been suboptimal. 1,2 Using recently published 2023 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) practice guidance-based recommendations as a reference, 3 we assessed current real-world management of patients with MASH to identify gaps in clinical practice. We extracted data from the Adelphi Real World MASH Disease Specific Programme, a cross-sectional survey with retrospective data capture (from 85 hepatologists, gastroenterologists, and endocrinologists [Supplementary Table 1] and 633 patients [Supplementary Table 2] in the United States between January and June 2022). Two key goals of the AASLD guidance algorithm served as reference points: exclude fibrosis in low-prevalence populations (Goal A) and identify/manage people with 'at-risk' MASH or cirrhosis (Goal B). 3 Patients were split into 2 groups: Goal A comprised 100 patients initially diagnosed by primary care physicians (PCPs)/endocrinologists, and Goal B included 533 patients managed by gastroenterologists/hepatologists.

### Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD): mechanisms, clinical implications and therapeutic advances [^d7e39700]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Research has shown that patients with advanced fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis face a substantial likelihood of disease progression within a short timeframe, with an estimated 20% developing cirrhosis or decompensation over 2 years. The presence of portal hypertension, increased collagen deposition and hepatic stellate cell activation are markers of heightened fibrogenesis, contributing to a greater risk of disease advancement. While tools like the Child‐Pugh and MELD (Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease) scores are widely used to assess prognosis in cirrhosis, their utility is limited to later stages and not applicable for earlier phases of MASLD. Current non‐invasive serum biomarkers have only moderate accuracy in predicting disease progression, necessitating continued research to improve risk stratification methods.

Given the growing global prevalence of obesity and diabetes, MASLD represents a significant public health challenge. Early identification of high‐risk individuals, combined with targeted lifestyle interventions and emerging pharmacological therapies, is essential for preventing progression to severe liver disease and reducing overall morbidity.

Importance

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) includes a range of liver conditions, progressing from isolated steatosis (characterized by fat accumulation in the liver without inflammation) to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which involves fat accumulation and inflammation in the liver. The presence of MASLD is associated with increased morbidity and mortality due to liver-related complications, hepatocellular carcinoma, cardiovascular disease, and certain extrahepatic cancers.

Observations

The most common chronic liver disease worldwide, MASLD affects approximately 30% to 40% of the general adult population globally (with varying prevalence across continents), including approximately 60% to 70% of individuals with type 2 diabetes and approximately 70% to 80% of those with obesity. It is typically diagnosed based on an ultrasonographic finding of hepatic steatosis, along with at least 1 of 5 features of the metabolic syndrome (abdominal overweight or obesity, prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, hypertension, elevated level of plasma triglycerides, and low level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) for women who consume less than 140 g/wk of alcohol (<2 standard drinks/d) and for men who consume less than 210 g/wk (<3 standard drinks/d) and have no other known causes of steatosis such as use of a particular medication (eg, corticosteroids, tamoxifen, or methotrexate), hepatitis C, or iron overload. Other risk factors for MASLD include older age (≥50 years) and male sex (male:female ratio approximately 2). The Fibrosis-4 index (a scoring system incorporating age, serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, and platelet count) and vibration-controlled transient elastography (a noninvasive imaging technique) are commonly used to stage hepatic fibrosis in patients with MASLD. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death, followed by certain extrahepatic cancers (primarily gastrointestinal, breast, and gynecologic cancer) and liver-related complications, including cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding), and hepatocellular carcinoma. First-line treatment of MASLD involves behavioral modifications (including hypocaloric low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets, physical exercise, and avoidance of alcohol) and management of type 2 diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Bariatric surgery should be considered for patients with MASLD and a body mass index greater than 35. Resmetirom (a liver-directed, thyroid hormone receptor β-selective agonist) and subcutaneous semaglutide (a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist) are conditionally approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adults with MASH who have moderate to advanced fibrosis.

Conclusions

A highly prevalent condition among adults worldwide, MASLD is associated with liver-related complications, hepatocellular carcinoma, cardiovascular disease, and certain extrahepatic cancers. First-line treatment includes behavioral modifications, including a weight-reducing diet, physical exercise, and avoidance of alcohol. Resmetirom and semaglutide are conditionally FDA-approved medications for the treatment of adults with MASH and moderate to advanced fibrosis.

### Community pathways for the early detection and risk stratification of chronic liver disease: a narrative systematic review [^bceaa4a4]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Patients with chronic liver disease are often diagnosed during an index presentation to hospital with decompensated cirrhosis or liver-related events, and these presentations are associated with high mortality. However, there is often a long asymptomatic phase, in which there is an opportunity for earlier diagnosis and interventions to prevent progression to advanced disease. Therefore, strategies for early diagnosis and interventions (including behavioural changes and pharmacological treatments) that prevent patients progressing to cirrhosis and its associated complications probably have substantial benefits for patients and health-care services. Many community pathways have been generated. Some pathways focus on abnormal liver function tests as a starting point to diagnose liver disease. Other pathways target groups at greater risk of chronic liver disease-particularly people with harmful alcohol consumption, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. This systematic review summarises the existing strategies available for the early detection or risk stratification of liver disease, focusing primarily on alcohol-related liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Conducting randomised clinical trials that compare different strategies will be essential to elucidate which pathways are acceptable to patients, feasible, provide high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of liver disease, improve liver-related outcomes, and are most cost-effective at the population level.

Steatotic liver disease (MASLD) secondary risk assessment and referral—In patients with FIB-4 ≥ 1.3, a secondary assessment should be done (preferably VCTE or ELF initially) or the patient referred for further risk stratification, and direct referral to gastroenterology/hepatology should be considered in those with aminotransferases persistently (> 6 mo) above normal or when FIB-4 ≥ 2.67 due to the increased risk of clinically significant fibrosis. In higher prevalence settings, additional risk assessment with MRE may be appropriate when NITs are indeterminate or there is a clinical suspicion of more advanced disease, and MRE or corrected T1 (cT1) may help identify patients with “at-risk” MASH (NAFLD activity score ≥ 4 and fibrosis stage ≥ 2). In patients with confirmed or suspected advanced fibrosis, an ELF ≥ 11.3 is a predictor of future liver-related events and is approved for this purpose.

2.2 Progression to Advanced Liver Disease

Disease progression in MASLD is heterogeneous, with longitudinal data suggesting that 12%–40% of individuals with metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver (MASL) will progress to MASH within 8–13 years. Among those with MASH and fibrosis, ~15%–25% progress to cirrhosis within the same timeframe. Further, ~7% of patients with compensated cirrhosis due to MASLD will develop HCC within 10 years, and 50% of these individuals will require liver transplantation or experience liver‐related mortality. Understanding fibrosis staging is essential for risk assessment and long‐term management. The progression of MASLD varies among individuals, with advanced fibrosis being the strongest predictor of liver‐related morbidity and mortality. While some patients remain stable, others may develop end‐stage liver disease or require liver transplantation, with an estimated 3%–5% of MASL cases advancing to cirrhosis. Unlike other chronic liver diseases, MASLD is primarily driven by metabolic dysfunction rather than viral or autoimmune processes. Despite its slow progression, the increasing global prevalence of obesity and diabetes highlights its significance as a primary public health concern.

MASLD manifestation ranges from benign hepatic steatosis to advanced liver disease. Fibrosis staging is a key determinant of disease progression, with patients who develop bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis at the highest risk for liver‐related morbidity and mortality. Advanced fibrosis is the strongest predictor of poor outcomes, and some patients may progress to cirrhosis, end‐stage liver disease or HCC. While most individuals with MASLD do not develop significant liver complications, identifying those at greatest risk is critical. Current best practices involve a stepwise, non‐invasive evaluation beginning with a blood surrogate score (e.g. FIB‐4), If patients are intermediate or high risk, this is followed by imaging‐based liver stiffness assessments using ultrasound elastography. MASLD is also associated with several extrahepatic complications, most notably an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, which remains the leading cause of mortality in affected individuals, driven by systemic inflammation, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. Additionally, those with MASLD have a higher prevalence of chronic kidney disease with shared risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes, and polycystic ovarian syndrome likely due to underlying insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. These systemic effects highlight the need for comprehensive management strategies that address hepatic and extrahepatic manifestations of the disease.

Abstract Introduction Screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes may allow earlier detection, diagnosis, and treatment. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening every 3 years for abnormal blood glucose among adults aged 40 to 70 years with overweight or obesity. Using IQVIA Ambulatory Electronic Medical Records, we estimated the proportion of adults aged 40 to 70 years with overweight or obesity who received blood glucose testing within 3 years from baseline in 2016. Methods We identified 1, 338, 509 adults aged 40 to 70 years with overweight or obesity in 2016 and without pre-existing diabetes. We included adults whose records were present in the data set for at least 2 years before their index body mass index in 2016 and 3 years after the index BMI, during which we examined the occurrence of blood glucose testing. We calculated the unadjusted and adjusted prevalence of receiving blood glucose testing.

Results The unadjusted prevalence of receiving blood glucose testing was 33. 4% when it was defined as having a hemoglobin A 1c or fasting plasma glucose measure. The unadjusted prevalence was 74. 3% when we expanded the definition of testing to include random plasma glucose and unspecified glucose measures. Adults with obesity were more likely to receive the test than those with overweight. Men and adults aged 50 to 59 years had higher testing rates. A risk factor for abnormal blood glucose is having overweight or obesity. The 2017–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that approximately 42. 5% of US adults aged 20 years or older had obesity during the 2-year survey cycle. Abnormal glucose metabolism is also associated with cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension.

Effective blood glucose screening allows people with prediabetes and undiagnosed diabetes to be identified and referred to a type 2 diabetes primary prevention program. In 2015, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended screening nonpregnant adults aged 40 to 70 years who have overweight or obesity for abnormal blood glucose every 3 years. Our analysis identified adults aged 40 to 70 years with overweight or obesity in 2016 and without pre-existing diabetes, defined by using a modified SUPREME-DM algorithm for EMR data. We included only adults whose records were present in the data set for at least 2 years before their index BMI in 2016 and 3 years after the index BMI, during which we examined the occurrence of blood glucose testing.

Results Of the 1, 338, 509 adults aged 40 to 70 years who met the 2015 USPSTF criteria to test for abnormal blood glucose, nearly half had overweight and the other half had obesity. Among the overall study sample, most patients were White, and more than half were women. In the 3-year follow-up period, we found that 33. 4% of adults eligible for screening received a test for blood glucose when we used the strict definition of a blood glucose test. Among adults with overweight, the unadjusted prevalence of blood glucose testing was 28. 7%. Among adults with obesity, the unadjusted prevalence of blood glucose testing was 37. 3%. When we used the broad definition of a blood glucose test, the unadjusted prevalence of receiving a blood glucose test was 74. 3% among all adults eligible for screening, and among persons with overweight and obesity, the prevalence was
73. 9% and 74. 7%, respectively.

1.3 Clinical Importance of Early Detection

Timely diagnosis of MASLD and effective intervention are critical to preventing its progression to more severe conditions, including fibrosis, cirrhosis and HCC (Figure 4). Many individuals with MASLD remain asymptomatic until advanced stages, highlighting the need for improved screening protocols and non‐invasive biomarkers. However, diagnosis alone is not sufficient, as without effective, accessible interventions, early detection offers little clinical value. Early detection allows for targeted interventions, including lifestyle modifications and pharmacological approaches, to mitigate disease progression. Identifying high‐risk individuals enables proactive management strategies to reduce long‐term hepatic and cardiovascular complications.

FIGURE 4 
Progression of metabolic‐dysfunction steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Natural progression of MASLD, beginning with a benign healthy liver and progressing through the reversible stages of lipogenesis resulting in metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver (MASL), and inflammation leading to metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Then the beginning of the irreversible stages, starting with fibrosis, cirrhosis and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This continuum highlights the escalating severity of liver damage driven by metabolic dysfunction and underscores the urgency of early detection and intervention.

Diagnosing MASLD depends on identifying hepatic steatosis through imaging alongside at least one cardiometabolic risk factor, while ruling out other liver diseases or secondary causes such as heavy alcohol use. In contrast, diagnosing MASH, the more advanced form of MASLD, requires signs of hepatocellular damage such as lobular inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning. Despite its diagnostic utility in MASH, liver biopsy is rarely performed in clinical practice unless the disease is suspected to be advanced or there is diagnostic uncertainty, due to its invasiveness, cost and sampling variability. These limitations underscore the urgent demand for accurate, non‐invasive diagnostic tools. One such surrogate is vibration‐controlled transient elastography (FibroScan), which is increasingly used to assess liver stiffness (which estimates histological fibrosis levels) and detect early‐stage fibrosis or cirrhosis non‐invasively. Beyond its risk of progression to irreversible conditions such as cirrhosis, HCC and liver failure, MASH further disrupts metabolic homeostasis, contributing to comorbidities like obesity and diabetes through chronic inflammation and fibrosis. This self‐perpetuating cycle of worsening disease underscores the importance of developing early detection methods and targeted therapies.

Introduction

The global burden of chronic liver disease is increasing.Liver cirrhosis is the 11th most common cause of death worldwide, and liver cancer—predominantly hepatocellular carcinoma—is the sixth most common type of cancer and fourth most common cause of death due to cancer.Such end stage liver diseases have poor prognosis, partly because liver disease is often asymptomatic until severe complications occur, such as the classical decompensation signs of oesophageal varices, ascites, or hepatic encephalopathy.Metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most common chronic liver disease, with an estimated global prevalence of 38%.The prevalence is particularly high among patients with type 2 diabetes or obesity.MASLD and other liver diseases have the potential to progress through different stages of metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. This makes patients with confirmed or suspected MASLD particularly suitable to be screened for possible advanced fibrosis. MASLD is the most common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma in Sweden and elsewhere.By contrast, alcohol related liver disease is less common in the general population but is the leading cause of cirrhosis in many European countries.Together, alcohol related liver disease and MASLD are common liver diseases in the general population but are largely under-diagnosed. The primary risk factor for progression to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma remains the stage of liver fibrosis.

In recent years, international societies have published recommendations for screening for advanced fibrosis in primary care among patients with or at risk for MASLD or alcohol related liver disease.Detecting pre-cirrhotic disease early can potentially improve prognosis through interventions including lifestyle changes (alcohol abstinence in alcohol related liver disease and weight loss in MASLD) or by novel treatments such as resmetirom for patients with fibrotic metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis.Patients with screening detected compensated cirrhosis may benefit from surveillance for oesophageal varices and hepatocellular carcinoma, for example.As a first line test, guidelines recommend the non-invasive, blood based FIB-4 score. FIB-4 was originally developed to detect advanced fibrosis in patients with HIV and hepatitis C viral co-infection,but it has since been applied to other groups of patients with liver disease. Some concerns have been raised about its performance in the general population or in the primary care setting, where the prevalence of advanced fibrosis is relatively low.Although FIB-4 and other novel diagnostic alternatives are relatively successful in detecting fibrosis at the time of testing, they are less effective for predicting future cirrhosis events.

### Using incidental radiologic findings of hepatic steatosis to improve the diagnosis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease [^a7f91969]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a common cause of liver disease worldwide. In patients with MASLD, liver fibrosis stage is the most significant predictor of mortality; therefore, early identification of patients at the greatest risk of advanced fibrosis is essential. Noninvasive tests predict advanced fibrosis and are recommended for use in primary care settings to determine which patients would benefit most from specialty care. The adoption of these tools is not widespread, and several studies have reported underrecognition of cirrhosis in patients with MASLD and diabetes. The finding of hepatic steatosis on imaging performed for evaluation of nonliver conditions may present an avenue for opportunistic screening to identify more patients with MASLD. This article will review recommendations for when hepatic steatosis is found on imaging and noninvasive tests that can be used to help predict fibrosis staging. This is a significant area of research because a new treatment for MASLD has been approved, and other treatments may follow.

### Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in people with diabetes: the need for screening and early intervention. A consensus report of the American diabetes association [^8ceb2e31]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly referred to as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is a growing but often unrecognized medical problem for people with diabetes (particularly type 2 diabetes, especially when associated with obesity). Liver health has not been at the forefront of complications tracked for disease prevention, as traditionally done for diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, or neuropathy. However, liver steatosis affects approximately two out of three people with type 2 diabetes and places them at an increased risk for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and overall liver-related mortality. MASLD is also associated with extrahepatic cancers, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes and negatively impacts health-related quality of life. However, most individuals and their health care professionals remain unaware of the severe hepatic or extrahepatic health risks associated with MASLD and the need for early identification. In recognition of this knowledge gap and the rising prevalence of MASLD, this consensus report is a call to action to screen for liver fibrosis and risk stratify people with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, in particular if obesity is also present. This consensus report explains the rationale for the recent MASLD nomenclature change, how to best risk stratify, current treatment and long-term monitoring options, the value of an interprofessional approach to disease management, and the impact of alcohol intake on liver health. More awareness about the health risks associated with MASLD and broad adoption of screening for liver fibrosis as a new standard of care hold promise for a future without cirrhosis for people with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.

What is already known on this topic

Many people in the general population, especially those with type 2 diabetes or obesity, are at elevated risk of developing major adverse liver outcomes (MALO)

### A simple test to identify the risk of NASH and cirrhosis in people with obesity or diabetes: the time to screen is now [^505077d4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

In summary, more studies of this nature are needed to further improve our screening strategies. The central message for the endocrinologist is that this study confirms that the time for screening is now. More patient and clinician awareness are needed. Today, a simple test such as FIB-4 that can be embedded within our electronic medical records (ie, we have incorporated it at the University of Florida, together with a clinical care pathway to refer to hepatology) can efficiently screen and risk-stratify patients and prevent future cirrhosis in many people with obesity or T2DM—within seconds.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: from pathogenesis to patient care [^ee19056d]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in Western countries. It encompasses a wide spectrum of liver lesions, from pure steatosis to end-stage liver disease with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis corresponds only to one stage of NAFLD. As NAFLD can be considered a liver manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, its prevalence is high in obese people and in patients who have type 2 diabetes-insulin resistance is one of the key elements of the pathogenesis of NAFLD. This disease is often asymptomatic in the absence of decompensated cirrhosis, but should be suspected in patients with elevated aminotransferase levels or radiological evidence of a fatty liver or hepatomegaly. Liver fibrosis is associated with age over 50 years, obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels. Liver biopsy is the only way to assess the histologic features of necrotic inflammation and fibrosis that define nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and to determine its probable prognosis. The prognosis is good for pure steatosis, whereas the presence of necrotic inflammation is associated with a significant risk of progression to cirrhosis and, possibly, hepatocellular carcinoma. Lifestyle changes, such as dietary modifications and exercise, are recommended. To date, there have been very few randomized, placebo-controlled trials of drug treatments for NAFLD.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels in the asymptomatic patient [^907220f6]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Mild elevations in liver chemistry tests such as alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase can reveal serious underlying conditions or have transient and benign etiologies. Potential causes of liver transaminase elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, steatosis or steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis. The history should be thorough, with special attention given to the use of medications, vitamins, herbs, drugs, and alcohol; family history; and any history of blood-product transfusions. Other common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and thyroid disease, can cause or augment liver transaminase elevations. The recent American Gastroenterological Association guideline regarding the evaluation and management of abnormal liver chemistry tests proposes a practical, algorithmic approach when the history and physical examination do not reveal the cause. In addition to liver chemistries, an initial serologic evaluation includes a prothrombin time; albumin; complete blood count with platelets; hepatitis A, B, and C serologies; and iron studies. Depending on the etiology, management strategies may include cessation of alcohol use, attention to medications, control of diabetes, and modification of lifestyle factors such as obesity. If elevations persist after an appropriate period of observation, further testing may include ultrasonography and other serum studies. In some cases, biopsy may be indicated.

### ADA updates standards of medical care for patients with... [^cb2fc1a7]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice • All adults should be tested for diabetes beginning at 45 years of age. • Overweight or obese patients with one or more risk factors for diabetes should be screened at any age. • Persons who use continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pumps should have continued access after 65 years of age. Ongoing patient self-management education and support are critical to preventing acute complications of diabetes mellitus and reducing the risk of long-term complications. The American Diabetes Association recently updated its standards of care to provide the components of diabetes care, general treatment goals, and tools to evaluate the quality of care.

Key changes in the 2016 update include new screening recommendations, clarification of diagnostic testing, and recommendations on the use of new technology for diabetes prevention, the use of continuous glucose monitoring devices, cardiovascular risk management, and screening for hyperlipidemia in children with type 1 diabetes. In the 2016 update, the ADA revised the order and discussion of diagnostic tests to make it clear that no one test is preferred over others. Diabetes may be diagnosed based on results of random plasma glucose testing, fasting plasma glucose testing, two-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance testing, or an A1C level of 6. 5% or greater. Studies have confirmed that, compared with fasting plasma glucose and A1C testing, two-hour OGTT diagnoses more persons with diabetes.

A1C testing has several advantages compared with fasting plasma glucose testing and OGTT, including greater convenience, greater preanalytical stability, and less day-to-day variation during stress and illness. However, these advantages may be offset by the lower sensitivity of A1C testing at the designated cutoff, greater cost, limited availability in certain regions, and the imperfect correlation between A1C and average glucose levels in certain persons. The ADA revised screening recommendations in the 2016 update to clarify the relationship between age, body mass index, and risk of type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. It now recommends that all adults be tested beginning at 45 years of age, regardless of weight. Testing is also recommended for asymptomatic adults of any age who are overweight or obese and who have at least one additional risk factor for diabetes or who were diagnosed with gestational diabetes; and women with polycystic ovary syndrome). If test results are normal, repeat testing at a minimum of three-year intervals is reasonable.

### Practical approach to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in patients with diabetes [^0d01592c]. Diabetic Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes is expected to increase in parallel with obesity rates and the ageing population. Recent studies show that Type 2 diabetes is associated with a twofold increase in the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, a leading cause of chronic liver disease. Individuals with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, a more advanced stage of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, are specifically at risk of developing fibrosis/cirrhosis (end-stage liver disease) and hepatocellular carcinoma; therefore, identifying individuals (with Type 2 diabetes) who are likely to develop hepatic complications is paramount. In the present clinical review, we discuss the potential impact of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease diagnosis on Type 2 diabetes, and the putative risk factors for developing non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis fibrosis. We highlight the limitations of currently used tools in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease diagnosis and staging, and provide an insight into future developments in the field. We present an example of a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease screening protocol and discuss the therapeutic options currently available to our patients.

### Metabolic dysfunction and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease risk in individuals with a normal body mass index [^b1a9fd04]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is strongly associated with obesity, but is also common in individuals with a normal body mass index (BMI), who also experience the hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, and decompensated cirrhosis associated with NAFLD progression. The clinical evaluation and treatment of NAFLD in this patient population are challenging for the gastroenterologist. A better understanding of the epidemiology, natural history, and outcomes of NAFLD in individuals with normal BMI is emerging. This review examines the relationship between metabolic dysfunction and clinical characteristics associated with NAFLD in normal-weight individuals.

Recent Findings

Despite a more favorable metabolic profile, normal-weight NAFLD patients exhibit metabolic dysfunction. Visceral adiposity may be a critical risk factor for NAFLD in normal-weight individuals, and waist circumference may be better than BMI for assessing metabolic risk in these patients. Although screening for NAFLD is not presently recommended, recent guidelines may assist clinicians in the diagnosis, staging, and management of NAFLD in individuals with a normal BMI.

Summary

Individuals with a normal BMI likely develop NAFLD as a result of different etiologies. Subclinical metabolic dysfunction may be a key component of NAFLD in these patients, and efforts to better understand this relationship in this patient population are needed.

### Role of noninvasive tests in clinical gastroenterology practices to identify patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis At high risk of adverse outcomes: expert panel recommendations [^48fe5dec]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is generally considered a silent and potentially reversible condition. The subtype of NAFLD that can be classified as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can progress to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. Because of the metabolic nature of the pathogenic mechanism underlying NAFLD and NASH, it is often accompanied by common comorbidities such as obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The increase in the prevalence of these comorbidities has resulted in a parallel increase in the prevalence of NAFLD and NASH, globally, nationally, and even in children. In recent years, it has been identified that the stage of fibrosis is the most important predictor of liver outcomes; therefore, identifying patients with NAFLD and NASH with more advanced stages of fibrosis can be essential for optimal management. Several noninvasive tools for diagnosing and staging NAFLD and NASH are available, but simple and straightforward recommendations on the use of these tools are not. Recognizing these unmet needs, hepatologists who are members of the American College of Gastroenterology and the Chronic Liver Disease Foundation created a practical decision tree/algorithm to risk stratify NAFLD/NASH as a resource in gastroenterology/hepatology clinical practices. This review will provide insight into how this algorithm was developed, describe it in detail, and provide recommendations for its use in clinical practice.

### Semaglutide 2 . 4 mg once weekly in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis Dash_related cirrhosis: a randomised, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial [^ad268bea]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related cirrhosis are at particularly high risk of developing potentially life-threatening liver-related morbidities, such as portal hypertension, hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver-related mortality, and cardiovascular events. – By 2030, advanced liver disease amongst patients with NASH is expected to rise by 160% to nearly 8 million cases in the USA, leading to an estimated 3·5 million cases of cirrhosis and more than 100 000 cases of decompensated disease.This increase in prevalence is associated with an ageing population and increased incidence of metabolic syndrome related to the epidemic rise in obesity and type 2 diabetes.Indeed, approximately 71% of patients with NASH-related cirrhosis have type 2 diabetes,and suboptimal glycaemic control is a marker of advanced disease and adverse clinical outcomes.

Patients with NASH-related cirrhosis have a high unmet need for effective pharmacotherapies to improve the natural history of this disease, including the associated increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, yet there are currently no approved pharmacotherapies for the treatment of NASH.Currently, first-line treatment in patients with compensated cirrhosis and overweight or obesity involves lifestyle interventions to safely achieve weight loss and treat comorbidities (eg, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, and diabetes). Despite this, there is limited evidence that lifestyle modification or treating comorbidities in patients with cirrhosis improves liver-related morbidity or mortality.From a liver perspective, the main aim of treatment is to prevent progression of cirrhosis to end-stage liver disease (hepatocellular carcinoma and liver failure, which are increasingly likely with increasing fibrosis), for which liver transplantation remains the only curative treatment option. Unfortunately, due to obesity and metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities, many patients may not be listed for liver transplantation.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) exert multiorgan effects and have been shown to lower HbA 1c in people with type 2 diabetes and reduce bodyweight in individuals with overweight or obesity, and are associated with a reduced risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetes at high cardiovascular risk. – It has been suggested that GLP-1RAs may have hepatoprotective effects.In a previous placebo-controlled trial, the GLP-1RA semaglutide improved metabolic parameters and NASH resolution and was well tolerated in patients with NASH without cirrhosis (fibrosis stage [F] 1–3).However, there are at present no data with semaglutide in patients with NASH-related cirrhosis. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy and safety of semaglutide in patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: common questions and answers on diagnosis and management [^ceb85c57]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of liver disease in the United States, affecting up to 30% of adults. There are two forms of NAFLD: nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), defined as 5% or greater hepatic steatosis without hepatocellular injury or fibrosis, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), defined as 5% or greater hepatic steatosis plus hepatocellular injury and inflammation, with or without fibrosis. Individuals with obesity are at highest risk of NAFLD. Other established risk factors include metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although NAFLD is common and typically asymptomatic, screening is not currently recommended, even in high-risk patients. NAFLD should be suspected in patients with elevated liver enzymes or hepatic steatosis on abdominal imaging that are found incidentally. Once other causes, such as excessive alcohol use and hepatotoxic medications, are excluded in these patients, risk scores or elastography tests can be used to identify those who are likely to have fibrosis that will progress to cirrhosis. Liver biopsy should be considered for patients at increased risk of fibrosis and when other liver disorders cannot be excluded with noninvasive tests. Weight loss through diet and exercise is the primary treatment for NAFLD. Other treatments, such as bariatric surgery, vitamin E supplements, and pharmacologic therapy with thiazolidinediones or glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues, have shown potential benefit; however, data are limited, and these therapies are not considered routine treatments. NAFL typically follows an indolent course, whereas patients with NASH are at higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease, cancer, and end-stage liver disease.

### Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and cardiovascular risk: a comprehensive review [^e1e448ed]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a manifestation of metabolic syndrome (MS), is now one of the leading causes of chronic liver disease worldwide. It affects approximately 25% of the global population, and this figure is expected to increase to 38% by 2023. In 2020, NAFLD was redefined as “metabolic-associated fatty liver disease” (MAFLD), characterized by liver steatosis evident through biopsy, imaging or elevated liver enzymes, as well as obesity/overweight, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or metabolic disorders. Afterwards, in 2023, three major international hepatology organizations advocated for a nomenclature shift, recommending that the term “metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)” be adopted in lieu of NAFLD as the preferred term currently used in the field, the term “non-alcoholic steatohepatitis” has been superseded by “metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH)”.

MASLD includes a spectrum of liver conditions, ranging from simple steatosis (fat in > 5% of hepatocytes) to MASH, advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Recently, MASLD has been considered a multisystemic disease with interorgan connections to extrahepatic conditions. Increasing evidence suggests that cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a significant concern in individuals with MASLD, with a greater risk of CVD-related deaths than liver-related deaths. This is due to shared pathophysiological mechanisms such as insulin resistance (IR), endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress (OS), and systemic inflammation.

MASLD and CVD interactions are associated with common metabolic disorders such as obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes. The preferred term MASLD has been used to reflect the independence of MAFLD patients from metabolic risk factors. Although both MAFLD and MASLD are associated with different atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risks, MAFLD predicts ASCVD risk better than MASLD does. However, empirical confirmation regarding the superior predictive efficacy of MAFLD over MASLD in forecasting CVD events remains elusive. Since cardiovascular death has overtaken liver-related deaths and is the most common cause of death in MASLD patients, the link between MASLD and CVD has attracted the attention of clinicians, and it is crucial to identify MASLD patients at greater risk of fibrosis and disease progression and to effectively prevent and manage cardiovascular(CV) risk. This review aimed to provide an overview of the current understanding of MASLD and its impact on cardiovascular health.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^3721f7aa]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

NAFLD—Screening for advanced fibrosis and risk stratification prioritizes high‑risk groups and staged noninvasive testing. General population-based screening for NAFLD is not advised, whereas high-risk individuals should be screened for advanced fibrosis. All patients with hepatic steatosis or clinically suspected NAFLD should undergo primary risk assessment with the fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), and in prediabetes or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or with 2 or more metabolic risk factors or imaging steatosis, FIB-4 should be repeated every 1–2 y with secondary assessment considered. If FIB-4 ≥ 1.3, vibration-controlled elastography (VCTE), magnetic resonance elastography (MRE), or enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) may be used to exclude advanced fibrosis. In nongastroenterology/hepatology settings, suspected advanced NASH or discordant noninvasive tests (NITs) warrant specialist referral; patients with NASH cirrhosis require routine surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), esophageal varices, and decompensation monitoring. ELF > 11.3 is linked to hepatic decompensation in advanced fibrosis and should prompt screening and management of cirrhosis and portal hypertensive complications.

Figure 1. 
An approach to assessing a patient with MASLD and clinical considerations that may necessitate a liver biopsy.

MASLD, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.

Liver biopsy finds its most robust utility in the context of clinical research, particularly in its capacity to assist with the identification of histological endpoints in therapeutic intervention trials. A recognized knowledge deficit exists in the field concerning the validation of noninvasive assessments for monitoring the progression of MASH/MASLD in addition to the ability of noninvasive assessments to accurately prognosticate disease.Following guidance Food and Drug Administration and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)/ European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), patients typically enrolled in phase II and phase III trials depend upon a definite histologic diagnosis of MASH and identification of “at-risk” status with a NAS ⩾4. – Most trials typically enroll patients with biopsy-confirmed F2 or F3 fibrosis, and recognizing the potential for variability in interpretation, they often involve central pathologist review or consensus by a pathology adjudication committee comprising at least two pathologists to ensure precise scoring.Histologic outcomes are typically used as surrogate endpoints as liver-related mortality correlates with increasing fibrosis; particularly evident in cirrhosis (F4), while even F3 and F2 stages show significantly elevated mortality compared to minimal or absent fibrosis (F1 or F0).Consequently, histological examination becomes crucial for identifying patients with MASH at the F2 and F3 stages, where potential trial interventions could demonstrate clinical benefits. This underscores the importance of liver biopsy in clinical research, as opposed to relying solely on noninvasive assessments.

This commentary discusses how clinicians and various stakeholders can utilize the recently published American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (AASLD NAFLD) Practice Guidance in light of the change in the nomenclature to steatotic liver disease and its subcategories. The new terminologies explained in this commentary make it easier for the readers to interchangeably use metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in place of NAFLD and metabolic-dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH) instead of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), respectively, as they read the NAFLD Practice Guidance. The guidance document is relevant and can be utilized for the diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of patients with MASLD. This commentary serves as an accompanying article to the NAFLD Practice Guidance and helps it clinical application in the light of the new nomenclature.

### Insights into clinical trials for drugs targeting MASLD: progress, challenges, and future directions [^2812eb55]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

The transition in terminology from fatty liver disease to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) marks a considerable evolution in diagnostic standards. This new definition focuses on liver fat accumulation in the context of overweight/obesity, type 2 diabetes, or metabolic dysfunction, without requiring the exclusion of other concurrent liver diseases. The new definition also provides clear guidelines for defining alcohol consumption in relation to the disease. MASLD is currently acknowledged as the most widespread liver disorder globally, affecting ~25% of the population. Despite the extensive array of clinical trials conducted in recent years, the number of approved treatments for metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease is very limited. In the review critically evaluates the results of clinical trials of related drugs and assesses the future directions for drug development trials. The renaming of MASLD presents new challenges and opportunities for the design of clinical trials and the selection of target populations for drug development.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: non-invasive investigation and risk stratification [^904a7876]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a histological spectrum of liver disease, from simple steatosis through to cirrhosis. As the worldwide rates of obesity have increased, NAFLD has become the commonest cause of liver disease in many developed countries, affecting up to a third of the population. The majority of patients have simple steatosis that carries a relatively benign prognosis. However, a significant minority have non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and have increased liver related and cardiovascular mortality. Identifying those at risk of progressive disease is crucial. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard investigation for assessing stage of disease but its invasive nature makes it impractical for widespread use as a prognostic tool. Non-invasive tools for diagnosis and disease staging are required, reserving liver biopsy for those patients where it offers clinically relevant additional information. This review discusses the non-invasive modalities available for assessing steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis. We propose a pragmatic approach for the assessment of patients with NAFLD to identify those at high risk of progressive disease who require referral to specialist services.

### Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: update and impact of new nomenclature on the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases practice guidance on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^616dc135]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) nomenclature—this commentary discusses how clinicians and stakeholders can utilize the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (AASLD NAFLD) Practice Guidance in light of the nomenclature change to steatotic liver disease and its subcategories, clarifies that readers can interchangeably use “metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)” in place of “NAFLD” and “metabolic-dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH)” instead of “nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)” when reading the guidance, and notes that the guidance document is relevant and can be utilized for the diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of patients with MASLD; it also states that a global Delphi consensus process co-led by AASLD and the European Association for the Study of the Liver, in collaboration with the Latin American Association for the Study of the Liver, recommended a new nomenclature and that this commentary serves as an accompanying article to the NAFLD Practice Guidance.

### Systematic review of risk factors for fibrosis progression in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^71a648b8]. Journal of Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a growing public health problem. Evaluation of risk factors for fibrosis in NASH will help to target resources to reduce development of cirrhosis. This study had two aims; the first to compile longitudinal histological data to characterize the natural history of fibrosis progression in NASH, and second, to identify predictive factors for progression to advanced fibrosis (stage 3 or greater) in NASH.

Methods

Subjects had to have a histological diagnosis compatible with NASH on their initial biopsy, received no intervention of proven histological benefit, and undergone two liver biopsies with at least an interval of one year between them.

Results

Ten studies were selected comprising 221 patients. 37.6% had progressive fibrosis over a mean follow-up interval of 5.3 years (SD, 4.2 years, median, 3.7 years, range 1.0-21.3 years). Proportional hazards regression analysis demonstrated that age (HR=0.98, p=0.009) and inflammation on initial biopsy (any inflammation, HR=2.5, p=0.001; grade 1, HR=2.5, p=0.001; grade 2, HR=2.4, p=0.003) are independent predictors of progression to advanced fibrosis. Other traditional parameters (e.g. obesity, diabetes, hypertension) were not statistically significant predictors.

Conclusions

Presence of inflammation on the initial biopsy and age are independent predictors of progression to advanced fibrosis in patients with NASH.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^0c8ec408]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (AASLD Practice Guidance)—referral, laboratory interpretation, and family screening: Patients with suspected advanced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or discordant noninvasive tests (NITs) should be referred, as “Patients with suspected advanced NASH or discordant NITs should be referred to a specialist for evaluation, management, and/or further diagnostic evaluation.” Aminotransferase levels may be misleading, as “Aminotransferase levels are frequently normal in patients with advanced liver disease due to NASH and should not be used in isolation to exclude the presence of NASH with clinically significant fibrosis.” Family members merit counseling and assessment, as “First-degree relatives of patients with NASH cirrhosis should be counseled regarding their increased individual risk and offered screening for advanced hepatic fibrosis.” Patients with “at-risk” disease are highlighted: “Patients with ‘at-risk’ NASH (NASH with at least stage 2 fibrosis) are at increased risk of developing cirrhosis and liver-related complications.”

### Diagnostic evaluation of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^610f0a6a]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a diagnostic consideration among patients with asymptomatic elevated aminotransaminases, patients with radiologic findings of hepatic fatty infiltration, or occasionally in the patient with "cryptogenic" cirrhosis. The diagnosis of NAFLD requires evidence of fatty infiltration of the liver in the absence of excessive alcohol ingestion. Clinical evaluation should examine for metabolic risk factors (central obesity, glucose intolerance, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL cholesterol), which are suggestive but not specific for the diagnosis of NAFLD. Secondary causes of NAFLD, such as medications and intestinal bypass surgery, should be excluded as management of these conditions may differ. Confirmation of hepatic steatosis can usually be done by imaging studies, although occasionally liver biopsy is required. Among suspected NAFLD patients with chronically elevated aminotransaminases, clinical evaluation and serological testing should be performed to exclude other causes of chronic liver disease. Liver biopsy is required to stage fibrosis and distinguish between nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and steatosis. This is valuable for providing prognosis, excluding other liver disease, monitoring response to therapy or evaluating disease progression over time. Clinical features, particularly diabetes, obesity, and older age, can aid in stratifying patients at risk for advanced fibrosis but are not sufficiently accurate to replace liver biopsy.
