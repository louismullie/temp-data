## Question

INR of 3.5 with patient on warfarin 9 mg what should I do

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage a patient on warfarin 9 mg daily with an INR of 3.5, including whether to adjust the dose, whether to give vitamin K, and how to monitor. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the therapeutic INR target and whether 3.5 is supratherapeutic. Then, I should verify bleeding risk and whether the patient is asymptomatic. Next, I will review guideline-based management for mildly elevated INR without bleeding. After that, I need to check for reversible causes of INR fluctuation. Finally, I will outline a concrete plan for dose adjustment, monitoring, and follow-up, and consider any exceptions such as mechanical valves or high-risk features.

> Let me first confirm the therapeutic target. For most indications, including atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism, the target INR is 2.5 with a range of 2.0 to 3.0, so an INR of 3.5 is only 0.5 units above the upper limit and represents a mild elevation rather than a major supratherapeutic value [^5536d21a] [^052f68a1].

> Wait, let me verify bleeding risk at this level. The risk of bleeding rises as INR increases, but the short-term risk of major bleeding with a single INR between 5.0 and 9.0 is about 1% in observational cohorts, and an INR of 3.5 is substantially lower than that threshold, so the absolute bleeding risk at 3.5 is low in the absence of symptoms or high-risk features [^d6b74542] [^7bb2bec1].

> I should confirm the guideline stance on mild INR elevations without bleeding. The ACCP recommends against routine vitamin K for INR 4.5 to 10 without bleeding, and instead advises withholding 1 to 2 doses and reducing the maintenance dose for INR greater than 5.0. For INR 3.5, which is below 4.5, the approach is generally to observe and recheck rather than to reverse or make large dose changes, especially if the patient is asymptomatic [^443daa30] [^57b83930].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check for reversible causes of INR fluctuation before changing the dose. Let me consider recent changes in medications, supplements, alcohol, diet, adherence, or intercurrent illness, because these are common drivers of modest INR shifts and addressing them can obviate unnecessary dose changes [^7bb2bec1] [^8526a563].

> Next, I should review the immediate action. Given no bleeding and an INR of 3.5, I would hold the next 1 to 2 warfarin doses and then resume at a reduced maintenance dose, typically a 10% to 20% reduction from 9 mg daily, which corresponds to about 7 to 8 mg daily, with the exact adjustment individualized to prior INR stability and patient factors [^57b83930] [^c23f62c9].

> I need to ensure the monitoring plan is appropriate. I should recheck the INR within 2 to 7 days after the dose change to confirm trajectory, and if the INR normalizes and remains stable, I can return to the usual monitoring interval. For stable patients, extending INR checks up to every 12 weeks is acceptable, but after a dose change, closer follow-up is prudent [^f0754dad] [^cd87fa2a].

> But wait, what if the indication is a mechanical heart valve or another exception where a higher target is used. For most mechanical valves the target is INR 2.5 to 3.5, so an INR of 3.5 would be at the upper end of therapeutic and might prompt only a small dose reduction or closer monitoring rather than reversal, whereas some modern On-X aortic valves allow a lower INR strategy with aspirin, so I should confirm the valve type and current regimen before deciding [^67f748c9] [^44f571cc].

> I should double-check that I am not overlooking bleeding risk modifiers. In elderly patients, those with renal impairment, recent bleeding, or high-risk comorbidities, I might favor a slightly larger dose reduction and earlier INR recheck, but even then, routine vitamin K is not indicated at INR 3.5 without bleeding [^443daa30].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure internal consistency. For an asymptomatic patient on warfarin 9 mg daily with INR 3.5, the safest, evidence-aligned approach is to hold 1 to 2 doses, reduce the maintenance dose by about 10% to 20%, recheck the INR within a week, and investigate reversible causes of fluctuation, reserving vitamin K for INR greater than 10 or for bleeding scenarios [^57b83930] [^443daa30].

---

For an INR of 3.5 on warfarin 9 mg, **hold the next 1–2 doses** and **reduce the weekly dose by 10–20%** (about 7–8 mg/day) [^c23f62c9], then recheck the INR in 2–3 days. Vitamin K is **not routinely indicated** at this level unless there is bleeding or a high bleeding risk [^443daa30]. If the INR remains > 4.0 after rechecking, consider a 1–2 mg oral vitamin K dose and reassess within 24 hours [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance of INR 3.5

An INR of 3.5 is **mildly supratherapeutic** for most indications (target 2.0–3.0) [^5536d21a] and confers a modest increase in bleeding risk, though the absolute risk remains low in the absence of bleeding or high-risk features [^d6b74542]. The risk of bleeding rises as INR exceeds 4.0, so prompt correction is prudent [^ed59494f].

---

## Recommended management steps

### Step 1: confirm INR and assess bleeding risk

Confirm the INR with a **repeat test** to exclude lab error, and assess for bleeding or high-risk features (age ≥ 75, recent GI bleed, renal impairment, thrombocytopenia, or concomitant antiplatelets/NSAIDs) [^2c51be8f].

---

### Step 2: hold or reduce warfarin dose

Hold the **next 1–2 doses** and reduce the weekly dose by about 10–20% (e.g. from 63 mg/week to 50–56 mg/week, or ~7–8 mg/day) [^c23f62c9]. This balances bleeding risk against thrombosis risk in stable patients [^notfound].

---

### Step 3: monitor INR frequency

Recheck the **INR in 2–3 days** to gauge response; if stable, return to the usual interval (every 2–4 weeks) [^da2285c5].

---

### Step 4: consider vitamin K administration

Routine vitamin K is **not indicated** at INR 3.5 without bleeding or high-risk features [^443daa30]. If INR remains > 4.0 after rechecking, consider 1–2 mg oral vitamin K and reassess in 24 hours [^51317205].

---

## Special considerations

- **Mechanical heart valves**: Higher targets (often 2.5–3.5) may apply; still, INR 3.5 is at the upper limit, so consider a small dose reduction and closer monitoring [^67f748c9].
- **High bleeding risk**: Larger dose reductions or earlier vitamin K may be warranted [^notfound].
- **Drug interactions**: Review new or changed medications (e.g. antibiotics, amiodarone, statins) and adjust monitoring or dosing as needed [^8526a563].

---

## Patient education and follow-up

Emphasize **consistent vitamin K intake**, prompt reporting of bleeding or bruising, and adherence to scheduled INR checks. Reinforce medication and supplement reconciliation at each visit [^e8fb5a64].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Action** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Confirm INR | Repeat INR to exclude lab error |
| Assess bleeding risk | Identify high-risk features |
| Hold/reducedose | Hold 1–2 doses; reduce weekly dose by 10–20% |
| Monitor INR | Recheck in 2–3 days |
| Vitamin K | Not routine; consider 1–2 mg oral if INR > 4.0 persists |
| Patient education | Reinforce adherence, diet, and symptom reporting |

---

An INR of 3.5 on warfarin 9 mg warrants **holding 1–2 doses and reducing the weekly dose by 10–20%**, with a recheck in 2–3 days; reserve vitamin K for persistent elevation or high bleeding risk.

Low-intensity VKA for patients with atrial fibrillation — For stroke prophylaxis, minidose or low-intensity fixed-dose VKA "usually corresponding to 1.25 mg (0.5–3 mg) warfarin daily" was studied; a meta-analysis of "four randomized trials with 2,753 patients" found minidose warfarin "was inferior to conventional-intensity VKA with regard to thrombotic events (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.25–0.97)" and "Results were uncertain for major hemorrhage (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.67–2.27) or fatal bleeding (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.27–3.54)". Low-intensity VKA with a therapeutic range of "INR 1.5 to 2.0 (or 2.1 in one study)" was compared with conventional intensity in "two randomized trials" where one "was stopped prematurely after an excess of major hemorrhages" and neither showed differences in stroke or deaths; mean ages were "65 years" and "80 years". Pooled results show a "significant reduction of nonfatal extracranial hemorrhages with low-intensity VKA (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.06–0.6) without any appreciable increase in the rate of stroke or mortality". Stroke risk increases at low INR: "the OR for stroke was 2.0 (95% CI, 1.6–2.4) at an INR of 1.7 and 3.3 (95% CI, 2.4–4.6) at an INR of 1.5", and there is a trade-off showing a relative risk reduction of stroke "(~80%)" with "INR 1.5 to 2.0 compared with INR < 1.2", but greater thromboembolism risk with "INR 1.4 to 1.7 compared with INR 2.0 to 2.5 (OR, 3.72; 95% CI, 2.67–5.19)" in the ATRIA cohort; notably, "there was no evidence for a reduced risk for intracranial hemorrhage at INR < 2.0 compared with 2.0 to 3.5".

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of warfarin sodium must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

Bleeding risk and management context with elevated international normalized ratio (INR) on warfarin: "The risk of bleeding increases significantly when the INR exceeds 4.5". In patients with mechanical heart valves, adverse events increased from "two per 100 patient-years at INR 2.5 to 4.9, to 4.8 per 100 patient-years for INR 5 to 5.5, then to 7.5 per 100 patient-years for INR ≥ 6.5", and intracerebral bleeding doubled "for every 0.5-s increment in prothrombin time". When supratherapeutic INR occurs without bleeding, strategies include withholding VKA, adjusting VKA dose, or giving vitamin K, and a 2006 meta-analysis found vitamin K "was more likely to reverse overanticoagulation (INR > 4) at 24 h compared with simply withholding VKA".

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) maintenance — international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring frequency for consistently stable results: Stable INRs are defined as "at least 3 months of consistent results with no need to adjust VKA dosing". Practice varies, with "stable patients usually" tested "every 4 weeks" in North America, whereas "INR recall intervals of up to 90 days are routine" in the United Kingdom. Evidence includes three RCTs of recall intervals exceeding the 4-week standard; one compared 6- to 4-week intervals, another allowed intervals "of up to 12 weeks", and a third compared "4- to 12-week" intervals, with "none of the studies" showing differences in thromboembolism, bleeding, or INR control. Accordingly, the recommendation states: "For patients taking VKA therapy with consistently stable INRs, we suggest an INR testing frequency of up to 12 weeks rather than every 4 weeks (Grade 2B)".

### Oral anticoagulant therapy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^82289392]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Warfarin initiation dosing and timing — following the administration of VKAs, an initial effect on the INR usually occurs within the first 2 or 3 days and an antithrombotic effect occurs within the next several days. Initiation doses between 5 and 10 mg are effective, with individual responses varying according to the inpatient or outpatient status, age, concomitant treatments, and comorbidities; starting doses of ≤ 5 mg might be appropriate in the elderly, in patients with impaired nutrition, liver disease, or congestive heart failure, and in patients who are at high risk of bleeding. A dose of 2 to 3 mg seems to be appropriate for patients who have undergone heart valve replacement.

### Management of patients taking warfarin… [^bb39a072]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

After beginning warfarin therapy, a steady-state response is not achieved for about two weeks. A dosage of 4 to 5 mg per day is typical, although the needed dosage may be as low as 0. 5 mg or as high as 50 mg per day. Elderly patients should start at a lower dosage. A loading dose of warfarin is unnecessary; in one study, patients who received an initial 5-mg dose achieved their goal INR earlier than patients who received an initial 10-mg dose. If an INR is not available on the day after the first dose, it can be obtained on days 2, 3 or 4. If the initial INR is high, the patient is probably sensitive to warfarin's effects; therefore, a lower dose should be prescribed. Patients who are resuming warfarin therapy after a time off of the drug can safely begin with their previous maintenance dose. Experts at the College of American Pathologists recently recommended that the INR be checked at least four times during the first week of therapy.

This frequency could then be gradually decreased, based on the stability of the INR. Because the risk of hemorrhage is highest in the first six to 12 weeks of treatment, checking the INR weekly may be reasonable during this time. The maximum interval between tests should be no more than four to six weeks. If a patient's INR has been stable and then fluctuates by more than 0. 2 below or
0. 4 above the goal INR, the authors recommend evaluating the patient for the cause of the change. Leading causes would be laboratory error, noncompliance, use of a drug that interacts with warfarin. 1 is effective and may have fewer risks than the parenterally administered form. When a patient's INR is between 5 and 9, the American College of Chest Physicians recommends temporary discontinuation of warfarin therapy. If the patient is at risk for hemorrhage, low-dose oral vitamin K 1 also should be given.

For INRs of 9 or higher, vitamin K 1 also should be given, although at a higher dose. A repeat INR should be obtained within 24 hours. Additional vitamin K 1 may be needed, depending on the result of the repeat INR.

Background

High-quality anticoagulation management is required to keep these narrow therapeutic index medications as effective and safe as possible. This article focuses on the common important management questions for which, at a minimum, low-quality published evidence is available to guide best practices.

Methods

The methods of this guideline follow those described in Methodology for the Development of Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis Guidelines: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines in this supplement.

Results

Most practical clinical questions regarding the management of anticoagulation, both oral and parenteral, have not been adequately addressed by randomized trials. We found sufficient evidence for summaries of recommendations for 23 questions, of which only two are strong rather than weak recommendations. Strong recommendations include targeting an international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0 for patients on vitamin K antagonist therapy (Grade 1B) and not routinely using pharmacogenetic testing for guiding doses of vitamin K antagonist (Grade 1B). Weak recommendations deal with such issues as loading doses, initiation overlap, monitoring frequency, vitamin K supplementation, patient self-management, weight and renal function adjustment of doses, dosing decision support, drug interactions to avoid, and prevention and management of bleeding complications. We also address anticoagulation management services and intensive patient education.

Conclusions

We offer guidance for many common anticoagulation-related management problems. Most anticoagulation management questions have not been adequately studied.

### Pharmacology and management of the vitamin K antagonists: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^5c9a501c]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This article concerning the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). It describes the antithrombotic effect of the VKAs, the monitoring of anticoagulation intensity, and the clinical applications of VKA therapy and provides specific management recommendations. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh the risks, burdens, and costs. Grade 2 recommendations suggest that the individual patient's values may lead to different choices. (For a full understanding of the grading, see the "Grades of Recommendation" chapter by Guyatt et al, CHEST 2008; 133:123S-131S.) Among the key recommendations in this article are the following: for dosing of VKAs, we recommend the initiation of oral anticoagulation therapy, with doses between 5 mg and 10 mg for the first 1 or 2 days for most individuals, with subsequent dosing based on the international normalized ratio (INR) response (Grade 1B); we suggest against pharmacogenetic-based dosing until randomized data indicate that it is beneficial (Grade 2C); and in elderly and other patient subgroups who are debilitated or malnourished, we recommend a starting dose of ≤ 5 mg (Grade 1C). The article also includes several specific recommendations for the management of patients with nontherapeutic INRs, with INRs above the therapeutic range, and with bleeding whether the INR is therapeutic or elevated. For the use of vitamin K to reverse a mildly elevated INR, we recommend oral rather than subcutaneous administration (Grade 1A). For patients with life-threatening bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage, we recommend the use of prothrombin complex concentrates or recombinant factor VIIa to immediately reverse the INR (Grade 1C). For most patients who have a lupus inhibitor, we recommend a therapeutic target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 1A]. We recommend that physicians who manage oral anticoagulation therapy do so in a systematic and coordinated fashion, incorporating patient education, systematic INR testing, tracking, follow-up, and good patient communication of results and dose adjustments [Grade 1B]. In patients who are suitably selected and trained, patient self-testing or patient self-management of dosing are effective alternative treatment models that result in improved quality of anticoagulation management, with greater time in the therapeutic range and fewer adverse events. Patient self-monitoring or self-management, however, is a choice made by patients and physicians that depends on many factors. We suggest that such therapeutic management be implemented where suitable (Grade 2B).

Oral anticoagulation management systems and self-testing include the following: We suggest that health-care providers who manage oral anticoagulation therapy should do so in a systematic and coordinated fashion, incorporating patient education, systematic INR testing, tracking, follow-up, and good patient communication of results and dosing decisions. For patients treated with VKAs who are motivated and can demonstrate competency in self-management strategies, including the self-testing equipment, we suggest patient self-management (PSM) rather than usual outpatient INR monitoring (Grade 2B), and for all other patients, we suggest monitoring that includes the safeguards in our best practice statement 3.5. For dosing decisions during maintenance VKA therapy, we suggest using validated decision support tools (paper nomograms or computerized dosing programs) rather than no decision support (Grade 2C). Remarks: Inexperienced prescribers may be more likely to improve prescribing with use of decision support tools than experienced prescribers.

Warfarin 10 mg loading dose nomogram versus 5 mg loading dose nomogram — among patients with acute venous thromboembolism (VTE), bleeding outcomes show very low-quality evidence with a relative effect OR 1.90 (95% CI 0.17–21.1); the risk with the 5 mg nomogram was 5 per 1,000 and the risk difference with the 10 mg nomogram was 0 more per 1,000 (from 10 fewer to 20 more). For recurrent VTE, the OR was not estimable; the risk with the 5 mg nomogram was 0 per 1,000 and the risk difference with the 10 mg nomogram was 10 more per 1,000 (from 30 more to 0 more). Pooled data included 420 participants (3 studies) with 5–30 d follow-up, all from acute VTE, with footnotes noting that no studies were powered to detect differences in bleeding events and that absolute risk differences were calculated when ORs were not estimable.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of warfarin sodium tablets must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

Atrial Fibrillation

In patients with non-valvular AF, anticoagulate with warfarin to target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0).

Vitamin K supplementation and INR control — evidence overview: A low time in therapeutic range (TTR) as well as highly variable INR results are independent predictors of bleeding and thromboembolic complications during VKA therapy, and an observational study found that higher dietary vitamin K intake was associated with more stable INR control, suggesting the possibility that daily vitamin K supplementation might improve anticoagulation control. Across three randomized, placebo-controlled trials using pharmaceutically prepared vitamin K, the absolute difference in TTR was 3.54% (95% CI, 1.13%-5.96%) with no difference in major bleeding or thromboembolic complications, and control arms had relatively stable INRs (TTR range, 78.0%-85.5%).

### Warfarin dose management affects INR control [^18d8eb80]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known about how patterns of warfarin dose management contribute to percentage time in the therapeutic International Normalized Ratio (INR) range (TTR).

Objectives

To quantify the contribution of warfarin dose management to TTR and to define an optimal dose management strategy.

Patients/Methods

We enrolled 3961 patients receiving warfarin from 94 community-based clinics. We derived and validated a model for the probability of a warfarin dose change under various conditions. For each patient, we computed an observed minus expected (O - E) score, comparing the number of dose changes predicted by our model to the number of changes observed. We examined the ability of O - E scores to predict TTR, and simulated various dose management strategies in the context of our model.

Results

Patients were observed for a mean of 15.2 months. Patients who deviated the least from the predicted number of dose changes achieved the best INR control (mean TTR 70.1% unadjusted); patients with greater deviations had lower TTR (65.8% and 62.0% for fewer and more dose changes respectively, Bonferroni-adjusted P < 0.05/3 for both comparisons). On average, clinicians in our study changed the dose when the INR was 1.8 or lower/3.2 or higher (mean TTR: 68%); optimal management would have been to change the dose when the INR was 1.7 or lower/3.3 or higher (predicted TTR: 74%).

Conclusions

Our observational study suggests that INR control could be improved considerably by changing the warfarin dose only when the INR is 1.7 or lower/3.3 or higher. This should be confirmed in a randomized trial.

Table 10 — optimal therapeutic INR range (lower target vs 2 to 3): Compared with INR 2–3, a lower target INR increases thromboembolism (RR 3.5 (2.5–4.4)) with anticipated absolute effects of 115 more per 1,000 (from 83 more to 157 more) at a baseline risk of 46 per 1,000 and 100 more per 1,000 (from 72 more to 136 more) at a baseline of 40 per 1,000, while major hemorrhage shows RR 1.1 (0.7–1.7) with absolute differences of 1 more per 1,000 (from 2 fewer to 4 more) at a baseline of 6 per 1,000 and 2 more per 1,000 (from 7 fewer to 16 more) at a baseline of 23 per 1,000; study sizes were 78,493 (17 studies) for major hemorrhage and 827 (4 studies) for thromboembolism.

### Monitoring… [^53cec104]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

4, 12 Because warfarin has a long half-life, increases in the INR may not be noted for 24 to 36 hours after administration of the first dose, and maximum anticoagulant effect may not be achieved for 72 to 96 hours.
4. Patients at highest risk for complications should probably be given a smaller initial dose. This dose is then titrated to the lower end of a given therapeutic range, depending on the indication. For example, the goal may be an INR of 2 to 2. 5 in a patient with a history of bleeding, chronic atrial fibrillation and no additional risk factors for thrombosis. 13 A small decrease in the INR is expected to occur with the discontinuation of unfractionated heparin therapy. 14 Patients who require nonurgent anticoagulation, such as those with stable chronic atrial fibrillation, can be started on warfarin as out-patients, without the concomitant administration of heparin.

15 As needed, doses can be easily changed by looking at the cumulative weekly dosage and adding or subtracting 10 to 20 percent evenly over the week 15, 16. This approach is possible because of warfarin's long half-life. It is a safe and effective way to provide sufficient anticoagulation. Algorithms for establishing a percentage change in the weekly dosage to achieve an INR of 2 to 3 or 2. 5 to
3. 5 are presented in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.

3. The study was discontinued after a mean follow-up period of 1. 1 years because of the occurrence of significantly fewer events in the adjusted-dose warfarin group compared with the warfarin and aspirin group. This reduction in events was associated with similar major bleeding rates. Interestingly, in the adjusted-dose group, the INR was greater than 3 in seven of the 12 major bleeding events.

### Management strategies following slightly out-of-range INRs: watchful waiting vs dose changes [^41ccf193]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Higher time in therapeutic range is a predictor of positive outcomes such as decreased risk of death, stroke, and major bleeding events. However, time in therapeutic range has been shown to be affected by a multitude of factors including adherence to regimen, diet, patient demographics, and comorbidities. Most of these factors lie outside the realm of adjustment, and clinicians must rely primarily on dose adjustments to maintain therapeutic international normalized ratios (INRs).

The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines recommend a therapeutic INR range of 2.0 to 3.0 for most indications for warfarin, including atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolic disease, and low-risk mechanical aortic valve replacement. At any given time, 50% of patients receiving care within an anticoagulation management clinic may be outside of the recommended range, with 30% only slightly out of range (1.75–1.99 or 2.01–2.25). When an INR is found to be slightly out of range, clinicians must select a management strategy to reestablish a therapeutic INR. Warfarin management strategies include a weekly dose change and/or a single-dose change or no dose change. In cases where the INR is slightly out of range, 0.5 above or below the therapeutic range, ACCP guidelines suggest maintaining the patient's current warfarin dosing and retesting the INR within the following 2 weeks. This management strategy is also known as watchful waiting.

The dosage and administration of JANTOVEN must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

Mechanical On-X aortic valve — lower-intensity warfarin strategy: In patients without risk factors who receive a mechanical On-X aortic heart valve, targeting the INR to a lower goal (1.5–2.0) with aspirin 81 mg daily may be a strategy for long-term management. Warfarin dosing is targeted to an INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0) for the first 3 months after surgery, during which low-dose aspirin is also used. In the randomized comparison, the lower-intensity INR group experienced significantly less major and minor bleeding with similar rates of stroke, transient ischemic attack, total neurological events, and all-cause mortality between the 2 groups, and a subsequent publication showed harm with dual-antiplatelet therapy versus low-intensity anticoagulation plus low-dose aspirin.

### Warfarin management with mild elevation of INR… [^4e755837]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Using warfarin increases the risk of hemorrhage, particularly when the International Normalized Ratio rises above the therapeutic range. Most experts agree that when the INR exceeds four or five, the warfarin dosage should be decreased. However, there currently is no consensus about how to treat the asymptomatic patient who has a mildly elevated INR in the 3. 2 to
3. 4 range. Some experts would continue the current dosage for a period of time, while others would reduce the total weekly dosage by 2 to 18 percent. Banet and associates evaluated the safety of not changing the warfarin dosage because of a mildly elevated INR and quantified the relationship between reduction of the warfarin dosage and subsequent decrease of the INR. The study was a randomized controlled trial of outpatients who were receiving warfarin therapy at eight health maintenance centers. Investigators identified patients who had a mildly elevated INR between 3. 2 and 3.
4.

To be included in the study, the patients had to be asymptomatic, have been using warfarin for at least 30 days, and have a previous therapeutic INR. A cohort of 231 patients was analyzed for the study, with 103 of those in the anticoagulation service group. The anticoagulation service group had only one episode of epistaxis in the 30 days after the elevated INR. Patients in the primary care group were more likely to have a reduction in their warfarin dosage than patients in the anticoagulation service group. There was no difference between the two groups with regard to the median INR. In a subgroup analysis, the patients in the anticoagulation service group were more likely to have a follow-up therapeutic INR than those in the primary care group. The median follow-up INR in those with no change in the dosage was 2. 7,
2. 5 in those who reduced the dosage by 1 to 20 percent, and 1.

7 in patients who had the dosage reduced by 21 to 43 percent. The authors conclude that maintaining the same warfarin dosage in asymptomatic patients with a slightly elevated INR of 3. 2 to
3. 4 is appropriate management for these patients. They add that a dosage reduction of more than 20 percent should be avoided in patients with mild elevation of the INR because of the increased risk of subsequent adverse events.

### Single-dose adjustment versus no adjustment of warfarin in stably anticoagulated patients with an occasional international normalized ratio (INR) out of range [^23a32d29]. Thrombosis Research (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Well-controlled patients on warfarin may still have occasional International Normalized Ratios (INRs) outside the therapeutic range. It is unclear whether there is any benefit of a single-dose correction in this situation.

Aim

To evaluate whether patients with very stable INR results should continue with the maintenance dose of warfarin without a single-dose correction, even when the result unexpectedly is moderately below or above the therapeutic range.

Methods

A) We reviewed retrospectively 364 patients with unchanged maintenance dose for at least 6 months and an occasional INR outside the therapeutic range regarding decision on dosing and the effect on the next INR. B) We randomized 160 patients with at least 3 months of unchanged maintenance dose, an occasional INR deviating to a minimum of 1.5 or a maximum of 4.4 and unexplained or temporary, removable cause to a single-dose Change or No change. Follow-up INRs and telephone interviews were obtained after 2 weeks.

Results

A) Retrospectively, the proportion of follow-up INRs outside the therapeutic range was 29.9% after No change, 27.1% after Increased dose and 25.7% after Skipped/reduced dose. However, the decision on No change was mainly taken in case of minimal INR deviations. B) Forty-eight (60%) of the patients randomized to Change were within the therapeutic range at follow-up versus 45 (56%) of those with No change, odds ratio 1.17 (95% confidence interval 0.59–2.30). For baseline INRs deviating down to 1.6 or up to 3.6 (therapeutic range, INR 2.0–3.0) the 2-week INRs did not differ between the groups.

Conclusion

Our results suggest only a small or no difference between the two managements of an occasional INR out of range in terms of the 2-week follow-up INR. In stable patients on warfarin with an occasional INR outside the therapeutic range it seems reasonable to continue with the same dose without a single-dose change and perform a repeat test in about 2 weeks.

### The pharmacology and management of the vitamin K antagonists: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^ba59b5b4]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This article concerning the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is part of the Seventh American College of Chest Physicians Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence-Based Guidelines. The article describes the antithrombotic effect of VKAs, the monitoring of anticoagulation intensity, the clinical applications of VKA therapy, and the optimal therapeutic range of VKAs, and provides specific management recommendations. Grade 1 recommendations are strong, and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh the risks, burdens, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patient's values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this article are the following: for dosing of VKAs, we suggest the initiation of oral anticoagulation therapy with doses between 5 and 10 mg for the first 1 or 2 days for most individuals, with subsequent dosing based on the international normalized ratio (INR) response (Grade 2B). In the elderly and in other patient subgroups with an elevated bleeding risk, we suggest a starting dose at ≤ 5 mg (Grade 2C). We recommend basing subsequent doses after the initial two or three doses on the results of INR monitoring (Grade 1C). The article also includes several specific recommendations for the management of patients with INRs above the therapeutic range and for patients requiring invasive procedures. For example, in patients with mild to moderately elevated INRs without major bleeding, we suggest that when vitamin K is to be given it be administered orally rather than subcutaneously (Grade 1A). For the management of patients with a low risk of thromboembolism, we suggest stopping warfarin therapy approximately 4 days before they undergo surgery (Grade 2C). For patients with a high risk of thromboembolism, we suggest stopping warfarin therapy approximately 4 days before surgery, to allow the INR to return to normal, and beginning therapy with full-dose unfractionated heparin or full-dose low-molecular-weight heparin as the INR falls (Grade 2C). In patients undergoing dental procedures, we suggest the use of tranexamic acid mouthwash (Grade 2B) or epsilon amino caproic acid mouthwash without interrupting anticoagulant therapy (Grade 2B) if there is a concern for local bleeding. For most patients who have a lupus inhibitor, we suggest a therapeutic target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 2B]. In patients with recurrent thromboembolic events with a therapeutic INR or other additional risk factors, we suggest a target INR of 3.0 (range, 2.5 to 3.5) [Grade 2C]. As models of anticoagulation monitoring and management, we recommend that clinicians incorporate patient education, systematic INR testing, tracking, and follow-up, and good communication with patients concerning results and dosing decisions (Grade 1C+).

Results

Search results

We identified 2656 articles from bibliographic databases search after duplicates were removed (Fig. 1). Of these, 75 full-text articles passed title/abstract screening, were retrieved, and reviewed for eligibility. A total of 52 articles were excluded after full text review (see the complete list in Appendix 2). Five additional RCTs, identified from previous relevant systematic reviews and other search techniques, were included, resulting in a total of 28 trials, included in our study. Two 3-arm trials divided their intervention groups based on different INR measurement frequenciesand PSM algorithms. However, in our analysis exploring the broad types of warfarin management, we combined the groups with the same management type in each trial.

Warfarin management strategies

Twenty-two trials compared usual care with other warfarin management strategies. The practice of usual care appeared similar across these trials, although some details of the protocols varied. These variations ranged from physicians adjusting the warfarin dose based on INR readings and dosing algorithms to practices where physicians managed INR monitoring and warfarin dosing adjustments without the support of an anticoagulation protocol (Appendix 3). Healthcare providers in the 12 AMS trials were pharmacists (6 trials), a multidisciplinary team (1 trial), nurses (1 trial), and unspecified healthcare providers (4 trials). In 9 PST trials, patients performed their own INR tests during the maintenance phase at the following frequencies: once a week (5 trials), every two weeks (3 trials), every month (1 trial), or at an unknown frequency (1 trial). Warfarin dosing instruction was received from various sources, including computer application/software guiding healthcare providers (4 trials), physicians (2 trials), and unspecified healthcare providers (3 trials). The frequency of INR measurements by patients in the 13 PSM trials were as follows: once a week (6 trials), every two weeks (4 trials), at patient's discretion (2 trials), or at unspecified intervals (1 trial).

Risk of bias of included trials

Since the risk of bias may vary for certain steps in RCTs across different outcomes, the risk of bias in the included trials was assessed and reported separately for each outcome (see Appendix 4). Among the 15 trials reporting all-cause mortality, 9 were justified as having a low risk of bias, 4 an unclear risk, and 2 a high risk of bias. For other outcomes, a higher proportion of trials exhibited an overall unclear risk of bias. This was attributed to the need for clearer reporting of outcome assessments. For example, 14 out of 18 trials, and 12 out of 17 trials were justified as having unclear risk of bias for major bleeding, and major TE.

### Warfarin INR test meters… [^aaff76e6]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

An INR test meter is a portable, battery-operated meter, used to monitor patient response to warfarin. The meter has a screen that displays results, and an opening for meter-specific test strips. A test strip is inserted into the meter, and then a lancet is used to obtain blood which is applied to the test strip. The meter reads the test strip, measures how long it takes the blood to clot, and provides the result based on a standardized calculation in the form of the International Normalized Ratio, or INR. The INR is used by patients and physicians to determine if warfarin dosing is appropriate. INR test meters and test strips are medical devices regulated by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA wants to ensure patients and health care providers use these devices safely. Please read on for more information. What is Warfarin.

Warfarin is a blood thinner prescribed to prevent and treat blood clots. Warfarin therapy may be prescribed for patients with certain types of irregular heartbeat, blood clots in the legs or lungs, and patients who have certain medical device implants such as artificial heart valves. A patient's warfarin dose depends on many factors, including the patient's age, overall health and genetic makeup. The dose may also need to be adjusted based on a patient's diet and current medications. Monitoring Warfarin Warfarin must be monitored to ensure it is working effectively and being used safely. Achieving the correct warfarin dosage can be difficult but is extremely important. If the dose of warfarin is too low, the patient is at risk of developing harmful blood clots. If the dose of warfarin is too high, the patient may be at risk of serious bleeding.

How often an INR test meter is used to monitor warfarin, and the results a patient should expect, will be based on recommendations from the patient's health care provider. An INR target range is set by a health care provider. It is typically between 2. 0 and
3. 0 for basic blood-thinning needs, though the range may vary based on a patient's specific conditions. An INR above the patient-specific target range may increase the risk of bleeding, while an INR below the target range may increase the risk of developing a blood clot.

3: Poor documentation:

Patients were often not issued with patient-held information and written dosage instructions at start of therapy, or discharged from hospital without an appointment for next INR measurement or for consultation with appropriate healthcare professional. New referrals to anticoagulation service had incomplete information making appointments more challenging for the haematology team. Patients were affected by reduced quality of anticoagulation leading to potentially life-threatening over or under coagulation.

4: Failure to consider significant pharmacological interactions:

Not enough safe practice had been promoted regarding co-prescribing one or more clinically significant interacting medicines or informing anticoagulant services that an interacting medicine had been prescribed. Co-prescribed medications were frequently not documented on the referral form, with the consequence that the anticoagulation team were unable to identify any potentially dangerous interactions in a timely manner.

Computerized warfarin dosing and monitoring — Computer assistance by dedicated programs may improve dose management and time in therapeutic range (TTR). In randomized studies, three contemporary computer programs performed as well as the experienced medical staff of an anticoagulation management service in achieving a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 and achieved significantly better control when intensive therapy was required (ie, INR, 3.0–4.5). In another randomized study of 101 patients, computerized dose adjustment required 50% fewer changes of dose while maintaining comparable regulation. The first multicenter randomized trial, in 285 patients, showed a 22% overall improvement of control with a computerized program. Using a different program in > 1,200 randomized patients, 71.6% of patients were in range with computer dosing and 68.2% were in range by manual dosing during maintenance. In the European Concerted Action on Anticoagulation international, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, 13,052 patients were followed for 18,617 patient-years, with a trend toward fewer clinical events overall and a statistically significant reduction in clinical events in the subgroup treated for VTE; a subsequent cost-effectiveness analysis found computer-assisted dosing cheaper than manual dosing. During initiation, two small clinical trials suggest computerized dose management can be at least as effective as manual dosing by trained clinicians, although some computerized programs are unable to manage dosing during the induction phase.

2.3 Initial and Maintenance Dosing

The appropriate initial dosing of COUMADIN varies widely for different patients. Not all factors responsible for warfarin dose variability are known, and the initial dose is influenced by:

Clinical factors including age, race, body weight, sex, concomitant medications, and comorbidities
Genetic factors (CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]

Select the initial dose based on the expected maintenance dose, taking into account the above factors. Modify this dose based on consideration of patient-specific clinical factors. Consider lower initial and maintenance doses for elderly and/or debilitated patients and in Asian patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Routine use of loading doses is not recommended as this practice may increase hemorrhagic and other complications and does not offer more rapid protection against clot formation.

Individualize the duration of therapy for each patient. In general, anticoagulant therapy should be continued until the danger of thrombosis and embolism has passed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Dosing Recommendations without Consideration of Genotype

If the patient's CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes are not known, the initial dose of COUMADIN is usually 2 to 5 mg once daily. Determine each patient's dosing needs by close monitoring of the INR response and consideration of the indication being treated. Typical maintenance doses are 2 to 10 mg once daily.

Dosing Recommendations with Consideration of Genotype

Table 1 displays three ranges of expected maintenance COUMADIN doses observed in subgroups of patients having different combinations of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 gene variants [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. If the patient's CYP2C9 and/or VKORC1 genotype are known, consider these ranges in choosing the initial dose. Patients with CYP2C9 *1/✱3, *2/✱2, *2/✱3, and *3/✱3 may require more prolonged time (> 2 to 4 weeks) to achieve maximum INR effect for a given dosage regimen than patients without these CYP variants.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^8a5c2483]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative warfarin (VKA) restart dose — PICO 3: In patients requiring VKA (warfarin) interruption for an elective surgery/procedure, we suggest resuming the first post-operative VKA dose at the patient's usual dose over resuming VKA with double the usual dose (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence). One randomized trial of 98 patients compared post-operative resumption of warfarin at patients' usual dose vs doubling the warfarin dose for the first 2 post-operative days, finding by the fifth post-operative day an INR ≥ 2.0 in 13% of the usual-dose group and 50% of the doubling dose group (RR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.60) and by the tenth post-operative day 68% and 87% (RR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.65 to 1.00). A 40-patient randomized trial reported median days to reach an INR ≥ 2.0 of 7.8 vs 9.0 days (95% CI: −3.1 to 4.9), and observational studies reported mean durations to attain an INR ≥ 2.0 of 4.6 and 5.1 days, respectively. Implementation notes caution that although doubling for 1 to 2 days may lead to a more rapid attainment of an INR ≥ 2.0 in some patients, there are concerns in applying this approach in practice, including in patients expected to be hospitalized for > 1 day.

Warfarin interaction mitigation — The most effective method to avoid adverse outcomes associated with drug interactions is to try to avoid, when feasible, concurrent use of potentially interacting drugs and to use noninteracting alternatives instead; when noninteracting alternatives are not available, adverse outcomes can be avoided by increasing the frequency of monitoring and adjusting warfarin doses based on INR response, and prospective dosing adjustments are inappropriate because of the unpredictable nature of patient response to drug interactions.

Fondaparinux

Therapeutic range

Fondaparinux is not routinely monitored in adults but, if required, can be monitored using an anti-FXa activity assay, calibrated with fondaparinux. Target peak concentration for therapeutic anticoagulation in adults is 0.5 to 1.0 mg/L, and this range has been extrapolated to children treated with fondaparinux. Fondaparinux does not usually affect routine coagulation tests, prothrombin time, or aPTT, when used in therapeutic doses but can cause aPTT prolongation at higher doses.

Dosing/dose frequency

A starting dose of 0.1 mg/kg once daily is recommended in children aged 1 to 17 years. This is based on an open-label prospective study (FondaKIDS) of 24 children treated for DVT or HIT. Dosing was adjusted to achieve peak concentrations of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/L after 4 hours, tested initially after the first dose, with 88% of individuals achieving the target concentration without dose adjustment.

Periprocedural management

The anticoagulant effect of fondaparinux may persist for 2 to 4 days in patients with normal renal function because of its long elimination half-life.

Management of bleeding

There is no antidote to fondaparinux. Bleeding should be managed as per protocols for managing bleeding due to other irreversible anticoagulants.

Warfarin, acenocoumarol, and phenprocoumon

Therapeutic range

Target therapeutic ranges for children are currently extrapolated from the therapeutic ranges used in adults for the different indications. The most common target international normalized ratio (INR) for children for the treatment of VTE is 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0). High-risk conditions may require a higher range of 2.5 to 3.5. As yet, there have been no clinical trials to assess appropriate INR ranges for children.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation with coronary artery disease — comparative antithrombotic strategies indicate that moderate-intensity oral anticoagulation (international normalized ratio [INR] 2.0 to 3.0) reduced myocardial infarction and stroke but increased bleeding 6.0- to 7.7-fold; combining aspirin with low-intensity anticoagulation (INR less than 2.0) was not superior to aspirin alone. High-intensity oral anticoagulation (INR 3.0 to 4.0) is more effective than aspirin but increases bleeding, and aspirin plus moderate-intensity warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) is more effective than aspirin alone, is as effective as high-intensity warfarin, and has similar bleeding risk; trials have not addressed moderate-intensity warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) alone. For long-term management in patients with CAD and atrial fibrillation, options include aspirin alone, aspirin plus moderate-intensity warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0), or warfarin alone (INR 2.0 to 3.0); in those with stroke risk factors, the latter two are more effective but involve more bleeding and inconvenience, and without close INR control the combination may carry greater bleeding risk. For most patients with stable CAD, warfarin anticoagulation alone (target INR 2.0 to 3.0) should provide satisfactory antithrombotic prophylaxis against both cerebral and myocardial ischemic events.

Clinical prediction rules for bleeding while taking vitamin K antagonists (VKA) — The annual incidence of warfarin-associated major bleeding is estimated at 1% to 3%, and the performance of a rule was considered moderate if the likelihood ratio for a high score to predict major bleeding was > 5.0 and strong if it was ≥ 10.0; two variants of the same clinical prediction rule had a likelihood ratio of ~9. The independently validated mOBRI (modified Outpatient Bleeding Risk Index) includes predictors age ≥ 65 years, history of stroke, GI bleed in the past 2 weeks, and at least one of the following comorbidities: recent myocardial infarction, hematocrit level < 30%, creatinine level > 1.5 mg/dL, or diabetes mellitus; one point is given for each, with high risk defined as ≥ 3 points. For patients initiating VKA therapy, we suggest against the routine use of clinical prediction rules for bleeding as the sole criterion to withhold VKA therapy (Grade 2C).

### Outpatient management of anticoagulation therapy [^67f748c9]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The Seventh American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy provides guidelines for outpatient management of anticoagulation therapy. The ACCP guidelines recommend short-term warfarin therapy, with the goal of maintaining an International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2.5 ± 0.5, after major orthopedic surgery. Therapy for venous thromboembolism includes an INR of 2.5 ± 0.5, with the length of therapy determined by associated conditions. For patients with atrial fibrillation, the INR is maintained at 2.5 ± 0.5 indefinitely; for most patients with mechanical valves, the recommended INR is 3.0 ± 0.5 indefinitely. Use of outpatient low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is as safe and effective as inpatient unfractionated heparin for treatment of venous thromboembolism. The ACCP recommends starting warfarin with unfractionated heparin or LMWH for at least five days and continuing until a therapeutic INR is achieved. Because patients with venous thromboembolism and cancer who have been treated with LMWH have a survival advantage that extends beyond their venous thromboembolism treatment, the ACCP recommends beginning their therapy with three to six months of LMWH. When invasive procedures require the interruption of oral anticoagulation therapy, recommendations for bridge therapy are determined by balancing the risk of bleeding against the risk of thromboembolism. Patients at higher risk of thromboembolization should stop warfarin therapy four to five days before surgery and start LMWH or unfractionated heparin two to three days before surgery.

### Evidence-based adjustment of warfarin (coumadin) doses… [^c23f62c9]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical Question What is the best way to adjust oral anticoagulation for patients taking warfarin. Evidence Summary A previous Point-of-Care Guides article, 1 presented several validated approaches to the initiation of anticoagulation therapy with warfarin. Once a patient is receiving warfarin, it is important to have a systematic approach to the management of anticoagulation and adjustment of warfarin doses. In a busy clinical practice with multiple competing demands on a physician's time and attention, managing anticoagulation can too often be haphazard. Two alternatives to the management of anticoagulation in the primary care office are anticoagulation management services and patient self-monitoring; the latter uses home testing of the International Normalized Ratio.

A systematic review of the evidence as part of an evidence-based guideline found some support for AMS and PSM over usual care in terms of time spent by the patient in the therapeutic range and avoidance of bleeding complications.
2. Applying the Evidence Mrs. Leiden is taking 40 mg of warfarin per week. Her INR today is 3.
6. Looking back, her INR trend was gradually upward; her last value was 2.
9. How should you adjust her warfarin dose. According to the table at the bottom of the flow sheet, you should lower the dose 5 to 10 percent and recheck the INR in seven to 14 days. You therefore lower her dose to 37. 5 mg and have her come back in 10 days for a recheck. She returns in one week, with a therapeutic INR. Because she only has one week in range, you ask her to come back after one more week.

The next week she is in range again; because she has now been in range for two weeks, you ask her to come back in two weeks.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^f0a48c84]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Patients receiving vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy — elective surgery interruption timing — is informed by elimination half-lives and expected international normalized ratio (INR) kinetics: values are 36 to 42 hours for warfarin, 8 to 11 hours for acenocoumarol, and 96 to 104 hours for phenprocoumon; typically 5 days of interruption are needed to normalize INR, while 6 or more days may be required in selected patients, including those with an elevated INR (> 3.5). After resumption, a full anticoagulant effect (INR ≥ 2.0) occurs 4 to 8 days after VKA resumption. Routine INR measurement in the immediate pre-operative (day before) and post-operative (1–2 days after) period would not be needed, but may be warranted when the pre-operative INR is high (> 3.5).

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: optimal management of anticoagulation therapy [^7adf178e]. Blood Advances (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Clinicians confront numerous practical issues in optimizing the use of anticoagulants to treat venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians and other health care professionals in their decisions about the use of anticoagulants in the management of VTE. These guidelines assume the choice of anticoagulant has already been made.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline development process, including updating or performing systematic evidence reviews. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel agreed on 25 recommendations and 2 good practice statements to optimize management of patients receiving anticoagulants.

Conclusions

Strong recommendations included using patient self-management of international normalized ratio (INR) with home point-of-care INR monitoring for vitamin K antagonist therapy and against using periprocedural low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) bridging therapy. Conditional recommendations included basing treatment dosing of LMWH on actual body weight, not using anti-factor Xa monitoring to guide LMWH dosing, using specialized anticoagulation management services, and resuming anticoagulation after episodes of life-threatening bleeding.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy — international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring frequency is outlined for inpatient and outpatient care, with randomized and observational data on testing intervals: In hospitalized patients, INR monitoring is usually performed daily until the therapeutic range has been achieved and maintained for at least 2 consecutive days, and in outpatients starting VKA therapy, initial monitoring may be reduced to once every few days until a stable dose response has been achieved. When the INR response is stable, the frequency of testing can be reduced to intervals as long as every 4 to 6 weeks (or possibly longer in particularly stable patients). In a randomized comparison of monitoring intervals in stable mechanical valve patients, there were no differences of time in, above, or below range between 6‑week and 4‑week groups, with actual monitoring intervals of 24.9 days vs 22.5 days (P < .0003). In a retrospective cohort of > 4,000 patients with chronic AF and > 250,000 INRs, time in range increased as the interval decreased from every 5 weeks or more to every 3 weeks (41% to 45%, P < .0005), and investigators suggested that patients should be monitored at time intervals no longer than every 3 weeks; however, the strength of this recommendation is reduced by the very poor TTR reported in both arms of the study.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^dce968d7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (warfarin) reversal — Several options exist for reversal of VKAs, including administration of vitamin K, PCCs, and plasma; vitamin K can be given orally, subcutaneously, or intravenously, and slow intravenous administration (in 25 to 50 mL normal saline over 15 to 30 minutes) effects a more predictable and rapid reduction in the INR (4 to 6 hours) compared with oral (18 to 24 hours), although the administration of vitamin K does not result in immediate correction of coagulopathy and for a major bleed warranting reversal must be accompanied by a repletion strategy (if 4F-PCC is unavailable, PCCs or plasma may be used). PCCs contain purified vitamin K-dependent clotting factors; nonactivated 3-factor PCCs contain FII, FIX, and FX with negligible FVII, protein C, and S, whereas nonactivated 4F-PCCs contain FII, FVII, FIX, FX, and proteins C and S, and only 4F-PCCs are licensed for rapid VKA reversal. For VKA reversal, 4F-PCCs are dosed on the basis of INR and body weight (INR 2 to < 4 at 25 U/kg, INR 4 to 6 at 35 U/kg, and INR > 6 at 50 U/kg; max dose 5,000 units capped at 100 kg body weight), and per unit volume 4F-PCCs contain approximately 25 times (25 U/mL) the concentration of vitamin K-dependent factors as compared with plasma (1 U/mL); therefore, PCC can be given in a much smaller volume at a much faster infusion rate (8×) compared with plasma and is preferred.

Warfarin pharmacogenetics — dose prediction and adverse events: In a validation cohort of > 1,000 patients, a pharmacogenetic algorithm more accurately identified patients who required ≤ 21 mg weekly warfarin doses and those who required weekly doses of ≥ 49 mg compared with a clinical algorithm, with no difference for intermediate doses. Observational data reported that among 185 patients, 58 with at least one CYP2C9 variant had higher risk of INRs above range (hazard ratio [HR], 1.40; 95% CI, 1.03–1.90) and serious or life-threatening bleeding (HR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.15–4.86); other studies noted a trend toward increased rates of an INR > 6.0 and bleeding in heterozygotes or compound heterozygotes/homozygotes. A randomized trial found that a pharmacogenetic-based dosing strategy did not significantly reduce adverse events (34.7% vs 42.4%; OR = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.41–1.25).

Long-term INR stability during vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy — patient factors, monitoring implications, physical activity, and vitamin K intake: Two recent studies assessed very stable INR control, comparing 2,504 patients with all INR values in range for 6 months vs 3,569 with at least one value outside range, and 533 patients in range for 12 months vs 2,555 controls. Independent predictors of stability were age > 70 years and absence of chronic diseases (male gender in one study), while congestive heart failure, diabetes, and a target range for INR ≥ 3.0 were associated with instability. Patients with very stable INR levels required fewer visits and had fewer events; investigators suggested many such warfarin-treated patients could be safely managed with INR recall intervals ≥ 4 weeks, and advanced age predicted stable anticoagulation. Physical activity influences control, with reductions in anticoagulant effect correlated with sudden increases in activity and increased warfarin requirements described with daily exercise such as walking. Dietary vitamin K affects stability: controlling intake can achieve a more stable response; unstable patients had poorer intake than stable controls; vitamin K‑depleted patients show greater INR influence from small vitamin K amounts; in healthy volunteers, a daily dose of at least 150 μg was needed to alter the INR response; and in nine unstable patients, 100 μg daily increased INRs in range from 32% to 57%.

### A call to reduce the use of bridging anticoagulation [^b59711c4]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2016). Low credibility.

Because of the recent publication of several important studies, there has been a major change in how we think about perioperative management of anticoagulation. Because of these changes, existing consensus guidelines are suddenly out of date and can no longer be used as is, particularly the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians Antithrombotic Guidelines, version 9. We estimate that well over 90% of patients receiving warfarin therapy should not receive bridging anticoagulation during periprocedural interruptions of therapy, except under unusual circumstances and with appropriate justification. Accumulating evidence also suggests that bridging is not indicated among patients receiving direct-acting oral anticoagulant therapy. The large number of patients potentially affected represents an important safety concern and requires an immediate change in practice.

### Management strategies following slightly out-of-range INRs: watchful waiting vs dose changes [^4e34ba42]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

The recommendation of the ACCP guidelines was based upon 2 studies, which sought to determine whether any clinical differences exist between the implementation of watchful waiting and any dose change for slightly out-of-range INRs. A retrospective study conducted by Banet et alfound there was no appreciable difference between watchful waiting and a dose change ≤ 20% of the weekly warfarin regimen. The findings of the study were based on 231 patients, but few exclusion criteria were used. Schulman et alconducted a similar retrospective study in addition to a prospective study, which found there was little to no difference between watchful waiting and single-dose change in stable patients. In their sample of INRs (n = 364), they included multiple therapeutic INR ranges, 2 to 3 and 2.5 to 3.5, and did not include INRs with weekly dose changes. Although both studies appear to support the use of watchful waiting, there is an opportunity to validate the findings in a larger sample of patients using methods that address all possible management strategies and account for patient factors that may influence decisions.

The present study sought to determine if the ACCP guidelines are supported by data from a large, multicenter clinical registry. We aimed to see if dose changes had meaningful impact on INR control or should watchful waiting remain the preferred strategy.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^31d109c4]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative interruption and resumption of VKAs — evidence for timing — notes that no randomized trials compared a 5-day and a < 5-day preoperative interruption of warfarin. In a cohort where warfarin was stopped 5 days before surgery in 224 patients, 15 (7%) had INR > 1.5 the day before surgery, and a randomized trial of 5-day vs 1-day interruption (with 1 mg oral vitamin K for the 1-day group) reported a mean INR of 1.2 at surgery in the 5-day group. A subanalysis assessing longer vs shorter interruption (≥ 3 days vs < 3 days) found it conferred a decrease risk for major bleeding (RR = 0.29; 95% CI: 0.15–0.55) without affecting ATE risk (RR = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.19–1.3). Observational and uncontrolled studies support a longer (≥ 5-day) interruption with low rates of major bleeding (approximately 2%) and ATE (< 0.5%).

### Management of anticoagulant-related intracranial hemorrhage: an evidence-based review [^4af4d410]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Reversal of anticoagulation

Most authorities consider rapid and adequate reversal of anticoagulation as the cornerstone of therapy in AICH, despite the lack of evidence showing that correction of coagulopathy reduces the incidence of hematoma growth or improves outcome. In certain situations, however – such as the presence of a mechanical valve, INR < 3, small hemorrhage, or no surgical intervention needed – some authorities advocate holding warfarin without actively reversing coagulopathy. Antidotes specific to each anticoagulant are presented in Table 1. Although warfarin remains the most commonly used oral anticoagulant, newer agents are gaining popularity. The exact mechanism of the occurrence of WRICH remains speculative, but potentially involves a local vasculopathy and/or systemic factors (for example, higher prevalence of the apolipoprotein E ϵ2 allele in patients with WRICH). Preventative measures to mitigate WRICH could therefore be relatively inefficient, and the onus is on rapid coagulopathy reversal. The same probably holds true for AICH related to newer anticoagulants. Hence, the first step in any AICH is to discontinue the offending drug, administer an antidote (if available) and monitor adequate reversal of anticoagulation. In the case of warfarin, theoretically adequate hemostasis is restored at an INR of ~1.5 since adequate quantities of the factors needed for ex vivo coagulation are restored. However, an optimal INR value is unknown. Unfortunately, parameters for adequate reversal with newer anticoagulants are yet to be defined. Despite concern among physicians for reversing anticoagulation in a prothrombotic state, available evidence with WRICH, albeit meager, supports correcting the coagulopathy in such cases.

Vitamin K

Vitamin K 5 to 10 mg intravenously by slow infusion over 30 minutes is administered to all patients with WRICH. Anaphylactic reactions are uncommon, and are mitigated by a slow infusion rate. The subcutaneous route for the administration of vitamin K is less effective because of erratic absorption, and the enteral route provides slow absorption although it has an equivalent bioavailability to the intravenous route. The action of vitamin K is slow; it takes 6 to 24 hours to replenish adequate concentrations of factors II, VII, IX and X and to restore hemostasis. This warrants the administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and/or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) to rapidly replenish deficient factors. One should note that these agents have a short half-life, and are practically used as bridging therapy until vitamin K becomes effective.

### Optimal loading dose of warfarin for the initiation of oral anticoagulation [^36022556]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Warfarin is used as an oral anticoagulant. However, there is wide variation in patient response to warfarin dose. This variation, as well as the necessity of keeping within a narrow therapeutic range, means that selection of the correct warfarin dose at the outset of treatment is not straightforward.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of different initiation doses of warfarin in terms of time in-range, time to INR in-range and effect on serious adverse events.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, DARE and the NHS Health economics database on The Cochrane Library (2012, Issue 4); MEDLINE (1950 to April 2012) and EMBASE (1974 to April 2012).

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials which compared different initiation regimens of warfarin.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. Authors also assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies.

Main Results

We identified 12 studies of patients commencing warfarin for inclusion in the review. The overall risk of bias was found to be variable, with most studies reporting adequate methods for randomisation but only two studies reporting adequate data on allocation concealment. Four studies (355 patients) compared 5 mg versus 10 mg loading doses. All four studies reported INR in-range by day five. Although there was notable heterogeneity, pooling of these four studies showed no overall difference between 5 mg versus 10 mg loading doses (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.77, P = 0.46, I(2) = 83%). Two of these studies used two consecutive INRs in-range as the outcome and showed no difference between a 5 mg and 10 mg dose by day five (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.19, P = 0.37, I(2) = 22%); two other studies used a single INR in-range as the outcome and showed a benefit for the 10 mg initiation dose by day 5 (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.21, P = 0.05, I(2) = 72%). Two studies compared a 5 mg dose to other doses: a 2.5 mg initiation dose took longer to achieve the therapeutic range (2.7 versus 2.0 days; P < 0.0001), but those receiving a calculated initiation dose achieved a target range quicker (4.2 days versus 5 days, P = 0.007). Two studies compared age adjusted doses to 10 mg initiation doses. More elderly patients receiving an age adjusted dose achieved a stable INR compared to those receiving a 10 mg initial dose (and Fennerty regimen). Four studies used genotype guided dosing in one arm of each trial. Three studies reported no overall differences; the fourth study, which reported that the genotype group spent significantly more time in-range (P < 0.001), had a control group whose INRs were significantly lower than expected. No clear impacts from adverse events were found in either arm to make an overall conclusion.

Authors' Conclusions

The studies in this review compared loading doses in several different situations. There is still considerable uncertainty between the use of a 5 mg and a 10 mg loading dose for the initiation of warfarin. In the elderly, there is some evidence that lower initiation doses or age adjusted doses are more appropriate, leading to fewer high INRs. However, there is insufficient evidence to warrant genotype guided initiation.

Anticoagulant Transitioning

As with any high‐risk medication such as anticoagulants, clinical situations may arise that require transitioning to or off of DOAC therapy. Two common transition scenarios include (1) switching between anticoagulants and (2) periprocedural management.

Switching Between Anticoagulants

It is not uncommon to require transition from one anticoagulant to another because of either cost, comorbid conditions, patient preference, hospitalization, thrombotic complications, bleeding complications, or procedures. Five scenarios exist that comprise DOAC therapy switching from/to another anticoagulant:
VKA to DOAC
DOAC to VKA
DOAC to DOAC
DOAC to parenteral anticoagulant
Parenteral anticoagulant to DOAC

For all scenarios, assessment of each drug's pharmacokinetic profile (ie, half‐life), pharmacodynamics profile (INR for VKA or activated partial thromboplastin time for unfractionated heparin, etc), as well as patients' renal function, must be taken into account. The ultimate goal is to limit interruption of the therapeutic anticoagulation during the transition to minimize the risk of atherothrombosis. In certain cases, this requires overlap of the 2 anticoagulants. See Table 6. 92

Table 6
Algorithm for Switching Between Anticoagulants

Transitioning between VKA and DOAC and vice versa requires additional explanation that takes into account the INR measurement. When transitioning from a VKA to a DOAC, the half‐life of the VKA compound is imperative to guide therapy. Since warfarin is the principle VKA utilized in the United States, with a half‐life of ≈36 to 48 hours, it is advisable to stop warfarin and check INR at least 3 days later. DOACs can be initiated once the INR is ≤ 2; see Table 7 for management strategies based on INR values. 38 When converting from a DOAC to a VKA, providers should administer DOACs concomitantly with VKAs because of the VKAs' known slow onset of action (≈5–10 days). 38 An INR should be rechecked between days 3 and 5 of warfarin therapy. INRs should be checked just before the dose of the DOAC because of their ability to elevate INR values. The INRs should be monitored frequently for at least the first month until INR stability has been achieved (ie, ≥ 3 consecutive INR readings at goal).

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) initiation — parenteral overlap and discontinuation: When rapid anticoagulant effect is required, a rapidly acting parenteral anticoagulant should be started together with the VKA and discontinued after at least 5 days of concomitant therapy and once the INR has been in the therapeutic range for at least two measurements approximately 24 h apart. If there is no urgent need for an immediate anticoagulant effect, warfarin administration can be commenced without the concurrent use of a rapid-acting anticoagulant.

### Perioperative management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients undergoing interventional techniques: 2024 updated guidelines from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^6a8aa76a]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

ASIPP 2024 — Warfarin and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) perioperative management for interventional procedures states warfarin is continued for minimal bleed risk, whereas for low to moderate and high bleed risk it is stopped for 5 days; other guidance recommends it be stopped for 3–5 days, and individualized care may achieve an appropriate INR below 1.5 after stopping for 2 days. Warfarin can be resumed on the evening of procedure (D0) or the day after procedure (D1) at the patient's usual maintenance dose. "Bridging suggested for high thrombotic risk populations with full-dose, subcutaneous LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg bid or 1.5 mg/kg daily or dalteparin, 100 IU/kg bid or 200 IU/kg daily), with the last dose given the AM of the day prior to the procedure (i.e. D-1) at half the total daily dose". Low-dose LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin, 40 mg daily or dalteparin 5,000 IU daily) can be used for VTE prophylaxis for first 24–72 hours post-procedure, with full dose LMWH resumed 2–3 days post-procedure. Initiation of low molecular heparin therapy has been questioned and is no longer a recommendation as it increases the risk.

### The risk of hemorrhage among patients with warfarin-associated coagulopathy [^d6b74542]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Among warfarin-treated patients with international normalized ratio (INR) > 5, we sought to determine the risk of major bleeding within 30 days.

Background

For warfarin-treated patients, the risk of bleeding increases as the INR rises, particularly if the INR exceeds 4. The 30-day risk of hemorrhage among outpatients with excessively prolonged INR values is unknown.

Methods

To assess anticoagulation care in the U.S., a cohort of 6,761 patients taking warfarin was prospectively assembled from 101 participating sites (43% were community-based cardiology practices). From this cohort, 1,104 patients were identified with a first episode of INR > 5.

Results

A total of 979 met eligibility criteria; complete follow-up information was available for 976 (99.7%). Ninety-six percent (n = 937) of patients had an INR value between 5 and 9; 80% of INR values were < 7. Thirteen patients (1.3%) experienced major hemorrhage during the 30-day follow-up period; among patients whose INR was > 5 and < 9, 0.96% experienced major hemorrhage. None of the bleeding events was fatal. Intervention with vitamin K was uncommon (8.7%). Warfarin doses were withheld for the majority of patients. Fifty percent of patients who were managed conservatively and retested on day 4 or 5 had an INR of 2.0 or less.

Conclusions

For warfarin-treated outpatients presenting with an INR > 5 and < 9, the 30-day risk of major bleeding is low (0.96%). Intervention with vitamin K among asymptomatic patients presenting with an INR < 9 is not routine practice in the U.S.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^f19b2487]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Reversal of OACs

The effects of warfarin on coagulation extend over the drug's half-life of several days; hence, simply stopping warfarin will not rapidly reverse the anticoagulated state. Emergency management of patients treated with warfarin is discussed in depth in many clinical guidelines that advise on interventions according to INR status, the need for invasive procedures and bleeding risk or severity; these are reviewed in table 3. Vitamin K 1 (phytonadione), administered orally or intravenously, can be used to accelerate warfarin reversal to some extent by counteracting its effects on vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor synthesis. The effect of vitamin K 1 on reversal of VKA-based anticoagulation is not immediate but will progress over 18–24 h or more as the liver synthesises sufficient quantities of vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins (factors II, VII, IX and X) to re-establish effective clotting, a process that takes even longer in the presence of liver disease or other metabolic or nutritional problems.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^e8fb5a64]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — warfarin selection, INR targets, and interaction-related bleeding risk: Warfarin remains the preferred agent in patients with AF receiving CYP3A4/glycoprotein– inducing agents, or moderate-severe mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valve, and the optimal INR control, with a therapeutic INR goal of 2 to 3, needs to be achieved through drug–drug interaction management, vitamin K dietary education, and routine INR monitoring. Time in therapeutic INR range showed negative correlation with risks of thromboembolism (R, −0.59; P = 0.01) and major bleeding (R, −0.59; P = 0.002); a weekly vitamin K dietary modification achieved a therapeutic INR more frequently than a conventional group (74 versus 58%; P = 0.04) at 90 days; and concomitant use of APT (OR, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.56–1.94]), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.29–2.59]), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (OR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.42–1.85]), or antimicrobial agents (OR, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.45–1.83]) was significantly associated with higher risks of clinically relevant bleeding.

Significance of nontherapeutic INRs — causes and clinical risk — includes that fluctuations may result from inaccuracy in testing, vitamin K intake or absorption/metabolism changes, other drug effects, or noncompliance, and that adverse event rates rise sharply as INR moves outside target range; in a retrospective analysis of 3,000 atrial fibrillation patients, the poorest control group (48% of time in range) had twice the rates of stroke, myocardial infarction, major bleeding, and death compared with the best control group (83% of time in range); although excessively elevated INRs, particularly > 5.0, increase bleeding risk, registry data suggest short-term major bleeding risk is low for a single INR between 5.0 and 9.0, and in a matched cohort of 2,597 warfarin patients a single significant supratherapeutic INR had low 3 months thromboembolism risk (0.4%), with similar rates reported in 294 mechanical heart valve patients.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) reversal by interruption — expected INR decline: Interruption of VKAs may be sufficient in patients who need an elective invasive procedure or in asymptomatic patients with an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) and a low risk for bleeding, and it takes approximately 2.5 days for an INR between 6.0 and 10.0 to decline to < 4.0; with acenocoumarol, the decline is probably no more than 1 day for most patients, phenprocoumon will probably result in a much slower decline, and fluindione is similar to warfarin so a similar decline should be expected.

### Low-dose oral vitamin K is safe and effective for outpatient management of patients with an INR > 10 [^c02d2330]. Thrombosis Research (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Low-dose oral vitamin K effectively returns an international normalized ratio (INR) between 4.5 and 10.0 to an INR of 2.0–3.0 within 24 h in about 70% of patients. However, the efficacy of oral vitamin K for the treatment of higher INR values has only been studied in one small randomized trial. Treatment of markedly prolonged INR values with low-dose oral vitamin K is attractive because it has the potential to greatly simplify the management of such patients.

Methods

In our tertiary care anticoagulation clinic patients with an INR of more than 10 were managed as outpatients with simple warfarin withdrawal and, where feasible, low-dose (2 mg) oral vitamin K. Only patients with additional complications such as bleeding or unexplained symptoms were admitted to hospital.

Results

Eighty-five patients had 89 episodes of an INR value of more than 10.0. Fourteen patients were admitted to the hospital for management. In the other 75 episodes patients were managed as outpatients by warfarin withdrawal. In 24 episodes patients did not receive vitamin K. In 51 episodes patients were also given oral vitamin K. None of the patients given oral vitamin K experienced bleeding requiring medical intervention (95% confidence interval (CI) 0–6%). In contrast there were three clinically important bleeding episodes amongst the patients managed with simple warfarin withdrawal (95% CI 0–34%). Patients given vitamin K were also more likely to have an INR < 5 by day 3 than those managed by withdrawal of warfarin alone. Two patients admitted to hospital and given intravenous vitamin K at higher doses became temporarily refractory to anticoagulation while there were no such complications in those treated with low-dose oral vitamin K.

Conclusion

Low-dose (2 mg) oral vitamin K, coupled with temporary warfarin discontinuation, appears to be a safe and effective treatment for severe warfarin associated coagulopathy in non-bleeding patients.

### Recommendations for management of clinically significant drug-drug interactions with statins and select agents used in patients with cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^8542dfe2]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Warfarin–statin interactions — effects on anticoagulation have been observed, including reports indicating up to a 30% change in INR and a report showing a doubling of the number of subjects with supratherapeutic INRs, and an analysis of > 1100 patients indicated that simvastatin was associated with a 29% reduced warfarin requirement in CYP2C9✱3 carriers; overall, there is no clinically significant increase in statin exposure with coadministration of warfarin, and combination therapy is useful when clinically indicated. Recommendations for Statin–Warfarin DDIs are: use of a statin with warfarin as combination therapy is useful when clinically indicated, and the INR should be monitored more closely after the initiation of a statin or a change in statin dose; the impact on the INR appears lowest for pitavastatin and atorvastatin.

### Massive warfarin overdose management in an adolescent patient [^1e8b9d3c]. Clinical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Warfarin is a widely used oral anticoagulant with established reversal guidelines in the setting of a supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR). Limited literature exists on managing acute warfarin overdoses in patients who are not chronically anticoagulated.

Case

A 15-year-old male, with no indication for anticoagulation, presented to a pediatric emergency department after an acute 1,000mg warfarin ingestion. He had no significant complaints upon presentation aside from a mild intermittent headache. His past medical history was significant for anxiety, depression, Tourette syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and polysubstance misuse. Computed tomography of his head was unremarkable and serum acetaminophen, salicylate, and ethanol concentrations were negative. Approximately 16h post-ingestion, his INR was 1.9 with an increase to 3.3 by 26h. The regional poison center was consulted and recommended, consistent with the CHEST guidelines, holding treatment with vitamin K until INR was > 10 or if signs or symptoms of bleeding occurred. The patient was admitted for monitoring and by hospital day (HD) #4, his INR had risen to > 11.8 at which point oral vitamin K 10mg was administered. On HD #7, the patient was deemed stable for transfer to inpatient psychiatry after repeat INRs of 2.9 and 3.4.

Discussion

Case reports have demonstrated early administration of vitamin K can temporarily lower INR and prevent detection of rebound. The CHEST warfarin reversal guidelines describe the risks and benefits with respect to bleeding and thrombosis in the non-intentional overdose patient. Application and extrapolation of these guidelines to acute overdose in patients who lack an indication for anticoagulation may or may not be warranted.

Conclusion

While established clinical guidance exists on reversing a supratherapeutic INR in patients chronically anticoagulated with warfarin, the risks and benefits of extrapolating this approach are unclear in those who lack an indication for anticoagulation.

Venous thromboembolism treatment — standard practice and RE-COVER trial methods indicate anticoagulation is started with a heparin together with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), overlapping for at least 5 days and stopping heparin only after the INR exceeds 2.0 for ≥ 2 consecutive days; in RE-COVER, dabigatran etexilate was noninferior to warfarin after at least 5 days of approved parenteral anticoagulant, randomization was substratified by symptomatic PE (31% of the total), masking used coded POC INR with patients receiving dabigatran etexilate 150 mg bid once INR exceeded 2.0 for 2 consecutive days, the median parenteral duration before dabigatran was 9 days, and warfarin-treated patients had INR 2.0 to 3.0 for 60% of study time.

The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for prosthetic heart valves, more specifically with respect to management of thromboembolism, ACC/AHA 2021 guidelines recommend to consider increasing the INR goal from 3.0 (range, 2.5–3.5) to 4.0 (range, 3.5–4.0) or adding daily low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg), with an assessment of bleeding risk, in patients with a mechanical mitral valve replacement experiencing a stroke or systemic embolic event while in therapeutic range on VKA anticoagulation.

Bioprosthetic valve surgery — perioperative antithrombotic therapy is described as follows: In patients undergoing bioprosthetic mitral or aortic valve replacement, warfarin anticoagulation to a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5 (range, 2.0–3.0) "is reasonable for at least 3 months and for as long as 6 months after surgery in patients at low risk of bleeding", after which "long-term therapy with only aspirin 75 to 100 mg daily is recommended". Patients with prior ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) on antiplatelet therapy and without an anticoagulation indication "should continue to be managed with antiplatelet therapy alone after the bioprosthetic valve insertion".

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) discontinuation — abrupt cessation has theoretical and observed effects: There is a theoretical concern that abrupt VKA discontinuation may result in a temporary hypercoagulable state due to an imbalance in the rates of normalization of activity of the coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X and the natural inhibitors protein C and protein S. Five small controlled trials (total n = 217) have addressed this issue; in four, primary outcomes were laboratory results suggestive of a hypercoagulable state and produced inconsistent results. Elevations tended to persist for 8 to 9 weeks regardless of discontinuation strategy, suggesting an unmasked prothrombotic state rather than a rebound phenomenon, and the thromboembolism event rate appeared similar between groups across the five studies.

ACC/AHA valvular heart disease — post-embolism evaluation in mechanical and bioprosthetic valves highlights prioritizing international normalized ratio (INR) review and individualized antithrombotic decisions. There are no comparative-effectiveness trials assessing higher-intensity vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy versus standard VKA therapy plus low-dose aspirin in mechanical valve recipients with stroke or systemic embolism while in target INR range, and excluding extended time in a subtherapeutic INR range is the first priority. Management includes reviewing INR levels to ensure the patient is in the target INR range most of the time, recognizing that subtherapeutic INR may reflect suboptimal medication adherence, intercurrent illness, new or recently adjusted medications, dietary changes, or alcohol intake. Whether to intensify VKA therapy or add low-dose aspirin is a patient-specific, shared decision-making proposition that must weigh several factors, including bleeding risk. In bioprosthetic valve patients with stroke or embolic events, further imaging with TEE or 3D CT may show leaflet thrombosis, which should respond to anticoagulation with either a VKA or a NOAC; if leaflet thrombosis is not established, the effectiveness of anticoagulation is uncertain and patients should undergo a full neurological evaluation to rule out other causes. Shared decision-making that accounts for bleeding risk is emphasized.

### Impact of global geographic region on time in therapeutic range on warfarin anticoagulant therapy: data from the ROCKET AF clinical trial [^212f3853]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Methods

The design, conduct, and main results of the ROCKET AF trial have been presented previously. – In brief, rivaroxaban (20 mg daily; 15 mg daily in patients with creatinine clearance of 30 to 49 mL/min) was compared with adjusted‐dose warfarin (INR point target of 2.5, INR range 2.0 to 3.0) for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism. Patients with electrocardiographically documented nonvalvular atrial fibrillation at moderate to high risk of stroke were recruited at 1178 participating sites in 45 countries. Elevated risk was indicated by a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or systemic embolism or ≥ 2 of the following: heart failure or left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 35%, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, or diabetes mellitus (CHADS 2 score ≥ 2). The proportion of patients without prior ischemic stroke, TIA, or systemic embolism and ≤ 2 risk factors was limited to 10% of the cohort by region; the remainder required either prior thromboembolism or ≥ 3 risk factors. Investigators were chosen on the basis of performance in clinical trials and access to large clinical practices that included patients with atrial fibrillation. We do not have comprehensive information on recruiting physicians' specialty status. Warfarin dosing was managed by local physicians based on INR values generated by a standard point‐of‐care device (HemoSense, San Jose, CA). While physicians were reminded about the INR target of the trial and the need for monthly INR tests even when patients' anticoagulation status was stable, the study did not provide specific treatment algorithms for anticoagulation management. Patients with < 6 weeks of exposure to vitamin K antagonist (VKA) medication immediately before entry into the trial were considered VKA naïve.
