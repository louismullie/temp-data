## Question

What can use of marijuana do to the GI system

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what marijuana (cannabis) can do to the gastrointestinal (GI) system. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pharmacology and receptor distribution in the gut. Then, I should verify the major clinical effects across motility, nausea/vomiting, inflammation, and pain. Next, I will examine disease-specific data for IBD, gastroparesis, and CHS. After that, I need to check safety, adverse effects, and drug interactions. Finally, I will integrate guideline positions and formulate a balanced, clinically actionable conclusion with caveats and research gaps.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic foundation. Cannabis exerts GI effects primarily via the endocannabinoid system (ECS), with CB1 receptors abundant in the enteric nervous system and CB2 receptors prominent on immune cells; both are upregulated in inflammation, which provides a plausible basis for both therapeutic and adverse effects in the gut [^2c812a0b] [^a9107764] [^5cd58241]. Wait, let me verify the receptor localization details: CB1 is indeed enriched in myenteric and submucosal plexuses regulating motility and secretion, while CB2 is more prominent in lamina propria immune cells, aligning with observed immunomodulatory effects [^5cd58241] [^770fb2af].

> I will now examine motility effects, because this is where clinical trade-offs often arise. Cannabinoids generally inhibit GI motility via CB1-mediated suppression of excitatory neurotransmission, which can delay gastric emptying and slow colonic transit; this is well documented with dronabinol and observed clinically in chronic users [^1e46d70b] [^9245f48f]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: while this anti-motility effect can theoretically worsen gastroparesis, a small randomized trial of pharmaceutical-grade CBD in idiopathic and diabetic gastroparesis showed improvements in vomiting, early satiety, and abdominal pain, suggesting symptom benefit despite slowed emptying in some contexts, though the certainty is low and replication is needed [^0ffc09ad] [^16eeb2db]. I should double-check guideline positions: the AGA suggests against routine CBD use for gastroparesis outside trials due to low certainty and potential CHS risk with THC-containing products, which tempers enthusiasm pending larger studies [^f3ea8352].

> Next, I should review nausea and vomiting, where the biphasic effect is most clinically salient. Acute cannabinoid exposure can suppress emesis via CB1 and possibly 5-HT3 interactions, which underpins FDA-approved synthetic THC (dronabinol, nabilone) for refractory chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, though modern antiemetics often outperform cannabinoids and adverse effects are common [^a6b7649d] [^d1f2d858]. But wait, what if use is chronic or high potency? Chronic, heavy cannabis use is linked to cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), characterized by cyclic vomiting, abdominal pain, and compulsive hot bathing; prevalence is rising with legalization and potency increases, and symptoms typically resolve with cessation, reinforcing the need to screen for cannabis use in refractory emesis [^9290a946] [^38ff63d4]. I need to ensure I distinguish CHS from cyclic vomiting syndrome; overlap exists, but CHS requires resolution with abstinence and a compatible use pattern, which guides management and counseling [^9290a946].

> Let me consider inflammatory bowel disease, where expectations often exceed evidence. Patients frequently report symptom improvements in pain, diarrhea, and appetite, and small studies and meta-analyses suggest quality-of-life gains, but objective reductions in inflammatory biomarkers or endoscopic healing have not been demonstrated consistently, and some observational data associate cannabis use with worse outcomes or higher surgery risk, so disease modification remains unproven [^a6a5d01a] [^448f2c22] [^ef772abb]. Hold on, I should verify trial quality: most human data are small, heterogeneous, and at high risk of bias; Cochrane reviews in both Crohn's and ulcerative colitis conclude uncertainty about efficacy and emphasize the need for larger, rigorously controlled trials with standardized formulations and objective endpoints [^05e5f21f] [^6ec0077b]. Guidelines from the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology and the AGA advise against replacing standard IBD therapies with cannabis, though adjunctive symptom control may be considered in select cases after discussing risks and legal issues [^499c9267] [^f12866ba].

> I should confirm pain and visceral hypersensitivity effects, especially in disorders of gut–brain interaction. Preclinical and early clinical signals suggest cannabinoids can modulate visceral pain via CB1/CB2 and related pathways, and a small randomized trial of a CB2-preferring agent reduced abdominal pain in IBD, while observational data in fibromyalgia with DGBIs show GI symptom improvements with medical cannabis, though confounding and lack of controls limit inference [^0ffc09ad] [^c9adfd0d]. Let me reconsider the strength of evidence: high-quality, definitive RCTs in IBS are sparse, so cannabinoids remain investigational for visceral pain pending larger, placebo-controlled studies and clarification of optimal formulations and dosing [^1dbc8ee2].

> Now, I need to check safety, adverse effects, and drug–drug interactions. Common GI adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and dry mouth, with pooled analyses showing roughly a twofold increase in GI adverse events versus placebo; psychiatric and neurologic effects are also more frequent, particularly with THC-predominant products, and discontinuations due to adverse effects are not rare [^229ee651]. I should confirm hepatic considerations: chronic CBD use has been associated with transaminase elevations and rare liver injury, and THC can impair cognition and psychomotor function, so patients should be counseled on driving and occupational risks and potential interactions with sedatives, opioids, and CYP-metabolized drugs [^387814d4] [^16eeb2db]. But wait, what about perioperative risk? Cannabis use is associated with delayed gastric emptying and higher postoperative nausea and vomiting risk, which has anesthesia and aspiration implications that require preoperative planning and counseling [^9245f48f].

> Next, I should review special populations and formulations. In pediatrics, cannabinoids are discouraged for abdominal pain–predominant DGBIs due to lack of efficacy data and potential neurodevelopmental harm, so clinicians should prioritize established therapies and avoid off-label cannabinoid use in children [^8154ed25]. For adults, product variability is a major issue: over-the-counter CBD oils often contain variable or undeclared THC, complicating risk–benefit assessment and increasing CHS risk; when considered, pharmaceutical-grade products and clear monitoring plans are prudent, and patients should be screened for psychiatric comorbidity and substance use disorder risk [^f3ea8352] [^387814d4]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines align with this caution: the AGA's conditional recommendation against routine CBD in gastroparesis and the emphasis on standardized formulations reflect these concerns [^f3ea8352].

> I will now examine synthetic cannabinoids briefly, because ED clinicians often encounter them. Synthetic cannabinoids can cause severe GI manifestations including intractable vomiting, ischemic-type abdominal pain, and even intestinal perforation; mechanisms likely involve potent CB1/CB2 agonism plus vascular effects, and management is supportive with hydration, antiemetics, and observation for complications [^89f2e617] [^905e4342]. I should double-check that these reports are distinct from phytocannabinoid CHS: yes, synthetic cannabinoid toxicity is a separate, often more severe entity with unpredictable potencies and adulterants, warranting high suspicion in unexplained severe GI presentations [^89f2e617].

> Let me synthesize a balanced, clinically actionable answer. Cannabis can modulate GI function via the ECS, producing antiemetic, anti-motility, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects that may benefit selected patients with chemotherapy-related nausea, refractory diarrhea, visceral pain, or symptom-predominant IBD, but these potential benefits must be weighed against meaningful risks including CHS, delayed gastric emptying, hepatic injury, psychiatric effects, and drug interactions, and evidence for disease modification in IBD is lacking [^2c812a0b] [^0ffc09ad] [^a6a5d01a]. I need to ensure the bottom line is clear: cannabinoids should not replace standard, evidence-based therapies for GI diseases; if considered, use should be individualized, supervised, and coordinated with ongoing care, with explicit counseling on risks, legal constraints, and the need for cessation if CHS is suspected [^499c9267] [^f12866ba] [^9290a946].

Marijuana has **complex effects** on the gastrointestinal system, mediated by the endocannabinoid system [^2c812a0b]. It can **reduce gastric motility** and delay gastric emptying [^1e46d70b], which may relieve diarrhea but worsen gastroparesis [^16eeb2db]. Chronic use is linked to **cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome** — cyclic vomiting and abdominal pain that resolve with cessation [^9290a946] [^38ff63d4]. Marijuana may reduce intestinal inflammation and pain in IBD [^a9107764], but high-quality evidence for disease modification is limited [^448f2c22]; it does not replace standard therapy [^499c9267]. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, and altered gut microbiota [^229ee651]; **risks rise with heavy or prolonged use** [^38ff63d4].

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms in the GI tract

Marijuana exerts its effects through the **endocannabinoid system (ECS)** [^2c812a0b], which includes CB1 and CB2 receptors, endogenous ligands (anandamide, 2-AG), and enzymes (FAAH, MAGL) [^5cd58241]. CB1 is abundant in the enteric nervous system and regulates motility, secretion, and visceral sensation; CB2 is mainly on immune cells and modulates inflammation [^5cd58241] [^770fb2af].

- **CB1 activation**: Reduces gastric motility, delays emptying, and decreases intestinal transit [^1e46d70b] [^9245f48f].
- **CB2 activation**: Reduces inflammation and modulates immune responses [^a9107764] [^770fb2af].
- **Endocannabinoid enzymes**: FAAH and MAGL degrade endocannabinoids; inhibiting them can enhance anti-inflammatory effects [^879e9a1e] [^fb12c3e3].

---

## Effects on gastrointestinal motility

Marijuana **slows GI motility** via CB1-mediated inhibition of acetylcholine release, reducing gastric emptying and intestinal transit [^1e46d70b] [^9245f48f]. This can help diarrhea-predominant IBS [^notfound] but may worsen gastroparesis or opioid-induced constipation [^16eeb2db].

| **Condition** | **Effect of marijuana** | **Clinical implication** |
|-|-|-|
| Diarrhea-predominant IBS | Slows transit, reduces frequency | Potential benefit |
| Gastroparesis | Delays gastric emptying | May worsen symptoms |
| Opioid-induced constipation | Slows transit | May exacerbate symptoms |

---

## Effects on gastrointestinal secretion

Marijuana **reduces gastric acid secretion** via CB1, which may benefit acid-related disorders [^f12866ba]. It also alters intestinal secretion, though evidence is limited and effects vary by dose and formulation [^notfound].

---

## Effects on gastrointestinal inflammation

Preclinical and limited clinical data suggest cannabinoids have **anti-inflammatory effects** in IBD via CB2 and cytokine modulation [^a9107764] [^770fb2af]. However, randomized trials have not shown clear reductions in inflammatory biomarkers or endoscopic healing, so marijuana should not replace standard IBD therapy [^448f2c22] [^499c9267].

---

## Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS)

Chronic, heavy marijuana use can cause **CHS** — cyclic vomiting, abdominal pain, and compulsive hot showers — which resolves with cessation [^9290a946] [^38ff63d4]. The pathophysiology likely involves CB1 downregulation and TRPV1 dysregulation [^40ab54f0] [^f4b2d005].

---

## Effects on appetite and metabolism

Marijuana increases appetite and caloric intake via CB1 in the hypothalamus and gut, aiding cachexia or anorexia [^752756fb] [^91a7b653]. Chronic use, however, may alter metabolism and the gut microbiome, with long-term consequences that remain unclear [^2f8a3b5f].

---

## Clinical implications and therapeutic potential

- **Symptom control**: May help diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nausea in IBD or IBS, but evidence quality varies [^a6a5d01a] [^1dbc8ee2].
- **IBD**: Not a disease-modifying therapy; use only as adjunct to standard care [^499c9267] [^f12866ba].
- **Gastroparesis**: CBD may reduce symptoms in small studies, but larger trials are needed; routine use is not recommended [^16eeb2db] [^f3ea8352].
- **CHS**: Requires cessation and supportive care; recurrence is common if use resumes [^9290a946] [^38ff63d4].

---

## Risks and adverse effects

- **GI effects**: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and altered motility [^229ee651] [^9245f48f].
- **Psychiatric effects**: Anxiety, depression, psychosis, especially with high-THC products [^387814d4] [^6bc093d9].
- **Drug interactions**: CYP inhibition and additive sedation with opioids or benzodiazepines [^387814d4].
- **Long-term risks**: Unknown; potential liver injury and microbiome changes with chronic use [^16eeb2db] [^2f8a3b5f].

---

## Conclusion

Marijuana has **bidirectional GI effects**: it can slow motility, reduce acid, and modulate inflammation, offering symptomatic benefit in some conditions, but it can also cause CHS and worsen motility disorders. It is not disease-modifying in IBD and should be used cautiously, with counseling on risks, interactions, and the need for high-quality evidence.

Key points
- Cannabis can make the heart beat faster and can raise blood pressure immediately after use.
- More research is needed to understand the full impact of cannabis use on the cardiovascular system to determine if cannabis use leads to higher risk of death. Cannabis use and heart health Cannabis can make the heart beat faster and can raise blood pressure immediately after use. It could also increase risk of stroke, heart disease, and other vascular diseases. Most of the scientific studies linking cannabis to heart attacks and strokes are based on reports from people who smoked cannabis. Cannabis smoke contains many of the same substances researchers have found in tobacco smoke, which are harmful to the lungs and cardiovascular system.

It is hard to separate the effects of cannabis chemicals like tetrahydrocannabinol and other cannabinoids on the cardiovascular system from those caused by the irritants and other chemicals present in the smoke. More research is needed to understand the full impact of cannabis use on the cardiovascular system to determine if cannabis use leads to higher risk of death.

### Medical marijuana for digestive disorders: high time to prescribe? [^f357b206]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The use of recreational and medical marijuana is increasingly accepted by the general public in the United States. Along with growing interest in marijuana use has come an understanding of marijuana's effects on normal physiology and disease, primarily through elucidation of the human endocannabinoid system. Scientific inquiry into this system has indicated potential roles for marijuana in the modulation of gastrointestinal symptoms and disease. Some patients with gastrointestinal disorders already turn to marijuana for symptomatic relief, often without a clear understanding of the risks and benefits of marijuana for their condition. Unfortunately, that lack of understanding is shared by health-care providers. Marijuana's federal legal status as a Schedule I controlled substance has limited clinical investigation of its effects. There are also potential legal ramifications for physicians who provide recommendations for marijuana for their patients. Despite these constraints, as an increasing number of patients consider marijuana as a potential therapy for their digestive disorders, health-care providers will be asked to discuss the issues surrounding medical marijuana with their patients.

### Role of cannabis and its derivatives in gastrointestinal and hepatic disease [^2c812a0b]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Medical and recreational cannabis use has increased dramatically over the last decade, resulting from mainstream cultural acceptance and legalization in several countries worldwide. Cannabis and its derivatives affect many gastrointestinal processes via the endocannabinoid system (ECS). The ECS influences gastrointestinal homeostasis through anti-inflammatory, anti-nociceptive, and anti-secretory effects. Some gastrointestinal disorders might therefore be treated with cannabinoids. Despite numerous studies in cell lines and animals, few human studies have evaluated the therapeutic effects of cannabinoids. Cannabis' schedule 1 drug status has limited its availability in research; cannabis has been legalized only recently, in some states, for medicinal and/or recreational use. Cannabinoids can alleviate chemotherapy-induced nausea and emesis and chronic pain. Studies have demonstrated the important roles of the ECS in metabolism, obesity, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and the anti-inflammatory effects of cannabis have been investigated in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. Despite its potential benefits, undesired or even detrimental effects of cannabis can limit its use. Side effects such as cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome affect some users. We review the ECS and the effects of cannabis and its derivatives on gastrointestinal and hepatic function in health and disease.

### Cannabinoids: a guide for use in the world of gastrointestinal disease [^2f2777fc]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Cannabinoids have been known as the primary component of cannabis for decades, but the characterization of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in the 1990s opened the doors for cannabis' use in modern medicine. The 2 main receptors of this system, cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2, are found on cells of various tissues, with significant expression in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The characterization of the ECS also heralded the understanding of endocannabinoids, naturally occurring compounds synthesized in the human body. Via secondary signaling pathways acting on vagal nerves, nociceptors, and immune cells, cannabinoids have been shown to have both palliative and detrimental effects on the pathophysiology of GI disorders. Although research on the effects of both endogenous and exogenous cannabinoids has been slow due to the complicated legal history of cannabis, discoveries of cannabinoids' treatment potential have been found in various fields of medicine, including the GI world. Medical cannabis has since been offered as a treatment for a myriad of conditions and malignancies, including cancer, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, nausea, posttraumatic stress disorder, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cachexia, glaucoma, and epilepsy. This article hopes to create an overview of current research on cannabinoids and the ECS, detail the potential advantages and pitfalls of their use in GI diseases, and explore possible future developments in this field.

### Got the munchies for an egg sandwich? The effects of cannabis on bowel motility and beyond [^2f8a3b5f]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2024). Medium credibility.

The use of medicinal cannabis has a long history dating back thousands of years. Recent discoveries have shed light on its mechanism of action with the identification of cannabinoid receptors and endocannabinoids, which make up the body's endocannabinoid system. Cannabinoid receptors, particularly the cannabinoid 1 and 2 receptors, play a crucial role in modulating the gut-brain axis and serve as potential therapeutic targets for gastrointestinal motility and inflammatory disorders. With increasing legalization of cannabis and a rising number of users, understanding the effects of cannabis on gut motility is essential for nuclear medicine providers. Although tetrahydrocannabinol, the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis, may decrease gut motility in experimental settings, it appears to paradoxically improve symptoms in gastroparesis. Treatment effects are difficult to measure given the large number of variables that could significantly alter outcomes, such as cannabinoid type, potency, and route of intake. Another consideration is the highly personalized gut microbiome, which directly interacts with the endocannabinoid system. Further research is required to delineate these multifaceted, complex cannabinoid interactions. The goal of this article is to explore the knowns and unknowns of the impact of cannabis on the alimentary system.

### Role of cannabis in inflammatory bowel diseases [^a9107764]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

For many centuries, cannabis (marijuana) has been used for both recreational and medicinal purposes. Currently, there are about 192 million cannabis users worldwide, constituting approximately 3.9% of the global population. Cannabis comprises more than 70 aromatic hydrocarbon compounds known as cannabinoids. Endogenous circulating cannabinoids, or endocannabinoids, such as anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol, their metabolizing enzymes (fatty acid amide hydrolase and monoacylglycerol lipase) and 2 G-protein coupled cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, together represent the endocannabinoid system and are present throughout the human body. In the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the activated endocannabinoid system reduces gut motility, intestinal secretion and epithelial permeability, and induces inflammatory leukocyte recruitment and immune modulation through the cannabinoid receptors present in the enteric nervous and immune systems. Because of the effects of cannabinoids on the GI tract, attempts have been made to investigate their medicinal properties, particularly for GI disorders such as pancreatitis, hepatitis, and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The effects of cannabis on IBD have been elucidated in several small observational and placebo-controlled studies, but with varied results. The small sample size and short follow-up duration in these studies make it difficult to show the clear benefits of cannabis in IBD. However, cannabis is now being considered as a potential drug for inflammatory GI conditions, particularly IBD, because of its spreading legalization in the United States and other countries and the growing trend in its use. More high-quality controlled studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanism and benefits of cannabis use as a possible option in IBD management.

### Inflammatory bowel disease and cannabis: key counseling strategies [^97c2c285]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Cannabis use is becoming more frequent in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Because of the increased usage, gastroenterologists need to be cognizant of the benefits and risks associated with cannabis use in the IBD-patient population.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have attempted to determine whether cannabis can improve biomarkers or endoscopic findings of inflammation in patients with IBD, but the results have been inconclusive. However, cannabis has been shown to have an impact on the symptoms and quality of life of individuals with IBD. Despite these benefits, the use of cannabis in IBD is not without risks, including the potential for systemic illness, toxin ingestion and significant drug interactions.

Summary

In this review article, we use a case-based approach to discuss the critical clinical data that informs us of the benefits and risks of cannabis use in IBD. The endocannabinoid system plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological functions including the gastrointestinal tract. Studies have investigated the impact of cannabis on various medical conditions, including IBD. Clinicians must be aware of the most recent data to properly educate their patients on the benefits and risks of its use.

### Pharmacology, clinical effects, and therapeutic potential of cannabinoids for gastrointestinal and liver diseases [^b7adfd23]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Cannabis and cannabinoids (such as tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol) are frequently used to relieve gastrointestinal symptoms. Cannabinoids have effects on the immune system and inflammatory responses, as well as neuromuscular and sensory functions of digestive organs, including pancreas and liver. Cannabinoids can cause hyperemesis and cyclic vomiting syndrome, but they might also be used to reduce gastrointestinal, pancreatic, or hepatic inflammation, as well as to treat motility, pain, and functional disorders. Cannabinoids activate cannabinoid receptors, which inhibit release of transmitters from presynaptic neurons and also inhibit diacylglycerol lipase alpha, to prevent synthesis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol. However, randomized trials are needed to clarify their effects in patients; these compounds can have adverse effects on the central nervous system (such as somnolence and psychosis) or the developing fetus, when used for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. Cannabinoid-based therapies can also hide symptoms and disease processes, such as in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. It is important for gastroenterologists and hepatologists to understand cannabinoid mechanisms, effects, and risks.

### The gastrointestinal tract-a central organ of cannabinoid signaling in health and disease [^57b5c410]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In ancient medicine, extracts of the marijuana plant Cannabis sativa were used against diseases of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Today, our knowledge of the ingredients of the Cannabis plant has remarkably advanced enabling us to use a variety of herbal and synthetic cannabinoid (CB) compounds to study the endocannabinoid system (ECS), a physiologic entity that controls tissue homeostasis with the help of endogenously produced CBs and their receptors. After many anecdotal reports suggested beneficial effects of Cannabis in GI disorders, it was not surprising to discover that the GI tract accommodates and expresses all the components of the ECS. Cannabinoid receptors and their endogenous ligands, the endocannabinoids, participate in the regulation of GI motility, secretion, and the maintenance of the epithelial barrier integrity. In addition, other receptors, such as the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1), the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and the G-protein coupled receptor 55 (GPR55), are important participants in the actions of CBs in the gut and critically determine the course of bowel inflammation and colon cancer.

Purpose

The following review summarizes important and recent findings on the role of CB receptors and their ligands in the GI tract with emphasis on GI disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and colon cancer.

### Patients' perspectives on marijuana use for inflammatory bowel disease: a multicenter survey [^14ea0e4a]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

With the spreading legalization of marijuana, there has been growing interest among researchers and patients in its use for a variety of medical conditions. Use among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the United States (US) is higher than the national average, and prevalence studies in the US and beyond suggest that 10-16.4% of IBD patients are active cannabis users [-].

Given the intense interest in its potential effects, the IBD community has started investigating marijuana’s role in inflammation and symptom control. Research has shown that marijuana acts on the cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors in the enteric nervous and immune systems of the gastrointestinal tract. Its effects reduce gut motility, intestinal secretion and epithelial permeability, and induce inflammatory leukocyte recruitment and immune modulation. However, there are very few clinical trials examining the effect of marijuana use on disease management in IBD [-]. Among the available studies, there is no clear evidence of disease remission, or improvement in severity or biochemical scores, and some studies have shown worse outcomes and greater need for surgery in patients with Crohn’s disease (CD). Importantly, however, patients do report symptomatic improvement and better quality of life (QoL) when they have a poor or incomplete response to standard therapy.

### Role of cannabis in inflammatory bowel diseases [^d9217e18]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 1 
Worldwide distribution and prevalence of cannabis Use (Data adapted from Prevalence of drug use in general population: National Data) World Drug Report 2018; (Retrieved from: https://www.unodc.org/wdr2018/en/maps-and-graphs.html) and State-wise representation of cannabis legality in the United States of America. Data obtained from: https://disa.com/map-of-marijuana-legality-by-state

Though cannabis can cause many harmful effects, its medicinal properties cannot be denied. Cannabis sativa contains more than 70 different cannabinoids (phytocannabinoids). Among these, Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the principle and most potent psychoactive ingredient. Cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol and cannabichromene are some of the other natural cannabis compounds actively used for research purposes, among which CBD has shown its potential as an anti-inflammatory agent without adverse psychotic effects. Because of its neuroprotective effects, it is now approved for treating some rare forms of epilepsy. CB1 and CB2 are the 2 receptor mediators through which cannabis exerts its actions on multiple organ systems, including the gastrointestinal (GI), nervous and immune systems. Anti-inflammatory and pain-modulating properties of cannabis have been demonstrated in multiple GI and related organ disorders in the past [-]. In recent years, the effects of cannabis on inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have been investigated in multiple investigational, clinically randomized, retrospective and survey studies. IBD is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can affect both the small and large intestines. It mainly comprises 2 entities: Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) (though there is a third entity, unclassified or indeterminate IBD). In some in vivo experiments on animal models, cannabis showed strong anti-motility and anti-inflammatory effects on the gut [-]. However, little is known about whether it has the same impact on the human colon. Lately, some observational and small placebo-controlled studies have been conducted to examine the effects of cannabis on IBD, and some of these studies have shown promising results [,-]. However, given the lack of sufficient large clinical trials, it remains a question whether it can be used as a successful therapeutic agent for IBD management. In this review, we will focus on the published evidence regarding the clinical effects of cannabis in patients with IBD.

### Supporting gut health with medicinal cannabis in people with advanced cancer: potential benefits and challenges [^0dbc1236]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Soon after the discovery of its chemical structure and ability to obtain various compounds from the plant in the late 1900s, as well as the description of the cannabinoid receptors and the endocannabinoid system in the 1990s, cannabis use for medical purposes has increased significantly with a steep rise in the last few years. It is evident that the majority of this use results from illegal access, however, this has been recognised and laws are in a fast-changing phase with several products approved and several others on a registered unapproved list. This provides new opportunities for users and prescribers to access MC products in a legal manner. In cancer care, self-reported cannabis use is prevalent, however, the evidence base is lacking due to inconsistencies in study design and outcomes. Moving forward, it is critical that research efforts integrate appropriate pharmacokinetic and mechanistic sub-studies to understand cannabis biology in the context of cancer and investigate its efficacy in a more holistic sense by considering its impact on clusters of related symptoms. In the context of mucositis, this is a compelling approach given the numerous symptoms that occur secondary to mucosal barrier injury and the already documented benefits medicinal cannabis has on gastrointestinal physiology, inflammation, and dysfunction.

### Cannabinoids and gastrointestinal motility: pharmacology, clinical effects, and potential therapeutics in humans [^1e46d70b]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cannabinoid agents and cannabis are frequently used for relief of diverse gastrointestinal symptoms.

Purpose

The objective of this article is to increase the awareness of gastroenterologists to the effects of cannabinoids on gastrointestinal motility, as gastroenterologists are likely to encounter patients who are taking cannabinoids, or those with dysmotility that may be associated with cannabinoid mechanisms. The non-selective cannabinoid agonist, dronabinol, retards gastric emptying and inhibits colonic tone and phasic pressure activity. In addition to the well-recognized manifestations of cannabinoid hyperemesis, cannabinoid mechanisms result in human and animal models of gastrointestinal and colonic dysmotility. Decreased enteric FAAH activity is associated with colonic inertia in slow transit constipation and, conversely, the orphan G protein-coupled receptor, GPR55, is overexpressed in streptozotocin-induced gastroparesis, suggesting it is involved in inhibition of antral motility. Experimental therapies in gastrointestinal motility and functional disorders are focused predominantly on pain relief mediated through cannabinoid 2 receptors or inhibition of DAGLα to normalize colonic transit. In summary, cannabinoid mechanisms and pharmacology are relevant to the current and future practice of clinical gastroenterology.

### Toward modulation of the endocannabinoid system for treatment of gastrointestinal disease: FAAHster but not "higher" [^fb12c3e3]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2014). Low credibility.

Cannabis has been used to treat various afflictions throughout the centuries, including nausea, vomiting, and pain. It has also been used recreationally for its psychotropic properties, which can include a pleasurable 'high' feeling and a decrease in anxiety and tension; however, other may experience dysphoria. Changes in cognition and psychomotor performance are also well-known with cannabis use. In recent years, our understanding of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) has progressed dramatically; the objective of identifying agents which may allow modulation of the ECS without significant psychotropic side effects may be possible. Inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), an important enzyme for the degradation of anandamide and other endogenous cannabinoids, is a promising target to achieve this goal. In this issue of Neurogastroenterology and Motility, Fichna and colleagues report on a novel selective FAAH inhibitor, PF-3845, with potent antinociceptive and antidiarrheal effects in a mouse model. In this context, we briefly review the components of the ECS, discuss pharmacologic targets for indirect cannabinoid receptor stimulation, and describe recent research with cannabinoids for gut disorders.

### Supporting gut health with medicinal cannabis in people with advanced cancer: potential benefits and challenges [^ecb59e01]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite the impact of mucositis on patients and the healthcare system, it remains without effective intervention, and its range of secondary symptoms/consequences are managed reactively and in isolation. Given the body of evidence that now suggests many symptoms and treatment consequences may be influenced by mucositis, there is an opportunity to control mucositis to mitigate the constellation of impactful symptoms with which it is associated. This review aims to outline a rationale for how, based on its already documented effects on the gastrointestinal microenvironment, medicinal cannabis could be used to control mucositis and prevent its associated symptom cluster. We will provide a brief update on the current state of evidence on medicinal cannabis in cancer care and outline the potential benefits (and challenges) of using medicinal cannabis during active cancer therapy.

### Insights into the role of cannabis in the management of inflammatory bowel disease [^a6a5d01a]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion and future directions

There is emerging evidence that cannabis may play a role in the management of patients with IBD. Many patients are already using cannabis to help manage symptoms associated with the disease, and physicians cannot ignore this when taking histories and managing their patients.

The current studies that have explored the use of cannabis in IBD have demonstrated improvement in a number of gastrointestinal symptoms as well as patient quality of life. There has been no clear evidence, however, that cannabis modulates inflammation or improves disease activity. The majority of the current literature is retrospective observational data. The few randomized trials that have been performed are small and insufficiently powered to detect any clinically significant differences between cannabis and placebo. Large prospective randomized controlled studies with standardized preparations of cannabis and long-term follow up are required to assess the effectiveness of cannabis in IBD. There have been many regulatory obstacles in research involving medical cannabis in a number of countries around the world, including the United States. A recent review, released by the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation (United States) has called for government and regulatory policy change to facilitate further research into cannabinoid-based therapies.

Patients often do not report cannabis use to their treating physician. As with any drug, cannabis is associated with potential risks and long-term adverse effects. To better counsel patients, it is important for physicians managing IBD to be aware of how patients are using cannabis to manage their symptoms, the current evidence for its use, as well as potential adverse effects.

In summary, cannabis may improve clinical symptoms but has not demonstrated any improvement in disease activity in IBD. The risks and benefits of use should be considered for each individual patient. Cannabis should not replace current effective therapies in IBD, but can be used as a complementary adjunct in certain patients. IBD patients who are taking cannabis should be advised against taking it if their medical and family history dictates otherwise (e.g. pregnancy, age, family history of mental illness, etc.). Further large clinical trials looking at different formulations, doses, modes of administration, and long-term safety and efficacy are required to evaluate the effectiveness of cannabis in IBD.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^37d52de2]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

The antiemetic properties of marijuana are well known, but there is increasing evidence of its paradoxical hyperemetic effects on the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system, known as 'cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome' (CHS). We report a case of CHS encountered in our outpatient clinic. We also completed a review of the literature using PubMed in patients over 18years of age with CHS. Understanding the diagnostic criteria and risk factors associated with CHS may reduce the ordering of unnecessary and expensive investigations, and pursuing inappropriate medical and surgical treatments. Ultimately, abstaining from cannabis use leads to resolution of symptoms in the majority of patients.

### Role of cannabis in digestive disorders [^5973e19e]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Cannabis sativa, a subspecies of the Cannabis plant, contains aromatic hydrocarbon compounds called cannabinoids. [INCREMENT]-Tetrahydrocannabinol is the most abundant cannabinoid and is the main psychotropic constituent. Cannabinoids activate two types of G-protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors: cannabinoid type 1 receptor and cannabinoid type 2 receptor. There has been ongoing interest and development in research to explore the therapeutic potential of cannabis. [INCREMENT]-Tetrahydrocannabinol exerts biological functions on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Cannabis has been used for the treatment of GI disorders such as abdominal pain and diarrhea. The endocannabinoid system (i.e. endogenous circulating cannabinoids) performs protective activities in the GI tract and presents a promising therapeutic target against various GI conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (especially Crohn's disease), irritable bowel syndrome, and secretion and motility-related disorders. The present review sheds light on the role of cannabis in the gut, liver, and pancreas and also on other GI symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting, cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, anorexia, weight loss, and chronic abdominal pain. Although the current literature supports the use of marijuana for the treatment of digestive disorders, the clinical efficacy of cannabis and its constituents for various GI disorders remains unclear.

### Gut feelings about the endocannabinoid system [^8dd7169b]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2011). Low credibility.

Stemming from the centuries-old and well known effects of Cannabis on intestinal motility and secretion, research on the role of the endocannabinoid system in gut function and dysfunction has received ever increasing attention since the discovery of the cannabinoid receptors and their endogenous ligands, the endocannabinoids. In this article, some of the most recent developments in this field are discussed, with particular emphasis on new data, most of which are published in Neurogastroenterology & Motility, on the potential tonic endocannabinoid control of intestinal motility, the function of cannabinoid type-1 (CB1) receptors in gastric function, visceral pain, inflammation and sepsis, the emerging role of cannabinoid type-2 (CB2) receptors in the gut, and the pharmacology of endocannabinoid-related molecules and plant cannabinoids not necessarily acting via cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors. These novel data highlight the multi-faceted aspects of endocannabinoid function in the GI tract, support the feasibility of the future therapeutic exploitation of this signaling system for the treatment of GI disorders, and leave space for some intriguing new hypotheses on the role of endocannabinoids in the gut.

### Cannabinoids as gastrointestinal anti-inflammatory drugs [^ce703ab8]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). Low credibility.

In this mini-review, we focus on the potential of the endocannabinoid system as a target for novel therapies to treat gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation. We discuss the organization of the endocannabinoid signaling and present possible pharmacological sites in the endocannabinoid system. We also refer to recent clinical findings in the field. Finally, we point at the potential use of cannabinoids at low, non-psychoactive doses to counteract non-inflammatory pathological events in the GI tract, like chemotherapy-induced diarrhea, as evidenced by Abalo et al. in the rat model.

Cannabis: mechanistic considerations

Cannabis contains a number of chemically active compounds, including cannabinoids, terpenoids, flavonoids, and alkaloids.The most active constituent is the cannabinoid, THC, which is responsible for the well-characterized psychotropic effects associated with cannabis use. There are, however, over 100 other active cannabinoids that have been identified, each which modulates one or more components of the body’s ECS.A basic knowledge of the ECS is essential to understand how cannabis may be beneficial in patients with IBD.

The ECS consists of cannabinoid receptors, endogenous ligands for these receptors, and the enzymes for their synthesis and degradation. The human body naturally produces endocannbinoids, which are lipid-mediators that bind to cannabinoid receptors, found throughout the body (Figure 1). This complex system is involved in regulating a number of cognitive and physiological processes in the central nervous system including pain, mood, appetite, stress, and memory. In addition, the ECS regulates physiological processes outside of the brain, including those in the heart, gastrointestinal tract, reproductive system, and bone, to name a few. – Physiological and pharmacological studies have demonstrated the ECS is widely distributed throughout the gastrointestinal tract, and is involved in regulation of food intake, emesis, gastric secretion, gastric and intestinal motility, visceral sensation, and intestinal inflammation.The cannabinoids found in cannabis (phytocannabinoids) act as exogenous ligands for several of the receptors of the ECS.Several synthetic cannabinoids structurally analogous to the endocannabinoids have also been developed, and these share a similar biological action.

### Insights into the role of cannabis in the management of inflammatory bowel disease [^0934002f]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), which comprise Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic immune-mediated diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.IBD is characterized by periods of inflammatory flares, quiescence, and relapse, which places a substantial psychologic, emotional, and symptomatic burden on affected individuals.The incidence and prevalence of IBD globally continues to rise. – The current therapeutic goals in managing patients with IBD are: a reduction in inflammation, elimination of symptoms, improvement in quality of life, and the prevention of complications.Advances in the understanding of the immunopathological mechanisms behind the disease have led to the development of a number of new effective therapies used in the induction and maintenance of remission of disease activity.These have reduced the need for surgery and hospitalizations, and have led to improved patient quality of life.Current therapies, however, are not effective in all patients, and patients that do respond often lose response over time, Some patients also complain of symptoms even when inflammation is controlled and in remission. Cannabis may be an adjunct to medications in controlling inflammation, as well as improving a patient’s symptoms and quality of life.

Cannabis, a drug made up of the flowers and buds of the Cannabis sativa plant, has been used therapeutically for centuries. Ancient Chinese cultures have reported use in their medical practices, dating back as early as 2700 BC.Although widely used recreationally during the 19th and 20th centuries, the use of medical cannabis has exploded over the last decade, as a result of mainstream cultural acceptance and legalization in several countries around the world.

Cannabis contains over 100 different constituents, with Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) being the most prominent and best characterized.These act on the endocannabinoid system (ECS),and have demonstrated analgesic and antinociceptive activity in several animal and human models. – The primary clinical use of cannabis has been in the management of acute and chronic pain. It may be useful in reducing the use and dependence on opioids in the management of pain. The constituents of cannabis, however, also act on a number of other central and peripheral receptors, and can impact cytokine and immunoglobulin production as well as control immune cell migration. – Cannabis has been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory effects, and therefore may be useful in the treatment of a number of chronic inflammatory conditions including IBD.

### Cannabinoids and the gastrointestinal tract [^0ffc09ad]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

The synthesis and degradation of endocannabinoids, location of cannabinoid (CB) receptors, and cannabinoid mechanisms of action on immune/inflammatory, neuromuscular, and sensory functions in digestive organs are well documented. CB 2 mechanisms are particularly relevant in immune and sensory functions. Increasing use of cannabinoids in the United States is impacted by social determinants of health including racial discrimination, which is associated with tobacco and cannabis co-use, and combined use disorders. Several conditions associated with emesis are related to cannabinoid use, including cannabinoid hyperemesis or withdrawal, cyclic vomiting syndrome, and nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Cannabinoids generally inhibit gastrointestinal motor function; yet they relieve symptoms in patients with gastroparesis and diverse nausea syndromes. Cannabinoid effects on inflammatory mechanisms have shown promise in relatively small placebo-controlled studies in reducing disease activity and abdominal pain in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Cannabinoids have been studied in disorders of motility, pain, and disorders of gut-brain interaction. The CB 2 -receptor agonist, cannabidiol, reduced the total Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index and increases the ability to tolerate a meal in patients with gastroparesis appraised over 4 weeks of treatment. In contrast, predominant-pain end points in functional dyspepsia with normal gastric emptying were not improved significantly with cannabidiol. The CB 2 agonist, olorinab, reduced abdominal pain in inflammatory bowel disease in an open-label trial and in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome in a placebo-controlled trial. Cannabinoid mechanisms alter inflammation in pancreatic and liver diseases. In conclusion, cannabinoids, particularly agents affecting CB 2 mechanisms, have potential for inflammatory, gastroparesis, and pain disorders; however, the trials require replication and further understanding of risk-benefit to enhance use of cannabinoids in gastrointestinal diseases.

### Cannabis for the treatment of Crohn's disease [^05e5f21f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic immune-mediated condition of transmural inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, associated with significant morbidity and decreased quality of life. The endocannabinoid system provides a potential therapeutic target for cannabis and cannabinoids and animal models have shown benefit in decreasing inflammation. However, there is also evidence to suggest transient adverse events such as weakness, dizziness and diarrhea, and an increased risk of surgery in people with CD who use cannabis.

Objectives

The objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of cannabis and cannabinoids for induction and maintenance of remission in people with CD.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, PsychINFO, the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.Gov, and the European Clinical Trials Register up to 17 October 2018. We searched conference abstracts, references and we also contacted researchers in this field for upcoming publications.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing any form of cannabis or its cannabinoid derivatives (natural or synthetic) to placebo or an active therapy for adults with Crohn's disease were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcomes were clinical remission and relapse. Remission is commonly defined as a Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) of < 150. Relapse is defined as a CDAI > 150. Secondary outcomes included clinical response, endoscopic remission, endoscopic improvement, histological improvement, quality of life, C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin measurements, adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, withdrawal due to AEs, and cannabis dependence and withdrawal effects. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI. Data were combined for analysis when the interventions, patient groups and outcomes were sufficiently similar (determined by consensus). Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis and the overall certainty of the evidence supporting the outcomes was evaluated using the GRADE criteria.

Main Results

Three studies (93 participants) that assessed cannabis in people with active CD met the inclusion criteria. One ongoing study was also identified. Participants in two of the studies were adults with active Crohn's disease who had failed at least one medical treatment. The inclusion criteria for the third study were unclear. No studies that assessed cannabis therapy in quiescent CD were identified. The studies were not pooled due to differences in the interventional drug.One small study (N = 21) compared eight weeks of treatment with cannabis cigarettes containing 115 mg of D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to placebo cigarettes containing cannabis with the THC removed in participants with active CD. This study was rated as high risk of bias for blinding and other bias (cannabis participants were older than placebo). The effects of cannabis on clinical remission were unclear. Forty-five per cent (5/11) of the cannabis group achieved clinical remission compared with 10% (1/10) of the placebo group (RR 4.55, 95% CI 0.63 to 32.56; very low certainty evidence). A difference was observed in clinical response (decrease in CDAI score of >100 points) rates. Ninety-one per cent (10/11) of the cannabis group achieved a clinical response compared to 40% (4/10) of the placebo group (RR 2.27, 95% CI 1.04 to 4.97; very low certainty evidence). More AEs were observed in the cannabis cigarette group compared to placebo (RR 4.09, 95% CI 1.15 to 14.57; very low certainty evidence). These AEs were considered to be mild in nature and included sleepiness, nausea, difficulty with concentration, memory loss, confusion and dizziness. This study did not report on serious AEs or withdrawal due to AEs.One small study (N = 22) compared cannabis oil (5% cannabidiol) to placebo oil in people with active CD. This study was rated as high risk of bias for other bias (cannabis participants were more likely than placebo participants to be smokers). There was no difference in clinical remission rates. Forty per cent (4/10) of cannabis oil participants achieved remission at 8 weeks compared to 33% (3/9) of the placebo participants (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.36 to 3.97; very low certainty evidence). There was no difference in the proportion of participants who had a serious adverse event. Ten per cent (1/10) of participants in the cannabis oil group had a serious adverse event compared to 11% (1/9) of placebo participants (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.07 to 12.38, very low certainty evidence). Both serious AEs were worsening Crohn's disease that required rescue intervention. This study did not report on clinical response, CRP, quality of life or withdrawal due to AEs.One small study (N= 50) compared cannabis oil (15% cannabidiol and 4% THC) to placebo in participants with active CD. This study was rated as low risk of bias. Differences in CDAI and quality of life scores measured by the SF-36 instrument were observed. The mean quality of life score after 8 weeks of treatment was 96.3 in the cannabis oil group compared to 79.9 in the placebo group (MD 16.40, 95% CI 5.72 to 27.08, low certainty evidence). After 8 weeks of treatment, the mean CDAI score was118.6 in the cannabis oil group compared to 212.6 in the placebo group (MD -94.00, 95%CI -148.86 to -39.14, low certainty evidence). This study did not report on clinical remission, clinical response, CRP or AEs.

Authors' Conclusions

The effects of cannabis and cannabis oil on Crohn's disease are uncertain. Thus no firm conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of cannabis and cannabis oil in adults with active Crohn's disease can be drawn. The effects of cannabis or cannabis oil in quiescent Crohn's disease have not been investigated. Further studies with larger numbers of participants are required to assess the potential benefits and harms of cannabis in Crohn's disease. Future studies should assess the effects of cannabis in people with active and quiescent Crohn's disease. Different doses of cannabis and delivery modalities should be investigated.

### Patients' perspectives on marijuana use for inflammatory bowel disease: a multicenter survey [^67c29571]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of marijuana use varies greatly internationally. Reported rates of use among adolescents and young adults have been shown to be higher in the US (2.5-11.7%) than in other European countries (0.0-2.6%). Differences in reported rates likely reflect cultural and legal differences in marijuana use. If the effects of marijuana are largely driven by perceived symptom relief, rather than objective signs of reduced inflammation, it is possible that the effect of marijuana on IBD symptoms may be lower in countries where marijuana is less liberally used.

The greatest challenge to counseling patients on marijuana use is the lack of literature addressing its true risk-benefit profile and effect on symptoms. Currently, there are 3 studies that investigated marijuana compared to placebo/standard of care and evaluated the response to therapy and/or induction of remission, as described in the meta-analysis by Desmarias et al [-,]. Irving et al investigated marijuana use in UC patients, finding no evidence of treatment remission, while additionally all 29 patients in the treatment group had adverse events. In the 2 CD trials by Naftali et al there was no evidence of remission, while adverse events were not reported on a per-patient basis and therefore could not be determined. Overall, the quality of evidence was graded as low and very low for UC and CD, respectively, owing to factors including small sample sizes and high variability in the formulations of marijuana used. The Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation commissioned a review that also reports the need for further safety information, and attributes the difficulty in evaluating the effect of use to the large heterogeneity in study design. Further systematic research protocols with discrete formulations and larger sample sizes will be needed to advance our body of knowledge.

### The multiple functions of the endocannabinoid system: a focus on the regulation of food intake [^49904634]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Cannabis sativa (also known as marijuana) has been cultivated by man for more than 5,000 years. However, there was a rise in its use in the 20th century for recreational, religious or spiritual, and medicinal purposes. The main psychoactive constituent of cannabis, whose structure was identified in the 1960's, is Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol. On the other hand, the discovery of cannabinoid receptors and their endogenous agonists took place only very recently. In fact, the first cannabinoid receptor (CB1) was cloned in 1990, followed 3 years later by the characterization of a second cannabinoid receptor (CB2). Since the 19th century, the use of cannabis has been reported to stimulate appetite and increase the consumption of sweet and tasty food, sometimes resulting in significant weight gain. The recent description of the endocannabinoid system, not only in the central nervous system but also in peripheral tissues, points to its involvement in the regulation of appetite, food intake and energy metabolism. Consequently, the pharmacological modulation of the over-activity of this system could be useful in the treatment of the metabolic syndrome.

Conclusions

The endocannabinoid system has important physiological functions not only in the central nervous system but also in peripheral tissues. The activation of central CB1 receptors, particularly in hypothalamic nuclei and in the limbic system, is involved in the regulation of feeding behavior, and especially in the control of the intake of palatable food. In the periphery, cannabinoid receptors are present in adipocytes, skeletal muscle, gastrointestinal tract and liver, modulating energy metabolism.

Guidelines and clinical recommendations

Due to the current lack of evidence for the efficacy of cannabis in IBD, clinical guidelines and recommendations to assist physicians remain limited. Two recent Cochrane database reviews that reviewed the evidence of cannabis in CD and UC, respectively, were unable to make any firm conclusions on the safety or efficacy of cannabis in IBD.

The Canadian Association of Gastroenterology released a position statement in 2018 on the use of cannabis for several gastroenterologic and hepatologic disorders.They stated that cannabis does not appear to alter the course of the disease in IBD (for better or worse) based on the current evidence available. They have also recommended that medical cannabis should not replace current approved medical therapies for patients with IBD.

A clinical, scientific, and regulatory review commissioned by the American Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation recently concluded that, although cannabis may help control symptoms and improve quality of life in patients with IBD, it has not been demonstrated to modify disease behavior.This article outlined the current legal, regulatory, and logistic hurdles in investigating medical cannabis for IBD in the United States.

### Supporting gut health with medicinal cannabis in people with advanced cancer: potential benefits and challenges [^64c71e07]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal effects of cannabis: can they be adapted to control mucositis?

Cannabinoids, including both CBD and THC, are increasingly documented for their capacity to modulate gastrointestinal function, owing to the immense control that the ECS has on gastrointestinal homeostasis. Both CNR1 and CNR2 are present in the gastrointestinal tract, largely on enteric nerves and the epithelium, but also on enteroendocrine cells and immune cells. This network of ECS receptors controls gastric motility, and as such, it is now understood that variants in the genes encoding for CNR1 are implicated in diseases characterised by altered motility including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), particularly diarrhoea-predominant. Both CNR1 and CNR2 are expressed in the gut at medium to high degrees, respectively. Accordingly, it has been shown that agonists of the cannabinoid receptors (CNR1 and CNR2), as well as targeting endocannabinoid degradation, minimises experimental colitis and associated visceral hypersensitivity. Furthermore, preclinical investigations have shown that potent agonists of CNR1 (without central nervous system effects) and CNR2 have been shown to control increased gastrointestinal motility caused by stress and inflammation. Similarly, inhibition of anti-diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH)—two enzymes critical in endocannabinoid metabolism—has been shown to normalise transit time in the context of opioid-induced constipation. Of particular interest to changes in the gastrointestinal microenvironment associated with mucositis is the ability of CNR2 activation and FAAH inhibition to control accelerated gastrointestinal motility induced by lipopolysaccharide—a bacterial product that is causally implicated in chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea.

### Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) expert opinion / consensus guidance on the use of cannabinoids for gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with cancer [^86e3313a]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in patients with cancer, whether related to treatment or a direct effect of the disease itself. Patients may choose to access cannabinoids outside of their formal medical prescriptions to palliate such symptoms. However, clinical guidelines are lacking in relation to the use of such medicines for gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with cancer.

Methods

A systematic review of the evidence for the use of cannabinoids for symptom control in patients with cancer was undertaken. Search strategies were developed for Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, including all publications from 1975 up to 12 November 2021. Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials of cannabinoids compared with placebo or active comparator in adult patients with cancer, regardless of type, stage, or treatment status. Articles for inclusion were agreed by all authors, and data extracted and summarized by two authors. Each study was scored according to the Jadad scale. This review was specifically for the purpose of developing guidelines for the use of cannabis for gastrointestinal symptoms, including chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), chronic nausea, anorexia-cachexia syndrome, and taste disturbance.

Results

Thirty-six randomized controlled trials were identified that met the inclusion criteria for this review of gastrointestinal symptoms: 31 relating to CINV, one to radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and the remaining four to anorexia-cachexia and altered chemosensory disturbance. The populations for the randomized controlled trials were heterogeneous, and many studies were of poor quality, lacking clarity regarding method of randomization, blinding, and allocation concealment. For CINV, eleven RCTs showed improvement with cannabis compared to placebo, but out of 21 trials where cannabis was compared to other antiemetics for CINV, only 11 favoured cannabis.

Conclusion

Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and nabilone were more effective in preventing CINV when compared to placebo but are not more effective than other antiemetics. For refractory CINV, one study of THC:CBD demonstrated reduced nausea as an add-on treatment to guideline-consistent antiemetic therapy without olanzapine. The MASCC Guideline Committee found insufficient evidence to recommend cannabinoids for the management of CINV, nausea from advanced cancer, cancer-associated anorexia-cachexia, and taste disturbance. High-quality studies are needed to inform practice.

### Role of cannabis in inflammatory bowel diseases [^f632fa2a]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

The question of the legality of cannabis use

IBD patients who have never used cannabis have expressed their desire to try medicinal marijuana for the control of their symptoms, if available legally. Nevertheless, the legal and social implications of the unrestrained, unregulated use of cannabis should also be considered, despite its benefits. When a history is taken from a member of the IBD population, questions about consumption of cannabis should be asked, as there seems to be a surge of cannabis use in this patient group as per the state and federal marijuana laws. With the formulation of a number of CB1 and CB2 receptor agonists and antagonists, animal model research has answered some vital questions regarding the mechanism of the ECS in health and in morbid states [-]. Still, more in vitro and in vivo studies are needed, especially large randomized, controlled trials designed to specifically answer questions about the clinical effects of cannabis on IBD.

### The role of cannabis in the management of inflammatory bowel disease: a review of clinical, scientific, and regulatory information [^3339caaf]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

There is significant interest among patients and providers in using cannabis (marijuana) and its derivatives to treat a number of chronic illnesses, including inflammatory bowel disease. Despite the Schedule I classification of cannabis by the federal government, state governments have sought ways to make cannabis available for specific medical conditions, and some states have legalized cannabis outright. This white paper summarizes the preclinical data, clinical data, safety data, and the regulatory landscape as they apply to medical cannabis use in inflammatory bowel disease. Animal models of cannabinoid chemistry and physiology give evidence of anti-inflammatory, antidiarrheal, and nociceptive-limiting properties. Human studies have found benefit in controlling symptoms and improving quality of life, but no studies have established true disease modification given the absent improvement in biomarker profiles or endoscopic healing. Finally, this review describes the legal, regulatory, and practical hurdles to studying the risks and benefits of medical cannabis in the United States. 10.1093/ibd/izy319_video1 izy319.video1 5852852028001.

5.12.3.1 Cannabis extracts

There is increasing interest in use of cannabidiol (CBD) in medicine. This does not have the psychotropic effects of the delta 9 -tetrahydrocannabionol (THC) component in cannabis. CBD can have beneficial effects in the gut including reduction in nausea, reduced gastric acid secretion, anti-inflammatory effects and reduction in intestinal motility. Cannabis use has been reported to improve IBD symptoms,and many patients claim that it has beneficial effects.A small double-blind randomised trial in 60 patients compared an oral CBD-rich botanical extract with placebo in mild-moderate active UC. At 10 weeks, the primary end-point of remission was achieved in 28% on CBD versus 26% on placebo (non-significant). The treatment caused side effects of dizziness and somnolence (likely due to the residual THC content of the botanical extract). There was some evidence of symptom improvement in the per protocol analysis.A previous small randomised double-blind study in 21 Crohn’s disease patients compared smoking two marijuana cigarettes (containing 115 mg of THC) to a cannabis flower extract without THC over 8 weeks. The primary end-point of clinical remission was met in 45% on active treatment compared with 10% on placebo, but the difference was not significant.Further adequately powered studies are needed, with rigorous blinding, and objective measures of inflammation as well as symptoms.

The Endocannabinoid System: Marijuana and Synthetic Cannabinoids

The endocannabinoid system comprises cannabinoid (CB) receptors, their endogenous ligands (endocannabinoids), and proteins responsible for metabolism. It is an extensive network of cannabinoid receptors and endogenous mediators throughout the brain, nervous system, and GI tract that regulate neural, digestive, and immunologic systems [116, 117, 118]. Cannabis in ingested or inhaled form can modulate several central and peripheral cannabinoid receptors, including CB1 and CB2. Cannabidiol (CBD), a CB2 agonist, and Δ9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a CB1 agonist, are the two main chemical components of cannabis. There are several approved synthetic cannabinoids. Dronabinol and nabilone are both synthetic versions of THC and are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients with refractory nausea. They have a generally lackluster record in analgesia. Olorinab is a highly selective CB2 receptor agonist currently in phase IIb clinical trials for the treatment of visceral gastrointestinal pain (NCT04043455).

Marijuana or cannabis is currently legalized (or decriminalized) for adult medical and/or recreational use in close to 70% of the U.S. Cannabis plants have traditionally been promoted for putative analgesic, sedative, anti‐inflammatory, antispasmodic, appetite stimulant, and anticonvulsant activities and mood improvement [119]. Historically the major routes of cannabis ingestion have been by inhalation and by mouth. Both routes have reported analgesic efficacy in the chronic pain setting, best reported in the setting of neuropathic or arthritic pain [120]. In patients with impaired GI absorption, orally ingested compounds might have reduced efficacy. Ingestion by inhalation may provide more rapid and better analgesic effect [121]. Emerging studies have reported a decrease in reported opioid use in patients with chronic pain using transdermal or vaping delivery modalities [120]. Inhalation is the most widespread recreational form of administration and has all the risks expected with smoking. Vaporizers remove much of this risk and have a rapid onset of effect; however, there is significant variability in bioavailability and dosing. Oral, oromucosal, or sublingual administration has a slower onset but also lasts longer. There are no major differences between the oral, sublingual, and oromucosal routes [122]. More studies will be needed to assess marijuana's potential efficacy and optimal route of delivery for patients with pancreatic cancer.

### The role of cannabinoids in advancing cancer treatment: insights from evidence-based medicine [^36e6cea6]. Current Oncology Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

The enzymatic degradation of endocannabinoids is another crucial aspect of the ECS. Enzymes like fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) for AEA and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) for 2-AG ensure the transient nature of endocannabinoid signaling. Recent advancements in ECS research have shed light on its diverse roles in human physiology. For instance, a study by Ratcliffe et al. explored the developmental impacts of cannabis smoke exposure on the ECS in the gastrointestinal tract. This research provides insight into the significant role of the ECS in the gut-brain axis, highlighting its influence on gastrointestinal functions. Furthermore, investigations into the relationship between the ECS and metabolic flexibility, as well as its association with metabolic markers in middle-aged individuals, underscore the system's involvement in metabolic regulation. Additionally, studies delving into the effects of cannabis on bowel motility contribute to our understanding of the ECS's comprehensive influence on gastrointestinal function. The role of the ECS in modulating the composition of immune cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) is crucial. This modulation has a significant impact on the functionality of immune cells and the development of tumor growth. These findings suggest that cannabinoids could have the potential for immunotherapy. However, to fully grasp these interactions, further investigation is necessary. The main components and functions of ECS are presented in Fig. 1.

### Targeting the endocannabinoid system for the treatment of abdominal pain in irritable bowel syndrome [^1dbc8ee2]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

The management of visceral pain in patients with disorders of gut-brain interaction, notably irritable bowel syndrome, presents a considerable clinical challenge, with few available treatment options. Patients are increasingly using cannabis and cannabinoids to control abdominal pain. Cannabis acts on receptors of the endocannabinoid system, an endogenous system of lipid mediators that regulates gastrointestinal function and pain processing pathways in health and disease. The endocannabinoid system represents a logical molecular therapeutic target for the treatment of pain in irritable bowel syndrome. Here, we review the physiological and pathophysiological functions of the endocannabinoid system with a focus on the peripheral and central regulation of gastrointestinal function and visceral nociception. We address the use of cannabinoids in pain management, comparing them to other treatment modalities, including opioids and neuromodulators. Finally, we discuss emerging therapeutic candidates targeting the endocannabinoid system for the treatment of pain in irritable bowel syndrome.

### Effects of oral, smoked, and vaporized cannabis on endocrine pathways related to appetite and metabolism: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, human laboratory study [^752756fb]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Scientific knowledge about the pharmacological actions of exogenous cannabinoids was considerably informed by the discovery of the G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors (CB 1 and CB 2) and their endogenous ligands known as endocannabinoids (anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG)) which, along with their synthesis/degradation enzymes, collectively constitute the endocannabinoid system. Upon production and release, endocannabinoids bind to cannabinoid receptors located on pre-synaptic membranes and change neuronal excitability by modulating the release of different neurotransmitters –. Cannabinoid receptors are expressed not only in the brain, but also in the gut and other peripheral organs involved in food intake, metabolism, and energy homeostasis –. Previous studies suggest that agonism of the cannabinoid receptors, by either endocannabinoids or exogenous cannabinoids, acutely stimulates food craving, intake, and reward, and promotes the storage of energy in adipose tissues, whereas antagonism of the cannabinoid receptors reduces food intake and body weight –. On the other hand, chronic daily administration of THC suppresses weight gain, fat mass gain, and caloric intake in diet-induced, obese rats, and epidemiological data indicate an association between chronic cannabis use and decreased prevalence of obesity and diabetes –. These findings suggest that cannabinoids play important roles in modulating appetitive behaviors and metabolic processes. However, more studies are required to shed light on the complexity of this cross-talk as, for example, acute versus chronic cannabis use may lead to different, and even opposite, outcomes.

### Nabilone administration in refractory chronic diarrhea: a case series [^22dc7f40]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cannabis is the most abused illicit drug in the world. In the past, it played a strong and prominent role in medicine. Until 1941, when cannabis preparations were taken off the United States Pharmacopeia and National Formulary, it was prescribed for a multitude of symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Even though the consumption of cannabis is currently associated with major health issues, such as an increase in respiratory diseases, psychosis and suicidal ideations, the medical use of its derivatives continues to increase worldwide. At the time of this writing, several European nations and more than 30 United States territories allow marijuana for medical purposes, although their approaches are significantly different. Moderate evidence now supports the use of cannabis for the treatment of chronic pain and spasticity, and improvements have been observed in nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy, anorexia in HIV infection, sleep disorders and Tourette syndrome.

Among the active ingredients of cannabis, cannabinoids are the most studied in the medical literature. Δ -tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ -THC) is the most familiar of them, and the responsible for the psychotropic activity. Once absorbed by the human body, several cannabinoids interact with the endocannabinoid system (ECS), a physiologic system involved in establishing and maintaining homeostasis of different organs and body systems. ECS is composed by endogenous ligands, known as endocannabinoids, by G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2) and the enzymes involved in endocannabinoids turnover. It interacts within its own pathways, as well as with all major inflammatory and painful pathways, including endorphins, enkephalins, transient receptor potential cation channels (TRPV) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). ECS components are in the human brain and in the peripheral nervous system, but they are also detectable outside the brain, e.g. on immune cells, in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and other organs.

### Effects of oral, smoked, and vaporized cannabis on endocrine pathways related to appetite and metabolism: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, human laboratory study [^c7c61e2d]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Cannabis administration in the present study also modulated blood concentrations of GLP-1, an incretin closely linked to insulin and glucose metabolism. While there were no significant differences at baseline, a significant drug main effect was found, indicating that GLP-1 concentrations were lower during cannabis administration sessions (oral, smoked, and vaporized), compared to the placebo condition (Fig. 2d). These results are parallel to, and consistent with, the aforementioned effects on insulin. GLP-1 is a 30-amino acid peptide primarily produced by endocrine cells in the intestines. Upon secretion, for example in response to food intake, GLP-1 contributes to regulating blood glucose levels, mainly by stimulating insulin secretion and inhibiting glucagon secretion from the pancreas. GLP-1 also reduces food appetite and slows gastric emptying via central (e.g. hypothalamus) and peripheral (e.g. stomach) mechanisms,. The relationship between GLP-1 and insulin appears to be bidirectional, as insulin stimulates GLP-1 secretion from the enteroendocrine cells and insulin resistance, in vitro and in vivo, is associated with impaired GLP-1 secretion. Hypothetically, the suppressing effect of cannabis on GLP-1 observed in this study may not be direct, but rather secondary to the suppressed insulin levels. Indeed, some of the previous research does not support a direct link between the endocannabinoid system and GLP-1 signaling. For example, increased activity of the endocannabinoid system does not influence GLP-1 concentrations,, and the effects of CB1 receptor antagonists on appetite, food intake, and weight are not mediated by GLP-1,. However, some other studies point to a possible direct link between the endocannabinoid system and GLP-1 signaling. For example, one study demonstrated that endocannabinoid-like lipids can directly bind to GLP-1 and increase its potency via conformational changes. More studies are required to understand whether and how exogenous cannabis administration, as well as different components of the endocannabinoid system, may have direct and/or indirect influences on the GLP-1 system.

### Gastrointestinal manifestations of synthetic cannabinoids: a retrospective cohort study [^89f2e617]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is, to our knowledge, the first study specifically dealing with the GI symptoms of SC use in an acute setting. Among symptomatic SC users presenting to the ED, 38% had GI manifestations and abdominal pain was reported by of those with GI symptoms. Still, the clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging findings ranged in severity among these patients. Most patients had only mild abdominal pain, while others had severe elevations of serum lactate with one patient having suffered an intestinal perforation. Nevertheless, the vast majority of patients (20/21) had a complete resolution of abdominal pain and normalization of serum lactate levels within a few hours of presentation.

When comparing the differences between the patients with GI symptoms and those without, there were no statistically significant differences in their prognoses, clinical severity, or laboratory values. Lack of significant difference may have been due to their low numbers. However, the patients with GI manifestations had higher lactate levels likely caused by the intestinal involvement and more patients with severe leukocytosis. The mechanism causing the varied effects of SC on the GI tract is unclear, but may be related to a previously reported effect of THC and cannabidiol on CBr1 and CBr2, which influence GI function, motility, and sensation. Our study suggests that SC GI symptoms are unpredictable and can vary from minimal, or no symptoms to intestinal perforation and death. This varied GI response to SC may be due to the varying potency of SC, especially with the development of new ultra-potent SC that may impact the GI tract more than regular cannabis. Others have suggested that the variability of SC on the GI tract may be due to adulterants added to the compounds (such as caffeine, nicotine, and tramadol), which can contribute to clinical effects and toxicity.

### Supporting gut health with medicinal cannabis in people with advanced cancer: potential benefits and challenges [^b468dec7]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition to the method of administration, the selection of specific cannabinoids and their relevant doses is critical. This decision needs to be guided by the specific symptom or side effect(s) of interest, with a clear scientific rationale for their use. When considering the MC intervention of interest, it is also important to acknowledge and respect the complexity of medicinal cannabis as an entire entity (i.e. a whole plant) in which the combination of numerous active compounds work cooperatively to elicit benefit. As such, while using synthesised isolates may be attractive from a pharmacological perspective, evidence suggests that the synergy of numerous cannabis compounds, a process referred to as the “entourage effect”, outweighs the benefits that can be gained from a single isolate or molecule.

In the context of mucositis and its constellation of symptoms, the use of CBD and THC (with other cannabinoids and compounds such as terpenes) is likely to be best positioned to deliver meaningful benefits based on their unique yet synergistic effects. Of note, CBD is documented to counteract the undesirable psychotropic effects of THC and may therefore improve adherence. This synergy is in addition to the ability of these compounds to address different but related symptoms. For example, CBD is hypothesised to control self-perpetuating inflammatory pathways that ultimately dictate the depth and duration of mucosal injury to deliver clinically meaningful benefits [,–]. In parallel, THC has the capacity to provide complementary effects to control anxiety, promote food intake/appetite and sleep quality. However, it cannot be ignored that while THC provides potential benefits for the patient, it certainly introduces additional medico-legal complexity, with many countries enforcing strict no-tolerance laws with respect to operating heavy machinery or driving motor vehicles. This may negatively impact patient well-being by impacting their employment prospects, or ability to live independently. It also poses challenges for patients that may have caring duties. Further advice regarding dosing has been summarised by Cyr and colleagues.

### The role of the endocannabinoid system in the brain-gut axis [^b9dd6dd2]. Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The actions of cannabis are mediated by receptors that are part of an endogenous cannabinoid system. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) consists of the naturally occurring ligands N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), their biosynthetic and degradative enzymes, and the cannabinoid (CB) receptors CB1 and CB2. The ECS is a widely distributed transmitter system that controls gut functions peripherally and centrally. It is an important physiologic regulator of gastrointestinal motility. Polymorphisms in the gene encoding CB1 (CNR1) have been associated with some forms of irritable bowel syndrome. The ECS is involved in the control of nausea and vomiting and visceral sensation. The homeostatic role of the ECS also extends to the control of intestinal inflammation. We review the mechanisms by which the ECS links stress and visceral pain. CB1 in sensory ganglia controls visceral sensation, and transcription of CNR1 is modified through epigenetic processes under conditions of chronic stress. These processes might link stress with abdominal pain. The ECS is also involved centrally in the manifestation of stress, and endocannabinoid signaling reduces the activity of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal pathways via actions in specific brain regions, notably the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hypothalamus. Agents that modulate the ECS are in early stages of development for treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. Increasing our understanding of the ECS will greatly advance our knowledge of interactions between the brain and gut and could lead to new treatments for gastrointestinal disorders.

Receptor system—There are two main types of cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, and CB1 receptors are most closely linked with THC. For CB1, the location is the central nervous system, particularly in the brain and spinal cord, uterus, and ovaries; psychoactive effects are responsible for the “high” associated with cannabis use with impaired cognition and anxiety; function is regulating mood, memory, appetite, pain perception, and coordination, and others; and therapeutic effects are pain relief and appetite stimulation. For CB2, the location is the peripheral nervous system, particularly in immune cells, uterus, and various other tissues such as the spleen and gastrointestinal tract; psychoactive effects are less associated with “high” (eg, disinhibition, hallucinations); function is modulating immune responses, inflammation, and pain perception; and therapeutic effects include reducing inflammation, autoimmune disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases.

### Supporting gut health with medicinal cannabis in people with advanced cancer: potential benefits and challenges [^95c1923b]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Inter-individual differences in pharmacogenomics, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics may explain contradictory outcomes from previous studies and accounting for such differences will provide an opportunity for personalised medicine where efficacy can be maximised, and toxicity minimised for various conditions or diseases.

Reflecting the breadth of cells upon which ECS receptors are expressed, the ECS regulates a number of critical functions that are well-known to contribute to the side effects of chemotherapy. Most notable is its psychotropic properties, modulating mood, anxiety, cognition, appetite, sleep and pain ; all of which are well-documented to be negatively impacted by chemotherapy. Peripheral CB1 expression is also implicated in gastrointestinal inflammation, mucosal defences and gastric motility, and thus by extension diarrhoea and constipation, due to its expression on presynaptic cell of sympathetic motor neurons innervating visceral organs leading to reduced noradrenalin release. Further to this, given the immunomodulatory capacity of the ECS, its ability to influence numerous symptoms and side effects of chemotherapy of which many are underpinned by aberrant inflammation, is vast. It is for these reasons that medicinal cannabis, and strategies to augment the ECS, have gained considerable momentum for their potential benefits in people with cancer.

### Manipulation of the endocannabinoid system in colitis: a comprehensive review [^879e9a1e]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a lifelong disease of the gastrointestinal tract whose annual incidence and prevalence is on the rise. Current immunosuppressive therapies available for treatment of IBD offer limited benefits and lose effectiveness, exposing a significant need for the development of novel therapies. In the clinical setting, cannabis has been shown to provide patients with IBD symptomatic relief, although the underlying mechanisms of their anti-inflammatory effects remain unclear.

Methods

This review reflects our current understanding of how targeting the endocannabinoid system, including cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2, endogenous cannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, atypical cannabinoids, and degrading enzymes including fatty acid amide hydrolase and monoacylglycerol lipase, impacts murine colitis. In addition, the impact of cannabinoids on the human immune system is summarized.

Results

Cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2, endogenous cannabinoids, and atypical cannabinoids are upregulated in inflammation, and their presence and stimulation attenuate murine colitis, whereas cannabinoid receptor antagonism and cannabinoid receptor deficient models reverse these anti-inflammatory effects. In addition, inhibition of endocannabinoid degradation through monoacylglycerol lipase and fatty acid amide hydrolase blockade can also attenuate colitis development, and is closely linked to cannabinoid receptor expression.

Conclusions

Although manipulation of the endocannabinoid system in murine colitis has proven to be largely beneficial in attenuating inflammation, there is a paucity of human study data. Further research is essential to clearly elucidate the specific mechanisms driving this anti-inflammatory effect for the development of therapeutics to target inflammatory disease such as IBD.

### Insights into the role of cannabis in the management of inflammatory bowel disease [^bdd660b8]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Over the last decade, interest in the therapeutic potential of cannabis and its constituents (e.g. cannabidiol) in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) has escalated. Cannabis has been increasingly approved for a variety of medical conditions in several jurisdictions around the world. In animal models, cannabinoids have been shown to improve intestinal inflammation in experimental models of IBD through their interaction with the endocannabinoid system. However, the few randomized controlled trials of cannabis or cannabidiol in patients with IBD have not demonstrated efficacy in modulating inflammatory disease activity. Cannabis may be effective in the symptomatic management of IBD. Given the increasing utilization and cultural acceptance of cannabis, physicians need to be aware of its safety and efficacy in order to better counsel patients. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the role of cannabis in the management of patients with IBD.

### Effects of oral, smoked, and vaporized cannabis on endocrine pathways related to appetite and metabolism: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, human laboratory study [^a7e9b3ee]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Perspectives on cannabis (marijuana) use are shifting throughout the world, politically and scientifically. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, cannabis is the most commonly cultivated, trafficked, and used illicit drug worldwide, with an estimated 192.2 million users (3.9% of the global population). With cannabis medicalization and legalization increasing, the prevalence of cannabis use, in various forms, is also predicted to increase,. Several studies indicate that recreational cannabis use can have detrimental effects on physical and mental health –. On the other hand, continued work on cannabinoids for medical use resulted in the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) approval of cannabidiol (CBD), in the form of Epidiolex, for treating rare and severe forms of epilepsy, and of synthetic ∆9-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), dronabinol, and nabilone, for preventing nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy. Accordingly, understanding the physiological and behavioral effects of cannabis use, recreationally or medicinally, is of paramount importance.

### Evidence supporting the benefits of marijuana for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is extremely limited: a meta-analysis of the literature [^448f2c22]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Medical marijuana is increasingly used to control inflammation and pain in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We performed a meta-analysis to investigate the effect of marijuana on the clinical response, induction of clinical remission, and maintenance of clinical remission compared to placebo/standard of care.

Methods

We performed a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science in June 2019, for cannabis/marijuana and IBD, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis (UC). The statistical analysis was performed using Revman (version 5.3). GRADE methodology was used to assess the quality of the evidence.

Results

Of the 334 studies initially reviewed, 1 trial in UC and 2 trials in Crohn's disease met eligibility. For UC, 29 patients were treated with marijuana and 31 with placebo/standard of care. There was no difference in failure to achieve clinical remission (relative risk [RR] 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-1.37) or response (RR 0.99, 95%CI 0.65-1.21). Adverse events occurred in all patients receiving marijuana (RR 1.28, 95%CI 1.05-1.56). For Crohn's disease, 21 patients were treated with marijuana and 19 with placebo/standard of care. There was no difference in failure to achieve clinical remission (RR 0.72, 95%CI 0.47-1.12) or failure to achieve clinical response (RR 0.15, 95%CI 0.02-1.05). Adverse events were not reported per patient. The quality of evidence was low to very low using GRADE methodology.

Conclusions

Data supporting the use of marijuana for the management of IBD are extremely limited. Further well-designed studies are needed before any positive conclusions regarding marijuana use can be drawn.

### Clinical management of cannabis withdrawal [^6bc093d9]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Psychiatric comorbidity

There is a well‐documented dose–response relationship between the level of cannabis use, CUD and psychiatric comorbidity. A differential diagnosis therefore requires assessment of concurrent mental health disorders, symptoms of which may be exacerbated by or mimic cannabis withdrawal. In a national stratified Australian sample, 70% of adults who met CUD criteria in the past year had at least one other psychiatric disorder. In US national surveys, having a CUD in the past 12 months is associated with increased risk of post‐traumatic stress disorder [PTSD; odds ratio (OR) = 4.3], personality disorder (OR = 4.8), mood disorders (OR = 3.8) and anxiety disorders (OR = 2.8). Heavy cannabis use increases psychosis risk, and cannabis use worsens symptoms of schizophrenia.

Physical comorbidities

It is beyond the scope of this review to provide a comprehensive description of physical conditions that should be considered in a differential diagnosis for cannabis withdrawal. As cannabis withdrawal symptoms can mirror other physical disorders, a comprehensive medical review with an emphasis on gastrointestinal and neurological systems is recommended.

### Endocannabinoid system and cannabis hyperemesis syndrome: a narrative update [^5adb2204]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Cannabis use has been increasing in the United States and throughout the world. It is derived from one of the earliest plants cultivated by humans - Cannabis sativa. Cannabis (also called marijuana) is the most commonly used psychoactive substance worldwide. The cannabis plant has more than 400 chemicals, of which more than 100 cannabinoids (such as cannabigerol, cannabidiol, and cannabinol) have been identified. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) plays an essential role in the effects of cannabis on end organs. Although cannabis use has been reported for many decades, some of its unique adverse effects of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, termed as cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (CHS), were noted recently. The legal status of cannabis in the United States has been rapidly changing from state to state. The incidence of CHS is expected to rise with rising access to cannabis in the United States. Furthermore, CHS is frequently underdiagnosed due to a lack of uniform criteria, subjective nature of symptoms, and overlap with cyclical vomiting syndrome (CVS). Understanding the ECS and its role in biphasic response (proemetic and antiemetic) of CHS is critical to explain its pathophysiology. As the use of cannabis increases globally, awareness of CHS is warranted for early recognition and prompt treatment to avoid complications. We describe the putative mechanism of CHS with an overview of the clinical features in these patients. Furthermore, we highlight the differences between CHS and CVS with important differentials to consider. We provide a narrative update on the current evidence on CHS pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, and identifying research gaps.

### Cannabis for the treatment of ulcerative colitis [^6ec0077b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cannabis and cannabinoids are often promoted as treatment for many illnesses and are widely used among patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Few studies have evaluated the use of these agents in UC. Further, cannabis has potential for adverse events and the long-term consequences of cannabis and cannabinoid use in UC are unknown.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of cannabis and cannabinoids for the treatment of patients with UC.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, WHO ICTRP, AMED, PsychINFO, the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.Gov and the European Clinical Trials Register from inception to 2 January 2018. Conference abstracts and references were searched to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any form or dose of cannabis or its cannabinoid derivatives (natural or synthetic) to placebo or an active therapy for adults (> 18 years) with UC were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcomes were clinical remission and relapse (as defined by the primary studies). Secondary outcomes included clinical response, endoscopic remission, endoscopic response, histological response, quality of life, C-reactive protein (CRP) and fecal calprotectin measurements, symptom improvement, adverse events, serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, psychotropic adverse events, and cannabis dependence and withdrawal effects. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval for dichotomous outcomes. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) and corresponding 95% CI. Data were pooled for analysis when the interventions, patient groups and outcomes were sufficiently similar (determined by consensus). Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. GRADE was used to evaluate the overall certainty of evidence.

Main Results

Two RCTs (92 participants) met the inclusion criteria. One study (N = 60) compared 10 weeks of cannabidiol capsules with up to 4.7% D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) with placebo capsules in participants with mild to moderate UC. The starting dose of cannabidiol was 50 mg twice daily increasing to 250 mg twice daily if tolerated. Another study (N = 32) compared 8 weeks of therapy with two cannabis cigarettes per day containing 0.5 g of cannabis, corresponding to 23 mg THC/day to placebo cigarettes in participants with UC who did not respond to conventional medical treatment. No studies were identified that assessed cannabis therapy in quiescent UC. The first study was rated as low risk of bias and the second study (published as an abstract) was rated as high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel. The studies were not pooled due to differences in the interventional drug.The effect of cannabidiol capsules (100 mg to 500 mg daily) compared to placebo on clinical remission and response is uncertain. Clinical remission at 10 weeks was achieved by 24% (7/29) of the cannabidiol group compared to 26% (8/31) in the placebo group (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.25; low certainty evidence). Clinical response at 10 weeks was achieved in 31% (9/29) of cannabidiol participants compared to 22% (7/31) of placebo patients (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.59 to 3.21; low certainty evidence). Serum CRP levels were similar in both groups after 10 weeks of therapy. The mean CRP in the cannabidiol group was 9.428 mg/L compared to 7.638 mg/L in the placebo group (MD 1.79, 95% CI -5.67 to 9.25; moderate certainty evidence). There may be a clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life at 10 weeks, measured with the IBDQ scale (MD 17.4, 95% CI -3.45 to 38.25; moderate certainty evidence). Adverse events were more frequent in cannabidiol participants compared to placebo. One hundred per cent (29/29) of cannabidiol participants had an adverse event, compared to 77% (24/31) of placebo participants (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.05 to1.56; moderate certainty evidence). However, these adverse events were considered to be mild or moderate in severity. Common adverse events included dizziness, disturbance in attention, headache, nausea and fatigue. None (0/29) of the cannabidiol participants had a serious adverse event compared to 13% (4/31) of placebo participants (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.11; low certainty evidence). Serious adverse events in the placebo group included worsening of UC and one complicated pregnancy. These serious adverse events were thought to be unrelated to the study drug. More participants in the cannabidiol group withdrew due to an adverse event than placebo participants. Thirty-four per cent (10/29) of cannabidiol participants withdrew due to an adverse event compared to 16% (5/31) of placebo participants (RR 2.14, 95% CI 0.83 to 5.51; low certainty evidence). Withdrawls in the cannabidiol group were mostly due to dizziness. Withdrawals in the placebo group were due to worsening UC.The effect of cannabis cigarettes (23 mg THC/day) compared to placebo on mean disease activity, CRP levels and mean fecal calprotectin levels is uncertain. After 8 weeks, the mean disease activity index score in cannabis participants was 4 compared with 8 in placebo participants (MD -4.00, 95% CI -5.98 to -2.02). After 8 weeks, the mean change in CRP levels was similar in both groups (MD -0.30, 95% CI -1.35 to 0.75; low certainty evidence). The mean fecal calprotectin level in cannabis participants was 115 mg/dl compared to 229 mg/dl in placebo participants (MD -114.00, 95% CI -246.01 to 18.01). No serious adverse events were observed. This study did not report on clinical remission, clinical response, quality of life, adverse events or withdrawal due to adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

The effects of cannabis and cannabidiol on UC are uncertain, thus no firm conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of cannabis or cannabidiol in adults with active UC can be drawn.There is no evidence for cannabis or cannabinoid use for maintenance of remission in UC. Further studies with a larger number of patients are required to assess the effects of cannabis in UC patients with active and quiescent disease. Different doses of cannabis and routes of administration should be investigated. Lastly, follow-up is needed to assess the long term safety outcomes of frequent cannabis use.

Figure 1. 
A schematic representation of the sites of action of cannabis (depicted by the cannabis leaf) in the brain gut axis. Cannabis acts predominantly on CB 1 in the brain and the enteric nervous system of the gastrointestinal tract. CB 2 receptors, located on immune cells, are also sites of action of cannabis, and these cells will be increased in states of inflammation. CB 1 receptors may also regulate gut barrier function at the level of the epithelium. Visceral pain is regulated by CB 1 receptors on spinal primary afferents and in the spinal cord. Nausea and vomiting is regulated by CB 1 and possibly CB 2 receptors in the brainstem (vomiting) and the insular cortex (nausea). Adapted from Maccarrone and colleagues.

The two primary endocannabinoid receptors that have been isolated are the G-protein coupled cannabinoid receptors CB 1 and CB 2.CB 1 receptors are located primarily on neural tissue including central and peripheral neurons as well as the enteric nervous system (Figure 1).CB 2 receptors are also expressed in the central nervous system, although most are located in immune tissues, including neutrophils, macrophages, epithelial cells, and subsets of T and B cells. In general, CB 1 signaling mediates neuromodulatory function, while CB 2 signaling mediates immunomodulatory activity.

CB 1 receptors are important in the control of gastrointestinal motility and gastric intestinal secretion. CB 1 receptor agonists were shown to reduce gastrointestinal propulsion and transit in animal models. Although the action on secretory function has been less studied, one study did demonstrate that gastric acid secretion was reduced with CB 1 activation.This suggests a therapeutic potential for the treatment of diarrhea in patients with IBD.

CB 1 receptor activation has also been demonstrated to increase appetite, and to promote food intake and energy conservation.

Several in vitro studies have demonstrated the importance of both the CB 1 and CB 2 in modulating intestinal inflammation. CB 1 and CB 2 receptor agonists reduced experimentally induced intestinal inflammation in several murine studies, whereas antagonists were shown to exacerbate inflammation. – The ECS was physiologically involved in protecting against excessive colonic inflammation with activation of these receptors, dampening smooth muscle irritation and controlling cellular pathways involved in inflammatory responses.Activation of the CB 1 and CB 2 receptors was also demonstrated to reduce visceral sensitivity and pain associated with colonic distention in animal models. –

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^16eeb2db]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Gastroparesis—cannabidiol (CBD) and marijuana evidence, safety, and research needs: The single study demonstrating efficacy for CBD in gastroparesis used pharmaceutical-grade CBD (Epidiolex) in patients with idiopathic and diabetes-associated gastroparesis, and a clinically important reduction in vomiting, early satiety, and abdominal pain was reported. There was no clinically important difference in the risk of serious adverse events (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.07 to 16.43; N/n = 1/44) and no adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment were reported. The overall CoE was low and was rated down due to serious to very serious imprecision. Although the study that evaluated the use of CBD was well-designed with positive results, the panel felt that larger studies are needed, specifically looking at different formulations more likely to be available to patients. Marijuana and CBD can slow gastric emptying, which might aggravate symptoms in some patients, particularly those with severely delayed gastric emptying, and there is the concern that frequent CBD use in the absence of FDA-approved non–THC-contaminated formulations could lead to worsening nausea and vomiting as part of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. Long-term daily administration of cannabis, or marijuana, is associated with cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome and has also been associated with depression, anxiety, and respiratory issues; although there are few adverse effects with CBD, longterm use of CBD may be linked to liver damage and thyroid issues, and further research is needed to understand any potential adverse effects from chronic CBD use specifically.

Endocannabinoid system and its mechanism of action in the GI tract

Endocannabinoids and their degrading enzymes

Cannabis or its constituents exert their effects through CB1 and CB2 receptors, found throughout the GI system (liver, pancreas, stomach, small and large intestines (Fig. 2). Two potent endocannabinoid ligands that yield strong cannabimimetic effects are anandamide (N-arachidonoyl ethanolamine [AEA]) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Other endocannabinoids include noladin ether, virodhamine and N-arachidonoyl dopamine. In addition to cannabinoid receptors, endocannabinoids bind to some other receptors, including TRPV1 and GPR55 (a G-protein coupled receptor), and can exert their effects via these. Endocannabinoid-degrading enzymes (fatty acid amide hydrolases [FAAH] and monoacylglycerol lipase [MAGL]) have also been identified. Anandamide is degraded mainly by FAAH, but also by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and lipoxygenases (LOXs) to some extent. However, the degradation of 2-AG is complex. It is degraded by MAGL, but also sometimes acts as a substrate for COX-2, LOXs and some minor enzymes such as α/β hydrolase-6 and α/β hydrolase-12. Endogenous ligands, together with the cannabinoid receptors and enzymes responsible for synthesizing and degrading those ligands, form the endocannabinoid system (ECS).

Locations of endocannabinoids in GI tract

Functions of the CB1 and CB2 receptors are ascertained by their locations in the organ systems. In the gut, CB1 receptors are found in the myenteric plexus (responsible for motor control of the GI tract) and submucosal plexus (responsible for secretomotor and vasomotor actions of the gut). CB2 receptors are present in the immune cells, such as plasma cells and macrophages, in the lamina propria of the GI tract and are also thought to be present in peripheral nerve terminals. CB2 receptors have also been identified in normal colonic mucosa as well as inflamed mucosa.

Patients will often turn to complementary medications, including cannabis, in the management of their IBD. Many physicians are unaware of the potential therapeutic role of cannabis, due to its relatively recent emergence and legalization for medical use. They should, however, be familiar with the its current use, evidence for a role in symptom management and disease control, as well as potential adverse effects, in order to safely advise patients. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the role of cannabis in the management of patients with IBD.

### Alcohol and cannabis consumption in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: prevalence, pattern of consumption and impact on the disease [^2d0f1f71]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

In the last couple of years, the use of medical cannabis has gained popularity after the discovery of the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. The latter has a key role in maintaining gut homeostasis by modulating motility, inflammation, perception of visceral pain and immune tolerance, notably by altering proinflammatory cytokine-induced chemotaxis (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8). Data suggest that exogenous cannabis reduces symptoms associated with IBD but a recent randomized controlled trial shows that this improvement is not associated with a decrease in inflammatory activity. Solid data concerning the prevalence, the patterns of consumption and the effects of alcohol and cannabis use on the clinical course of IBD patients are still lacking, including large prospective studies. Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of alcohol and cannabis consumption among IBD patients in Switzerland and to cross-sectionally and prospectively evaluate its influence on the disease.

### Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome: an update on the pathophysiology and management [^bf8fe97a]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyperemesis induced by cannabis

Cannabis has traditionally been used as an appetite stimulant and antiemetic drug and is FDA approved for chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting when traditional therapy fails. It has multiple effects on the gastrointestinal system, including secretions, appetite stimulation, modulation of inflammation, and motility [-]. However, its use is also associated with CHS, signifying its biphasic effect. Disorders involving the gut-brain axis, such as irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, functional nausea, and vomiting disorders, have been shown to be related to abnormalities in psychological status, visceral hypersensitivity, dysfunction of autonomic activity and gastric emptying. Cannabis consists of more than 100 types of cannabinoidal agents, and its potency is determined by the ratio of THC and other cannabinoidal agents. Therefore, this ratio also determines the toxicity during its use. The role of cannabis’s antiemetic activity is demonstrated in both species capable of vomiting (ferrets, least shrews, musk shrews) and those that are not, such as rodents [-]. In shrews and ferrets, anandamide (AEA) and arachidonolyglycerol (2-AG) reduce emesis in a dose-dependent fashion. CB agonists (both natural and synthetic) and transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) agonists have demonstrated antiemetic effects. In animals such as rodents, which lack a vomiting reflex, indirect markers of vomiting are used (taste avoidance, conditioned gaping, change in the facial expression). Cannabinoids reduced these behaviors in rodents suggestive of their anti-emetic effect.

### The endocannabinoid system: role in energy regulation [^91a7b653]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Cannabis sativa has been used since antiquity to treat many ailments, including eating disorders. The primary psychoactive constituent of this plant, Δ(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is an FDA approved medication to treat nausea and emesis caused by cancer chemotherapeutic agents as well as to stimulate appetite in AIDS patients suffering from cachexia. The effects of THC are mediated through the endocannabinoid system (ECS), which promotes a positive energy balance through stimulation of appetite as well as shifting homeostatic mechanisms toward energy storage. Here we discuss the physiological function of the ECS in energy balance and the therapeutic potential of targeting this system.

### New approaches and challenges to targeting the endocannabinoid system [^b2cf5ba0]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2018). Medium credibility.

The endocannabinoid signalling system was discovered because receptors in this system are the targets of compounds present in psychotropic preparations of Cannabis sativa. The search for new therapeutics that target endocannabinoid signalling is both challenging and potentially rewarding, as endocannabinoids are implicated in numerous physiological and pathological processes. Hundreds of mediators chemically related to the endocannabinoids, often with similar metabolic pathways but different targets, have complicated the development of inhibitors of endocannabinoid metabolic enzymes but have also stimulated the rational design of multi-target drugs. Meanwhile, drugs based on botanical cannabinoids have come to the clinical forefront, synthetic agonists designed to bind cannabinoid receptor 1 with very high affinity have become a societal threat and the gut microbiome has been found to signal in part through the endocannabinoid network. The current development of drugs that alter endocannabinoid signalling and how this complex system could be pharmacologically manipulated in the future are described in this Opinion article.

### Endocannabinoid signaling in stress, nausea, and vomiting [^2859abb9]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Classical antiemetics that target the serotonin system may not be effective in treating certain nausea and vomiting conditions like cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) and cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). As a result, there is a need for better therapies to manage the symptoms of these disorders, including nausea, vomiting, and anxiety. Cannabis is often used for its purported antiemetic and anxiolytic effects, given regulation of these processes by the endocannabinoid system (ECS). However, there is considerable evidence that cannabinoids can also produce nausea and vomiting and increase anxiety in certain instances, especially at higher doses. This paradoxical effect of cannabinoids on nausea, vomiting, and anxiety may be due to the dysregulation of the ECS, altering how it maintains these processes and contributing to the pathophysiology of CVS or CHS.

Purpose

The purpose of this review is to highlight the involvement of the ECS in the regulation of stress, nausea, and vomiting. We discuss how prolonged cannabis use, such as in the case of CHS or heightened stress, can dysregulate the ECS and affect its modulation of these functions. The review also examines the evidence for the roles of ECS and stress systems' dysfunction in CVS and CHS to better understand the underlying mechanisms of these conditions.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome in pediatrics: an emerging problem [^d785bf64]. Pediatrics in Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Cannabis use has been evolving in both recreational drug use and medicinal uses, in part due to the recent introduction of various strains and components. With increasing use, we have seen emergence of a hyperemesis syndrome called cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome characterized as intractable vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain in the context of prolonged cannabinoid use. Although the antiemetic properties of cannabis have been known for years, the paradoxical effect of hyperemesis has yet to be elucidated. Herein we discuss the current research, epidemiology, and diagnosis and treatment of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome. Without timely diagnosis and treatment, patients may experience significant physical and emotional distress, as well as place unnecessary financial burden on the medical system.

In addition to CB 1 and CB 2, other molecular targets for the cannabinoids have been identified, including the G-protein coupled receptors 18, 55, and 119 (GRP55 and GRP119); the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR); the serotonin-1A receptor (5-HT1A); and the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1.),– The administration of cannabis, through its interaction with the various receptors of the ECS, modulates the gastrointestinal system by increasing appetite and reducing nausea, gastric secretions, intestinal contractility, peristalsis, visceral sensation as well as intestinal inflammation (Figure 1).

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^40ab54f0]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Cannabinoid has several types of receptors. The active ingredients (cannabinoids) of cannabis are tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol and cannabigerol, and they are thought to be responsible for CHS by interacting with the receptors listed below. Their interaction has yet to be fully understood, but tetrahydrocannabinol is thought to exert the most effect.

Type 1 (CB-1) causes cannabis-related cognitive and memory disturbances with nausea and vomiting. Chronic cannabis use can result in derangement of the endogenous CB-1 system, downregulating this receptor and causing rebound vomiting and spasmodic pain. This resolves and recovers on cannabis cessation.
Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a non-selective cation channel activated by noxious heat and capsaicin. This receptor is present throughout the gastrointestinal tract, including in several sensory neurons, enteric neurons in the myenteric plexus and epithelial cells in the gastric mucosa.It is also found in the central nervous system, especially in the area postrema, also known as the chemoreceptor trigger zone. Activation of this receptor has a potent antiemetic effect, which is thought to be mediated by the depletion of substance P from neural circuits travelling to the nucleus tractus solitarius.

Both CB-1 and TRPV1 are activated by exogenous cannabinoids.Laboratory studies show that exogenous cannabinoids lead to dephosphorylation and subsequent receptor desensitisation.Chronic exposure to cannabinoids could lead to downregulation or desensitisation of TRPV1 signalling, explaining how prolonged exposure to cannabinoids might result in decreased TRPV1 signalling, altered gastric motility and emesis (figure 1).

Table 1 
Cannabinoid induced modulation of gastrointestinal symptoms through CB1 and CB2 receptors

It has been shown that the co-activation of CB1 and CB2 receptors is essential for effective emesis control by endocannabinoids, possibly by blocking the endocannabinoid reuptake by CB2. A Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved synthetic form of THC, dronabinol, has been in use for therapeutic purposes in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (for patients resistant to conventional anti-emetic therapies) and HIV-associated anorexia with weight loss since 1985. A synthetic oral cannabinoid, nabilone, is also now FDA-approved for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in patients on chemotherapy who fail to respond to conventional antiemetic treatments. Another synthetic preparation, levonantradol, is undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced vomiting, with promising results. However, it is not yet FDA approved. Despite the widely known use of cannabinoid products for controlling various type of nausea and vomiting, cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome can occur in patients who use it for years. It is a condition of cyclical vomiting and compulsive bathing behaviors and only gets diagnosed when other causes are ruled out.

How Can Marijuana Affect Your Heath. Even though more research is needed to fully understand some of the health effects of marijuana, we know marijuana use may have a wide range of effects on the brain and body. Brain Development and Function
- Developing brains, such as those in babies, children, and teenagers, are especially susceptible to harmful effects of marijuana and THC. Using marijuana during adolescence or young adulthood, before the brain is fully developed, may affect how the brain builds connections for functions like attention, memory, and learning. These effects may last a long time or even be permanent.
- Recent marijuana use directly affects parts of the brain responsible for decision-making, coordination, emotions, and reaction time and can impair important skills required for safe driving.

Heart and Lungs
- Smoking any product, including marijuana, can damage the lungs, increase risk of bronchitis, and scar small blood vessels. Smoking marijuana can also increase the risk for stroke, heart disease, and other vascular diseases. Mental Health
- Marijuana use has been linked to social anxiety, depression, suicide, and schizophrenia. Scientists don’t yet know whether marijuana use directly causes these health issues, but it may make symptoms more severe. Inhaling or Eating Marijuana
- Vaping THC-containing products has been linked to lung injury and even death. Use of concentrates in vaping or dabbing devices delivers very high levels of THC to the user and may carry health risks because of the high concentration or strength of THC being used.
- Eating edibles can take longer to kick in compared to smoking marijuana.

The delayed effect of consuming edibles may increase the risk of consuming too much, which can lead to poisoning or serious injury.
- Epidiolex contains purified CBD from the marijuana plant. The drug is approved for treating seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy as well as seizures associated with a rare genetic disorder.
- Dronabinol and nabilone are made from lab-created chemicals that act like THC by turning on cannabis receptors in the brain. These two medications are used to treat nausea in patients with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy treatment and to increase appetite in individuals with AIDS who do not feel like eating.

For example, these compounds have been shown to induce apoptosis in glioma cells in culture and induce regression of glioma tumors in mice and rats, while they protect normal glial cells of astroglial and oligodendroglial lineages from apoptosis mediated by the CB1 receptor. The effects of delta-9-THC and a synthetic agonist of the CB2 receptor were investigated in HCC. Both agents reduced the viability of HCC cells. in vitro study with multiple human glioblastoma multiforme cell lines. In an in vitro model, CBD increased TRPV2 activation and increased uptake of cytotoxic drugs, leading to apoptosis of glioma cells without affecting normal human astrocytes. This suggests that coadministration of CBD with cytotoxic agents may increase drug uptake and potentiate cell death in human glioma cells. Antiemetic Effects Preclinical research suggests that emetic circuitry is tonically controlled by endocannabinoids.

The antiemetic action of cannabinoids is believed to be mediated via interaction with the 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor. CB1 receptors and 5-HT3 receptors are colocalized on gamma-aminobutyric acid -ergic neurons, where they have opposite effects on GABA release. There also may be direct inhibition of 5-HT3 gated ion currents through non–CB1 receptor pathways. CB1 receptor antagonists have been shown to elicit emesis in the least shrew that is reversed by cannabinoid agonists. The involvement of CB1 receptor in emesis prevention has been shown by the ability of CB1 antagonists to reverse the effects of THC and other synthetic cannabinoid CB1 agonists in suppressing vomiting caused by cisplatin in the house musk shrew and lithium chloride in the least shrew. Taken by mouth, delta-9-THC is initially metabolized in the liver to 11-OH-THC, a potent psychoactive metabolite.

Inhaled cannabinoids are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream with a peak concentration in 2 to 10 minutes, declining rapidly for a period of 30 minutes and with less generation of the psychoactive 11-OH metabolite.

d) Side effects of cannabinoids: psychiatric, neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms

Side effects (Table 2) were assessed in two-arm studies, where cannabinoid use almost doubled the risk of gastrointestinal adverse effects (OR: 1.88, CI: 1.14;3.11). The most frequently reported were diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, or stomatitis. Neurological side effects included confusion, difficulty concentrating, coordination problems, and dizziness and were twice as common in the cannabinoid group (OR: 2.06, CI:1.15;3.68), regardless of the THC/CBD content. Notably, psychiatric side effects (hallucinations, delusion, paranoia, psychosis, nightmares, anxiety, and mood swings) were three times more prevalent in the intervention group (OR: 3.24, CI:1.48;7.1), and even ten times higher for THC-predominant drugs (OR: 10.62, CI:1.35;83.57). Overall, the odds of discontinuation of cannabinoid treatment due to side effects were 1.53 (CI:0.99;2.35), with twofold higher values for THC-predominant products (OR: 3.01, CI:0.32;27.89). This effect was approximately twice as large for THC-predominant products, with an OR of 3.01 (CI: 0.32–27.89).

### Medical marijuana for cancer [^59f3a723]. CA (2015). Low credibility.

Answer questions and earn CME/CNE Marijuana has been used for centuries, and interest in its medicinal properties has been increasing in recent years. Investigations into these medicinal properties has led to the development of cannabinoid pharmaceuticals such as dronabinol, nabilone, and nabiximols. Dronabinol is best studied in the treatment of nausea secondary to cancer chemotherapy and anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for those indications. Nabilone has been best studied for the treatment of nausea secondary to cancer chemotherapy. There are also limited studies of these drugs for other conditions. Nabiximols is only available in the United States through clinical trials, but is used in Canada and the United Kingdom for the treatment of spasticity secondary to multiple sclerosis and pain. Studies of marijuana have concentrated on nausea, appetite, and pain. This article will review the literature regarding the medical use of marijuana and these cannabinoid pharmaceuticals (with emphasis on indications relevant to oncology), as well as available information regarding adverse effects of marijuana use.

### Nabilone administration in refractory chronic diarrhea: a case series [^ba4c63b1]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

In recent years, the knowledge of the ECS and its role in the gut has grown rapidly. The actions of the ECS appear to be largely homeostatic, contributing to the gut protection from inflammation and regulating GI motility. CB1 receptors are expressed in the normal human colon and in the enteric nervous system (ENS), regulating neurotransmitters release, intestinal smooth muscle tone and peristalsis, whereas CB2 receptors were found in the lamina propria and in the ENS. Rimonabant, an inverse agonist of CB1 receptors, was able to increase colonic motility in mice, while the agonist activity of dronabinol inhibited gastric emptying and colonic motility in healthy humans. Furthermore, the endocannabinoid signalling is intensified during intestinal inflammation; CB2 receptors are up regulated in colonic mucosal samples from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and JWH-133, a CB2 receptor agonist, inhibits the increase in GI transit elicited by an intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharides. These results are consistent in over than 10% of patients with IBD, who confirmed that they had used cannabis as self-medication at least once in their life, and most of them found that marijuana was very helpful to relieve abdominal pain and diarrhea. Accordingly, cannabinoids acting on CB1 and CB2 receptors might have beneficial effects for patients with symptoms of abdominal pain, inflammation and hypermotility. The latter often coexist in chronic diarrhea. Chronic diarrhea is defined as a symptom with at least three bowel movements per day, with a faecal weight of more than 200 g/day, lasting for at least four weeks. It is due to many non-specific causes; as a result, patients take nonspecific antidiarrheal therapy (such as opiates, intraluminal pro-absorptive agents or glucocorticoids) for several months, and do not solve their problem.

### The emerging role of the endocannabinoid system in endocrine regulation and energy balance [^91c15716]. Endocrine Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

During the last few years, the endocannabinoid system has emerged as a highly relevant topic in the scientific community. Many different regulatory actions have been attributed to endocannabinoids, and their involvement in several pathophysiological conditions is under intense scrutiny. Cannabinoid receptors, named CB1 receptor and CB2 receptor, first discovered as the molecular targets of the psychotropic component of the plant Cannabis sativa, participate in the physiological modulation of many central and peripheral functions. CB2 receptor is mainly expressed in immune cells, whereas CB1 receptor is the most abundant G protein-coupled receptor expressed in the brain. CB1 receptor is expressed in the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, and its activation is known to modulate all the endocrine hypothalamic-peripheral endocrine axes. An increasing amount of data highlights the role of the system in the stress response by influencing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and in the control of reproduction by modifying gonadotropin release, fertility, and sexual behavior. The ability of the endocannabinoid system to control appetite, food intake, and energy balance has recently received great attention, particularly in the light of the different modes of action underlying these functions. The endocannabinoid system modulates rewarding properties of food by acting at specific mesolimbic areas in the brain. In the hypothalamus, CB1 receptor and endocannabinoids are integrated components of the networks controlling appetite and food intake. Interestingly, the endocannabinoid system was recently shown to control metabolic functions by acting on peripheral tissues, such as adipocytes, hepatocytes, the gastrointestinal tract, and, possibly, skeletal muscle. The relevance of the system is further strenghtened by the notion that drugs interfering with the activity of the endocannabinoid system are considered as promising candidates for the treatment of various diseases, including obesity.

Experimental evidence suggests the endogenous cannabinoid system may protect against colonic inflammation, leading to the possibility that activation of this system may have a therapeutic role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Medicinal use of cannabis for chronic pain and other symptoms has been reported in a number of medical conditions. We aimed to evaluate cannabis use in patients with IBD.

Methods

One hundred patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 191 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) attending a tertiary-care outpatient clinic completed a questionnaire regarding current and previous cannabis use, socioeconomic factors, disease history and medication use, including complimentary alternative medicines. Quality of life was assessed using the short-inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire.

Results

A comparable proportion of UC and CD patients reported lifetime [48/95 (51%) UC vs. 91/189 (48%) CD] or current [11/95 (12%) UC vs. 30/189 (16%) CD] cannabis use. Of lifetime users, 14/43 (33%) UC and 40/80 (50%) CD patients have used it to relieve IBD-related symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhoea and reduced appetite. Patients were more likely to use cannabis for symptom relief if they had a history of abdominal surgery [29/48 (60%) vs. 24/74 (32%); P=0.002], chronic analgesic use [29/41 (71%) vs. 25/81 (31%); P<0.001], complimentary alternative medicine use [36/66 (55%) vs. 18/56 (32%); P=0.01] and a lower short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire score (45.1±2.1 vs. 50.3±1.5; P=0.03). Patients who had used cannabis [60/139 (43%)] were more likely than nonusers [13/133 (10%); P<0.001 vs. users] to express an interest in participating in a hypothetical therapeutic trial of cannabis for IBD.

Conclusion

Cannabis use is common amongst patients with IBD for symptom relief, particularly amongst those with a history of abdominal surgery, chronic abdominal pain and/or a low quality of life index. The therapeutic benefits of cannabinoid derivatives in IBD may warrant further exploration.

### Patients' perspectives on marijuana use for inflammatory bowel disease: a multicenter survey [^2314bce9]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

As marijuana use is rising among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), so is interest in its potential use as a therapeutic agent. We sought to survey IBD patients regarding marijuana use, self-reported impact on IBD symptoms, and perceptions of safety.

Methods

A multicenter anonymous survey was administered to patients with IBD between October 2020 and June 2021. The 70-question survey collected demographic variables, clinical variables, attitudes about marijuana, and perceptions of its safety and efficacy in IBD. Participants were classified by their marijuana use: "rarely/never," "current," and "former". Percentage and chi-square tests were used to compare categorical variables between the 3 groups, and means and 2-group ANOVA were used for continuous variables.

Results

Of 181 patients surveyed, 166 were eligible for the study. Of these, 70 (42.2%) participants were rare/never marijuana users, 44 (26.5%) were current users, and 52 (31.3%) were former users. Fifty-three percent thought marijuana would help with IBD inflammation and 80% thought it would help with IBD pain. Over 70% of patients from all groups thought marijuana had a low-to-moderate risk of harm, and 69.6% of the participants who never or rarely used marijuana thought marijuana was addictive, compared to 20.5% of the current users and 44% of the former marijuana users.

Conclusions

While many patients thought marijuana use helps with IBD-related pain and inflammation, many expressed concerns about addiction to marijuana and a possible risk of harm. Further studies are needed to examine the benefit and harm of marijuana in IBD.

### Meta-analysis of the therapeutic impact of cannabinoids in inflammatory bowel disease [^ef772abb]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

With the increasing legalization of medical and recreational cannabis, patients and providers have growing interest in the role of cannabinoids in treating inflammatory bowel disease. Prior meta-analysis has shown inconclusive evidence for efficacy of cannabinoids. We sought to produce an up-to-date meta-analysis that pools new data to evaluate the therapeutic effects of cannabinoids in both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).

Methods

PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL and CINAHL were queried for randomized-controlled trials evaluating the impact cannabinoids in CD or UC. Random effects modeling was used to compute pooled estimates of risk difference. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2.

Results

Eight studies, including 4 studies of CD, 3 studies of UC, and 1 study of both diseases met inclusion criteria. Among 5 studies of CD, a statistically significant decrease in clinical disease activity following intervention was observed (risk ratios [RR], -0.91; 95% CI, CI:1.54 to CI:0.28, I2=71.9%). Clinical disease activity in UC was not significantly lower in the pooled analysis (RR, -2.13; 95% CI, -4.80 to 0.55; I2=90.3%). Improvement in quality of life (QoL) was observed in both CD and UC combined (RR, 1.79; 95% CI, 0.92-0.2.66; I2=82.8%), as well as individually. No differences were observed in the analysis on endoscopic disease activity and inflammatory markers.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis of clinical trials suggests that cannabinoids are associated with improved quality of life in both CD and UC, as well as improved disease activity but not inflammation.

### The effect of medical cannabis on gastrointestinal symptoms in fibromyalgia and disorders of gut-brain interaction: a patient ‑ centred real ‑ world observational study [^c9adfd0d]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Fibromyalgia (FM) is frequently associated with gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBIs). Current treatments for FM offer limited relief, leading to the exploration of alternative therapies such as medical cannabis. This study evaluates in the impact of Bedrocan® medical cannabis in FM patients and GI symptoms over six months.

Methods

Sixty FM patients were enrolled, receiving a Bedrocan® cannabis treatment for 6 months. A standardised questionnaire evaluating upper and lower GI symptoms and the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQR) evaluating FM severity were administered at enrolment and 3 and 6-month follow-up evaluations. DGBIs, in particular, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and functional dyspepsia (FD) were diagnosed according to Rome IV criteria.

Results

Forty-six/60 (76.6%) FM patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for at least one DGBI; 10/60 (16.7%) FM patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for IBS, 17/60 (28.3%) for FD, and 19/60 (31.7%) for both IBS/FD. The FIQR severity score log-transformed significantly decreased during the months-by-month comparison period (repeated-measures ANOVA, p<0.001). Among GI symptoms, the log-transformed intensity-frequency score of epigastric pain, epigastric burning, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and bloating significantly decreased during the month-by-month comparison period (repeated-measures ANOVA, p<0.01).

Conclusions

This study supports Bedrocan® medical cannabis as an alternative treatment for FM with a potential effect on FD and IBS symptoms. Despite positive outcomes, the study acknowledges limitations, such as the small sample size and absence of a control group. Further research is required to confirm the efficacy of medical cannabis in FM patients, particularly regarding its effects on GI symptoms.

Cannabinoids therapeutic effects and pediatric evidence limits—adult symptom control and adverse effects are described, while pediatric efficacy is limited: In adults, cannabinoids “have been shown to be helpful for adults in addressing some symptoms, such as increasing appetite and decreasing nausea and vomiting in patients receiving chemotherapy and reducing pain in chronic neuropathic pain syndromes,” but “may have adverse effects, however, such as dizziness, dysphoria, and clouded sensorium,” and “the only studies … in children and adolescents have been limited to its use in the treatment of refractory seizures.”

### Cannabinoids: potential anticancer agents [^b3a5e352]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2003). Medium credibility.

Cannabinoids - the active components of Cannabis sativa and their derivatives - exert palliative effects in cancer patients by preventing nausea, vomiting and pain and by stimulating appetite. In addition, these compounds have been shown to inhibit the growth of tumour cells in culture and animal models by modulating key cell-signalling pathways. Cannabinoids are usually well tolerated, and do not produce the generalized toxic effects of conventional chemotherapies. So, could cannabinoids be used to develop new anticancer therapies?

### Role of chronic cannabis use: cyclic vomiting syndrome vs cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome [^f4b2d005]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Medium credibility.

Taken together, these and other findings indicate that cannabinoid receptor agonists inhibit vomiting and that CB1 receptor antagonists initiate or potentiate vomiting. Thus, the ECS is well positioned to play a major role in both CVS and CHS. We speculate that the paradoxical effects of chronic cannabis may be caused by differential degrees of CB1R downregulation in genetically predisposed individuals. This potential mechanism is supported by studies in rats which show that CB1R downregulation occurs after prolonged and repeated exposure to cannabis inducing tolerance to its effects. 26 Postmortem studies in humans also demonstrate CB1R downregulation in the human brain with chronic cannabis use compared to non‐users. 27 Other reasons for the paradoxical emetic effects of chronic cannabis use could be the result of increasing potency of cannabis (with higher ratios of THC to cannabidiol) and prolonged duration of use. It is likely that cannabis has a biphasic mechanism of action, where it has anti‐emetic effects at lower or less frequent dosing but is pro‐emetic at higher or more sustained doses. Additionally, cannabis also has peripheral effects and affects gastric motility in both animal and clinical models. Δ 9 ‐tetrahydrocannabinol reduced rates of gastric emptying in mice and rats and caused a significant delay in gastric motility when administered to healthy volunteers, which may contribute to episodes of hyperemesis. 28, 29 These findings are of clinical importance and must be considered if gastric emptying studies are performed in patients with disorders of cyclic vomiting who use cannabis.

### ACOG clinical consensus no. 7: the use of cannabis products for the management of pain associated with gynecologic conditions [^387814d4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). High credibility.

Associated effects and drug interactions of cannabis, THC, and CBD include cognitive and systemic adverse effects and specific counseling points. Cognitive effects associated with cannabis, particularly with higher concentrations of THC, include intoxication, decreased short-term memory, impaired perception, impaired motor skills, somnolence, insomnia, and, for adolescents, an increase in suicidality, with additional adverse effects such as dry mouth, respiratory effects from inhaled products, transaminase elevation, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and rashes. Clinicians should be aware that some users may develop a cannabis use disorder. For interactions with FDA-approved CBD- or THC-containing medications, clinicians and patients should refer to the product labeling, while non–FDA-approved products may have varying concentrations and unknown dosages that pose interaction risks; many commonly prescribed medications potentially could result in drug interactions with CBD- or THC-containing products. Patients should be advised that alcohol and other sedatives may increase impairment and somnolence with CBD, and patients should be advised to avoid operating heavy machinery and driving when using CBD or THC products.

### Endocannabinoid signaling in stress, nausea, and vomiting [^6b0a5d2f]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The first‐line treatments for nausea and vomiting are typically serotonin 5‐HT3 receptor antagonists, which effectively prevent acute vomiting and are partially effective at preventing acute nausea associated with chemotherapy.These classic antiemetics are sometimes ineffective at alleviating symptoms associated with certain nausea and vomiting disorders, such as cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) or cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS).Neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonists have improved the management of nausea and vomiting; however, there is a need for better therapies that can treat both nausea and vomiting, as well as the anxiety that is associated with disorders such as CVS and CHS.Cannabis has historically been used as an effective antiemetic treatment for chemotherapy‐induced nausea and vomiting.The antiemetic effects are attributed to the primary psychoactive constituent of cannabis, ∆ 9 ‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),which has led to the development of synthetic derivatives of THC (i.e. dronabinol and nabilone) for the treatment of chemotherapy‐induced nausea and vomiting.In addition to the anti‐nausea and antiemetic effects, acutely in humans, THC generally produces subjective effects such as elevated mood, reduced anxiety, and increased sociability.There is growing evidence, however, that cannabinoids can also produce nausea and vomiting and increase anxiety in certain instances, particularly at higher doses.The biphasic effects of exogenous cannabinoids on nausea, vomiting, and anxiety suggest that the endocannabinoid system's role in modulating these processes could also be biphasic.

Abdominal pain disorders of gut–brain interaction (AP-DGBIs) in children—cannabinoids are discouraged: “The GDG suggests against the use of cannabinoid/cannabis for the treatment of AP-DGBIs.” Justification includes that “high-quality evidence supporting safety and efficacy in pediatric populations remains lacking,” potential harm as “The developing central nervous system in children may incur harm from early cannabinoid exposure,” product variability that “complicate dosing guidance,” and regulatory variability across jurisdictions.

### Cannabis withdrawal syndrome: an important diagnostic consideration in adolescents presenting with disordered eating [^b1068413]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Although previously thought to have no withdrawal symptoms, there is now convergent evidence for a cannabis withdrawal syndrome (CWS), criteria for its diagnosis, and evidence of its impact in the adolescent population. Cannabis withdrawal syndrome represents an important and under-recognized consideration in adolescents with disordered eating. We describe three clinical cases of adolescents presenting to an eating disorders program with primary complaints of gastrointestinal symptoms, food avoidance, and associated weight loss. They did not meet the criteria for an eating disorder, but did fulfill the DSM-5 criteria for CWS. This report emphasizes the importance of considering the impact of heavy cannabis use in adolescents presenting with gastrointestinal complaints, and eating disorder symptoms, including weight loss.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome: commentary [^9290a946]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions for cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS)—CHS is a chronic disorder of gut–brain interaction characterized by episodic nausea and vomiting associated with long-term use of cannabis. Because CHS and CVS share similar features and are linked to cannabis use, clinical distinction can be challenging. The prevalence of CHS is increasing in the United States, but overall prevalence remains unknown, and underdiagnosis is a challenge. Diagnostic criteria are based on clinical features, cannabis use patterns, and resolution of symptoms after cannabis cessation. Unfortunately, current management is based on limited evidence, and the frequency of recidivism is high. Further understanding of CHS pathophysiology and evidence-based therapies are urgently needed.

### Nabilone administration in refractory chronic diarrhea: a case series [^be594a9c]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Daily cannabis assumption is currently associated with several physical and mental health problems, however in the past it was prescribed for a multitude of symptoms, including vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea. Through the years, the endocannabinoid system has been recognized in the homeostatic mechanisms of the gut, as well as in the physiological control of intestinal motility and secretion. Accordingly, cannabinoids may be a promising therapy against several gastrointestinal conditions, such as abdominal pain and motility-related disorders.

Case Presentation

We retrospectively analysed the efficacy and safety of a CB1-receptor agonist administered in six patients with refractory chronic diarrhea, between April 2008 and July 2016. After three months of therapy, oral nabilone improved the health of nearly all patients, with visible improvements in reducing diarrheal symptoms and weight gain. Most of the benefits persisted through the three-month follow-up. Only one patient interrupted the treatment after one month, due to severe fatigue and mental confusion; the symptoms disappeared in the follow-up period.

Conclusions

These findings encourage the study of cannabinoids acting on CB1 receptors in chronic gastrointestinal disorders, especially in refractory chronic diarrhea, offering a chance for a substantial improvement in the quality of life of selected patients, with a reasonable safety profile.

### Gastrointestinal manifestations of synthetic cannabinoids: a retrospective cohort study [^b3ce91e5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

An additional proposed mechanism of SC induced GI symptoms may involve vascular spasm. SC have been shown to rapidly alter neurotransmitter release from nerve terminals, thereby potently activating vascular smooth muscle cells, potentially resulting in vascular spasm. Rose et al. reported two cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage following SC consumption and used digital subtraction angiography to confirm transient vasospasm. Moreover, Mir et al. reported two patients with ST-elevation MI following SC use with subsequent normal coronary angiography. These reports imply that SC causes vasospasm in other organs without solid evidence regarding the GI tract. The low proportion of abnormal imaging in patients with severe abdominal pain, as in our study, supports the vasospasm hypothesis as vasospasm is reversible, and no vascular pathological findings were demonstrated. This assumption is less established and controversial.

Currently, with the increasing prevalence of cannabis use by the public, there is extensive awareness among clinicians of the GI symptoms related to cannabis use, including abdominal pain and vomiting. However, SC related GI symptoms have been less frequently discussed. Nausea and vomiting and abdominal pain are frequent features of SC presentations. Treatment is mostly symptomatic, and involves intravenous hydration, and the use of anti-emetics. In other cases, treatment requires the use of sedatives and antipsychotics The lack of identifiable SC in the toxicology screening in routine use make the diagnosis of SC related GI symptoms difficult.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^f3ea8352]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Gastroparesis—cannabidiol (CBD) use: In individuals with gastroparesis, the AGA suggests against the use of cannabidiol (CBD) except in the context of a clinical trial (Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). Evidence informing this recommendation was derived from 1 clinical trial comparing CBD with placebo in idiopathic or diabetes-associated gastroparesis that included 44 patients and was at low risk for bias overall. Implementation considerations note that available CBD formulations are not regulated with varying potencies that make their impact on patients with gastroparesis unknown, and among CBD formulations that include tetrahydro-cannabinol (THC) there is concern about increased risk of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome.

### Nausea and vomiting: a palliative care imperative [^1b2b17c5]. Current Oncology Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review was undertaken to survey recent literature for research reports and comprehensive clinical reviews addressing the pharmacologic management of nausea and vomiting (N&V) in advanced cancer. The goal was to integrate findings in a comprehensive article that incorporates palliative care concepts into antiemetic treatment.

Recent Findings

There are few published studies of N&V in advanced cancer; such research may be limited by the multicausal nature of N&V and participant burden to patients with life-limiting disease. Most articles are written by oncologists who also specialize in palliative care, and those addressing adverse effects of drugs used as antiemetics are found in other literature. Articles addressing more novel therapies, like cannabinoids and medical marijuana, are uncommon in the oncology literature. N&V in patients with progressive or advanced cancer is often multicausal. Nausea is more common and persistent, and even mild nausea is bothersome and may cause anxiety or depression. The mechanisms of nausea and vomiting overlap, but different neural pathways constitute the final pathway for each-the brainstem for vomiting and higher brain regions for nausea. Common causes of N&V in advanced cancer include constipation, opioids, and malignant bowel obstruction. About 40% have undetermined causes and may be exacerbated by impaired gastric emptying, chemical imbalances, or other factors. Several drugs that have antiemetic effects and act at different receptors are used to palliate N&V. There is a paucity of research that supports palliative antiemetic choices, and other research is needed to define potential therapeutic strategies that capitalize on differences between nausea and vomiting.

### Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, 2016 to 2022 [^38ff63d4]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

As of June 2025, nearly half of all US residents lived in states with legalized recreational cannabis.The rapid and broad-scale changes in cannabis legality have been closely monitored by public health researchers, epidemiologists, and addiction researchers to evaluate whether legalization has produced adverse health outcomes.,,,,,,,, Evidence to date remains modest and mixed.

Among cannabis-related harms, cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) has emerged as a growing public health concern., First identified in 2004 in Australia,, the syndrome has uncertain etiology but several neurophysiological mechanisms have been proposed, including downregulation of high cannabinoid 1 receptors, altered transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 signaling, and disrupted hypothalamic thermoregulation. Genetic susceptibility has also been suggested, but evidence remains limited.In contrast, explanations attributing CHS to nonspecific gastrointestinal syndromes or environmental contaminants are not supported by scientific evidence.

CHS presents with recurrent severe nausea and emesis, often with abdominal pain and compulsive hot bathing. Risk increases with prolonged use (>6 months), use of high potency products (eg, vapes), and daily or near-daily use. Patients with CHS often present repeatedly to emergency departments (EDs) but are frequently misdiagnosed with cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) or other nonspecific gastrointestinal conditions; some clinicians believe that these patients are exaggerating their symptoms for another purpose. When diagnosed, CHS has typically been inferred from a CVS diagnosis (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision [ICD-10] code R11.15) or nonspecific emesis (ICD-10 code R11) accompanied by a cannabis-related diagnosis such as cannabis abuse (ICD-10 code F12.1) or poisoning (ICD-10 code T40.711). A dedicated CHS code (F12.188) only became available with the 2025 ICD-10 update.Cannabis use is frequently underreported in survey contexts and likely in clinical settings such as the ED.Limited studies comparing verified substance use with ED diagnoses suggest underreporting, leading to misdiagnosis and inadequate treatment.

### Cannabinoids for nausea and vomiting in adults with cancer receiving chemotherapy [^a6b7649d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Cannabis has a long history of medicinal use. Cannabis-based medications (cannabinoids) are based on its active element, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and have been approved for medical purposes. Cannabinoids may be a useful therapeutic option for people with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting that respond poorly to commonly used anti-emetic agents (anti-sickness drugs). However, unpleasant adverse effects may limit their widespread use.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of cannabis-based medications for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in adults with cancer.

Search Methods

We identified studies by searching the following electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and LILACS from inception to January 2015. We also searched reference lists of reviews and included studies. We did not restrict the search by language of publication.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a cannabis-based medication with either placebo or with a conventional anti-emetic in adults receiving chemotherapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently conducted eligibility and risk of bias assessment, and extracted data. We grouped studies based on control groups for meta-analyses conducted using random effects. We expressed efficacy and tolerability outcomes as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

We included 23 RCTs. Most were of cross-over design, on adults undergoing a variety of chemotherapeutic regimens ranging from moderate to high emetic potential for a variety of cancers. The majority of the studies were at risk of bias due to either lack of allocation concealment or attrition. Trials were conducted between 1975 and 1991. No trials involved comparison with newer anti-emetic drugs such as ondansetron. Comparison with placebo People had more chance of reporting complete absence of vomiting (3 trials; 168 participants; RR 5.7; 95% CI 2.6 to 12.6; low quality evidence) and complete absence of nausea and vomiting (3 trials; 288 participants; RR 2.9; 95% CI 1.8 to 4.7; moderate quality evidence) when they received cannabinoids compared with placebo. The percentage of variability in effect estimates that was due to heterogeneity rather than chance was not important (I(2) = 0% in both analyses).People had more chance of withdrawing due to an adverse event (2 trials; 276 participants; RR 6.9; 95% CI 1.96 to 24; I(2) = 0%; very low quality evidence) and less chance of withdrawing due to lack of efficacy when they received cannabinoids, compared with placebo (1 trial; 228 participants; RR 0.05; 95% CI 0.0 to 0.89; low quality evidence). In addition, people had more chance of 'feeling high' when they received cannabinoids compared with placebo (3 trials; 137 participants; RR 31; 95% CI 6.4 to 152; I(2) = 0%).People reported a preference for cannabinoids rather than placebo (2 trials; 256 participants; RR 4.8; 95% CI 1.7 to 13; low quality evidence). Comparison with other anti-emetics There was no evidence of a difference between cannabinoids and prochlorperazine in the proportion of participants reporting no nausea (5 trials; 258 participants; RR 1.5; 95% CI 0.67 to 3.2; I(2) = 63%; low quality evidence), no vomiting (4 trials; 209 participants; RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.44; I(2) = 0%; moderate quality evidence), or complete absence of nausea and vomiting (4 trials; 414 participants; RR 2.0; 95% CI 0.74 to 5.4; I(2) = 60%; low quality evidence). Sensitivity analysis where the two parallel group trials were pooled after removal of the five cross-over trials showed no difference (RR 1.1; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.7) with no heterogeneity (I(2) = 0%).People had more chance of withdrawing due to an adverse event (5 trials; 664 participants; RR 3.9; 95% CI 1.3 to 12; I(2) = 17%; low quality evidence), due to lack of efficacy (1 trial; 42 participants; RR 3.5; 95% CI 1.4 to 8.9; very low quality evidence) and for any reason (1 trial; 42 participants; RR 3.5; 95% CI 1.4 to 8.9; low quality evidence) when they received cannabinoids compared with prochlorperazine.People had more chance of reporting dizziness (7 trials; 675 participants; RR 2.4; 95% CI 1.8 to 3.1; I(2) = 12%), dysphoria (3 trials; 192 participants; RR 7.2; 95% CI 1.3 to 39; I(2) = 0%), euphoria (2 trials; 280 participants; RR 18; 95% CI 2.4 to 133; I(2) = 0%), 'feeling high' (4 trials; 389 participants; RR 6.2; 95% CI 3.5 to 11; I(2) = 0%) and sedation (8 trials; 947 participants; RR 1.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 1.8; I(2) = 31%), with significantly more participants reporting the incidence of these adverse events with cannabinoids compared with prochlorperazine.People reported a preference for cannabinoids rather than prochlorperazine (7 trials; 695 participants; RR 3.3; 95% CI 2.2 to 4.8; I(2) = 51%; low quality evidence).In comparisons with metoclopramide, domperidone and chlorpromazine, there was weaker evidence, based on fewer trials and participants, for higher incidence of dizziness with cannabinoids.Two trials with 141 participants compared an anti-emetic drug alone with a cannabinoid added to the anti-emetic drug. There was no evidence of differences between groups; however, the majority of the analyses were based on one small trial with few events. Quality of the evidence The trials were generally at low to moderate risk of bias in terms of how they were designed and do not reflect current chemotherapy and anti-emetic treatment regimens. Furthermore, the quality of evidence arising from meta-analyses was graded as low for the majority of the outcomes analysed, indicating that we are not very confident in our ability to say how well the medications worked. Further research is likely to have an important impact on the results.

Authors' Conclusions

Cannabis-based medications may be useful for treating refractory chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. However, methodological limitations of the trials limit our conclusions and further research reflecting current chemotherapy regimens and newer anti-emetic drugs is likely to modify these conclusions.
