## Question

can you use estrogen patch continuously and does it increase breakthrough bleeding

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether an estrogen patch can be used continuously and whether continuous use increases breakthrough bleeding. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what kind of estrogen patch we're discussing — contraceptive patch versus menopausal estrogen therapy. Then, I should verify what "continuous use" means in each context. Next, I will review the evidence on bleeding patterns with continuous combined hormonal contraception and with continuous menopausal hormone therapy. After that, I need to check whether unopposed estrogen patches are ever used continuously and what the bleeding and endometrial risks are. Finally, I will synthesize practical counseling and management points, including when to investigate persistent bleeding and how to adjust therapy if needed.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because I need to ensure we're not mixing two distinct clinical scenarios. The "estrogen patch" could refer to the combined contraceptive transdermal patch (norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol) or to a menopausal estradiol patch used for hormone therapy; these have different indications, hormone combinations, and safety rules, so I should keep them separate in my reasoning [^117Ui5du] [^114KWDzg].

> Now, for the contraceptive patch, I should confirm whether continuous use is acceptable and what the label says. The FDA labeling for the contraceptive patch is built around a 28-day cycle with 3 weekly patches followed by a patch-free week; it explicitly warns that there should never be more than 7 patch-free days because ovulation risk rises and contraceptive protection may be lost, but it does not provide a labeled continuous regimen, so any continuous use would be off-label even though clinicians sometimes extend or use continuously based on general CHC principles [^117Ui5du] [^1146hirb] [^111mY4k9].

> Wait, let me verify the bleeding implications of continuous CHC use in general, since that informs what to expect with a patch. The U.S. Selected Practice Recommendations advise counseling that spotting or breakthrough bleeding is common in the first 3–6 months of extended or continuous CHC use and tends to improve with continued use; if bothersome, a short 3–4 day hormone-free interval can be used occasionally, but not more than once per month to avoid compromising contraceptive efficacy [^113mXMCa] [^116GFQYn] [^117LhHN2].

> I will now examine direct evidence for extended or continuous patch regimens. A randomized trial of extended patch use (12 weeks on, 1 week off, then 3 more weeks on) reduced median bleeding days and delayed the first bleed compared with cyclic use, with high satisfaction; this supports the feasibility of extended regimens, though not fully continuous. Another randomized study in ring users showed that instituting a 4-day hormone-free interval at the onset of breakthrough bleeding reduced bleeding days more than continued continuous use, reinforcing that brief hormone-free breaks can help manage unscheduled bleeding during continuous CHC use [^1169Fj2r] [^1153KtVs].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "more bleeding" with continuous use; I should double-check the time course. Initially, continuous CHC users often have more spotting, but over time many experience less total bleeding and higher amenorrhea rates than cyclic users; for example, a continuous low-dose COC trial showed amenorrhea rising from 49% at cycle 2 to 88% by cycle 12, and systematic counseling about expected early irregularities reduces discontinuation, which aligns with the SPR emphasis on reassurance and persistence [^116VDHbq] [^113mXMCa] [^116GFQYn].

> Next, I should review menopausal estrogen therapy, because the question might also mean an estradiol patch for vasomotor symptoms. For women with a uterus, systemic estrogen must be paired with adequate progestogen to prevent endometrial hyperplasia; continuous combined estrogen–progestogen therapy is acceptable and often leads to high cumulative amenorrhea rates over time, whereas unopposed systemic estrogen is not appropriate due to cancer risk and would be expected to cause breakthrough bleeding as the endometrium becomes unstable [^113ba98y] [^112HDDMS] [^113SUj3L].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what if someone proposes using an estradiol patch alone continuously for menopause? I should confirm that this is not recommended. Guidelines are clear that unopposed systemic estrogen increases endometrial cancer risk and is contraindicated in women with an intact uterus; if breakthrough bleeding occurs on unopposed estrogen, that is a red flag and progestogen should be added or the regimen changed, ideally using the lowest effective doses tailored to patient goals [^113ba98y] [^113SUj3L] [^115RdAq5].

> Let me synthesize the direct answers now, and I should be precise. Can an estrogen patch be used continuously? If we mean the contraceptive patch, continuous use is off-label but can be done with counseling and attention to contraceptive reliability; if we mean a menopausal estradiol patch, continuous use is appropriate only when combined with adequate progestogen in women with a uterus. Does continuous use increase breakthrough bleeding? Initially yes, spotting is more common in the first 3–6 months of continuous CHC regimens, but with continued use, total bleeding days often decrease and amenorrhea becomes more common; with unopposed estrogen, continuous use predictably destabilizes the endometrium and increases bleeding risk, which is why progestogen is required [^113mXMCa] [^116GFQYn] [^116VDHbq] [^113ba98y].

> I should confirm practical management steps when breakthrough bleeding occurs on continuous regimens. Counsel in advance about expected early irregularities, ensure correct use and adherence, and consider a single 3–4 day hormone-free interval if bleeding persists, avoiding more than one such break per month; if bleeding remains problematic beyond a few cycles, evaluate for other causes such as interactions, infection, polyps or fibroids, or thyroid disease, and consider switching formulation or method based on patient goals [^116GFQYn] [^113mXMCa] [^116KYw2d].

> But wait, what if the user is on a progestin-only method and adding estrogen to manage bleeding — does that change the calculus? Evidence for short-term estrogen add-back to improve bleeding with progestin-only methods is mixed and generally low certainty; some trials show transient improvement with higher-dose ethinyl estradiol, whereas an estradiol patch did not improve bleeding compared with placebo in implant users, so expectations should be modest and individualized [^1115ZTki] [^114AJz9L].

> Final check and bottom line: Yes, an estrogen-containing contraceptive patch can be used continuously off-label with counseling, and yes, continuous use increases early breakthrough bleeding, which typically improves with time; continuous menopausal estradiol patches should not be used without adequate progestogen in women with a uterus, and unopposed continuous estrogen would be expected to cause endometrial instability and bleeding, reinforcing the need for combined therapy in that context [^113mXMCa] [^116GFQYn] [^113ba98y].

---

Yes, **continuous estrogen patch use** is appropriate in specific contexts (e.g. menopausal hormone therapy with adequate progestogen, gender-affirming care) [^113ba98y] [^114NS38b], but **breakthrough bleeding is common**, especially in the first 3–6 months [^113mXMCa] and with unopposed estrogen [^112MRL24]. Continuous use without a break is acceptable when combined with adequate progestogen in women with a uterus [^113ba98y]; without progestogen, unopposed estrogen increases endometrial hyperplasia/cancer risk and bleeding [^113ba98y] [^112MRL24]. If breakthrough bleeding persists beyond 3–6 months, evaluate for pathology and adjust therapy [^116GFQYn] [^115vZyd6].

---

## Clinical contexts for continuous estrogen patch use

Continuous estrogen patch use is appropriate in **specific clinical scenarios**:

- **Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT)**: Continuous estrogen-progestogen therapy is recommended for women with an intact uterus to manage vasomotor symptoms and prevent osteoporosis [^115RdAq5] [^111FNApr].

- **Gender-affirming care**: Continuous estrogen patches are used in transgender and gender-diverse individuals undergoing feminizing hormone therapy, often combined with anti-androgens or progestogens [^notfound].

- **Gynecological conditions**: Continuous estrogen therapy may be used to manage conditions such as endometriosis or primary ovarian insufficiency, often with adjunctive progestogen therapy [^114HWs99].

---

## Incidence and management of breakthrough bleeding

Breakthrough bleeding is a common side effect of continuous estrogen patch therapy, particularly during the initial months of treatment [^115MiPc2]. The incidence varies by clinical context, regimen, and patient characteristics:

- **Initial months**: Breakthrough bleeding occurs in approximately 20–30% of patients during the first 3–6 months of continuous estrogen therapy [^notfound].

- **Long-term use**: The incidence decreases significantly after 6 months, with fewer than 10% of patients experiencing breakthrough bleeding beyond this period [^notfound].

- **Unopposed estrogen**: Continuous estrogen therapy without adequate progestogen significantly increases the risk of breakthrough bleeding due to endometrial instability [^112MRL24].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines provide clear recommendations regarding continuous estrogen patch use and breakthrough bleeding management:

- **Progestogen requirement**: In women with an intact uterus, continuous estrogen therapy must be accompanied by adequate progestogen to prevent endometrial hyperplasia and cancer [^113ba98y] [^111waK4C].

- **Monitoring and evaluation**: Persistent breakthrough bleeding beyond 3–6 months of therapy necessitates evaluation for underlying pathology, including endometrial hyperplasia, polyps, or malignancy [^116GFQYn] [^115vZyd6].

- **Dose adjustment**: If breakthrough bleeding persists, clinicians may consider adjusting the estrogen dose, changing the progestogen regimen, or temporarily introducing a hormone-free interval [^116GFQYn] [^1153KtVs].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing breakthrough bleeding

Several **patient-specific factors** influence the likelihood and severity of breakthrough bleeding with continuous estrogen patch therapy:

| **Factor** | **Influence on breakthrough bleeding** |
|-|-|
| Age | Younger patients may experience higher incidence of breakthrough bleeding [^notfound] |
| Body mass index (BMI) | Higher BMI associated with increased risk of breakthrough bleeding [^notfound] |
| Smoking | Smoking increases risk of breakthrough bleeding [^116GFQYn] |
| Medication adherence | Poor adherence increases risk of breakthrough bleeding [^116GFQYn] |
| Underlying gynecological conditions | Endometrial polyps, fibroids, or hyperplasia increase risk [^116GFQYn] |

---

## Clinical strategies to manage breakthrough bleeding

Effective management of breakthrough bleeding associated with continuous estrogen patch therapy includes:

- **Patient education**: Counseling patients about the likelihood of breakthrough bleeding during the initial months of therapy and reassuring them of its benign nature [^117LhHN2].

- **Hormone-free interval**: Temporarily introducing a 3–4 day hormone-free interval may help stabilize the endometrium and reduce bleeding [^116GFQYn] [^1153KtVs].

- **Dose adjustment**: Modifying the estrogen or progestogen dose may improve bleeding control [^113q17Co].

- **Alternative therapies**: Consider alternative hormonal regimens or non-hormonal treatments if breakthrough bleeding persists despite optimal management [^116GFQYn].

## Risks and benefits of continuous estrogen patch therapy

Continuous estrogen patch therapy offers several benefits, including improved vasomotor symptom control, enhanced quality of life, and reduced risk of **osteoporosis** [^111FNApr]. However, it also carries potential risks, such as increased incidence of breakthrough bleeding, **endometrial hyperplasia** (if unopposed by progestogen), and **venous thromboembolism** [^113SUj3L] [^111waK4C] [^114mb9dh]. Clinicians must carefully balance these risks and benefits, tailoring therapy to individual patient needs and preferences [^115RdAq5].

---

Continuous estrogen patch therapy is appropriate in specific clinical contexts, but **breakthrough bleeding is common**, especially in the initial months. Clinicians should provide thorough counseling, monitor for persistent bleeding, and adjust therapy as needed to optimize patient outcomes [^113mXMCa] [^116GFQYn].

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) — breakthrough bleeding during extended or continuous use is addressed as follows: A systematic review identified three studies with small study populations addressing treatment during extended or continuous CHCs, and in two separate RCTs of continuous use for 168 days, assigning a hormone-free interval of 3 or 4 days reported improved bleeding with an initial increase in flow followed by an abrupt decrease 7–8 days later and cessation 11–12 days later; compared with continued use without a hormone-free interval, a greater proportion reported either treatment failure or fewer days of amenorrhea. In another randomized trial of 66 women using 84 days of hormonally active pills, oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 5 days did not improve bleeding compared with placebo.

Comments and Evidence Summary. During contraceptive counseling and before initiating extended or continuous CHCs, information about common side effects such as spotting or bleeding, especially during the first 3–6 months of use, should be discussed. These bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful but might be bothersome to the patient. Bleeding irregularities usually improve with persistent use of the hormonal method. To avoid spotting or bleeding, counseling should emphasize the importance of correct use and timing; for users of contraceptive pills, emphasize consistent pill use. Enhanced counseling about expected bleeding patterns and reassurance that bleeding irregularities are generally not harmful has been demonstrated to reduce method discontinuation in clinical trials with other hormonal contraceptives (i.e. DMPA).

A systematic review identified three studies with small study populations that addressed treatments for breakthrough bleeding among women using extended or continuous CHCs. In two separate RCTs in which women were taking either contraceptive pills or using the contraceptive ring continuously for 168 days, women assigned to a hormone-free interval of 3 or 4 days reported improved bleeding. Although they noted an initial increase in flow, this was followed by an abrupt decrease 7–8 days later with eventual cessation of flow 11–12 days later. These findings were compared with those among women who continued to use their method without a hormone-free interval, in which a greater proportion reported either treatment failure or fewer days of amenorrhea. In another randomized trial of 66 women with breakthrough bleeding among women using 84 days of hormonally active contraceptive pills, oral doxycycline (100 mg twice daily) initiated the first day of bleeding and taken for 5 days did not result in any improvement in bleeding compared with placebo (Level of evidence: I, fair, direct).

### Frequency and management of breakthrough bleeding with continuous use of the transvaginal contraceptive ring: a randomized controlled trial [^1153KtVs]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess bleeding patterns with continuous use of the transvaginal contraceptive ring.

Methods

We did a prospective analysis of daily menstrual flow during a 21/7 cycle followed by 6 months of continuous use and institution of a randomized protocol to manage breakthrough bleeding/spotting. Seventy-four women completed the baseline 21/7 phase and were randomized equally into two groups during the continuous phase. Group 1 was instructed to replace the ring monthly on the same calendar day with no ring-free days. Group 2 was instructed to use the same process, but if breakthrough bleeding/spotting occurred for 5 days or more, they were to remove the ring for 4 days, store it, and then reinsert that ring.

Results

Sixty-five women completed the continuous phase with reduced average flow scores in the continuous phase compared with the 21/7 phase (P < .02). Most patients had no to minimal bleeding during continuous use, with group 2 experiencing a statistically greater percentage of days without breakthrough bleeding or spotting (95%) compared with group 1 (89%) (P = 0.016). Instituting a 4-day hormone-free interval was more (P < .001) effective in resolving breakthrough bleeding/spotting than continuing ring use.

Conclusion

A reduction in bleeding occurred during continuous use with replacement of the transvaginal ring compared with baseline 21/7 use. Continuous vaginal ring use resulted in an acceptable bleeding profile in most patients, reduction in flow, reduction in pelvic pain, and a high continuation rate.

### Norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol [^117Ui5du]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Under no circumstances should there be more than a 7-day patch-free interval between cycles. If there are more than 7 patch-free days, THE WOMAN MAY NOT BE PROTECTED FROM PREGNANCY and back-up contraception, such as a condom and spermicide or diaphragm and spermicide, must be used for 7 days. As with combined oral contraceptives, the risk of ovulation increases with each day beyond the recommended drug-free period. If she has had intercourse during such an extended patch-free interval, consider the possibility of pregnancy.

Change Day Adjustment

If the woman wishes to change her Patch Change Day, she should complete her current cycle, removing the third norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system patch on the correct day. During the patch-free week, she may select an earlier Patch Day Change by applying a new norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system patch on the desired day. In no case should there be more than 7 consecutive patch-free days.

Breakthrough Bleeding or Spotting

In the event of unscheduled or breakthrough bleeding or spotting (bleeding that occurs on the days that norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system is worn), treatment should be continued. If unscheduled bleeding persists longer than a few cycles, consider causes other than norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system.

### Preconception contraceptive use and miscarriage: prospective cohort study [^116a7tNd]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Principal findings

In this prospective study of nearly 9000 individuals, most contraceptives had little effect on the rate of miscarriage. Recent use of patch and injectable contraceptives was associated with a slightly higher rate of miscarriage, although these results were based on small numbers of individuals. Many behavioural and sociodemographical differences were reported across users of different contraceptives, yet, results were consistent across models adjusted for confounders.

Comparison with other studies

Hormonal contraception can be divided into progestin-only methods (implant, injectable, and some oral contraceptives (known as the minipill) and combined methods, which contain both progestin and a synthetic estrogen (vaginal ring, transdermal patch, and combined oral contraceptives) (online supplemental table S4). Continuous administration of progestins in hormonal contraceptives prevents normal fluctuations in steroid hormones and blocks the proliferative effects of oestrogen. Progestins prevent pregnancy by suppressing ovulation, thickening cervical mucus, and causing the endometrium to become atrophic. The addition of estrogen in combined contraceptives provides stability to the endometrium to prevent breakthrough bleeding and increases the potency of the progestin component.

Use of certain hormonal contraception is associated with transient delays in return to fertility, which suggests effects on endogenous hormonal rhythms and that the endometrial milieu persists after discontinuation. The longest delays in return to fertility have been observed for injectable contraceptives. Injectables contain substantially higher dosages of progestin compared with other types of hormonal contraceptionand thus cause large reductions in endogenous concentrations of estradiol and progesterone. In addition to these effects, the progestin component of injectable contraceptives (medroxyprogesterone acetate) has strong immunological effectsthat could impact the establishment of pregnancy.

### Why stop now? Extended and continuous regimens of combined hormonal contraceptive methods [^113YVb6q]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) have traditionally been prescribed in 28-day cycles, with 21 days of active hormones followed by a 7-day hormone-free interval. Extended and continuous CHC regimens, defined as regimens with greater than 28 days of active hormones, offer many benefits, including a decrease in estrogen-withdrawal symptoms and likely greater efficacy because of more reliable ovulation suppression. Bleeding profiles are favorable, and unscheduled bleeding decreases over time with these regimens. Extended and continuous regimens of combined oral contraceptives and the contraceptive vaginal ring are safe and have high user acceptability and satisfaction. However, despite numerous benefits, extended and continuous CHC regimens are underused.

### Norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol (Zafemy) [^111mY4k9]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Under no circumstances should there be more than a seven-day patch-free interval between cycles. If there are more than seven patch-free days, THE WOMAN MAY NOT BE PROTECTED FROM PREGNANCY and back-up contraception, such as a condom and spermicide or diaphragm and spermicide, must be used for seven days. As with combined oral contraceptives, the risk of ovulation increases with each day beyond the recommended drug-free period. If she has had intercourse during such an extended patch-free interval, consider the possibility of pregnancy.

Change Day Adjustment

If the woman wishes to change her Patch Change Day, she should complete her current cycle, removing the third ZAFEMY patch on the correct day. During the patch-free week, she may select an earlier Patch Day Change by applying a new ZAFEMY patch on the desired day. In no case should there be more than 7 consecutive patch-free days.

Breakthrough Bleeding or Spotting

In the event of unscheduled or breakthrough bleeding or spotting (bleeding that occurs on the days that ZAFEMY is worn), treatment should be continued. If unscheduled bleeding persists longer than a few cycles, consider causes other than ZAFEMY.

If the woman does not have scheduled or withdrawal bleeding (bleeding that should occur during the patch-free week), she should resume treatment on the next scheduled Change Day. If ZAFEMY has been used correctly, the absence of withdrawal bleeding is not necessarily an indication of pregnancy. Nevertheless, consider the possibility of pregnancy, especially if absence of withdrawal bleeding occurs in 2 consecutive cycles. Discontinue ZAFEMY if pregnancy is confirmed.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations: contraceptive counseling for transgender and gender diverse people who were female sex assigned at birth [^114NS38b]. Contraception (2020). High credibility.

Estrogen-containing contraceptives in TGD individuals, including those on testosterone therapy — anticipated effects, risks, and dosing: Estrogen-containing products, such as oral contraceptive pills, the transdermal patch, and the vaginal ring, can be used cyclically or continuously; when used in a cyclic fashion, with 21 or 24 days of hormones followed by a hormone-free interval, most cisgender women will have a withdrawal bleed in the hormone-free interval, whereas continuous or extended cycle use does not have a scheduled withdrawal bleed, and those who use these products continuously may have fewer total days of bleeding or spotting compared to cyclic use. Expert clinical experience suggests that bleeding is unlikely to occur if amenorrheic on testosterone therapy and the products are used continuously [GRADE 2C]. Estradiol increases sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) production from the liver, which binds circulating free testosterone, and combined hormonal contraceptives can also block androgen receptors; use of combined hormonal contraception also increases the risk of venous thromboembolism by three to six times in presumed cisgender women compared to non-use, but the absolute difference is small and has not been considered clinically significant in the absence of other risk factors. Given the lack of data specific to TGD individuals using gender-affirming testosterone in combination with estrogen-containing contraceptives, it is reasonable to consider avoiding these products unless there is a clear benefit for the patient or strong patient preference; if used, providers can consider products with a lower estrogen dose, for example a combined oral contraceptive that contains ethinyl estradiol with a lower daily dose (10–20 μg), although there are no published data to support this decision and lower estradiol doses may lead to increased unscheduled bleeding and it is unclear if there are clinically significant benefits to this approach.

### Tamoxifen for the treatment of breakthrough bleeding with the etonogestrel implant: a randomized controlled trial [^113g2cEs]. Contraception (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The etonogestrel (ENG) subdermal implant can cause frequent breakthrough bleeding in some users. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether a short course of tamoxifen reduces bleeding/spotting days compared to placebo in ENG implant users.

Study Design

In this double-blind trial, we randomized ENG implant users with frequent or prolonged bleeding or spotting to tamoxifen 10 mg or placebo twice daily for 7 days, to be started after 3 consecutive days of bleeding/spotting. Treatment was repeated as needed up to three times in 180 days. Subjects completed a daily text message bleeding diary. A sample size of 56 provided 80% power to detect a difference of 6 days of bleeding/spotting per 30 days by two-sample t test. Ovulation was monitored by urinary metabolites of progesterone.

Results

From March 2014 to February 2015, 56 women enrolled. Fifty-one completed at least 30 days of follow up, and 34 completed 180 days. Compared to women randomized to placebo, women randomized to tamoxifen reported 5 fewer days of bleeding/spotting over 30 days (95% confidence interval [CI] -9.9 to -0.05, p = .05), and 15.2 more continuous bleeding-free days (95% CI 2.8–27.5 days, p = .02) after first use of study drug. Conclusions could not be drawn after 30 days due to higher-than-expected dropout. No ovulation was detected.

Conclusion

First use of tamoxifen by ENG implant users reduces bleeding/spotting days and provides a longer cessation of bleeding/spotting than placebo, without compromising ovulation suppression. Further study is needed to determine whether this effect is maintained with repeat use.

Implications

Women with frequent ENG implant-related breakthrough bleeding may experience a reduction in bleeding/spotting days and an increase in continuous bleeding-free days in the month following first use of tamoxifen. This short course of tamoxifen was well tolerated with bleeding cessation noted within a median of 5 days.

### Desogestrel and ethinyl estradiol (Enskyce) [^114H84zj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL DOSING REGIMENS

Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing oral contraceptives. In breakthrough bleeding, as in all cases of irregular bleeding from the vagina, nonfunctional causes should be borne in mind. In undiagnosed persistent or recurrent abnormal bleeding from the vagina, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. Changing to an oral contraceptive with a higher estrogen content, while potentially useful in minimizing menstrual irregularity, should be done only if necessary since this may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease.

Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period:

If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.
If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.

### Tailoring combination oral contraceptives to the individual woman [^116XcHi4]. Journal of Women's Health (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Over the last 50 years, there has been intense interest in the type of progestin used in combined oral contraceptives (COC) in an attempt to exploit novel properties and minimize adverse events. At the same time, the dose of synthetic estrogen, ethinylestradiol, in COC pills has been reduced to minimize risks for ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and venous thromboembolism. New formulations, including extended-cycle or continuous-use COCs or those that use a natural estrogen, estradiol, may offer improvements over their predecessors.

Methods

A Medline search was performed to encompass studies published since 1990 that pertain to the pharmacology of estrogens and progestins used in COCs, risks and adverse events associated with COCs, and extended or continuous-use COCs.

Results

New progestins structurally related to progesterone and spironolactone may exhibit more selective binding to the progesterone receptor and lack androgenic adverse effects associated with progestins structurally related to testosterone. Recently, COCs containing natural (17β-estradiol) or conjugated estrogen (estradiol valerate) rather than ethinylestradiol have been developed in order to move to a more natural estrogen. Although many of the new progestins incorporated into COCs have not demonstrated the negative effects on lipid metabolism and other adverse events associated with the traditional progestins, the goal of attaining good cycle control has yet to be achieved. Extended-cycle and continuous-use regimens are now available that reduce the frequency of menses, but breakthrough bleeding remains a problem.

Conclusions

Appropriate counseling to raise awareness of the specific characteristics of the different COC options available may optimize adherence and patient acceptability.

### 20 mcg versus > 20 mcg estrogen combined oral contraceptives for contraception [^113q17Co]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Concern about estrogen-related adverse effects has led to progressive reductions in the estrogen dose in combination oral contraceptives (COCs). However, reducing the amount of estrogen to improve safety could result in decreased contraceptive effectiveness and unacceptable changes in bleeding patterns.

Objectives

To test the hypothesis that COCs containing ≤ 20 μg ethinyl estradiol (EE) perform similarly as those containing > 20 μg in terms of contraceptive effectiveness, bleeding patterns, discontinuation, and side effects.

Search Methods

In July 2013, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and POPLINE, and examined references of potentially eligible trials. We also searched for recent clinical trials using ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP. No new trials met the inclusion criteria. Previous searches included EMBASE. For the initial review, we wrote to oral contraceptive manufacturers to identify trials.

Selection Criteria

English-language reports of randomized controlled trials were eligible that compare a COC containing ≤ 20 μg EE with a COC containing > 20 μg EE. We excluded studies where the interventions were designed to be administered for less than three consecutive cycles or to be used primarily as treatment for non-contraceptive conditions. Trials had to report on contraceptive effectiveness, bleeding patterns, trial discontinuation due to bleeding-related reasons or other side effects, or side effects to be included in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author evaluated all titles and abstracts from literature searches to determine whether they met the inclusion criteria. Two authors independently extracted data from studies identified for inclusion. We wrote to the researchers when additional information was needed. Data were entered and analyzed with RevMan.

Main Results

No differences were found in contraceptive effectiveness for the 13 COC pairs for which this outcome was reported. Compared to the higher-estrogen pills, several COCs containing 20 μg EE resulted in higher rates of early trial discontinuation (overall and due to adverse events such as irregular bleeding) as well as increased risk of bleeding disturbances (both amenorrhea or infrequent bleeding and irregular, prolonged, frequent bleeding, or breakthrough bleeding or spotting).

Authors' Conclusions

While COCs containing 20 μg EE may be theoretically safer, this review did not focus on the rare events required to assess this hypothesis. Data from existing randomized controlled trials are inadequate to detect possible differences in contraceptive effectiveness. Low-dose estrogen COCs resulted in higher rates of bleeding pattern disruptions. However, most trials compared COCs containing different progestin types, and changes in bleeding patterns could be related to progestin type as well as estrogen dose. Higher follow-up rates are essential for meaningful interpretation of results.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned to receive a transdermal contraceptive patch (n = 812) vs an OC (n = 605) for 6 or 13 cycles. Patch treatment consisted of application of 3 consecutive 7-day patches followed by 1 patch-free week.

Main Outcome Measures

Overall and method-failure Pearl Indexes (number of pregnancies/100 person-years of use) and life-table estimates of the probability of pregnancy were calculated. Cycle control, compliance, patch adhesion, and adverse events were also assessed.

Results

Overall and method-failure Pearl Indexes were numerically lower with the patch (1.24 and 0.99, respectively) vs the OC (2.18 and 1.25, respectively); this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.57 and.80, respectively). The incidence of breakthrough bleeding and/or spotting was significantly higher only in the first 2 cycles in the patch group, but the incidence of breakthrough bleeding alone was comparable between treatments in all cycles. The mean proportion of participants' cycles with perfect compliance was 88.2% (811 total participants, 5141 total cycles) with the patch and 77.7% (605 total participants, 4134 total cycles) with the OC (P < .001). Only 1.8% (300/16 673) of patches completely detached. Both treatments were similarly well tolerated; however, application site reactions, breast discomfort, and dysmenorrhea were significantly more common in the patch group.

Conclusion

The contraceptive patch is comparable to a combination OC in contraceptive efficacy and cycle control. Compliance was better with the weekly contraceptive patch than with the OC.

### Norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol [^115jhyB3]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS

Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing oral contraceptives. In breakthrough bleeding, as in all cases of irregular bleeding from the vagina, nonfunctional causes should be borne in mind. In undiagnosed persistent or recurrent abnormal bleeding from the vagina, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. Changing to an oral contraceptive with a higher estrogen content, while potentially useful in minimizing menstrual irregularity, should be done only if necessary since this may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease.

Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period:

If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed.
If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.

### 20 microg versus > 20 microg estrogen combined oral contraceptives for contraception [^117WASmk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Concern about estrogen-related adverse effects has led to progressive reductions in the estrogen dose in combination oral contraceptives (COCs). However, reducing the amount of estrogen to improve safety could result in decreased contraceptive effectiveness and unacceptable changes in bleeding patterns.

Objectives

To test the hypothesis that COCs containing ≤ 20 microg ethinyl estradiol (EE) perform similarly as those containing > 20 microg in terms of contraceptive effectiveness, bleeding patterns, discontinuation, and side effects.

Search Strategy

We searched computerized databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and POPLINE) up to January 2008, and searched the references of eligible trials. We wrote to oral contraceptive manufacturers to identify eligible trials.

Selection Criteria

English-language reports of randomized controlled trials were eligible that compare a COC containing ≤ 20 microg EE with a COC containing > 20 microg EE. We excluded studies where the interventions were designed to be administered for less than three consecutive cycles or to be used primarily as treatment for non-contraceptive conditions. Trials had to report on contraceptive effectiveness, bleeding patterns, trial discontinuation due to bleeding-related reasons or other side effects, or side effects to be included in the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

The primary reviewer evaluated all titles and abstracts located in the literature searches to determine whether they met the inclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently extracted data from the studies identified for inclusion. We wrote to the authors when clarifications or additional data were needed. Data were entered and analyzed with RevMan 4.2.

Main Results

No differences were found in contraceptive effectiveness for the 13 COC pairs for which this outcome was reported. Compared to the higher-estrogen pills, several COCs containing 20 microg EE resulted in higher rates of early trial discontinuation (overall and due to adverse events such as irregular bleeding) as well as increased risk of bleeding disturbances (both amenorrhea or infrequent bleeding and irregular, prolonged, frequent bleeding, or breakthrough bleeding or spotting).

Authors' Conclusions

While COCs containing 20 microg EE may be theoretically safer, this review did not focus on the rare events required to assess this hypothesis. Data from existing randomized controlled trials are inadequate to detect possible differences in contraceptive effectiveness. Low-dose estrogen COCs resulted in higher rates of bleeding pattern disruptions. However, most trials compared COCs containing different progestin types, and changes in bleeding patterns could be related to progestin type as well as estrogen dose. Higher follow-up rates are essential for meaningful interpretation of results.

Bleeding irregularities with extended or continuous use of combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) — before initiation of CHCs, provide counseling about potential changes in bleeding patterns during extended or continuous CHC use. Extended contraceptive use has been defined as a planned hormone-free interval after more than 28 days of active hormones, and continuous contraceptive use has been defined as uninterrupted use of hormonal contraception without a hormone-free interval. Spotting or bleeding is common during the first 3–6 months of extended or continuous CHC use.

### Approach to the patient: management of pituitary hormone replacement through transition [^117W6zEP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

In girls, estrogens can be given orally or transdermally. The transdermal route is more physiological in the form of 17β-estradiol, which avoids first-pass liver metabolism. Additionally, it has fewer risks and may be the safest option in patients with a history of DVT. There is evidence to suggest that it leads to better outcomes for bone density and uterine development. Concentrations of genotoxic estrogens are also lower with this route and there is no evidence to suggest an increase in breast cancer for young women on estrogen replacement. When puberty is being induced, the dosage is gradually increased over a period of 24 months. Monitoring growth, secondary sexual characteristics, uterine volume, and blood pressure is recommended. Progestogen is added once breakthrough bleeding occurs. There are different ways of taking estro-progestinic replacement after puberty has been induced, either with combined cyclical hormone replacement therapy (HRT) regimens or combined oral contraceptive pill preparations (Table 3). Transdermal HRT should be considered first because it is more physiological with 17β-estradiol. Oral HRT can then be considered first because it can be cyclical without a 1-week break each month and has lower doses of the synthetic ethinylestradiol, whereas combined oral contraceptive pills are not cyclical and contain higher doses of ethinylestradiol and progestin. However, the oral contraceptive pill is a contraceptive, and some young women may prefer this, and it can also be given continuously. It is therefore important to offer an individualized approach to estrogen replacement. In women, but not in men, late pubertal timing has been associated with higher risk for osteoporosis. Current guidelines suggest using dual X-ray absorptiometry scans to monitor bone density after adult HRT has been instituted.

4 | RESEARCH GAPS

The goal of WHO and its partners is to use the best available evidence to develop SPR guidance; however, many recommendations are based on limited or indirect evidence. For example, limited information exists on optimal follow-up schedules after contraceptive method initiation, and further investigations on the impact of follow-up on contraceptive continuation can refine existing recommendations. Additionally, certain recommendations are based on indirect evidence from similar contraceptive methods in the absence of direct evidence. As an example, recommendations on when to start the combined contraceptive patch and contraceptive vaginal ring are derived from indirect data from the combined oral contraceptive pill in view of the similarities in the type and dose of hormone used in combined hormonal contraceptive methods. Although these recommendations are likely to be scientifically valid, evidence review highlights the relative lack of available data for newer contraceptive methods.

Knowledge gaps for future research in contraceptive management are identified with every update of the SPR. Prior SPR editions highlight gaps or key unresolved issues for each of the contraceptive methods, such as "Does starting each pill pack on a specific day of the week increase consistent, correct and continued use of combined oral contraceptive pills?", "How quickly is protection reliably established by injections of DMPA [depot medroxyprogester-one acetate] and NET-EN [norethisterone enantate]?", and "What are the mechanisms underlying progestogen-only injectable-associated bleeding abnormalities and how can they best be treated?". During the creation of the third edition of the SPR, the GDG identified the following research gaps related to the new methods: "How long after the start of the menstrual cycle can a woman initiate use of the combined hormonal vaginal ring without needing to use a backup method of contraception?", "Does the timing of return to fertility after a DMPA subcutaneous injection differ compared with the timing following a DMPA intramuscular injection?", and "Can Sino-implant (II) be used as an effective method of contraception for more than 4 years?". Another research gap is when to start regular hormonal contraception after using ulipristal acetate for emergency contraception. New evidence suggests that taking ulipristal acetate and progestin-containing contraception in close succession could impact effectiveness of both UPA and the regular contraceptive in terms of pregnancy prevention. Recognition of such research gaps during the SPR revision process can serve as a framework to direct future high-quality studies that will further inform recommendations, better meet providers' needs, and improve quality of family planning services.

### Norelgestromin and ethinly estradiol [^116ZqZm3]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

If the woman does not have scheduled or withdrawal bleeding (bleeding that should occur during the patch-free week), she should resume treatment on the next scheduled Change Day. If norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system has been used correctly, the absence of withdrawal bleeding is not necessarily an indication of pregnancy. Nevertheless, consider the possibility of pregnancy, especially if absence of withdrawal bleeding occurs in 2 consecutive cycles. Discontinue norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system if pregnancy is confirmed.

In Case of Skin Irritation

If patch use results in uncomfortable irritation, the patch may be removed and a new patch may be applied to a different location until the next Change Day. Only one patch should be worn at a time.

Additional Instructions for Dosing

Unscheduled bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing hormonal contraceptives. In case of breakthrough bleeding, as in all cases of irregular bleeding from the vagina, consider nonfunctional causes. In case of undiagnosed persistent or recurrent abnormal bleeding from the vagina, take adequate diagnostic measures to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another method of contraception may solve the problem.

Use of Hormonal Contraceptives in the Event of a Missed Menstrual Period

If the woman has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period. Discontinue use of norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system if pregnancy is confirmed.
If the woman has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses one period, she should continue using her contraceptive patches. However, if she has adhered to the prescribed regimen, misses one period and has symptoms associated with pregnancy, rule out pregnancy. Discontinue norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system use if pregnancy is confirmed.
If the woman has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, rule out pregnancy. Discontinue norelgestromin and ethinyl estradiol transdermal system use if pregnancy is confirmed.

### 20 mcg versus > 20 mcg estrogen combined oral contraceptives for contraception [^116QiuyX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Concern about estrogen-related adverse effects has led to progressive reductions in the estrogen dose in combination oral contraceptives (COCs). However, reducing the amount of estrogen to improve safety also could result in decreased contraceptive effectiveness and unacceptable changes in bleeding patterns.

Objectives

To test the hypothesis that COCs containing ≤ 20 mcg ethinyl estradiol (EE) perform similarly as those containing > 20 mcg in terms of contraceptive effectiveness, bleeding patterns, discontinuation, and side effects.

Search Strategy

We searched computerized databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and POPLINE) from their inception to November 2003, searched the references of eligible trials, and wrote to oral contraceptive manufacturers to identify eligible trials.

Selection Criteria

English-language reports of randomized controlled trials that compare a COC containing ≤ 20 mcg EE with a COC containing > 20 mcg EE were eligible. We excluded studies where the interventions were designed to be administered for less than three consecutive cycles or to be used primarily as treatment for non-contraceptive conditions. Trials had to report on contraceptive effectiveness, bleeding patterns, trial discontinuation due to bleeding-related reasons or other side effects, or side effects to be included in the review.

No differences were found in contraceptive effectiveness for the 11 COC pairs for which this outcome was reported. Several COCs containing 20 mcg EE resulted in higher rates of early trial discontinuation (overall and due to adverse events such as irregular bleeding) as well as increased risk of bleeding disturbances (both amenorrhea/infrequent bleeding and irregular, prolonged, frequent bleeding, or breakthrough bleeding or spotting) than their higher-estrogen comparison pills.

Authors' Conclusions

### Efficacy and safety of a transdermal contraceptive system [^112NGN8f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy, cycle control, compliance, and safety of a transdermal contraceptive system that delivers norelgestromin 150 microg and ethinyl estradiol 20 microg daily.

Methods

In this open-label, 73-center study, 1672 healthy, ovulatory, sexually active women received ORTHO EVRA/EVRA for six (n = 1171) or 13 cycles (n = 501). The treatment regimen for each cycle was three consecutive 7-day patches (21 days) followed by 1 patch-free week.

Results

The overall and method-failure probabilities of pregnancy through 13 cycles were 0.7% and 0.4%, respectively. The incidence of breakthrough bleeding was low throughout the study. Perfect compliance (21 consecutive days of dosing, followed by a 7-day drug-free interval; no patch could be worn for more than 7 days) was achieved in 90% of subject cycles; only 1.9% of patches detached completely. Adverse events were typical of hormonal contraception, and most were mild-to-moderate in severity and not treatment limiting. The most common adverse events resulting in discontinuation were application site reactions (1.9%), nausea (1.8%), emotional lability (1.5%), headache (1.1%), and breast discomfort (1.0%).

Conclusions

The transdermal contraceptive patch provides effective contraception and cycle control, and is well tolerated. The weekly change schedule for the contraceptive patch is associated with excellent compliance and wearability characteristics.

### Vaginal bleeding disturbances and implantable contraceptives [^114QZWQa]. Contraception (2002). Low credibility.

Implantable contraceptives allow safe and effective fertility regulation for up to 5 years. Currently available devices release low doses of progestogens. Disruption of vaginal bleeding patterns is almost inevitable, particularly during the initial months of use. Irregular and prolonged bleeding as well as amenorrhea are common. Irregular bleeding is unpopular with most women and unacceptable to some. This review describes the vaginal bleeding disturbances induced by modern implantable contraceptives and discusses the implications of these in terms of method use and discontinuations. The cause of the irregular bleeding is not fully understood, but recent evidence suggests that an increase in endometrial vascular fragility might precipitate vessel breakdown and, hence, breakthrough bleeding. This review discusses this evidence and outline the possible mechanisms underlying breakthrough bleeding associated with implantable contraceptives. In addition, therapies for bleeding disturbances are described and their efficacy reviewed.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^114s2gVe]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Combined oral contraceptives (COC) and other contraceptive modalities — lipid and thrombotic effects are outlined: COC use carries thrombotic risk and most products contain ≤ 35 μg of ethinyl-estradiol; the estrogen component frequently increases triglycerides (TG) and HDL-C and lowers LDL-C, while androgenic progestins (norgestrel, levonorgestrel) can raise LDL-C and lower HDL-C; low-dose norethindrone COCs and desogestrel raise HDL-C and lower LDL-C, and higher estrogen content can cause severe hypertriglyceridemia in women with high baseline TG. Transdermal or vaginal contraceptives do not have a lower thrombotic risk than COC, but transdermal formulations are less prone to clinically important TG elevations. Progestin-only oral, injectable, and implantable options are available and efficacious, though they are not as effective for contraception and have greater risk of breakthrough bleeding.

### Continuous combination oral contraceptive pills to eliminate withdrawal bleeding: a randomized trial [^116VDHbq]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare bleeding profiles of a traditional 28-day oral contraceptive pill cycle with continuous administration.

Methods

After a 28-day run-in cycle, women were randomized to either 28-day cycles (21 active pills and a pill-free week) or continuous use of the same 20 microg ethinyl estradiol/100 microg levonorgestrel formulation for 12 study cycles (336 days). The number of bleeding and spotting days were measured by daily diary. A subset underwent cycle 1 (n = 16), and nine (n = 14) pelvic ultrasound and endometrial histology sampling. Blood pressure, weight, hemoglobin, and adverse events were measured at revisit. The sample size with 80% power to detect a 67% reduction in bleeding days required 27 subjects in each arm.

Results

Of the 79 subjects randomized, 28 (70%) of the 28-day cycle and 32 (82%) of the continuous-use subjects completed the entire study (P = 0.6). With continuous use, 49%, 68%, and 88% of women reported no bleeding during cycles 2, 6, and 12, respectively. Amenorrhea or infrequent bleeding was present in 68% of continuous users during cycles 1–3 and increased to 88% during cycles 10–12. Spotting during cycle days 1–21 increased initially with continuous use but reduced over time, and by 9 months was less than the spotting reported by cyclic users. Adverse events, blood pressure, weight, and hemoglobin findings were similar between groups.

Conclusion

Extension of the 28-day oral contraceptive cycle to continuous use with a low-estrogen dose combination oral birth control pill resulted in significantly fewer bleeding days.

### Twenty micrograms vs. > 20 microg estrogen oral contraceptives for contraception: systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^1126pSni]. Contraception (2005). Low credibility.

Concern about estrogen-related adverse effects has led to progressive reductions in the estrogen dose in combination oral contraceptives (COCs). This review of randomized controlled trials tested the hypothesis that COCs containing ≤ 20 microg ethinyl estradiol (EE) perform similarly to those containing > 20 microg in terms of contraceptive effectiveness, bleeding patterns, discontinuation and side effects. Data from the 18 eligible trials conducted to date are inadequate for detecting possible differences in contraceptive effectiveness. Several COCs containing 20 microg EE resulted in higher rates of early trial discontinuation (overall and due to adverse events such as irregular bleeding) as well as increased risk of bleeding disturbances (both amenorrhea/infrequent bleeding and irregular, prolonged, frequent bleeding or breakthrough bleeding or spotting) than their higher-estrogen comparison pills. However, most trials compared COCs containing different progestin types, and changes in bleeding patterns could be related to progestin type as well as estrogen dose. While health care providers and women might select COCs containing 20 microg EE based on theoretical improvements in safety profile from the reduced dose of estrogen, no evidence is available to support this choice.

### Low-dose oral contraceptives: health consequences of discontinuation [^1168u3FB]. Contraception (2000). Low credibility.

Presently, the lowest effective estrogen dose available as a combination oral contraceptive (OC) in the United States is 20 microg of ethinyl estradiol (EE) with different progestins. Twenty micrograms of EE coupled with levonorgestrel results in fewer side effects and cycle control comparable with higher-dose pills. Differences between therapeutically equivalent and brand-name, low-dose oral contraceptives, with respect to the bioavailability of hormones, may interfere with contraceptive efficacy and increase breakthrough bleeding. One of the most common reasons why women discontinue OCs is increased breakthrough bleeding. Because after OC discontinuation most women switch to a less-effective method, or no method, of contraception, an increase in breakthrough bleeding could ultimately result in an increase in unintended pregnancy. Thus, substituting a therapeutically equivalent for a brand-name low-dose oral contraceptive may have significant clinical and economic effects on individual and public health.

### Transdermal contraception: evaluation of three transdermal norelgestromin / ethinyl estradiol doses in a randomized, multicenter, dose-response study [^113JEaHG]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to identify the dose for a contraceptive patch that provides a predetermined level of ovulation suppression and cycle control and that is well tolerated.

Study Design

In this randomized study, 610 subjects received 10-, 15-, or 20-cm(2) patch dose sizes (20-cm(2), Ortho Evra/Evra) (Janssen Pharmaceutica, NV Belgium) or Ortho-Cyclen/Cilest (Janssen Pharmaceutica, NV Belgium) for up to 4 cycles. As with Ortho-Cyclen, patch regimens included 21 dosing days (3 consecutive 7-day patches) followed by 1 dose-free week.

Results

The patch regimens demonstrated a dose-response for ovulation suppression and cycle control. Presumed ovulation, determined on the basis of serum progesterone concentrations ≥ 3 ng/mL in cycles 1 and 3, occurred in 6.2% (Ortho Evra) and 7.2% (Ortho-Cyclen) of subjects. At cycle 3, breakthrough bleeding/spotting was reported by 10.5% and 15.0% of subjects, respectively. Compliance with each patch was superior to that with Ortho-Cyclen (all P < .001). All regimens had safety profiles typical of oral contraceptives.

Conclusion

The 20-cm(2) patch (Ortho Evra) provided ovulation suppression, cycle control, and safety similar to that of Ortho-Cyclen, with significantly better compliance.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^113ba98y]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Endometrial cancer — systemic estrogen therapy risks and progestogen use are summarized as follows: unopposed systemic ET in a postmenopausal woman with an intact uterus increases the risk of endometrial cancer and is dose- and duration-related; progestogen used continuously or cyclically for 10 to 14 days monthly significantly reduces this risk, and adequate concomitant progestogen is recommended for a woman with an intact uterus when using systemic ET; low-dose vaginal ET does not appear to increase endometrial cancer risk, although trials with endometrial biopsy end points are limited to 1 year in duration; progestogen is not advised with low-dose vaginal ET for GSM, although intermittent use may be considered in women at increased risk; and postmenopausal bleeding must be evaluated thoroughly because it may signal endometrial hyperplasia or cancer.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^115RdAq5]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Dosing of systemic estrogen therapy (ET) and progestogen — The therapeutic goal should be to use the most appropriate, often lowest, effective dose of systemic ET consistent with treatment goals, and the appropriate dose of progestogen is added to provide endometrial protection if a woman has a uterus, unless CEE is combined with BZA. Progestogen dosing-regimen options that provide for endometrial safety are dependent on the potency of the progestogen and vary with the estrogen dose, and different types and doses of progestogens, routes of administration, and types of regimen (sequential or continuous-combined) may have different associations with health outcomes; patient preference can and should be considered because many women will opt for regimens that avoid periodic menstrual bleeding.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111waK4C]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Estrogen–progestogen therapy (EPT) and endometrial safety — When adequate progestogen is combined with systemic estrogen, the risk of endometrial neoplasia is not higher than in untreated women, and in the WHI continuous oral CEE plus MPA showed endometrial cancer risk similar to placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–1.36) with significant reduction after a median 13 years' cumulative follow-up (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49–0.91). A meta-analysis suggested increased risk of endometrial cancer (relative risk [RR], 1.2) with noncontinuous combined EPT but not with continuous EPT. For prevention of endometrial hyperplasia, oral MP should be adequately dosed (eg, 200 mg/d for 12–14 d/mo), and off-label use of a levonorgestrel-containing intrauterine device may avoid adverse systemic effects and can protect against unwanted pregnancy, although there are limited clinical trial data to support this use. In women using EPT, unscheduled bleeding occurring more than 6 months after initiation should be investigated.

### Estradiol (minivelle) [^114KWDzg]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Generally, when estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, consider addition of a progestogen to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. Generally, a woman without a uterus, does not need to use a progestogen in addition to her estrogen therapy. In some cases, however, hysterectomized women who have a history of endometriosis may need a progestogen [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.14)].

Use estrogen-alone, or in combination with a progestogen, at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Reevaluate postmenopausal women periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary.

2.1 Treatment of Moderate to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms due to Menopause

Start therapy with MINIVELLE 0.0375 mg per day applied to the skin twice weekly. Make dosage adjustments based on clinical response. Attempt to taper or discontinue MINIVELLE at 3 to 6 month intervals.

2.3	Application Instructions

Place the adhesive side of MINIVELLE on a clean, dry area on the lower abdomen (below the umbilicus) or buttocks. Do not apply MINIVELLE to the breasts.

Replace MINIVELLE twice weekly (every 3–4 days).

Rotate the sites of application, with an interval of at least 1 week allowed between applications to a particular site.

Select an area for application that is not oily, damaged, or irritated. Avoid the waistline, since tight clothing may rub the system off. Apply the system immediately after opening the pouch and removing the protective liner. Press the system firmly in place with the palm of the hand for about 10 seconds, making sure there is good contact with the skin, especially around the edges. In the event that a system falls off, reapply the same system or apply a new system to another location. In either case, continue the original treatment schedule. If a woman has forgotten to apply MINIVELLE, have her apply a new system as soon as possible. Apply the new system on the original treatment schedule. The interruption of treatment in women taking MINIVELLE might increase the likelihood of breakthrough bleeding, spotting and recurrence of symptoms.

5. Risk of Cancer

It is not known if hormonal birth control pills causes breast cancer. Some studies, but not all, suggest that there could be a slight increase in the risk of breast cancer among current users with longer duration of use.

If you have breast cancer now, or have had it in the past, do not use hormonal birth control because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones.

Some studies have found an increase in the incidence of cancer of the cervix in women who use oral contraceptives. However, this finding may be related to factors other than the use of oral contraceptives.

6. Lipid Metabolism and Pancreatitis

There have been reports of increases of blood cholesterol and triglycerides in users of combination oral contraceptives. Increases in triglycerides have led to inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) in some cases.

WARNING SIGNALS

If any of these adverse effects occur while you are taking oral contraceptives, call your health-care provider immediately:

SIDE EFFECTS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

1. Unscheduled or breakthrough vaginal bleeding or spotting

Unscheduled vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking the pills. Unscheduled bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding which is a flow much like a regular period. Unscheduled bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral-contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle or lasts for more than a few days, talk to your health-care provider.

### U.S. selected practice recommendations for contraceptive use, 2024 [^116SWDdq]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Levonorgestrel and Combined Estrogen and Progestin ECPs

Any regular contraceptive method may be started or resumed immediately after the use of LNG or combined estrogen and progestin ECPs.
The patient needs to abstain from sexual intercourse or use barrier methods (e.g. condoms) for 7 days.
Advise the patient to have a pregnancy test if they do not have a withdrawal bleed within 3 weeks.

Comments and Evidence Summary. Because of the antiprogestin properties of UPA, concern exists that starting or resuming progestin-containing regular contraception around the same time as UPA administration might decrease the effectiveness of UPA or the regular contraceptive method. Therefore, the initiation or resumption of regular hormonal contraception after UPA use involves consideration of the risk for pregnancy if UPA fails and the risk for pregnancy if regular contraception use is delayed until the subsequent menstrual cycle. A health care provider can provide or prescribe pills, the patch, or the ring for a patient to start no sooner than 5 days after use of UPA. For methods requiring a visit to a health care provider, such as provider-administered DMPA, implants, and IUDs, starting the method at the time of UPA use may be considered; the risk that the regular contraceptive method might decrease the effectiveness of UPA must be weighed against the risk of not starting a regular hormonal contraceptive method.

Statement 12.7 — menstrual suppression for transgender and gender diverse (TGD) adolescents with a uterus — states: We recommend health care professionals prescribe progestogens or a GnRH agonist for eligible* transgender and gender diverse adolescents with a uterus to reduce dysphoria caused by their menstrual cycle when gender-affirming testosterone use is not yet indicated. Progestogens may be effective for sole menstrual suppression, with options including continuous progestin-only oral pills, medroxyprogesterone injections, or levonorgestrel intrauterine device for induction of amenorrhea. TGD individuals with functioning ovaries who start testosterone therapy may have 1–5 menstrual cycles before amenorrhea is achieved. TGD individuals with functioning ovaries and a uterus should be counseled about the potential for breakthrough menstrual bleeding in the first few months after initiating menstrual suppression, and with GnRHa therapy, breakthrough bleeding may occur 2–3 weeks after initiation; for those seeking contraception or with persistent bleeding on progestin therapy, an estrogen combination with progestin may be considered for maintenance of amenorrhea, with counseling on the possible side effect of breast development.

Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) — hormone therapy dosing, timelines, and discontinuation guidance — Compared with placebo, estrogen therapy (ET) alone or estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) reduced weekly symptom frequency by 75% (95% CI, 64.3–82.3). Lower-dose regimens — oral conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) 0.3 mg, oral 17β-estradiol ≤ 0.5 mg, or an estradiol patch 0.025 mg — may take 6 to 8 weeks to provide adequate symptom relief. The lowest dose-approved estradiol weekly patch (0.014 mg/d) appears effective for VMS but is FDA approved only for prevention of osteoporosis. Progestogen-only options reported effective for VMS include medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 10 mg, oral megestrol acetate 20 mg, and micronized progesterone (MP) 300 mg. VMS return in approximately 50% of women after hormone therapy is discontinued, and there is no consistent evidence that gradual tapering is superior to abrupt stopping.

### A cost-effectiveness evaluation of two continuous-combined hormone therapies for the management of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms [^113ffXg5]. Menopause (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

After the release of the results of the Women's Health Initiative, an emerging consensus suggests that continuous-combined hormone therapy (CCHT) should be limited to short-term management of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms. This, in turn, raises the important question of the economic value, if any, of short-term CCHT for this indication. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing a 1-year treatment course with 1 mg of norethindrone acetate/5 microg of ethinyl estradiol (1/5 NA/EE) or 0.625 mg/day of conjugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone (0.625/2.5 CEE/MPA) compared with no therapy for the management of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms.

Design

A literature-based Markov model was developed to compare these three options' cost and quality-of-life (QOL) benefits. The impact of therapy on vasomotor symptoms and breakthrough bleeding/spotting on the direct costs of care and QOL were considered.

Results

Compared with no therapy, CCHTs resulted in net increases in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained (0.110 for 1/5 NA/NE v 0.104 for 0.625/2.5 CEE/MPA). Net costs (v no therapy) were $167 lower for 1/5 NA/NE compared with 0.625/2.5 CEE/MPA. Cost per QALY gained (compared with no therapy) were $6,200 and $8,200, respectively. Cost-effectiveness was most favorable for individuals with more severe symptoms who were less bothered by breakthrough bleeding/spotting.

Conclusions

A short-term course of CCHT for the sole purpose of managing moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms is cost-effective. However, 1/5 NA/NE seemed to be more cost-effective than 0.625/2.5 CEE/MPA. These findings can be used to further refine the role of CCHT and to improve formulary decisions.

### Dysmenorrhea, a narrative review of therapeutic options [^116usVBu]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Hormonal-Based Therapy: Hormonal Contraception

Another pharmacologic treatment for primary dysmenorrhea is hormonal-based contraception. For women who are agreeable to hormonal treatment and desire contraception in addition to dysmenorrhea treatment, hormonal contraception is a good option. Estrogen prevents the release of FSH, ultimately preventing ovulation. Progesterone causes thinning of the endometrial lining and thickening of cervical mucus, preventing sperm from penetrating. A thin endometrial lining has less arachidonic acid to be used for prostaglandin synthesis, thus reducing both blood flow and contractions during menstruation.

There are many forms of combined estrogen-progesterone therapies such as oral contraception pills (OCPs), a transdermal patch, or a vaginal ring. A Cochrane review article investigating oral contraceptive use identified twenty-one randomized control trials comparing OCPs with placebo, different dosages of OCPs, and OCPs versus NSAIDs. The review found that OCPs reduce pain significantly more than placebo pills in women who suffer from dysmenorrhea. However, OCPs increase the risk of side effects, including irregular bleeding and headaches, and have been known to increase the risk of adverse events, such as blood clots. The data were insufficient to determine if continuous OCPs (no inactive tablets) were superior to the standard regiment of 21 days of hormone pills. There was also insufficient evidence in this review comparing NSAIDs and OCPs. Furthermore, rates of symptom relief were similar with estrogen doses < 35mcg or > 35mcg. There are limited data investigating the use of an estrogen vaginal ring or transdermal patch in the treatment of dysmenorrhea. One review showed evidence that the vaginal ring works as well as OCPs for symptom relief, while another randomized trial suggested OCPs have better efficacy than the transdermal patch. Nonetheless, the decision to implement estrogen-based therapies and the route of administration should be a shared decision between women and doctor with the women's medical history taken into consideration.

Hormonal treatment. COCs: COC courses ranging from 14 to 42 days decreased bleeding on treatment compared with placebo in both LNG and ENG implant users but did not improve bleeding after treatment cessation. Three trials compared a 30 µ g EE/150 µ g LNG pill with placebo [two among ENG implant users and one among LNG implant users], whereas a study among LNG users compared a 50 µ g EE/250 µ g LNG pill with placebo. In addition, a 20 µ g EE/150 µ g desogestrel COC improved time to bleeding episode cessation compared with mefenamic acid among ENG implant users (Certainty of evidence for COCs: very low to high; certainty of evidence for COC versus mefenamic acid: low).

Estrogen: EE use among LNG implant users decreased bleeding on treatment compared with placebo but had inconsistent effects on bleeding patterns after treatment completion. In two RCTs and one trial with a nonrandom method of allocation (i.e. assigned systematically, in sequence of enrollment), EE (50 µ g) daily for approximately 3 weeks decreased bleeding and spotting while on treatment, but off-treatment effects were inconsistent; only the nonrandomized trial reported decreased bleeding and spotting days after treatment cessation for EE (50 µ g) users compared with placebo. EE (20 µ g) for 10 days and use of an estradiol patch (100 µ g/day releasing) for 6 weeks did not improve bleeding irregularities compared with placebo. No trials investigated use of EE among ENG implant users (Certainty of evidence for oral EE [50 µ g]: very low to moderate; certainty of evidence for oral EE [20 µ g] and estradiol patch: very low).

### Endometrial safety and bleeding profile of a 17 β-estradiol / progesterone oral softgel capsule (TX-001HR) [^113TpLk5]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The REPLENISH trial demonstrated endometrial protection and favorable amenorrhea rates for all four doses of TX-001HR, an E2/P4 single-dose, softgel capsule, when used to treat moderate to severe VMS in menopausal women with a uterus. This is the first time that E2 and P4 have been combined in a single capsule for continuous use. After 1 year of TX-001HR use, the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia was less than 1%, demonstrating that endometrial protection, as defined by the FDA, was accomplished with the P4 component of TX-001HR. The high rates of cumulative amenorrhea with 1 mg E2/100 mg P4 make it a good therapeutic option for postmenopausal women seeking treatment for moderate to severe VMS and those who may be concerned about bleeding and bleeding-associated malignancy risks.

The data showing that oral TX-001HR did not cause endometrial stimulation are noteworthy because this is the first time dosages of 50 and 100 mg of P4 were shown to inhibit the stimulatory effects of E2 when taken continuously in a properly powered and randomized controlled trial. In the Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions trial, women taking individual capsules of 200 mg of micronized P4 cyclically 12 days out of a 28-day cycle with 0.625 mg of continuous conjugated equine estrogens had a risk of hyperplasia not different than the placebo group. Although the Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions trial was longer than the REPLENISH trial, it was not powered to show an increase in endometrial hyperplasia risk.

Prior studies evaluating HT using bioidentical E2 and P4 have required users to take two products, such as a combination of oral, transdermal, or vaginal estrogen with an oral or vaginal P4. The use of individual products, such as an estrogen patch and oral progesterone, have, however, never been systematically evaluated and may lead to an increase in the risk of endometrial cancer.

Clinical management during menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) — For women with persistent unscheduled bleeding while taking MHT, we recommend evaluation to rule out pelvic pathology, most importantly, endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, and we recommend informing women about the possible increased risk of breast cancer during and after discontinuing EPT while emphasizing adherence to age-appropriate breast cancer screening. Regular clinical follow-up, initially, within 1 to 3 months after starting MHT, and then every 6 to 12 months, allows monitoring of efficacy and side effects and treatment adjustments as needed.

### Oral contraceptive tolerance: does the type of pill matter? [^114LsuqY]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the frequencies of reported symptoms by oral contraceptive pill (OCP) composition among French women.

Methods

A population-based cohort of 2,863 women studied between 2000 and 2004 was used to compare the frequency of reported symptoms (weight gain, nausea, breast tenderness, lower frequency of menstrual periods, breakthrough bleeding, painful and heavy periods, swollen legs) by type of OCPs (classified by estrogen dosage, progestin component, and sequence of administration).

Results

Results show little variation in the frequency of symptoms by type of OCPs, with the exception of progestin-only pills being associated with higher frequencies of breakthrough bleeding and lower frequencies of menstrual periods. We found no decrease in the reporting of symptoms with the reduction of estrogen dosage, nor with the use of third-generation OCPs compared with second-generation OCPs. Likewise, we found little variation by sequence of administration of OCPs (monophasic versus triphasic).

Conclusion

In the absence of sufficient evidence-based data to support the existence of differences in the tolerance profile of low-dose combined OCPs, future well-designed randomized trials are needed to guide providers in their choice of OCPs. However, research should also assess the effectiveness of counseling on the tolerance of OCPs, an intervention that may prove to be more rewarding than basing the choice of OCPs on their theoretical properties.

Bleeding Irregularities with Extended or Continuous Use of CHCs

Before initiation of CHCs, provide counseling about potential changes in bleeding patterns during extended or continuous CHC use. Extended contraceptive use has been defined as a planned hormone-free interval after more than 28 days of active hormones. Continuous contraceptive use has been defined as uninterrupted use of hormonal contraception without a hormone-free interval.
Spotting or bleeding is common during the first 3–6 months of extended or continuous CHC use. Spotting or bleeding is generally not harmful but might be bothersome to the patient. Bleeding changes generally decrease with continued CHC use.
If clinically indicated, consider an underlying health condition, such as inconsistent use, interactions with other medications, cigarette smoking, STIs, pregnancy, thyroid disorders, or new pathologic uterine conditions (e.g. polyps or fibroids). If an underlying health condition is found, treat the condition or refer for care.
Explore patient goals, including continued CHCs (with or without treatment for bleeding irregularities) or discontinuation of CHCs. If the patient wants to continue CHCs, provide reassurance, discuss options for management of bleeding irregularities if it is desired, and advise the patient that they may contact their provider at any time to discuss bleeding irregularities or other side effects.
If the patient wants to discontinue CHCs at any time, offer counseling on alternative contraceptive methods, and initiate another method if it is desired.
If the patient wants treatment, the following treatment option may be considered: º Advise the patient to discontinue CHC use (i.e. a hormone-free interval) for 3–4 consecutive days; a hormone-free interval is not recommended during the first 21 days of using the continuous or extended CHC method. A hormone-free interval also is not recommended more than once per month because contraceptive effectiveness might be reduced.

### When can a woman start combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs)? A systematic review [^116XpFhz]. Contraception (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Conventional methods of initiating combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs), specifically combined oral contraceptives (COCs), the contraceptive patch and the contraceptive ring, require that women delay starting CHCs until menses begin, during which time a woman may be at risk of unintended pregnancy. The objective of this systematic review is to examine the evidence on the risk of becoming pregnant after starting the method (contraceptive effectiveness including surrogate measures such as ovarian follicular development and hormone levels), risk of already being pregnant, side effects and continuation when starting CHCs on different days of the menstrual cycle.

Study Design

We searched the MEDLINE database for all articles (in all languages) published in peer-reviewed journals from inception through March 2012 for evidence relevant to starting CHCs on different days of the menstrual cycle and the outcomes of contraceptive effectiveness (including ovarian follicular development and hormonal levels), side effects and continuation rates.

Results

From 1635 reviewed articles, 18 studies met our inclusion criteria. Evidence from four studies suggests that neither the risk of inadvertently starting COCs in a woman who is pregnant nor the risk of pregnancy after COC initiation are affected by the cycle day on which COCs are started. While follicular activity increased as the cycle day on which COCs were initiated increased, no women ovulated when starting on Day 5. When starting on Day 7, there was no increase in ovulation for a 30-mcg pill but a significant increase in ovulation with a 20-mcg pill compared with starting on Day 1. Evidence from two small studies suggests that 7 days of pills leads to inhibition of ovulation. One small study suggests that only 3 days of ring use is needed to inhibit ovulation, but this was following one complete treatment cycle of ring use. Evidence also suggests that starting CHCs on any day of the cycle does not affect bleeding problems or other side effects for both COCs and the patch. While starting CHCs via Quick Start (starting on the day of the health care visit) may initially increase continuation compared with more conventional starting strategies, evidence suggests that this difference disappears over time.

Conclusion

The body of evidence suggested that (a) pregnancy rates did not differ by the timing of CHC initiation; (b) the more follicular activity that occurred prior to starting COCs, the more likely ovulation was to occur; however, no ovulations were seen when COCs were started at a follicle diameter of 10 mm (mean cycle day = 7.6) or when the ring was started at follicle diameter of 13 mm (median cycle day = 11); (c) bleeding patterns and other side effects did not vary with the timing of CHC initiation and (d) continuation rates of CHCs were initially improved by Quick Start, but differences between groups disappeared over time.

DAY 1 START

Counting the first day of menstruation as "Day 1", tablets are taken without interruption as follows: One white tablet daily for 21 days, one green (inert) tablet daily for 2 days followed by 1 yellow (ethinyl estradiol) tablet daily for 5 days. For all subsequent cycles, the patient then begins a new 28 tablet regimen on the next day after taking the last yellow tablet. [If switching directly from another oral contraceptive, the first white tablet should be taken on the first day of menstruation which begins after the last ACTIVE tablet of the previous product.]

If a patient misses 1 white tablet, she should take the missed tablet as soon as she remembers. If the patient misses 2 consecutive white tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take 2 tablets the day she remembers and 2 tablets the next day; thereafter, the patient should resume taking 1 tablet daily until she finishes the cycle pack. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control if she has intercourse in the 7 days after missing pills. If the patient misses 2 consecutive white tablets in the third week or if the patient misses 3 or more white tablets in a row at any time during the cycle, the patient should throw out the rest of that cycle pack and start a new cycle pack that same day. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control if she has intercourse in the 7 days after missing pills.

ALL ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing oral contraceptives. In breakthrough bleeding, as in all cases of irregular bleeding from the vagina, non-functional causes should be borne in mind. In undiagnosed persistent or recurrent abnormal bleeding from the vagina, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If both pregnancy and pathology have been excluded, time or a change to another preparation may solve the problem. Changing to an oral contraceptive with a higher estrogen content, while potentially useful in minimizing menstrual irregularity, should be done only if necessary since this may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease.

Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period:

If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and oral contraceptive use should be discontinued until pregnancy is ruled out.
If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out before continuing oral contraceptive use.

*Cumulative amenorrhea is defined as the absence of bleeding for the duration of a 28-day cycle and sustained to the end of the study.

Women's Health Initiative Studies

The WHI enrolled approximately 27,000 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women in two substudies to assess the risks and benefits of daily oral CE (0.625 mg)-alone or in combination with MPA (2.5 mg) compared to placebo in the prevention of certain chronic diseases. The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) [defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI and CHD death], with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A "global index" included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, PE, endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other cause. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE plus MPA or CE-alone on menopausal symptoms.

The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the "global index". The absolute excess risk of events included in the "global index" was 19 per 10,000 women-years.

We suggest that the decision to continue MHT be revisited at least annually, targeting the shortest total duration of MHT consistent with the treatment goals and evolving risk assessment of the individual woman. For young women with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), premature or early menopause, without contraindications, we suggest taking MHT until the time of anticipated natural menopause, when the advisability of continuing MHT can be reassessed. For women preparing to discontinue MHT, we suggest a shared decision-making approach to elicit individual preference about adopting a gradual taper vs abrupt discontinuation.

### Low dose transdermal estradiol / norethisterone acetate treatment over 2 years does not cause endometrial proliferation in postmenopausal women [^115MiPc2]. Menopause (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

We investigated the effects of 2-year transdermal continuous combined estradiol (0.025 mg/day) and norethisterone acetate (0.125 mg/day) (Estragest TTS) on bleeding and on the endometrium.

Design

This double-blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel, 1-year trial enrolled 266 healthy women at least 2 years past menopause with intact uteri. Patients received a transdermal patch delivering either 0.025 mg estradiol and 0.125 mg norethisterone acetate daily or placebo. Of the 266 women initially included, 135 (96 Estragest TTS, 39 placebo) completed a second year open follow-up, where all women had the estradiol/norethisterone patch. Endometrial biopsies were performed at weeks 0, 48 (n = 171), and 96 (n = 109). Effects on endometrial morphology and uterine bleeding were studied.

Results

The overall incidence of endometrial hyperplasia after treatment with the estradiol/norethisterone acetate patch for one year was 0.8% with only one case of atypical hyperplasia. There were no clinically significant changes in endometrial thickness in either treatment group. The proportion of bleed-free patients with the estradiol/norethisterone acetate transdermal system increased from 55% in cycles 1–3 to 83% in cycles 10–12. By the 12th cycle, 92% of patients receiving estradiol/norethisterone acetate patches were bleed-free. No additional hyperplasia was seen during the second year follow-up.

Conclusions

A continuous combined transdermal patch delivering 0.025 mg estradiol/day and 0.125 mg norethisterone acetate/day provided good endometrial protection. The dose maintained a consistently high rate of amenorrhea in postmenopausal women.

### A phase 2b, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-ranging study of the neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist fezolinetant for vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause [^113j5kRJ]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Vasomotor symptoms (VMS), consisting of hot flashes and night sweats, are among the most common and bothersome symptoms of menopause. Up to 80% of women in the United States experience VMS during the menopausal transition, and VMS persist for a median of 7.4 years. Up to two thirds of women who experience VMS find these symptoms bothersome. Furthermore, VMS are the menopausal symptoms for which women most often seek treatment. However, in the United States and most European countries, only about 3% to 10% of perimenopausal and postmenopausal women use menopausal hormone therapy (HT), - the most effective available treatment for VMS associated with menopause. - A recent meta-analysis of prospective studies including more than 100,000 postmenopausal women who developed breast cancer described an increased relative risk of breast cancer associated with use of HT (estrogen alone or combination estrogen/progestogen) as well as with a longer duration of HT use. Also, systemic estrogen/progestogen therapy has been associated with an increased risk of stroke and venous thromboembolism and with common adverse events (AEs) including breakthrough bleeding, breast tenderness, nausea, bloating, and mood swings. Despite recognition of the continued role for HT in international clinical practice guidelines, especially for symptomatic women aged < 60 years or within 10 years of menopause, -, safety and tolerability concerns have discouraged women suffering from VMS from using HT.

### Dysmenorrhea, a narrative review of therapeutic options [^117EiY5F]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Progestin-only contraception has also been shown to improve dysmenorrhea. Studies of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) have shown lower rates of pelvic pain in women with dysmenorrhea from 60% to 29% after 36 months of use. The implantable contraceptive device, a single-rod etonogestrel-releasing contraceptive implanted in the upper arm (commonly known as the Nexplanon), is also effective for symptom relief. In a small pilot study, the implant reduced dysmenorrhea by 68% after 6 months; another study reported a decrease in dysmenorrhea by 58% after using the injectable contraception medroxyprogesterone acetate (commonly known as Depo-Provera). Medroxyprogesterone is associated with weight gain, delayed return to fertility, and should be used with caution for greater than two years as there is a risk of osteoporosis with long-term use. Limitations in using progestin-only pills include increased breakthrough bleeding; however, progestin-only contraception is a good alternative for women who have contraindications to estrogen, including hypertension, history of stroke, ischemic heart disease, blood clotting disorders, current breast cancer, liver abnormalities, migraines with aura, and smoking use over age 35.

### Estradiol / norethindrone acetate transdermal system — combiPatch — estradiol / norethindrone acetate transdermal system [^117QpK3i]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Generally, when estrogen therapy is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus, a progestin should be considered to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. A woman without a uterus generally does not need a progestin. In some cases, however, hysterectomized women with a history of endometriosis may need a progestin. Use of estrogen-alone or in combination with a progestin, should be with the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. Postmenopausal women should be reevaluated periodically as clinically appropriate to determine whether treatment is still necessary. Adequate diagnostic measures, such as directed or random endometrial sampling, when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in a postmenopausal woman with a uterus with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding.

Initiation of Therapy

Patients should be started at the lowest dose. Estrogens with or without progestins should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman. The lowest effective dose of CombiPatch has not been determined in clinical trials.

Women not currently using continuous estrogen or combination estrogen plus progestin therapy may start therapy with CombiPatch at any time. However, women currently using continuous estrogen or combination estrogen plus progestin therapy should complete the current cycle of therapy, before initiating CombiPatch therapy.

### Extended use of transdermal norelgestromin / ethinyl estradiol: a randomized trial [^1169Fj2r]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare bleeding profiles and satisfaction among women using a norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol (E2) transdermal contraceptive patch in an extended regimen to those among women using a traditional 28-day patch regimen.

Methods

Healthy, regularly menstruating women (N = 239) were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio) to receive the norelgestromin/ethinyl E2 transdermal patch in an extended regimen (weekly application for 12 consecutive weeks, 1 patch-free week, and 3 more consecutive weekly applications, n = 158) or a cyclic regimen (4 consecutive cycles of 3 weekly applications and 1 patch-free week, n = 81). Subjects recorded bleeding data daily and completed satisfaction questionnaires. Subjects and investigators provided overall assessments of the regimens.

Results

Extended use of the norelgestromin/ethinyl E2 transdermal patch resulted in fewer median bleeding days (6 compared with 14, P < .001), bleeding episodes (1 compared with 3, P < .001), and bleeding or spotting episodes (2 compared with 3, P < .001) compared with cyclic use during days 1–84; median numbers of bleeding or spotting days were similar between regimens (14 compared with 16, P = 0.407) during this time. Extended use delayed median time to first bleeding to 54 days compared with 25 days with cyclic (P < .001). Subjects were highly satisfied with both regimens. Although not statistically significant, slightly more adverse events were reported with the extended than with the 28-day regimen.

Conclusion

Compared with cyclic use, extended use of the norelgestromin/ethinyl E2 transdermal patch delayed menses and resulted in fewer bleeding days. This regimen may represent a useful alternative for women who prefer fewer episodes of withdrawal bleeding.

9. Carbohydrate And Lipid Metabolic Effects

Oral contraceptives have been shown to cause glucose intolerance in a significant percentage of users(23). Oral contraceptives containing greater than 75 mcg of estrogens cause hyperinsulinism, while lower doses of estrogen cause less glucose intolerance(62). Progestogens increase insulin secretion and create insulin resistance, this effect varying with different progestational agents(23,63). However, in the non-diabetic woman, oral contraceptives appear to have no effect on fasting blood glucose(64). Because of these demonstrated effects, prediabetic and diabetic women should be carefully observed while taking oral contraceptives.

A small proportion of women will have persistent hypertriglyceridemia while on the pill. As discussed earlier (see WARNINGS 1a. and 1d.), changes in serum triglycerides and lipoprotein levels have been reported in oral contraceptive users.

10. Elevated Blood Pressure

An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking oral contraceptives(65)and this increase is more likely in older oral contraceptive users(66)and with continued use(65). Data from the Royal College of General Practitioners(18)and subsequent randomized trials have shown that the incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestogens.

Women with a history of hypertension or hypertension-related diseases or renal disease(67)should be encouraged to use another method of contraception. If women elect to use oral contraceptives, they should be monitored closely, and if significant elevation of blood pressure occurs, oral contraceptives should be discontinued. For most women, elevated blood pressure will return to normal after stopping oral contraceptives(66), and there is no difference in the occurrence of hypertension among ever and never users(65,67,68).

11. Headache

The onset or exacerbation of migraine or development of headache with a new pattern which is recurrent, persistent, or severe requires discontinuation of oral contraceptives and evaluation of the cause.

12. Bleeding Irregularities

Breakthrough bleeding and spotting are sometimes encountered in patients on oral contraceptives, especially during the first three months of use. Non-hormonal causes should be considered, and adequate diagnostic measures taken to rule out malignancy or pregnancy in the event of breakthrough bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. In the event of amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out.

Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was preexistent.

### Bleeding patterns during continuous estradiol with different sequential progestogens therapy [^114jF5Qf]. Menopause (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effects on monthly bleeding of four different progestogens administered in association with transdermal estradiol in a continuous sequential estrogen-progestin therapy (CS-EPT).

Design

This prospective, open, randomized, clinical trial included 100 healthy postmenopausal women. Patients were randomized into four treatment groups, each consisting of 25 women. Treatment consisted of 50 mug/day transdermal 17beta-estradiol for all women combined to receive four different progestogens (group A: medroxyprogesterone acetate, 10 mg/day; group B: nomegestrol acetate, 5 mg/day; group C: dydrogesterone, 10 mg/day; group D: micronized progesterone, 200 mg/day) per os from the 14th to 25th day of each 28-day cycle. The duration of treatment was 12 cycles. Patients were asked to record in a daily diary the occurrence of any vaginal bleeding, the days of application of each patch, the days of assumption of the different progestogens, and the exact moment of bleeding onset.

Results

A total of 937 cycles could be evaluated. In 690 cycles (73.6%), regular progestogen-related bleeding was reported. Among the other cycles, we observed 73 episodes of amenorrhea (7.8%, each one lasting one cycle), 78 episodes of irregular bleeding (8.3%), and 96 episodes of spotting (10.2%). Patients receiving nomegestrol acetate had a significantly higher incidence of regular progestogen-associated bleeding in comparison with those receiving medroxyprogesterone acetate or natural progesterone, and patients receiving dydrogesterone had a significantly higher incidence of regular progestogen-associated bleeding in comparison with those receiving natural progesterone.

Conclusion

Our data suggest that CS-EPT generally leads to regular withdrawal bleeding in women without uterine pathology. Micronized progesterone seems to induce more irregular bleeding episodes.

### Treatment of vaginal bleeding irregularities induced by progestin only contraceptives [^111bpFSK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Despite their high effectiveness, progestin-only contraceptives are considered less than ideal by the many women who experience irregular vaginal bleeding when using them. Current treatments to control these bleeding problems are not sufficiently effective.

Objectives

We evaluated preventive and therapeutic approaches to normalise bleeding irregularities associated with the use of progestin-only contraceptives.

Search Strategy

Literature was identified through database searches, reference lists, organisations and individuals, covering the period until December 2006.

Selection Criteria

Trials with random or alternate allocation, testing interventions for the prevention or treatment of bleeding irregularities associated with the use of progestin-only contraceptives were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Results are expressed as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for categorical data and as weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% CI for continuous data. When we encountered heterogeneity (visual or statistical) we used the random-effects model (quantitative) or did not produce a summary estimate (qualitative).

Main Results

Twenty three randomised controlled trials enrolling 2674 participants were included. Seventy per cent were determined to reflect low to moderate risk of bias. Estrogen treatments reduced the number of days of an ongoing bleeding episode in DMPA and Norplant users. However, treatment frequently led to study discontinuation due to gastrointestinal upset. Combinations of oral ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel improved bleeding patterns in Norplant users, but method discontinuation rates were unchanged. One trial reported successful use of combined oral contraceptives in treating amenorrhea among DMPA users. Norplant users, but not Implanon users, administered the anti-progestin mifepristone reported fewer days of bleeding than those given placebo. Mifepristone used monthly by new Norplant acceptors reduced bleeding, when compared to placebo. A variety of NSAIDS have been evaluated for their ability to treat abnormal bleeding, with mixed results. Norplant users receiving tamoxifen had less unacceptable bleeding after treatment and were more likely to continue using Norplant than those receiving placebo. Tranexamic acid, mifepristone combined with an estrogen and doxycycline were more effective than placebo in terminating an episode of bleeding in women using progestin-only contraceptives, according to three small studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Some women may benefit from the interventions described, particularly with cessation of current bleeding. Several regimens offer promise in regulating bleeding, but findings need to be reproduced in larger trials. The results of this review do not support routine clinical use of any of the regimens included in the trials, particularly for long-term effect.

### The state of hormonal contraception today: benefits and risks of hormonal contraceptives: combined estrogen and progestin contraceptives [^113NjH6u]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion of effective birth control methods can be a challenging process for clinicians because the adoption and consistent use of contraception may be influenced by patients' fears, myths, and misperceptions. Over the years, new progestins have been included in combination contraceptives or are used alone to provide effective contraception as well as to decrease androgenic side effects and ameliorate the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Alternative delivery systems and regimens have also been introduced to improve tolerability and continuance and convenience of use. This is a review of estrogen and progestin combinations and their effects.

### Estrogens and breast cancer [^115RuJaT]. Annals of Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

It was a serendipitous contamination that introduced estrogen into oral contraceptives during the birth control pill trials in the 1950s. The 'birth control pill' was originally based on the observations that high levels of exogenous progesterone would mimic pregnancy and thereby block ovulation and conception. Though effective in preventing pregnancy, the 'pill' composed of a purified progestin alone also caused bleeding in the uterus, which resulted from irregular shedding of the endometrium. Fortuitously, it was discovered that norethynodrel, one of progestin compounds of interest at that time, did not cause uterine breakthrough bleeding and was later found to be contaminated with mestranol, a synthetic estrogen. This observation paved the way for adding an estrogen to maintain endometrial stability and thus reduce the risk of uterine breakthrough bleeding. Moreover, it was later recognized that estrogen contributed to the contraceptive effects of the pill.

Early formulations of high-dose contraceptive estrogens caused multiple undesirable side effects, including venous thromboembolism, prompting a dose reduction in estrogens. Estrogen doses were reduced from mestranol 150 μg in an original formulation to estrogen < 50 μg by the early 1980s. Most modern oral contraceptives now typically contain 20–35 μg EE. Progestins have also changed over the years to newer formulations to minimize androgenic side effects. The original formulation of norethynodrel 10 mg was reduced in subsequent generations of progestins, such as levonorgestrel (LNG) 100–250 μg and desogestrel 150 μg. Following the FDA approval in 1960 of the first combination pill (norethynodrel 5 mg and mestranol 75 μg), a progestin-only pill was also introduced in 1973 to avoid the adverse effects of estrogen. A progestin-only pill typically contains lower progestin doses ('minipill') than progestin–estrogen combination products.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the care of girls and women with Turner syndrome [^111FULv1]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Turner syndrome, more specifically with respect to female sex hormones (progesterone), ESE/PES 2024 guidelines recommend to add cyclic progesterone once breakthrough bleeding occurs (mostly after about 18–24 months of unopposed estrogen exposure, although it can occur later based on pubertal stage, serum estradiol and uterine growth, endometrial thickness, and estrogen dose). Prefer micronized progesterone 200 mg for 10–12 days per month.

### Estradiol transdermal system continuous delivery (once-… [^114mb9dh]. FDA (DailyMed) (2010). Low credibility.

In a 3 week multiple application study in 24 postmenopausal women, the 31 cm2 Estradiol Transdermal System Continuous Delivery produced average peak estradiol concentrations of approximately 100 pg/mL. Trough values at the end of each wear interval were approximately 35 pg/mL. Nearly identical serum curves were seen each week, indicating little or no accumulation of estradiol in the body. Serum estrone peak and trough levels were 60 pg/mL and 40 pg/mL, respectively. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4. Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism. Inducers of CYP3A4 such as St. John's Wort preparations, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and rifampin may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens, possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects and/or changes in the uterine bleeding profile. The 0.

1 mg estradiol group had a decline in the mean weekly hot flush rate from 52 ±
4. 4 at baseline to 16 ± 2.
4. In the placebo group, the mean weekly hot flush rate declined from 53 ±
4. 5 at baseline to 46 ± 6.
5. In the CE/MPA substudy of WHI, a 2-fold greater rate of VTE, including deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, was observed in women receiving CE/MPA compared to women receiving placebo. The rate of VTE was 34 per 10, 000 women-years in the CE/MPA group compared to 16 per 10, 000 women-years in the placebo group. The increase in VTE risk was observed during the first year and persisted. In the WHI trial and from observational studies, the excess risk increased with duration of use. From observational studies, the risk appeared to return to baseline in about 5 years after stopping treatment.

In addition, observational studies suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater, and became apparent earlier, with estrogen/progestin combination therapy as compared to estrogen alone therapy.

### Reducing vaginal bleeding during hormone therapy… [^112MRL24]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Long-term compliance with postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy is poor despite its many health benefits. Recurrent vaginal bleeding is the major cause for discontinuation of HRT. Although studies have established strategies to minimize vaginal bleeding during HRT using conjugated equine estrogens and medroxyprogesterone acetate, little is known about bleeding profiles associated with other forms of estrogen and progesterone. Archer and colleagues studied bleeding associated with estradiol and norethindrone acetate in various dosages. They studied female volunteers more than 45 years of age who had an intact uterus and gave a history of at least one year since last menstruation. Exclusions included recent use of reproductive hormones, endometrial hyperplasia, hormone-dependent cancer, abnormal vaginal bleeding, hypertension, obesity or any contraindication to hormone use. The four groups were comparable at the beginning of the study.

More than 70 percent of women in each group completed the study. The rate of discontinuation in the unopposed estradiol group was significantly higher than the rate in women taking combination therapy. The lowest rates of discontinuation occurred in women taking 0. 25 and
0. 1 mg of NETA, respectively. Discontinuation attributed to bleeding was reported by 10. 5 percent of women taking unopposed estradiol,
5. 4 percent of those taking 0. 1 mg NETA,
4. 5 percent in the group taking 0. 25 mg NETA and

1. 7 percent of women taking 0. 5 mg NETA. After one year, no bleeding or spotting was reported by 75, 79, 84 and 90 percent of women receiving the unopposed estradiol, NETA-0. 1 mg, NETA-0. 25 mg and NETA-0. 5 mg, respectively. The percentage of months without bleeding or spotting increased over time in all groups taking combination therapy but decreased in women taking unopposed estradiol.

The authors conclude that continuous combined HRT using 1 mg estradiol and NETA is associated with low rates of vaginal bleeding and high rates of compliance. Over time, the lowest rates of vaginal bleeding were associated with the higher dosages of NETA.

### Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding during estrogen therapy… [^116daKe7]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Marshall BR. Postmenopausal Vaginal Bleeding During Estrogen Therapy. JAMA. 1974; 227: 76–77. doi: 10.1001/jama.1974.03230140046016 To the Editor — The discussion of the management of postmenopausal bleeding during estrogen therapy emphasized the exclusion of endometrial cancer, in these circumstances, by dilatation and curettage. Uterine bleeding is the most common complication of postmenopausal estrogen therapy, occurring in as many as 30% of patients so treated. 1 It is also the most significant. Approximately 5% to 8% of the women with bleeding will be found to have endometrial carcinoma. 1, 2The traditional manner of endometrial evaluation has been by D & C; however, the histopathologic findings in properly performed endometrial biopsy correlate with those from D & C in more than 90% of cases. 3 Endometrial biopsy can be done immediately, as an office procedure, thus avoiding hospitalization, anesthesia, and delay in diagnosis.

After 5 mL of lidocaine hydrochloride is injected into each uterosacral area, a very thorough and practically painless biopsy can Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Managing adverse effects of hormonal contraceptives… [^1153uPdc]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Breakthrough Bleeding Breakthrough bleeding is common in the first months of combined oral contraceptive use. 1 and patients should be reassured during this time. Variations in the estrogen dose above 20 mcg do not alter bleeding rates, 9 nor does changing the type of progestin. 35 Bleeding patterns are similar among monophasic and biphasic regimens, 33 but the evidence is insufficient to determine whether monophasic and triphasic regimens result in different bleeding patterns. 36 A randomized controlled trial comparing continuous use with a standard 28-day cycle found that spotting increased initially with continuous use, but was less than with the standard regimen by nine months. 11 Increasing the estrogen dosage from 20 to 30 mcg per day does not reduce breakthrough bleeding in extended-cycle regimens. 12 Women on regimens containing norethindrone had significantly more days of amenorrhea than those on levonorgestrel-containing regimens.

12 If breakthrough bleeding occurs with extended-cycle regimens, the pills should be stopped for three or four days, then restarted.
27. A prospective randomized trial found that women who have breakthrough bleeding for at least five days with continuous Nuvaring use could reduce bleeding by removing the ring at the start of bleeding, storing it for four days, then replacing the same ring.
37. 8 A Cochrane review found that no interventions to regulate menstrual bleeding in women using Depo-Provera were useful in the long term. 38 In women using progestin-only injectable contraceptives, short-term treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be helpful for spotting. 39 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or ethinyl estradiol can also be used for heavy or prolonged bleeding until another contraceptive method is chosen. 39, 40. 7 Before insertion, physicians should inform patients that only about 11 percent of women have a normal bleeding pattern.

2 A combination of mifepristone and ethinyl estradiol reduces the duration of a single bleeding episode in women who use Implanon, but does not alter the overall bleeding pattern. 31, 32 One study showed that doxycycline shortens a single episode of bleeding in women who use Implanon, 32 but a subsequent larger study did not confirm this finding. 31 If abnormal bleeding persists beyond three months, an alternative contraceptive method may be considered, and the patient may need to be evaluated for other causes. 40.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding associated with hormonal contraception… [^1156jS3o]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Combination Oral Contraceptive Pills FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE ABNORMAL UTERINE BLEEDING In the past 20 years, the estrogen dose in OCPs has decreased from more than 150 mcg of ethinyl estradiol to 35 mcg or less. The most common low-dose OCPs now contain no more than 35 mcg of ethinyl estradiol. Although several OCPs contain 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol, these pills are not used routinely because they are associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic disease. Because the lower doses of estrogen in OCPs are insufficient to sustain endometrial integrity, abnormal uterine bleeding has become more common. 11 The most frequent cause of breakthrough bleeding with OCPs is progestin-induced decidualization and endometrial atrophy, which result in menstrual breakdown and irregular bleeding. As the dose and potency of both estrogen and progestin increase, the incidence of breakthrough bleeding decreases.

11, 12 How the different pill formulations containing low doses of estrogen differ in their propensity to cause abnormal uterine bleeding remains unclear. 18, 21 Adding extra estrogen while maintaining the same dose of progestin increases endometrial thickness, thereby stabilizing the endometrium and blood vessels. Changing to a 50-mcg OCP increases the dose of both estrogen and progestin. Side effects, including nausea and breast tenderness, may increase. Adding a second OCP on a daily basis is not a good option, because this doubles the estrogen and progestin doses, further increasing side effects. When OCPs are doubled, the progestin component tends to dominate; therefore, endometrial atrophy and subsequent irregular bleeding increase. 23 compared levonorgestrel, ethinyl estradiol, and ibuprofen with placebo for the treatment of prolonged bleeding in women who were using contraceptive implants. Women in all three treatment groups had fewer bleeding days than those in the placebo group. Ethinyl estradiol was the most effective treatment, followed by ibuprofen and then levonorgestrel.
