## Question

Bacterial pharyngitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about bacterial pharyngitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and etiologies to anchor pretest probability. Then, I should verify the clinical decision rules and when to test. Next, I will review diagnostic strategies, including RADT, culture, and NAATs, and reconcile guideline differences. After that, I need to examine treatment choices, durations, and stewardship trade-offs. Finally, I should consider special populations, complications, and follow-up, and close with a concise, practical algorithm that aligns with high-quality guidance and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiology and etiologies so I don't jump to conclusions about antibiotics. Most pharyngitis is viral, with GAS responsible for roughly 20–30% in children and 5–15% in adults, and other bacteria like Fusobacterium necrophorum and Arcanobacterium haemolyticum are less common but clinically important in select populations, so I need to keep pretest probability low and avoid overtesting or overtreating viral cases [^112EViFE] [^116FzKUh] [^116wnFvR].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical decision rules and their performance. The Centor/McIsaac criteria remain the most validated tools: fever, tonsillar exudates, tender anterior cervical nodes, absence of cough, and age 3–14 years increase the likelihood of GAS; in adults, a score of 2–3 prompts testing, and 4 supports empiric therapy in some guidelines, but I should double-check that this risks overtreatment and resistance, so testing-first strategies are generally preferred in primary care [^115dgucv] [^117P3DY1] [^111RUTM1].

> Hold on, I should verify diagnostic pathways next. IDSA recommends selective testing with RADT and backup culture in children and adolescents when RADT is negative, whereas ESCMID advises against routine culture backup in low-risk settings; rapid NAATs are emerging with high sensitivity and may obviate culture in some contexts, but I need to ensure local validation and stewardship alignment before substituting them routinely [^117FtXKa] [^114hZBTx] [^115xKwGu].

> I will now examine treatment indications and first-line choices. Penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days remains first-line given narrow spectrum, low cost, and no resistance; amoxicillin is often preferred in children for palatability, and in nonanaphylactic penicillin allergy, a first-generation cephalosporin is reasonable, while macrolides are reserved for severe beta-lactam allergy due to rising resistance; I should confirm that macrolide resistance can exceed 20% in some U.S. regions, reinforcing caution [^115H7z7h] [^116JcF45] [^117AKQRB] [^113noMib].

> But wait, what if we shorten therapy to improve adherence? Cochrane suggests 3–6 day courses of certain agents can be noninferior for symptom resolution, yet bacteriologic recurrence may be higher with short macrolide regimens; a 5-day penicillin V regimen dosed four times daily showed noninferior clinical cure and better adherence in a randomized trial, though bacterial eradication was lower, so I should individualize duration by severity, adherence risk, and local epidemiology rather than default to short courses [^117UxVVm] [^112WDa4A] [^113LPs5M].

> Let me consider symptomatic care and whether steroids help. NSAIDs and acetaminophen are first-line for pain and fever, and corticosteroids can modestly reduce pain at 24–48 hours, but IDSA recommends against routine steroid use in GAS pharyngitis, whereas ESCMID allows consideration in adults with severe presentations; given small absolute benefit and potential harms, I should reserve steroids for severe cases and avoid routine use [^113Le879] [^111ncXxk] [^111ncXxk] [^117TxTbJ].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and complications. In children 3–15 years, GAS is more common and complications like rheumatic fever, though rare in high-income settings, remain a key rationale for treatment; in adolescents and young adults, Fusobacterium necrophorum is a concern for Lemierre syndrome, so persistent or worsening symptoms after 4–5 days warrant reassessment; in pregnancy, penicillin remains safe and preferred, and in recurrent disease, I should confirm true GAS with testing and consider carriage or alternative diagnoses before escalating therapy [^116FzKUh] [^112AxEqy] [^115H7z7h].

> Next, I should review follow-up and stewardship metrics. Routine post-treatment cultures are not recommended, and asymptomatic household contacts should not be treated; I should double-check that unnecessary testing and prescribing remain common, with studies showing 28% of pediatric prescriptions are not guideline-concordant, so embedding decision rules and test-backup strategies can meaningfully reduce overtreatment without increasing complications [^112AUeiw] [^117K3WPh] [^116kid8P] [^113bY21x].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and sanity-check it against guidelines. Start with a brief symptom inventory to estimate pretest probability; if viral features predominate, avoid testing and treat supportively; if GAS is plausible, apply Centor/McIsaac and test with RADT, backing up negatives with culture in children and adolescents per IDSA; treat confirmed GAS with penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days, consider a 5-day high-frequency penicillin V regimen in select patients, and reserve macrolides for severe beta-lactam allergy; provide analgesics and consider a single dose of steroid only for severe pain after shared decision-making; arrange follow-up only if symptoms persist beyond 5 days or worsen [^115dgucv] [^117FtXKa] [^115H7z7h] [^112WDa4A] [^111VdEoF] [^113noMib].

Bacterial pharyngitis is most often due to **group A Streptococcus (GAS)** [^112EViFE], with other bacteria (e.g. Fusobacterium necrophorum, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum) less common [^116wnFvR]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical features plus testing** [^117EcNvV]: use Centor/McIsaac to guide testing, confirm with RADT, and back up negative RADTs with culture in children/adolescents [^117FtXKa] [^115xKwGu]. Treat confirmed GAS with **penicillin or amoxicillin for 10 days** [^115H7z7h]; use first-generation cephalosporins or clindamycin/macrolides if allergic, noting macrolide resistance risk [^115d74AE] [^117AKQRB]. Antibiotics shorten symptoms by ~1 day and reduce transmission and complications [^116Yai4s]; avoid treating viral pharyngitis or asymptomatic carriers [^112saWDY] [^114WGiQz]. Supportive care with NSAIDs/acetaminophen is essential, and corticosteroids are not routinely recommended [^113Le879] [^111VdEoF].

---

## Etiology and epidemiology

- **Group A Streptococcus (GAS)**: the most common bacterial cause; 20–30% of pediatric and 5–15% of adult pharyngitis [^112EViFE] [^116FzKUh].
- **Other bacteria**: Fusobacterium necrophorum (adolescents/young adults, risk of Lemierre syndrome) [^112AxEqy], Arcanobacterium haemolyticum (teenagers, scarlatiniform rash) [^116wnFvR], and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (sexually active patients) [^113RJYRi].
- **Seasonality**: peaks in late winter/early spring, especially in school-aged children [^1144dknB].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical features include **sudden sore throat, dysphagia, fever, anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and tonsillar exudates** [^112ACtFT]; cough, rhinorrhea, and conjunctivitis favor a viral etiology [^114WGiQz]. Scarlet fever may present with a sandpaper rash and strawberry tongue [^116Yai4s].

---

## Diagnostic approach

### Clinical scoring systems

Use **Centor or McIsaac scores** to stratify risk and guide testing/treatment [^115dgucv] [^117P3DY1]. Centor criteria include fever, tonsillar exudates, tender anterior cervical nodes, and absence of cough; age 3–14 years adds weight in McIsaac [^112hzNXH].

---

### Laboratory testing

- **Rapid antigen detection test (RADT)**: high specificity; sensitivity ~85–90% in children, lower in adults [^notfound].
- **Throat culture**: gold standard; recommended to confirm negative RADTs in children/adolescents [^117FtXKa] [^1136bEAL].
- **NAATs**: emerging POC tests with high sensitivity/specificity; may reduce need for backup culture [^115xKwGu].

---

## Indications for antibiotic therapy

Treat only **confirmed GAS** or when suspicion is high (e.g. 4 Centor/McIsaac) [^115dgucv] [^117P3DY1]. Do not treat viral pharyngitis or asymptomatic carriers [^112saWDY] [^117K3WPh].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

| **Antibiotic** | **Dose and duration** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Penicillin V | 250 mg PO BID-TID × 10 days (children); 250 mg QID or 500 mg BID × 10 days (adults) | First-line |
| Amoxicillin | 50 mg/kg/day divided BID × 10 days (children); 500 mg PO BID-TID × 10 days (adults) | First-line; better taste |
| Benzathine penicillin G | 1.2 million units IM once (adults); 600,000 units IM once (children < 27 kg) | Nonadherent patients |
| First-generation cephalosporin (e.g. cephalexin) | 20–50 mg/kg/day divided BID × 10 days | Penicillin allergy (non-anaphylaxis) |
| Clindamycin | 20–30 mg/kg/day divided TID × 10 days | Severe penicillin allergy |
| Macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin) | 5–10 days | Penicillin allergy; use cautiously due to resistance |

## Role of antibiotics in symptom relief and complication prevention

Antibiotics shorten illness by ~1 day and reduce transmission within 24 hours [^116Yai4s]; they also lower risks of suppurative complications (e.g. peritonsillar abscess) and nonsuppurative complications (e.g. acute rheumatic fever) [^112ACtFT].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

Supportive care with **NSAIDs or acetaminophen** is recommended for pain and fever [^113Le879] [^1144BvYF]. Corticosteroids are not routinely recommended due to limited benefit and potential harms [^111VdEoF] [^113noMib].

---

## Complications of untreated bacterial pharyngitis

- **Suppurative**: peritonsillar abscess, otitis media, sinusitis, cervical lymphadenitis, mastoiditis [^116FzKUh].
- **Nonsuppurative**: acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis [^116FzKUh].
- **Lemierre syndrome**: rare but severe; associated with Fusobacterium [^112AxEqy].

---

## Follow-up and special considerations

Routine post-treatment cultures are not needed unless symptoms persist or recur [^112AUeiw]. Recurrent GAS may reflect carriage or alternative diagnoses (e.g. EBV, CMV); avoid repeated antibiotics unless GAS is confirmed [^117K3WPh]. Tonsillectomy is reserved for severe, recurrent infections meeting specific criteria [^1112P85x].

---

## Antibiotic stewardship

Overprescription is common; **use clinical scores and testing** to limit unnecessary antibiotics [^113bY21x]. Emphasize viral features, avoid treating carriers, and educate on self-limited course to reduce misuse [^112saWDY] [^117K3WPh].

---

Bacterial pharyngitis is predominantly GAS; **confirm with RADT plus culture when indicated**, treat confirmed cases with penicillin or amoxicillin, and avoid antibiotics for viral illness or carriers. This approach balances symptom relief, complication prevention, and stewardship.

### Pharyngitis management: defining the controversy [^1149pYrX]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Despite numerous controlled trials, clinical practice guidelines and cost-effective analyses, controversy persists regarding the appropriate management strategy for adult pharyngitis. In this perspective, we explore this controversy by comparing two competing clinical guidelines. Although the guidelines appear to make widely diverging recommendations, we show that the controversy centers on only a small proportion of patients: those presenting with severe pharyngitis. We examine recently published data to illustrate that this seemingly simple problem of strep throat remains a philosophical issue: should we give primacy to relieving acute time-limited symptoms, or should we emphasize the potential societal risk of antibiotic resistance? We accept potentially over treating a minority of adult pharyngitis patients with the most severe presentations to reduce suffering in an approximately equal number of patients who will have false negative test results if the test-and-treat strategy were used.

### When is It not "Just a sore throat? "… [^112AxEqy]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Fusobacterium necrophorum, a newly recognized bacterial cause of pharyngitis, can result in a potentially devastating suppurative complication called Lemierre syndrome, which usually begins with a sore throat that improves over the first four to five days. 5 The patient then has a recurrence of symptoms, with the addition of bacteremic symptoms including rigors, fever, and night sweats. Fusobacterium pharyngitis occurs predominantly in the same age group. 6 A Lemierre syndrome variant can also occur before adolescence; however, it rarely starts with a sore throat. No laboratory method for diagnosing Fusobacterium pharyngitis is readily available. F. necrophorum is a gram-negative anaerobic bacterium that is difficult to grow on routine media from throat swabs. Blood cultures grow the organism, but identification is slow. Many Lemierre syndrome diagnoses occur after the blood cultures become positive and after complications have occurred.

Fusobacterium pharyngitis cannot be routinely diagnosed, so we cannot recommend antibiotic treatment for preventing Lemierre syndrome. We believe that following the American College of Physicians/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians would decrease the risk of Lemierre syndrome in adolescents and young adults. 6 Using these guidelines, physicians can choose to prescribe antibiotics for patients with a pharyngitis score of 3 or 4. 1 Penicillin remains the drug of choice because most Fusobacterium infections have in vitro sensitivity to penicillins but not to macrolides. Early diagnosis of Lemierre syndrome improves outcomes. 7 The organism is susceptible to many antibiotic combinations. Most physicians recommend clindamycin or a combination of penicillin and metronidazole.

How should this information change your practice. Physicians do not need to change their approach to acute pharyngitis for patients who present within two days of symptom onset, nor should they prescribe antibiotics when they are not indicated. However, we urge all physicians to reconsider their approach to patients who have persistent or worsening symptoms, and to recognize when the diagnosis and treatment do not fit the expected natural course of "just a sore throat, " a self-limited disease lasting less than five days.

### Acute pharyngitis [^117St1Y4]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Excellent credibility.

The primary care physician needs to identify those patients with acute pharyngitis who require specific antimicrobial therapy and to avoid unnecessary and potentially deleterious treatment in the large majority of patients who have a benign, self-limited infection that is usually viral. In most cases, differentiating between these two types of infection can be accomplished easily if the physician considers the epidemiologic setting, the history, and the physical findings, plus the results of a few readily available laboratory tests. When antimicrobial therapy is required, the safest, narrowest-spectrum, and most cost-effective drugs should be used. Despite agreement on these principles by expert advisory committees, data from national surveys of ambulatory care indicate that antimicrobial agents continue to be prescribed indiscriminately for upper respiratory infections.

### Review: known, emerging, and remerging pharyngitis pathogens [^112Jhug4]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

DIAGNOSTIC GAPS: POINTS TO PONDER

Pharyngitis may be caused by known pathogens such as GAS, but also by emerging and reemerging pathogens because of ever evolving geopolitical and social paradigms. To effectively diagnose and treat pharyngitis and promote antibiotic stewardship, it is imperative that new diagnostic methods keep pace. Cutting-edge technologies such as nucleic acid amplification can simultaneously detect and quantify multiple pathogens, and assist in the appropriate diagnosis, management, and outcomes of individuals with pharyngitis. However, individuals may simultaneously be colonized with bacterial and viral pathogens, which can confound the interpretation of test results and lead to unnecessary antibiotic administration or inappropriate patient management. These new detection methods must be able to distinguish between these 2 conditions while remaining cost effective. The second article of this supplement will elaborate on the current state of laboratory and point-of-care diagnostic testing for pharyngitis and address these and other knowledge gaps.

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute pharyngitis in adults: background [^112hzNXH]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute pharyngitis apply to immunocompetent adults without complicated comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease, and history of rheumatic fever. They do not apply during known outbreaks of group A streptococcus. 1. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) is the causal agent in approximately 10% of adult cases of pharyngitis. The large majority of adults with acute pharyngitis have a self-limited illness, for which supportive care only is needed. 2. Antibiotic treatment of adult pharyngitis benefits only those patients with GABHS infection. All patients with pharyngitis should be offered appropriate doses of analgesics and antipyretics, as well as other supportive care. 3. Limit antibiotic prescriptions to patients who are most likely to have GABHS infection. Clinically screen all adult patients with pharyngitis for the presence of the four Centor criteria: history of fever, tonsillar exudates, no cough, and tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy (lymphadenitis). Do not test or treat patients with none or only one of these criteria, since these patients are unlikely to have GABHS infection. For patients with two or more criteria the following strategies are appropriate: (a) Test patients with two, three, or four criteria by using a rapid antigen test, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with positive test results; (b) test patients with two or three criteria by using a rapid antigen test, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with positive test results or patients with four criteria; or (c) do not use any diagnostic tests, and limit antibiotic therapy to patients with three or four criteria. 4. Throat cultures are not recommended for the routine primary evaluation of adults with pharyngitis or for confirmation of negative results on rapid antigen tests when the test sensitivity exceeds 80%. Throat cultures may be indicated as part of investigations of outbreaks of GABHS disease, for monitoring the development and spread of antibiotic resistance, or when such pathogens as gonococcus are being considered. 5. The preferred antibiotic for treatment of acute GABHS pharyngitis is penicillin, or erythromycin in a penicillin-allergic patient.

Regarding medical management for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend to initiate an appropriate antibiotic (penicillin or amoxicillin as the drug of choice if not allergic to these agents) at an appropriate dose for a duration likely to eradicate the organism from the pharynx (usually 10 days).

### Analysis of different recommendations from international guidelines for the management of acute pharyngitis in adults and children [^111oj5uS]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Streptococcal pharyngitis is a frequently observed condition, but its optimal management continues to be debated.

Objective

The goal of this study was to evaluate the available guidelines, developed at the national level, for the management of streptococcal pharyngitis in Western countries, with a focus on their differences.

Methods

A literature search was conducted of the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, TRIP, and MEDLINE databases from their inception (1993 for the Cochrane Library, 1980 for EMBASE, 1997 for TRIP, and 1966 for MEDLINE) through April 25, 2010. The following search terms were used: pharyngitis, sore throat, tonsillitis, pharyngotonsillitis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Group A β-haemolytic Streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcal pharyngitis. Searches were limited to type of article or document (practice guideline or guideline) with no language restrictions or language limits.

Results

Twelve national guidelines were identified: 6 from European countries (France, United Kingdom, Finland, Holland, Scotland, and Belgium), 5 from the United States, and 1 from Canada. Recommendations differ substantially with regard to the use of a rapid antigen diagnostic test or throat culture and the indications for antibiotic treatment. The North American, Finnish, and French guidelines recommend performing one timely microbiologic investigation in suspected cases, and prescribing antibiotics in confirmed cases to prevent suppurative complications and acute rheumatic fever. According to the remaining European guidelines, however, acute sore throat is considered a benign, self-limiting disease. Microbiologic tests are not routinely recommended by these latter guidelines, and antibiotic treatment is reserved for well-selected cases. The use of the Centor score, for evaluation of the risk of streptococcal infection, is recommended by several guidelines, but subsequent decisions on the basis of the results differ in terms of which subjects should undergo microbiologic investigation. All guidelines agree that narrow-spectrum penicillin is the first choice of antibiotic for the treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis and that treatment should last for 10 days to eradicate the microorganism. Once-daily amoxicillin was recommended by 2 US guidelines as equally effective.

Conclusion

The present review found substantial discrepancies in the recommendations for the management of pharyngitis among national guidelines in Europe and North America.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^114AaBsW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although their effectiveness increases in people with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated. This is an update of a review first published in 2010, and updated in 2013, 2016, and 2020.

Objectives

To assess the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing clinical relapse (i.e. recurrence of symptoms after initial resolution); and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 3 September 2020: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946), Embase Elsevier (from 1974), and Web of Science Thomson Reuters (from 2010). We also searched clinical trial registers on 3 September 2020.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics, and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications and/or adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and used the GRADE approach to assess the overall certainty of the evidence for the outcomes. We have reported the intention-to-treat analysis, and also performed an analysis of evaluable participants to explore the robustness of the intention-to-treat results.

Main Results

We included 19 trials reported in 18 publications (5839 randomised participants): six trials compared penicillin with cephalosporins; six compared penicillin with macrolides; three compared penicillin with carbacephem; one compared penicillin with sulphonamides; one compared clindamycin with ampicillin; and one compared azithromycin with amoxicillin in children. All participants had confirmed acute GABHS tonsillopharyngitis, and ages ranged from one month to 80 years. Nine trials included only, or predominantly, children. Most trials were conducted in an outpatient setting. Reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was poor in all trials. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence mainly due to lack of (or poor reporting of) randomisation or blinding, or both; heterogeneity; and wide confidence intervals. Cephalosporins versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference in symptom resolution (at 2 to 15 days) for cephalosporins versus penicillin (odds ratio (OR) for absence of symptom resolution 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.12; 5 trials; 2018 participants; low-certainty evidence). Results of the sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants differed (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; 5 trials; 1660 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be lower for cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 50; 4 trials; 1386 participants; low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence showed no difference in reported adverse events. Macrolides versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference between macrolides and penicillin for resolution of symptoms (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.35; 6 trials; 1728 participants; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants resulted in an OR of 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.09; 6 trials; 1159 participants). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be different (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.03; 6 trials; 802 participants; low-certainty evidence). Azithromycin versus amoxicillin Based on one unpublished trial in children, we are uncertain if resolution of symptoms is better with azithromycin in a single dose versus amoxicillin for 10 days (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; 1 trial; 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis for per-protocol analysis resulted in an OR of 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; 1 trial; 482 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are also uncertain if there was a difference in relapse between groups (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.82; 1 trial; 422 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events were more common with azithromycin compared to amoxicillin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.99; 1 trial; 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Carbacephem versus penicillin There is low-certainty evidence that compared with penicillin, carbacephem may provide better symptom resolution post-treatment in adults and children (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14.3; 3 trials; 795 participants). Studies did not report on long-term complications, so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better in preventing serious but rare complications. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are uncertain if there are clinically relevant differences in symptom resolution when comparing cephalosporins and macrolides with penicillin in the treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Low-certainty evidence in children suggests that carbacephem may be more effective than penicillin for symptom resolution. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the other comparisons in this review. Data on complications were too scarce to draw conclusions. These results do not demonstrate that other antibiotics are more effective than penicillin in the treatment of GABHS pharyngitis. All studies were conducted in high-income countries with a low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is a need for trials in low-income countries and Aboriginal communities, where the risk of complications remains high.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: group A streptococcal pharyngitis, diagnosis and treatment in children [^1149Qq4Q]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2024). Medium credibility.

Group A streptococcus (GAS) is the most common bacterial cause of pharyngitis in children. GAS causes significant suppurative and non-suppurative complications including invasive GAS disease and acute rheumatic fever. This article describes the current epidemiology and clinical presentation of GAS pharyngitis and explores how diagnostic and treatment decisions differ globally. Several key decision support tools are discussed including international guidelines, clinical decision scores and laboratory tests along with the evidence for treatment choice and duration. With recent international reports describing an increase in GAS infections, clinicians should be familiar with their local GAS pharyngitis guidelines and the rationale for diagnosis and treatment of this common childhood illness.

All included trials reported clinical outcomes. Reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was poor in all trials. The overall quality of the evidence assessed using the GRADE tool was low for the outcome 'resolution of symptoms' in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and very low for the outcomes 'resolution of symptoms' of evaluable participants and for adverse events. We downgraded the quality of evidence mainly due to lack of (or poor reporting of) randomisation or blinding, or both, heterogeneity, and wide confidence intervals (CIs). There was a difference in symptom resolution in favour of cephalosporins compared with penicillin (evaluable patients analysis odds ratio (OR) for absence of resolution of symptoms 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 20, N = 5, n = 1660; very low quality evidence). However, this was not statistically significant in the ITT analysis (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.12; N = 5, n = 2018; low quality evidence). Clinical relapse was lower for cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; NNTB 50, N = 4, n = 1386; low quality evidence), but this was found only in adults (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.88; NNTB 33, N = 2, n = 770). There were no differences between macrolides and penicillin for any of the outcomes. One unpublished trial in children found a better cure rate for azithromycin in a single dose compared to amoxicillin for 10 days (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; NNTB 18, N = 1, n = 482), but there was no difference between the groups in ITT analysis (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; N = 1, n = 673) or at long-term follow-up (evaluable patients analysis OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.82; N = 1, n = 422). Children experienced more adverse events with azithromycin compared to amoxicillin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.99; N = 1, n = 673). Compared with penicillin carbacephem showed better symptom resolution post-treatment in adults and children combined (ITT analysis OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14, N = 3, n = 795), and in the subgroup analysis of children (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.99; NNTB 8, N = 1, n = 233), but not in the subgroup analysis of adults (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.22, N = 2, n = 562). Children experienced more adverse events with macrolides compared with penicillin (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.15; N = 1, n = 489). Studies did not report on long-term complications so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better in preventing serious but rare complications.

Authors' Conclusions

There were no clinically relevant differences in symptom resolution when comparing cephalosporins and macrolides with penicillin in the treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Limited evidence in adults suggests cephalosporins are more effective than penicillin for relapse, but the NNTB is high. Limited evidence in children suggests carbacephem is more effective than penicillin for symptom resolution. Data on complications are too scarce to draw conclusions. Based on these results and considering the low cost and absence of resistance, penicillin can still be regarded as a first choice treatment for both adults and children. All studies were in high-income countries with low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is need for trials in low-income countries and Aboriginal communities where risk of complications remains high.

### Guidelines for the use of antibiotics in acute upper respiratory tract infections [^117W6Ztp]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

To help physicians with the appropriate use of antibiotics in children and adults with upper respiratory tract infection, a multidisciplinary team evaluated existing guidelines and summarized key practice points. Acute otitis media in children should be diagnosed only if there is abrupt onset, signs of middle ear effusion, and symptoms of inflammation. A period of observation without immediate use of antibiotics is an option for certain children. In patients with sinus infection, acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be diagnosed and treated with antibiotics only if symptoms have not improved after 10 days or have worsened after five to seven days. In patients with sore throat, a diagnosis of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis generally requires confirmation with rapid antigen testing, although other guidelines allow for empiric therapy if a validated clinical rule suggests a high likelihood of infection. Acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy adults should not be treated with antibiotics; delayed prescriptions may help ease patient fears and simultaneously reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics.

### Sore throat: is it such a big deal anymore? [^117UqnmX]. The Journal of Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Sore throat remains a common disease of childhood, and a major cost and cause for antibiotic prescriptions. The management of sore throat remains controversial in affluent countries with various guidelines available and overall poor adherence to those guidelines. Group A streptococcus is the commonest bacterial cause with important sequelae including acute rheumatic fever (ARF). The driver for diagnosis and treatment is still questionable. In most affluent populations it is difficult to justify antibiotic treatment on the basis of preventing ARF, whereas this remains the major driver for sore throat management in populations at higher risk of ARF. Reduction in severity and duration of symptoms may be a reasonable basis to consider antibiotic treatment, and thus accurate diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis, particularly in those with more severe symptoms. The potential role of rapid tests in diagnosis appears to be increasing.

### Diagnosis and treatment of pharyngitis in children [^116NBCTp]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Acute pharyngitis is one of the most common illnesses for which children visit primary care physicians. Most cases of acute pharyngitis in children are caused by viruses and are benign and self-limited. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus is the most important of the bacterial causes of acute pharyngitis. Strategies for diagnosis and treatment of acute pharyngitis are directed at distinguishing children with viral pharyngitis, who would not benefit from antimicrobial therapy, from children with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis, for whom antimicrobial therapy would be beneficial. Making this distinction is crucial in attempting to minimize the unnecessary use of antimicrobial agents in children.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^111SM6Ga]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Data abstraction and risk of bias assessment

Reviewers extracted the following data, independently and in duplicate: general study information (authors, publication year, and study location); study population details (sample size, age, diagnosis, and percentage of participants with confirmed group A β haemolytic streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis or culture positive for bacterial pathogens); setting (primary care versus hospital emergency department); details on the intervention and comparison (for example, type, form, duration, and dose of corticosteroids; type of control group); co-interventions (proportion of participants who received antibiotics and/or analgesics); and outcomes as listed above.

In randomised controlled trials with more than two arms, we extracted data from the arm closest to a single dose regimen or data from the arm that received corticosteroid as adjunct treatment to standard of care rather than instead of standard of care. In trials with data for both oral and parenteral corticosteroids, we used oral data for the main analysis and intramuscular data for the appropriate subgroup analysis.

Two reviewers independently assessed risk of bias using the modified Cochrane risk of bias instrument, which deals with random sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of study participants, healthcare providers, and outcome assessors; incomplete outcome data; and other potential sources of bias. Reviewers classified studies at high risk of bias when they had rated at least one item as high risk of bias.

To assess the quality of evidence, we used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach that classifies evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low quality based on considerations of risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision, and publication bias. We resolved disagreements between reviewers in data extraction and assessments of risk of bias or quality of evidence by discussion and, if needed, by third party adjudication. We used the MAGICapp platform to generate the GRADE summary of findings table.

Sore throat is one of the most common reasons for visits to family physicians.

Useful, well-validated clinical decision rules are available to help family physicians care for patients who present with pharyngitis. Because of recent improvements in rapid streptococcal antigen tests, throat culture can be reserved for patients whose symptoms do not improve over time or who do not respond to antibiotics.

### Short-course antibiotics for common infections: what do we know and where do we go from here? [^116rgAo8]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Over the past 25 years, researchers have performed > 120 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) illustrating short courses to be non-inferior to long courses of antibiotics for common bacterial infections.

Objective

We sought to determine whether clinical data from RCTs affirm the mantra of 'shorter is better' for antibiotic durations in 7 common infections: pneumonia, urinary tract infection, intra-abdominal infection, bacteraemia, skin and soft tissue infection, bone and joint infections, pharyngitis and sinusitis.

Sources

Published RCTs comparing short- versus long-course antibiotic durations were identified through searches of PubMed and clinical guideline documents.

Content

Short-course antibiotic durations consistently result in similar treatment success rates as longer antibiotic courses among patients with community-acquired pneumonia, complicated urinary tract infections in women, gram-negative bacteraemia, and skin and soft tissue infections when the diagnosis is confirmed, appropriate antimicrobials are used, and patients show clinical signs of improvement. For patients with osteomyelitis, 6 weeks of antibiotics is adequate for the treatment of osteomyelitis in the absence of implanted foreign bodies and surgical debridement. Whether durations can be further shortened with debridement is unclear, although small studies are promising.

Implications

With few exceptions, short courses were non-inferior to long courses; future research should focus on appropriately defining the patient population, ensuring the correct choice and dose of antimicrobials and developing meaningful outcomes relevant for frontline clinicians.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections apply to immunocompetent adults without complicating comorbid conditions, such as chronic lung or heart disease. 1. The diagnosis of nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection or acute rhinopharyngitis should be used to denote an acute infection that is typically viral in origin and in which sinus, pharyngeal, and lower airway symptoms, although frequently present, are not prominent. 2. Antibiotic treatment of adults with nonspecific upper respiratory tract infection does not enhance illness resolution and is not recommended. Studies specifically testing the impact of antibiotic treatment on complications of nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections have not been performed in adults. Life-threatening complications of upper respiratory tract infection are rare. 3. Purulent secretions from the nares or throat (commonly observed in patients with uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection) predict neither bacterial infection nor benefit from antibiotic treatment.

### Management of group A β-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis [^114ty76o]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Bacteria are responsible for approximately 5 to 10 percent of pharyngitis cases, with group A beta-hemolytic streptococci being the most common bacterial etiology. A positive rapid antigen detection test may be considered definitive evidence for treatment; a negative test should be followed by a confirmatory throat culture when streptococcal pharyngitis is strongly suspected. Treatment goals include prevention of suppurative and nonsuppurative complications, abatement of clinical signs and symptoms, reduction of bacterial transmission and minimization of antimicrobial adverse effects. Antibiotic selection requires consideration of patients' allergies, bacteriologic and clinical efficacy, frequency of administration, duration of therapy, potential side effects, compliance and cost. Oral penicillin remains the drug of choice in most clinical situations, although the more expensive cephalosporins and, perhaps, amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium provide superior bacteriologic and clinical cure rates. Alternative treatments must be used in patients with penicillin allergy, compliance issues or penicillin treatment failure. Patients who do not respond to initial treatment should be given an antimicrobial that is not inactivated by penicillinase-producing organisms (e.g., amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium, a cephalosporin or a macrolide). Patient education may help to reduce recurrence.

### Diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of group a streptococcal pharyngitis in children in a primary care setting: impact of point-of-care polymerase chain reaction [^117N2iVj]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Infection with Streptococcus pyogenes (group A beta-hemolytic streptococci; GAS) is the most common bacterial cause of acute pharyngitis and is responsible for an estimated 20–30% of sore throat cases in children. In the United States, the societal cost of GAS pharyngitis is estimated to range from $224 to $539 million per year, with children missing an average of 1.9 days of school/daycare and 42% of parents missing a mean of 1.8 days of work. The timely initiation of antibiotics can effectively treat GAS pharyngitis, prevent the spread of infection to close contacts, reduce the duration of symptoms, and limit rare long-term complications. Acute pharyngitis can be a result of either bacterial or viral pathogens and, as such, current clinical guidelines encourage the use of antibiotics only for confirmed cases of GAS. Despite these recommendations, and the overall rates of documented GAS infections (5–30% of sore throat visits), antibiotics are often prescribed in as many as 60% of patient visits for sore throat. Greater awareness of the development of bacterial resistance resulting from the overprescribing of antibiotics is increasing the urgency to move away from empiric antibiotic treatment for common respiratory infections.

### Pharyngitis… [^116Yai4s]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

BACTERIA Patients with bacterial pharyngitis generally do not have rhinorrhea, cough, or conjunctivitis. The incidence of bacterial pharyngitis is increased in temperate climates during winter and early spring. 16 There is often a history of streptococcal throat infection within the past year. GABHS is the most common bacterial cause of pharyngitis. 16–18. GABHS Infection Symptoms of strep throat may include pharyngeal erythema and swelling, tonsillar exudate, edematous uvula, palatine petechiae, and anterior cervical lymphadenopathy. Untreated, GABHS infection lasts seven to 10 days. 4, 13, 19 Patients with untreated streptococcal pharyngitis are infectious during the acute phase of the illness and for one additional week. 1 Effective antibiotic therapy shortens the infectious period to 24 hours, reduces the duration of symptoms by about one day, and prevents most complications.

Scarlet fever is associated with GABHS pharyngitis and usually presents as a punctate, erythematous, blanchable, sandpaper-like exanthem. The rash is found in the neck, groin, and axillae, and is accentuated in body folds and creases. 1, 4, 19 The pharynx and tonsils are erythematous and covered with exudates. The tongue may be bright red with a white coating.
4. If examination reveals a serosanguineous nasal discharge and a grayish-white pharyngeal membrane in association with pharyngitis, tonsillitis, and cervical lymphadenopathy, the presumptive diagnosis is diphtheria. The incubation period for Corynebacterium diphtheriae infection is two to four weeks. A confirmatory diagnosis is made by microbacteriologic analysis. 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 11, 17, 23–27. Laboratory Evaluation Throat Culture One method for confirming the diagnosis of GABHS pharyngitis is throat culture.

To maximize accuracy, the tonsillar region and posterior pharyngeal wall should be swabbed. The specimen is inoculated onto a 5 percent sheep-blood agar plate, and a bacitracin disk is applied.

### Empirical validation of guidelines for the management of pharyngitis in children and adults [^111RUTM1]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Recent guidelines for management of pharyngitis vary in their recommendations concerning empirical antibiotic treatment and the need for laboratory confirmation of group A streptococcus (GAS).

Objective

To assess the impact of guideline recommendations and alternative approaches on identification and treatment of GAS pharyngitis in children and adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Throat cultures and rapid antigen tests were performed on 787 children and adults aged 3 to 69 years with acute sore throat attending a family medicine clinic in Calgary, Alberta, from September 1999 to August 2002. Recommendations from 2 guidelines (those of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and of the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine/American Academy of Family Physicians/US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) were compared with rapid testing alone, a clinical prediction rule (ie, the modified Centor score), and a criterion standard of treatment for positive throat culture results only.

Main Outcome Measures

Sensitivity and specificity of each strategy for identifying GAS pharyngitis, total antibiotics recommended, and unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions.

Results

In children, sensitivity for streptococcal infection ranged from 85.8% (133/155; 95% confidence interval [CI] 79.3%-90.0%) for rapid testing to 100% for culturing all. In adults, sensitivity ranged from 76.7% (56/73; 95% CI, 65.4%-85.8%) for rapid testing without culture confirmation of negative results to 100% for culturing all. In children, specificity ranged from 90.3% (270/299; 95% CI, 86.4%-93.4%) for use of modified Centor score and throat culture to 100% for culturing all. In adults, specificity ranged from 43.8% (114/260; 95% CI, 37.7%-50.1%) for empirical treatment based on a modified Centor score of 3 or 4 to 100% for culturing all. Total antibiotic prescriptions were lowest with rapid testing (24.7% [194/787]; 95% CI, 21.7%-27.8%) and highest with empirical treatment of high-risk adults (45.7% [360/787]; 95% CI, 42.2%-49.3%), due to a high rate of unnecessary prescriptions in adults (43.8% [146/333]; 95% CI, 38.4%-49.4%).

Conclusions

Guideline recommendations for the selective use of throat cultures but antibiotic treatment based only on positive rapid test or throat culture results can reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics for treatment of pharyngitis. However, empirical treatment of adults having a Centor score of 3 or 4 is associated with a high rate of unnecessary antibiotic use. In children, strategies incorporating throat culture or throat culture confirmation of negative rapid antigen test results are highly sensitive and specific. Throat culture of all adults or those selected on the basis of a clinical prediction rule had the highest sensitivity and specificity.

### Streptococcal pharyngitis: rapid evidence review [^113noMib]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis is a common infection responsible for more than 6 million office visits in the United States annually. Only 10% of adults seeking care for a sore throat have group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis; however, 60% or more are prescribed antibiotics. Guidelines recommend using clinical decision rules to assess the risk of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infection, followed by rapid antigen testing if a diagnosis is unclear, before prescribing antibiotics. Fever, tonsillar exudate, cervical lymphadenitis, and patient ages of 3 to 15 years increase clinical suspicion. A cough is more suggestive of a viral etiology. The limited history used in these decision rules is amenable to virtual visits. After a negative rapid antigen test result, a throat culture is recommended in children and adolescents. Penicillin and amoxicillin are first-line antibiotics, with a recommended course of 10 days; first-generation cephalosporins are recommended for patients with nonanaphylactic allergies to penicillin. There is significant resistance to azithromycin and clarithromycin in some parts of the United States. Steroids are not recommended for symptomatic treatment. Patients with worsening symptoms after appropriate antibiotic initiation or with symptoms lasting 5 days after the start of treatment should be reevaluated. Tonsillectomy is rarely recommended as a preventive measure: seven episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis in 1 year, five episodes in each of the past 2 years, or three episodes in each of the past 3 years are commonly used thresholds for considering surgery.

### Pharyngitis and epiglottitis [^113RJYRi]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Acute pharyngitis is one of the most common illnesses for which patients visit primary care physicians. Most cases are of viral origin, and with few exceptions these illnesses are both benign and self-limited. The most important bacterial cause is the beta-hemolytic group A streptococcus. There are other uncommon or rare types of pharyngitis. For some of these treatment is required or available, and some may be life threatening. Among those discussed in this article are diphtheria, gonorrhea, HIV infection, peritonsillar abscess, and epiglottitis.

### Adherence to guidelines for testing and treatment of children with pharyngitis: a retrospective study [^1156R5ih]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Group A streptococcus (GAS) is the most common bacterial etiology of pharyngitis, accounting for approximately one quarter of cases of pharyngitis that bring children to medical attention. Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and suppurative complications of GAS can be prevented by early antibacterial treatment; indeed, prevention of ARF is one of the primary goals of antibiotic treatment of GAS pharyngitis. However, GAS pharyngitis is difficult to distinguish clinically from viral pharyngitis. Treating children who have viral pharyngitis with antimicrobials is ineffective, generates unnecessary costs, exposes them to antibiotic side effects without benefit, and contributes to the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance. To minimize prescription of antimicrobials for viral pharyngitis, clinical scoring systems have been developed to predict the likelihood of GAS infection. Among these is the McIsaac score, which was developed and validated in both children and adults. Such scores have low positive predictive values, but help identify patients at low risk of GAS, in whom testing is not only unnecessary but may lead to identification of chronic GAS carriers experiencing viral pharyngitis.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline on diagnosis and management of GAS pharyngitis recommends that patients whose clinical presentation is consistent with GAS pharyngitis be tested with a streptococcal rapid antigen detection test (RADT) or throat culture; treatment is indicated if either is positive. Testing is not recommended for patients whose presentation is most consistent with a viral etiology. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has made similar recommendations. Nonetheless, studies evaluating the management of pharyngitis among pediatric providers have identified high rates of antibiotic prescribing, even for patients with negative GAS tests. To our knowledge, no study in a pediatric population has yet evaluated adherence to IDSA guidelines using individual patients' clinical data and test results.

### Antibiotic use in acute upper respiratory tract infections [^1138EQug]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Upper respiratory tract infections account for millions of visits to family physicians each year in the United States. Although warranted in some cases, antibiotics are greatly overused. This article outlines the guidelines and indications for appropriate antibiotic use for common upper respiratory infections. Early antibiotic treatment may be indicated in patients with acute otitis media, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis, epiglottitis, or bronchitis caused by pertussis. Persistent cases of rhinosinusitis may necessitate the use of antibiotics if symptoms persist beyond a period of observation. Antibiotics should not be considered in patients with the common cold or laryngitis. Judicious, evidence-based use of antibiotics will help contain costs and prevent adverse effects and drug resistance.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^113LPs5M]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

According to a Cochrane report from 2012, clinical trials on shorter treatment duration with oral penicillin for streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis are encouraged. Moore and colleagues (DESCARTE study) called for randomised controlled trials to confirm if a shorter course of penicillin might be sufficient when symptomatic cure is the goal. Increasing overall antimicrobial resistance and the lack of new antimicrobial agents emphasise the importance of correctly using existing antibiotics to their full potential. A Cochrane review published in 2016 concluded that penicillin is the preferred first line treatment for pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococcus in adults and children. This review compared penicillin with broader spectrum antibiotics. A meta-analysis from 2008 stated that clinical success and bacteriological eradication are less likely in patients with group A streptococcus pharyngotonsillitis on a short course of treatment (five to seven days) compared with those on a long course of treatment (10 days). The total daily doses in these studies ranged from 750 to 1600 mg, either twice daily or three times daily. However, the inclusion criteria did not always follow current ESCMID guidelines, and the dosing regimens were suboptimal according to current knowledge of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

The efficacy of β lactam antibiotics is dependent on time above the minimum inhibitory concentration of the unbound drug concentration in serum. The most important determinants for time above minimum inhibitory concentration are dose and frequency, and the dosing regimen of 800 mg four times daily provides better target attainment compared with 1000 mg three times daily. The risk with a shorter regimen might be a lower rate of clinical resolution and microbiological eradication. However, reducing the treatment duration could cause fewer side effects, improve patient adherence, cause less impact on the human microbiota, lower the total antibiotic use, and reduce drug costs for patients and the community. The rationale for a non-inferiority trial design was based on the expectation that non-inferiority of the clinical efficacy of a shorter treatment duration compared with the currently recommended treatment would be sufficient from a clinical perspective. The efficacy of 10 day treatment compared with placebo is previously well documentedand in line with international guidelines. The non-inferiority margin for the primary endpoint was agreed upon by the trial steering committee based on European Medicines Agency guidelinesand on the judgment that a difference in the rate of clinical cure up to 10 percentage points is not clinically relevant for non-serious infections.

### Adherence to guidelines for testing and treatment of children with pharyngitis: a retrospective study [^117SJ74v]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Group A streptococcus (GAS) is the most common bacterial etiology of pharyngitis but is difficult to distinguish clinically from viral pharyngitis. There are benefits to early antibacterial treatment of GAS pharyngitis, but administering antibiotics to children with viral pharyngitis is ineffective and costly. We evaluated adherence to guidelines that were developed to help clinicians distinguish between viral and GAS pharyngitis and guide management.

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of patients ages 3–18 who had a rapid streptococcal test and/or throat culture performed in an outpatient setting. We collected data on documentation of components of the McIsaac score and classified tests as indicated if the score was ≥ 2. Based on McIsaac score and GAS test results, we determined whether each antibiotic course prescribed was indicated according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America guideline.

Results

Among 291 eligible children, 87 (30%) had all five components of the McIsaac score documented. There was sufficient data to classify the score as either < 2 or ≥ 2 in 234 (80%); among these, 96% of tests were indicated. Twenty-nine patients (10%) were prescribed antibiotics. Eight (28%) of these prescriptions were not indicated according to guidelines.

Conclusions

The majority of GAS tests in children with pharyngitis are indicated, although providers do not regularly document all elements of a validated pharyngitis scoring tool. Over one quarter of children prescribed antibiotics for pharyngitis did not require antibiotics according to guidelines. There remains a role for targeted antimicrobial stewardship education regarding pharyngitis management in pediatric outpatient settings.

### Adherence to guidelines for testing and treatment of children with pharyngitis: a retrospective study [^116kid8P]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we found that 28% of antibiotic prescriptions for pediatric patients evaluated for pharyngitis were not recommended by guidelines, primarily due to the prescription of antibiotics in spite of negative GAS test results. Given the frequency of pharyngitis in children, further targeted antimicrobial stewardship education for providers should be emphasized to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. Studies assessing why adherence to guidelines for the management of pharyngitis in children appears to be greater than in adults may help elucidate which aspects of antimicrobial stewardship efforts have been most successful.

### Short versus standard duration antibiotic therapy for acute streptococcal pharyngitis in children [^117UxVVm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The standard duration of treatment for acute group A beta hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) pharyngitis with oral penicillin is 10 days. Shorter duration antibiotics may have comparable efficacy.

Objectives

To summarize the evidence regarding the efficacy of two to six days of newer oral antibiotics (short duration) compared to 10 days of oral penicillin (standard duration) in treating children with acute GABHS pharyngitis.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2007, issue 4), which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialized Register; the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE); MEDLINE (1966 to October 2007); OLDMEDLINE (1950 to December 1965); and EMBASE (January 1990 to November 2007).

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing short duration oral antibiotics to standard duration oral penicillin in children aged 1 to 18 years with acute GABHS pharyngitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors scanned the titles and abstracts of retrieved citations and applied the inclusion criteria. We retrieved included studies in full and extracted data. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality.

Main Results

Twenty studies were included with 13,102 cases of acute GABHS pharyngitis. Compared to standard duration treatment, the short duration treatment had shorter periods of fever (mean difference (MD) -0.30 days, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.14) and throat soreness (MD -0.50 days, 95% CI -0.78 to -0.22); lower risk of early clinical treatment failure (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.94); no significant difference in early bacteriological treatment failure (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.20), or late clinical recurrence (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.08). However, the overall risk of late bacteriological recurrence was worse in the short duration treatment (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.48), although no significant differences were found when studies of low dose azithromycin (10mg/kg) were eliminated (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.22). Three studies reported long duration complications with no statistically significant difference (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.64).

Authors' Conclusions

Three to six days of oral antibiotics had comparable efficacy compared to the standard duration 10 day oral penicillin in treating children with acute GABHS pharyngitis. In countries with low rates of rheumatic fever, it appears safe and efficacious to treat children with acute GABHS pharyngitis with short duration antibiotics. In areas where the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease is still high, our results must be interpreted with caution.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^117TxTbJ]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of study

Strengths of this review include explicit eligibility criteria; a comprehensive search developed with a research librarian; duplicate assessment of eligibility, risk of bias, and data abstraction; consideration of all outcomes important to patients; consideration of selective reporting bias; consideration of possible subgroup effects; and rigorous use of the GRADE approach to rate quality of evidence. The limitations of our review have to do with the underlying evidence. Only three trials explicitly reported adverse events, and they did so inconsistently. We observed substantial statistical heterogeneity in some of the outcomes. We explored the source(s) of heterogeneity by subgroup analysis and rated down for inconsistency in GRADE assessments for outcomes with unexplained heterogeneity.

In comparison with previous systematic reviews, we included two additional randomised controlled trials, which almost doubled the number of participants. Results from our meta-analysis are consistent with previous findings that corticosteroids reduce pain at 48 hours and probably reduce other pain outcomes. In addition to enhanced precision with the additional studies, our meta-analysis adds to the existing evidence in that we considered absolute in addition to relative effect measures, providing a clear picture of the magnitude of effect. In part because of input from the guideline panel, we considered additional outcomes that participating patients considered important, including risk of recurrence of symptoms, duration of bad/non-tolerable symptoms, need for antibiotics, and days missed from school or work. An important additional contribution of the new evidence is that it extends the applicability beyond patients with severe sore throat treated with antibiotics for group A β haemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis in the emergency department, to a broader range of patients not treated with antibiotics.

1. INDICATIONS AND USAGE

MOXATAG is a penicillin-class antibacterial indicated for the treatment of tonsillitis and/or pharyngitis secondary to Streptococcus pyogenes in adults and pediatric patients 12 years or older. (1)

Tonsillitis and/or Pharyngitis

MOXATAG is a penicillin-class antibacterial indicated for the treatment of tonsillitis and/or pharyngitis secondary to Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) in adults and pediatric patients 12 yrs and older.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of MOXATAG and other antibacterial drugs, MOXATAG should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Common childhood bacterial infections [^114HbRiq]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2011). Low credibility.

Children with infectious diseases are commonly encountered in primary care settings. Identification of the subset of patients with bacterial infections is key in guiding the best possible management. Clinicians frequently care for children with infections of the upper respiratory tract, including acute otitis media, otitis externa, sinusitis, and pharyngitis. Conjunctivitis is not an uncommon reason for office visits. Bacterial pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and gastroenteritis are regularly seen. Over the last decade, a growing number of children have had infections of the skin and soft tissue, driven by the increased prevalence of infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The following review addresses the epidemiology and risk factors for specific infections and examines the clinical presentation and selection of appropriate diagnostic methods in such conditions. Methods to prevent these bacterial infections and recommendations for follow-up are suggested. Management of these infections requires that antimicrobial agents be used in a judicious manner in the outpatient setting. Such antibiotic therapy is recommended using both available clinical evidence and review of disease-specific treatment guidelines.

### Short-course antimicrobial therapy of streptococcal pharyngitis [^112wVHjQ]. Clinical Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

While penicillin administered orally or intramuscularly is the least expensive course of pharyngitis treatment, there are many limitations to its use. These include the need for extended treatment (i.e., 10 days) and poor palatability of its liquid formulation and an alarming increase in the rates of failure with standard doses of either IM or oral penicillin. Increasing rates of beta-lactamase-producing normal flora and eradication of protective alpha-streptococci may also play a role in penicillin treatment failure. Thus practitioners may consider switching to amoxicillin in higher doses (up to 40 to 60 mg/kg/day divided twice daily, maximum dose 1 gram twice daily) as first-line therapy (Figure 1), similar to what we have done for acute otitis media. Five-day short-course treatment with cefdinir or cefpodoxime may be suitable alternatives, especially in patients with penicillin hypersensitivity (not anaphylaxis). Concerns with higher costs of these second-line agents and potential for resistance must be balanced with concerns for patient adherence with penicillin treatment and the recent increasing rate of penicillin failures. In light of recent reports regarding the high rate of failure with azithromycin and increasing macrolide resistance, clinicians should prescribe standard doses of this drug for 5 days with caution.

### Review: current laboratory and point-of-care pharyngitis diagnostic testing and knowledge gaps [^115xKwGu]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance, especially to commonly prescribed antibiotics, is increasing both domestically and abroad. In the United States, approximately half of antibiotic prescriptions for acute respiratory conditions such as pharyngitis have been deemed unnecessary as the etiology is most commonly viral. For pharyngitis, the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends health care providers test for group A Streptococcus (GAS) using rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs). However, due to suboptimal sensitivity, negative RADTs must be backed up by throat culture in patients aged 3–21 years (for others, culture confirmation is optional). Many clinicians choose not to wait an additional 24–48 hours for culture results and prescribe "just in case" antibiotics. New Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-waived, rapid nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for GAS, which can be performed at the point of care (POC), may reduce the need for culture confirmation of negative RADTs. Recent studies have verified the high sensitivity and specificity of rapid NAATs when compared to conventional culture and RADT methods. These new tools may improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce the time to appropriate treatment.

### Corticosteroids for treatment of sore throat: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^113jLX4r]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Despite previous evidence that corticosteroids might be beneficial, several groups and guidelines currently recommend against their routine use on the basis that evidence was applicable only to patients with severe pharyngitis who were also prescribed antibiotics in an emergency department. The body of evidence now includes a broader representation of patients. The largest and most recent randomised controlled trial included 565 patients presenting to their general practitioner rather than an emergency department, and none of the patients initially received antibiotics. We found no subgroup differences with respect to patient group: the evidence seems to apply equally to patients who did and did not receive antibiotics. The evidence also seems to apply equally to patients with sore throat from group A β haemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis and some with sore throat negative for group A β haemolytic streptococcus.

In the five trials that reported co-interventions, about 80% of the participants received additional analgesics such as paracetamol and NSAIDs. Therefore, a single dose of corticosteroids seems to further reduce pain when used in combination with other analgesics. Although the benefits are relatively small, many patients are likely to consider them important. Patients with less severe sore throat, however, will obtain less absolute benefit from corticosteroids. Thus, the balance of benefits and harms almost certainly depends on the severity of the patient's sore throat. With available evidence suggesting that serious adverse effects are rare or absent, the addition of one or two doses of steroids to the symptomatic management of sore throat is likely to appeal to many patients. More high quality data would be helpful to fully understand the net balance of benefits and harms according to severity of symptoms, particularly in primary care settings.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^113udCba]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Additional observation for persistent onset acute bacterial sinusitis — The guideline recommends either antibiotic therapy or an additional brief period of observation as initial management for children with persistent acute bacterial sinusitis, noting benefits to antibiotic therapy (number needed to treat, 3–5) while some children improve on their own and the risk of suppurative complications is low; benefits must also be balanced against an increased risk of adverse events (number need to harm, 3). Choosing between antibiotic therapy or additional observation presents an opportunity for shared decision-making with families. Children with persistent acute bacterial sinusitis who received antibiotic therapy in the previous 4 weeks, those with concurrent bacterial infection (pneumonia, suppurative cervical adenitis, group A streptococcal pharyngitis, or acute otitis media), those with actual or suspected complications, or those with underlying conditions should generally be managed with antibiotic therapy; the latter group includes children with asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunodeficiency, previous sinus surgery, or anatomic abnormalities of the upper respiratory tract. Limiting antibiotic use in children who may improve on their own reduces common antibiotic-related adverse events, and in the most recent RCT adverse events were 44% with antibiotic and 14% with placebo.

### Adherence to guidelines for testing and treatment of children with pharyngitis: a retrospective study [^1112LqC2]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Treating children with antibiotics when not indicated generates unnecessary healthcare costs and exposes patients to the risks of antibiotic treatment without associated benefit, while contributing to increasing antimicrobial resistance. A recent AAP report on the use of antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections, including pharyngitis, emphasized the importance of judicious prescribing in order to slow the rise of resistance. Pharyngitis is an important target for antimicrobial stewardship efforts because of the large number of patients affected and because cases caused by GAS are difficult to distinguish clinically from those with a viral etiology; such clinical uncertainty has been implicated in unnecessary antibiotic prescribing.

Prior studies have evaluated adherence to guidelines for management of pharyngitis among pediatric care providers. Kronman et al. found that 57% of children received antibiotics during office visits for pharyngitis, significantly higher than the expected rate of GAS infection. However, this study did not evaluate patients' histories or GAS test results, so it was not possible to determine how many patients were prescribed antibiotics in the absence of GAS infection or to characterize patients' clinical presentations. In an analysis of pediatric outpatient visits for pharyngitis, Benin et al. found that a GAS test was ordered for 78% of patients and that the presence of pharyngeal exudate increased the likelihood of testing; 36% of patients prescribed antibiotics had a negative GAS test. However, this study did not include data on other clinical predictors of GAS infection to assess whether testing was indicated.

### Short-term late-generation antibiotics versus longer term penicillin for acute streptococcal pharyngitis in children [^115Yy2HD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The standard duration of treatment for children with acute group A beta hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) pharyngitis with oral penicillin is 10 days. Shorter duration antibiotics may have comparable efficacy.

Objectives

To summarize the evidence regarding the efficacy of two to six days of newer oral antibiotics (short duration) compared to 10 days of oral penicillin (standard duration) in treating children with acute GABHS pharyngitis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2012, Issue 3) which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialized Register, MEDLINE (January 1966 to March week 3, 2012) and EMBASE (January 1990 to April 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing short duration oral antibiotics to standard duration oral penicillin in children aged 1 to 18 years with acute GABHS pharyngitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors scanned the titles and abstracts of retrieved citations and applied the inclusion criteria. We retrieved included studies in full, and extracted data. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality.

Main Results

We included 20 studies with 13,102 cases of acute GABHS pharyngitis. The updated search did not identify any new eligible studies; the majority of studies were at high risk of bias. However, the majority of the results were consistent. Compared to standard duration treatment, the short duration treatment studies had shorter periods of fever (mean difference (MD) -0.30 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.45 to -0.14) and throat soreness (MD -0.50 days, 95% CI -0.78 to -0.22); lower risk of early clinical treatment failure (odds ratio (OR) 0.80, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.94); no significant difference in early bacteriological treatment failure (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.20) or late clinical recurrence (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.08). However, the overall risk of late bacteriological recurrence was worse in the short duration treatment studies (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.48), although no significant differences were found when studies of low dose azithromycin (10 mg/kg) were eliminated (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.22). Three studies reported long duration complications. Out of 8135 cases of acute GABHS pharyngitis, only six cases in the short duration treatment versus eight in the standard duration treatment developed long-term complications in the form of glomerulonephritis and acute rheumatic fever, with no statistically significant difference (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.64).

Authors' Conclusions

Three to six days of oral antibiotics had comparable efficacy compared to the standard duration 10-day course of oral penicillin in treating children with acute GABHS pharyngitis. In areas where the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease is still high, our results must be interpreted with caution.

### Diagnosis and antibiotic treatment of group a streptococcal pharyngitis in children in a primary care setting: impact of point-of-care polymerase chain reaction [^115neyHM]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Historically, bacterial culture is considered the gold standard because it is believed to be both highly sensitive and highly specific. In clinical trials, cultures are generally performed at a central reference laboratory under rigorous procedural oversight and optimized transport conditions to prioritize sensitivity, with limited concern about turnaround times. The sensitivity results in this study (71.8% [62.4–80.0%]) and others (81 and 86.8%) that look at culture under real-world conditions, often with less rigorous procedural oversight, raise questions about its use in routine clinical care, especially in light of the time delay to report results back to providers.

Turnaround time is a high priority for patient care, timely results are necessary for optimal management. This is particularly important for streptococcal pharyngitis, because children are highly contagious until treated and both individual and community health are adversely affected by delays in diagnosis. Parental desire for a timely diagnosis and treatment, along with the additional resources needed to follow-up on culture results and report these results to parents, place additional strains on providers. As a result, clinicians often empirically prescribe antibiotics before receiving the final test results, or treat based on clinical presentation alone, which has low proven specificity. Prudent use of antibiotics by outpatients is necessary to prevent the development and spread of bacterial resistance.

Randomisation

We performed randomisation centrally in advance by using a computerised random number generator within fixed blocks (blinded to the investigators) on a one to one basis and stratified by primary healthcare centres. We concealed allocation by distributing sealed opaque randomisation envelopes to the healthcare centres. The local investigators enrolled participants and assigned them to intervention groups by opening the randomisation envelopes in consecutive order. The allocated treatment regimen was open to participants, investigators, study nurses, and outcome adjudicators. The steering committee agreed definitions of outcome measures to guide the outcome adjudicators before unblinding the two study groups. The steering committee also performed correction of data and made all decisions regarding definitions of analysis populations, variables, and coding of incidences while still blinded to the intervention groups.

### Management of acute pharyngitis in children: summary of the Italian national institute of health guidelines [^113ofeiD]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Discrepancies in the management of pharyngitis in children have been reported in Europe and the United States, and recommendations concerning the use of clinical scores, rapid antigen diagnostic tests (RADTs) or throat cultures, and the indications for antibiotic treatment largely differ.

Objective

This article summarizes the Italian guidelines on the management of pharyngitis in children issued by the National Institute of Health.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel of experts (the Guidelines Development Group) developed and used a set of key questions to conduct a systematic review of the literature. Relevant publications in English were identified through a systematic review of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from their inception through April 30, 2011. Final recommendations were scaled according to the Italian National Guidelines Program grading.

Results

Eighteen clinical questions were defined, and 44 recommendations were issued. None of the available scoring systems is sufficiently accurate to identify group A β-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) pharyngitis in settings with low prevalence for rheumatic disease. RADT should be performed by trained personnel in every child with a history and signs/symptoms suggestive of GABHS pharyngitis. RADT is not recommended in children with a McIsaac score of 0 or 1 with ≥ 2 signs/symptoms suggestive of viral infection. Backup culture in children with negative RADT result is not recommended. Culture test with antibiotic susceptibility assay should be performed exclusively for epidemiologic purposes. Streptococcal antibody titers are of no value in diagnosing acute pharyngitis. Antibiotic therapy is recommended in microbiologically documented GABHS pharyngitis. Because penicillin V is not available in Italy, amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/d in 2–3 doses orally) for 10 days is the first choice of treatment. In noncompliant cases, benzathine penicillin may be administered. Although not routinely recommended due to the high cost and wide spectrum of activity, a 5-day course with a second-generation cephalosporin may be used in noncompliant cases. Macrolides should be limited to children with demonstrated type I hypersensitivity to penicillin. Ibuprofen or paracetamol is recommended for relief of pain or fever associated with discomfort. Because the carrier state is not associated with increased risk of suppurative complications and risk of GABHS transmission to contacts is minimal, the carrier state should never be investigated and treated. Recommendations for the management of suppurative complications are given.

Conclusions

This guideline provides a comprehensive, evidence based, tool for the diagnosis and therapy of acute pharyngitis in children.

### Efficacy and safety of rapid tests to guide antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat [^113bY21x]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sore throat is a common condition caused by viruses or bacteria, and is a leading cause of antibiotic prescription in primary care. The most common bacterial species is group A streptococcus ('strep throat'). Between 50% to 70% of pharyngitis cases are treated with antibiotics, despite the majority of cases being viral in origin. One strategy to reduce antibiotics is to use rapid tests for group A streptococcus to guide antibiotic prescriptions. Rapid tests can be used alone or in combination with a clinical scoring system.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of strategies based on rapid tests to guide antibiotic prescriptions for sore throat in primary care settings.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and LILACS, as well as the trial registries ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP on 5 June 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing rapid tests with management based on clinical grounds to guide the prescription of antibiotics for people with a sore throat in ambulatory care settings. We included trials that randomised individuals, as well as cluster-RCTs in which individual practitioners (or practices) or emergency departments were randomised.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data on the primary outcomes (number of participants provided with an antibiotic prescription; number of participants with an antibiotic dispensed) and secondary outcomes (duration of sore throat symptoms; duration of other symptoms; quality of life measures; number of participants with a complication attributed to the index infection; number of participants in need of re-consultation by the end of follow-up; number of participants in need of hospital admission by the end of follow-up; number of satisfied participants; number of participants with an adverse event attributed to the rapid test). We assessed the risk of bias of all included trials and used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We performed meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses when feasible.

Main Results

We included five trials (2891 children and adult participants in total; 2545 participants after adjusting for clustering). Management in the intervention group was as follows: in three trials rapid tests were used in combination with a clinical scoring system; in one trial, some physicians were asked to use rapid tests alone, while others were asked to use rapid tests in combination with a clinical scoring system; in one trial, rapid tests were used alone. Based on data from five trials (2545 participants), a large reduction in prescribed antibiotics was found in the rapid test group (481/1197) versus management based on clinical grounds (865/1348), for a summary risk difference (RD) of -25%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -31% to -18%; I² = 62%; moderate-certainty evidence. Estimates of effect on antibiotic prescription rates were stable in various sensitivity analyses. Based on data from two trials (900 people) originating from the same overarching study, the evidence suggests that rapid tests may not reduce dispensed antibiotic treatments: rapid test group (156/445) versus management based on clinical grounds (197/455); summary RD -7%, 95% CI -17% to 2%; I² = 53%; low-certainty evidence. Four trials (2075 participants) reported data on the number of participants with a complication attributed to the index infection; the summary odds ratio (OR) was 0.85, 95% CI 0.03 to 26.65; P = 0.93; I² = 62%; very low-certainty evidence, which means that people in the rapid testing group were less likely to develop complications of the index infection, but the evidence is very uncertain. Two trials (1161 participants) reported on the number of participants in need of re-consultation by the end of follow-up; the summary OR was 1.12, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.21; P = 0.74; I² = 59%; low-certainty evidence, which means that participants in the rapid testing group were more likely to be in need of re-consultation by the end of the study follow-up, but the evidence is uncertain. Lack of data impeded assessment of other secondary outcomes (including safety outcomes) and of sources of heterogeneity. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Rapid testing to guide antibiotic treatment for sore throat in primary care probably reduces antibiotic prescription rates by 25% (absolute risk difference), but may have little or no impact on antibiotic dispensing. More studies are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of rapid test-guided antibiotic prescribing, notably to evaluate patient-centred outcomes and variability across subgroups (e.g. adults versus children).

Background

Group A beta hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) is commonly implicated in bacterial pharyngitis. Starting treatment with antibiotics for GABHS infection, within the first 24–48 hours of illness, when a bacterial cause is highly suspected, has been found to decrease duration of symptoms, such as sore throat, fever and adenopathy by approximately one day, and prevent complications of GABHS pharyngitis, particularly rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. However, the majority of pharyngitis cases in adults are of viral etiology; only 5–15% of cases suffer from bacterial pathogens that require prompt antibiotic treatment.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines an appropriate prescription as "administration of the right drug indicated for the disease, in the right dose, through an appropriate route of administration, for the right duration". When these criteria are not fulfilled, the prescription is considered inappropriate. Inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions for treatment of pharyngitis have contributed to the emergence of resistant strains of oropharyngeal human flora which in turn, have increased morbidity, mortality, and health-care costs. Approximately three quarters of pharyngitis patients have received inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions, by receiving antibiotics for viral infections or otherwise not adhering to the WHO definition.

First-line agents for treatment of bacterial pharyngitis include penicillin, ampicillin or amoxicillin. 13 Alternative options include erythromycin (especially in patients with a non-life-threatening allergy to penicillin) and first-generation cephalosporins (CG). Both erythromycin and cephalosporins are also considered reasonable alternatives to penicillin in patients who fail to respond to penicillin or continue to become re-infected following penicillin therapy. As GABHS is the most important pathogen causing infection, fluoroquinolones, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim that do not cover Gram-positive pathogens very well are not recommended. Although amoxicillin-clavulanate, clarithromycin, azithromycin and second-generation cephalosporins work very well against GABHS infection, they are considered third-line alternatives due to their broader spectrum of action and potential for causing resistance.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^112WDa4A]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

The five day regimen was preferred by patients, and patients in this group showed better adherence than the 10 day group despite the more frequent dose regimen. This finding is supported by a previous study that showed a four dose regimen does not reduce adherence compared with a three dose regimen. Fewer patients in the five day treatment group achieved bacterial eradication at the clinical follow up (test of cure), which is in line with previous studies. It is not clear whether bacterial eradication has clinical relevance because colonisation of group A streptococcus occurs in healthy people and there is the possibility that patients have coinfections with other potential pathogens and so the causative agent is not known. Notably, the relapse rate within one month was similar in the two groups, and the recurrence rate of new pharyngotonsillitis within three months was lower in the five day treatment group. Overall, these results support the argument for penicillin treatment regimens with more frequent dosing.

It is important to consider whether shorter duration of treatment would be appropriate in general or if certain subgroups in particular would benefit. In our study, subgroup analyses indicated that the rate of clinical cure at five to seven days after the end of penicillin treatment was similar in both treatment groups for patients with three Centor criteria. However, the cure rate in patients with four Centor criteria appeared lower in those receiving the shorter treatment regimen (table 2). This is mirrored by the fact that patients with four Centor criteria had a lower rate of clinical cure. Further research is needed to identify patients who would benefit from a longer treatment regimen.

Despite a slightly higher daily dose of penicillin V in the five day treatment group (3.2 g v 3.0 g in the 10 day treatment), fewer adverse events and shorter duration of adverse events were reported. This finding could be because of shorter exposure to penicillin and might lead to improved adherence if a five day treatment regimen were to be introduced in clinical practice. The four patients who developed complications (three had peritonsillitis and one had psoriasis) were in the 10 day treatment group. We do not know whether complications were avoided in the five day treatment group because of more frequent dosing or whether the three peritonsillitis cases were caused by other infectious agents not treatable with penicillin V. In addition to group A streptococcus, Fusobacterium necrophorum is one of the main agents that causes peritonsillitis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis [^114WGiQz]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Common signs and symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis include sore throat, temperature greater than 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C), tonsillar exudates, and cervical adenopathy. Cough, coryza, and diarrhea are more common with viral pharyngitis. Available diagnostic tests include throat culture and rapid antigen detection testing. Throat culture is considered the diagnostic standard, although the sensitivity and specificity of rapid antigen detection testing have improved significantly. The modified Centor score can be used to help physicians decide which patients need no testing, throat culture/rapid antigen detection testing, or empiric antibiotic therapy. Penicillin (10 days of oral therapy or one injection of intramuscular benzathine penicillin) is the treatment of choice because of cost, narrow spectrum of activity, and effectiveness. Amoxicillin is equally effective and more palatable. Erythromycin and first-generation cephalosporins are options in patients with penicillin allergy. Increased group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) treatment failure with penicillin has been reported. Although current guidelines recommend first-generation cephalosporins for persons with penicillin allergy, some advocate the use of cephalosporins in all nonallergic patients because of better GABHS eradication and effectiveness against chronic GABHS carriage. Chronic GABHS colonization is common despite appropriate use of antibiotic therapy. Chronic carriers are at low risk of transmitting disease or developing invasive GABHS infections, and there is generally no need to treat carriers. Whether tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy decreases the incidence of GABHS pharyngitis is poorly understood. At this time, the benefits are too small to outweigh the associated costs and surgical risks.

GROUP A STREPTOCOCCAL PHARYNGEAL INFECTIONS

Bacteria are the second most common etiology of acute pharyngitis. Infection with β-hemolytic GAS, accounts for 5%–15% and 20%–30% of infections in adults and children, respectively. While acute pharyngitis caused by GAS can also be self-limited and resolve without antibiotic treatment, the clinical course of GAS pharyngitis can be associated with significant postinfectious sequelae and other complications. Inadequately or untreated GAS pharyngitis can lead to both nonsuppurative and/or suppurative complications, especially in children 3–15 years of age. Treatment consists of penicillin or amoxicillin, or for β-lactam allergic individuals, a first-generation cephalosporin, clindamycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin. Nonsuppurative complications are immune mediated and include poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, acute rheumatic fever, and rheumatic heart disease. Suppurative complications include abscess (brain, peritonsillar region, soft tissues of head and neck), cervical lymphadenitis, mastoiditis, meningitis, otitis media, sinusitis, and rarely septicemia. Based on 2010 estimates of deaths by rheumatic heart disease and other previous deaths by invasive GAS infections, GAS was postulated to be the fifth most lethal pathogen worldwide.

### Common questions about streptococcal pharyngitis [^1144dknB]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infection causes 15% to 30% of sore throats in children and 5% to 15% in adults, and is more common in the late winter and early spring. The strongest independent predictors of GABHS pharyngitis are patient age of five to 15 years, absence of cough, tender anterior cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudates, and fever. To diagnose GABHS pharyngitis, a rapid antigen detection test should be ordered in patients with a modified Centor or FeverPAIN score of 2 or 3. First-line treatment for GABHS pharyngitis includes a 10-day course of penicillin or amoxicillin. Patients allergic to penicillin can be treated with firstgeneration cephalosporins, clindamycin, or macrolide antibiotics. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are more effective than acetaminophen and placebo for treatment of fever and pain associated with GABHS pharyngitis; medicated throat lozenges used every two hours are also effective. Corticosteroids provide only a small reduction in the duration of symptoms and should not be used routinely.

Introduction

Sore throat is a common reason for prescribing antibiotics and accounts for about 11% of all antibiotic prescriptions in primary healthcare in Sweden, which is a low prescribing country. Among approximately 29 consultations per 1000 inhabitants for sore throat in 2013, about two thirds were labelled as tonsillitis, of which 80% received an antibiotic prescription. Group A streptococcus is the most common pathogen in acute tonsillitis and is present in about 33% of patients with acute sore throat, but other bacteria and viruses are also potential pathogens. The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) Sore Throat Guideline Group and Swedish guidelines for the management of sore throat focus on patients who are more likely to benefit from antimicrobial treatment. These patients have a higher symptom burden and an infection caused by group A streptococcus. The recommendation is that antibiotic treatment should be offered to patients with three or four Centor criteria (fever, tender cervical lymph nodes, coatings of the tonsils, and lack of cough) and a positive rapid antigen detection test for group A streptococcus. In Sweden the recommended treatment regimen for adults is 1000 mg penicillin V three times daily for 10 days. This duration of treatment is similar to other countries, but the dosage and total exposure (30 g) are relatively high. The historical reason for antimicrobial treatment is mainly to avoid serious complications such as acute rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis. These conditions are currently extremely rare in high income countries. Today the main reason for treatment in high income countries is to speed up clinical resolution of symptoms, but treatment also prevents rare complications such as peritonsillitis, impetigo, cellulitis, otitis media, and sinusitis.

### Notes from the field: group A streptococcal pharyngitis misdiagnoses at a rural urgent-care clinic-Wyoming, March 2015… [^115A75Du]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Streptococcus is the most common bacterial cause of pharyngitis, implicated in 20%–30% of pediatric and 5%–15% of adult health care visits for sore throat. Along with the sudden onset of throat pain, GAS pharyngitis symptoms include fever, headache, and bilateral tender cervical lymphadenopathy. IDSA recommends that patients with sore throat be tested for GAS to distinguish between GAS and viral pharyngitis; however, IDSA emphasizes the use of selective testing based on clinical symptoms and signs to avoid identifying GAS carriers rather than acute GAS infections. Therefore, testing for GAS usually is not recommended for the following: patients with sore throat and accompanying symptoms that strongly suggest a viral etiology; children aged < 3 years, because acute rheumatic fever is extremely rare in this age group; and asymptomatic household contacts of patients with GAS pharyngitis. 1).

Two of these 10 were asymptomatic adult contacts of patients with diagnosed GAS pharyngitis; both asymptomatic contacts had positive RADT results and were prescribed an antibiotic. Of the 24 tested patients aged ≥ 3 years with sore throat, 19 reported cough or rhinorrhea, symptoms that suggest a viral rather than bacterial etiology. The patients' failure to improve led to the assumption of bacterial resistance, which prompted use of broad-spectrum antibiotics as first-line therapy in subsequent patients. The clinic practitioners' recognition of their unusually high GAS incidence, request for assistance, and compliance with suggested interventions were critical in identifying and amending problematic practices. Sore throat is one of the most common symptoms reported by outpatients, with viral infections responsible for the majority of cases.

Correct diagnosis and treatment of GAS pharyngitis prevents acute rheumatic fever, shortens illness duration, and reduces person-to-person spread; however, antibiotic overuse for sore throat is common among both children and adults. This can result in unnecessary side effects and promote development of antibiotic resistance. Clinics should take steps to ensure practitioner understanding of and adherence to published guidelines, and to promote the use of good laboratory practices, such as periodic evaluation of competency in testing procedures.

### Predicting streptococcal pharyngitis in adults in primary care: a systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms and signs and validation of the Centor score [^115hURyA]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Upper respiratory tract infections such as acute pharyngitis represent a substantial portion of the cases seen in primary care. Although the cause of acute pharyngitis in the majority of patients is viral, approximately 5% to 17% is caused by a bacterial infection, often β-haemolytic streptococci. A number of serotypes of β-haemolytic streptococci can cause pharyngitis in humans, however, antibiotics are only recommended in US and UK guidelines for treating patients with group A β-haemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis. Antibiotics reduce the risk of complications (for example, peritonsillar abscess, bacteraemia, acute glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever), as well as reducing the duration of symptoms and spread of the disease.

Throat cultures are currently considered to be the 'reference standard' for the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis. This test has a number of limitations in practice; it is relatively expensive; the laboratory tests take 1–2 days leading to delays in starting treatment; and excessive false positive results in asymptomatic pharyngeal carriers may lead to over treatment. To enhance the appropriate prescribing of antibiotics without performing cultures on all patients a number of clinical prediction rules (CPRs) have been developed over the last 40 years to distinguish streptococcal pharyngitis from pharyngitis by other causes. CPRs are evidence-based tools that allow clinicians to stratify patients according to their probability of having a particular disorder. They can also be used to provide a rational basis for treatment.

NON-STREPTOCOCCAL BACTERIAL PHARYNGEAL INFECTIONS

Besides streptococci, there are other bacterial pathogens that cause pharyngitis and many of these are not responsive to conventional GAS antimicrobial therapy. This drives the need for identification of additional bacterial pathogens if GAS is not detected by antigen, culture, or molecular testing modalities. Both commonly and uncommonly encountered bacterial pathogens of pharyngitis are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1.
Etiologic Agents Associated With Acute Pharyngitis a

A less common cause of acute pharyngitis, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum is a gram-positive bacillus that morphologically resembles coryneform gram-positive rods. Individuals with A. haemolyticum pharyngitis exhibit symptoms that closely mimic streptococcal infection. This pathogen is readily found on comprehensive throat cultures but will not be identified on a culture specifically targeting GAS. A. haemolyticum infection is usually found in teenagers and young adults, and infected individuals may present with a generalized rash like that of scarlet fever. A. haemolyticum, as an agent of asymptomatic colonization, was detected in the pharynx of 1.4% of individuals (n = 217) using PCR; however, it was not detected by culture methods alone. In general, this organism is susceptible to antibiotics typically prescribed for the treatment of GAS pharyngitis. However, due to varied reports of resistance to penicillin and macrolide antibiotics, culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing is recommended.

### Evaluation of culture and antibiotic use in patients with pharyngitis [^1112heRM]. The Laryngoscope (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objectives of this study were to evaluate practice patterns for treatment of patients with pharyngitis with regard to testing for group A beta hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infection, frequency of antibiotic use, and appropriate choice of antibiotics.

Study Design

The authors conducted a retrospective review of billing data for 10,482 office visits for pharyngitis.

Methods

The 2004 billing database for a tertiary institution was queried for outpatient visits for pharyngitis or tonsillitis, group A Streptococcus tests (GAST), and antibiotic prescriptions filled after the visit. Patients were separated by age group and analyzed for the proportion of patients that received a GAST and proportion prescribed an antibiotic. Antibiotic prescriptions were also analyzed to determine whether they were appropriate for treatment of GABHS.

Results

A total of 68.7% of all patients and 82.2% of pediatric patients were tested for GAST. A total of 47.1% of adult patients and 44.9% of pediatric patients received an antibiotic. For adult patients for whom GAST was obtained, 48.6% were prescribed an antibiotic versus 53.6% of those not tested. Streptococcus testing was a significant predictor of antibiotic use (P < .0001), whereas age was not (P = 0.22). A total of 82.1% of all antibiotics prescribed were recommended for treatment of GABHS.

Conclusions

Most patients seen for pharyngitis were tested for GABHS, but pediatric patients were tested more frequently than adults. Patients who received a GAST were less likely to receive antibiotics. The rates experienced in our tertiary academic institution are higher than previously quoted for community practice. When antibiotics were prescribed, they were usually appropriate for the treatment of GABHS based on current recommendations.

INTRODUCTION

Pharyngitis is an inflammatory condition of the pharynx and/or tonsils that is commonly seen in both adults and children and is responsible for 1%–2% of all outpatient visits in the United States annually. GAS alone causes an estimated 5.2 million outpatient visits and 2.8 million antibiotic prescriptions annually among US persons aged 0–64 years with pharyngitis. As one of the most common reasons for primary care visits, it is the number one diagnosis linked to antibiotic use in school-aged children. Individuals complaining of sore throat also frequently present to medical emergency departments. According to the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (2017), there were more than 1.19 million visits to US emergency departments for acute pharyngitis. In one study evaluating the medical and nonmedical costs of pediatric pharyngitis, children missed a mean of 1.9 days of school or day care, and 42% of parents missed work. Further expanding the familial impact of pharyngitis, a second parent or caregiver also missed a mean of 1.5 days in 14% of families. Including indirect costs related to loss of parent's wages while missing work, the estimated total cost in the United States was calculated as between $224 and $539 million annually. In this review, we will describe the key characteristics of GAS pharyngeal infections, as well as other causes of pharyngeal infections, and highlight emerging pathogens that clinicians must consider in children and adults.

Keep ReadingClinical Guidance for Scarlet Fever. Diagnosis Differential diagnosis The differential diagnosis of acute pharyngitis includes multiple viral and bacterial pathogens.

Viruses are the most common cause of pharyngitis in all age groups. Experts estimate that group A strep, the most common bacterial cause, causes
- 20% to 30% of pharyngitis episodes in children
- 5% to 15% of pharyngitis infections in adults Clinical examination only with viral symptoms Healthcare providers can use history and clinical examination to diagnose viral pharyngitis when clear viral symptoms are present. These patients don't need testing for group A strep bacteria. Treatment Patients, regardless of age, who have a positive RADT or throat culture need antibiotics. Don't treat viral pharyngitis with antibiotics. Benefits of antibiotics Using a recommended antibiotic regimen to treat group A strep pharyngitis:

- Shortens the duration of symptoms
- Reduces the likelihood of transmission to close contacts
- Decreases the development of complications.

Recommended antibiotics Penicillin or amoxicillin is the antibiotic of choice to treat group A strep pharyngitis. Penicillin V, oral Children: 250 mg twice daily or 3 times daily for 10 days Adolescents and adults: 250 mg 4 times daily or 500 mg twice daily, for 10 days.
