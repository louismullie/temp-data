## Question

Should I administer nitroglycerin to a patient with suspected acute coronary syndrome who has a systolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether nitroglycerin should be given to a patient with suspected acute coronary syndrome who has a systolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the hemodynamic consequences of nitroglycerin in hypotension. Then, I should verify what contemporary guidelines say about blood pressure thresholds and contraindications. Next, I will review the pharmacology and labeled warnings to ensure mechanistic plausibility. After that, I should consider special scenarios like right ventricular infarction and drug interactions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation and outline safer alternatives and monitoring steps.

> Let me first confirm the hemodynamic risk. Nitroglycerin is a potent vasodilator that reduces preload and afterload; in patients with low SBP, further venodilation can precipitate or worsen hypotension, reduce coronary perfusion pressure, and trigger reflex tachycardia or even paradoxical bradycardia, all of which can worsen ischemia and shock physiology, so I need to ensure we do not compound hypotension in this setting [^1121rh1Z] [^113hDLsa] [^111Fdk8L].

> Next, I should review guideline thresholds. The 2025 ACC/AHA/ACEP ACS guideline explicitly advises avoiding intravenous nitroglycerin when SBP is less than 90 mm Hg or when there is a drop in SBP greater than 30 mm Hg below baseline, and it restricts sublingual nitroglycerin to hemodynamically stable patients with SBP at least 90 mm Hg, which means SBP below 90 mm Hg is a contraindication to both SL and IV nitroglycerin in suspected ACS [^113PUmRb] [^111oFs3f]. Prehospital guidance similarly lists SBP less than 90 mm Hg as a contraindication to nitrates, reinforcing the same threshold across settings [^112Mg7gw].

> Hold on, I should verify the pharmacologic rationale. Nitroglycerin's predominant effect is venodilation with reduced venous return and preload, with secondary arteriolar dilation that lowers afterload; both actions can lower arterial pressure and, in a hypotensive patient, may further decrease mean arterial pressure and coronary perfusion, which is exactly what we want to avoid in ACS with low SBP [^1121rh1Z] [^113hDLsa]. The FDA labeling repeatedly warns that severe hypotension may occur even with therapeutic doses, particularly in patients who are already hypotensive or volume depleted, which aligns with withholding nitroglycerin when SBP is below 90 mm Hg [^113Hrhnq] [^111Fdk8L].

> I need to check special scenarios. Right ventricular infarction is a classic situation where nitrates are contraindicated because RV preload dependence makes these patients exquisitely sensitive to preload reduction. Even without documented RV infarction, an inferior STEMI pattern should prompt caution and consideration of RV involvement before any nitrate use, so I should confirm the ECG and hemodynamics before reconsidering nitrates even if SBP improves [^113PUmRb] [^111oFs3f]. But wait, what if the low SBP reflects a vasovagal response rather than true cardiogenic compromise? Even then, I should not jump to conclusions; until SBP is at least 90 mm Hg and the patient is hemodynamically stable, nitroglycerin remains unsafe to administer [^113PUmRb].

> Let me consider drug interactions that amplify hypotension. Recent PDE5 inhibitor use is a strict contraindication to nitrates due to the risk of profound, refractory hypotension; I should double-check for sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil, or avanafil within the prior 24–48 hours before even thinking about nitroglycerin, and if present, nitroglycerin is off the table regardless of SBP [^1149GrTL] [^111oFs3f]. I also need to ensure I account for additive effects with antihypertensives and beta-blockers, which can further lower blood pressure when combined with nitrates, reinforcing the need to stabilize SBP first [^1149GrTL].

> I should confirm the clinical implications of giving nitroglycerin in hypotension. Beyond worsening shock, nitrate-induced hypotension can cause syncope, paradoxical bradycardia, and even increased angina due to reduced coronary perfusion, and there is no evidence that nitrates improve mortality or hard outcomes in ACS. Their role is symptomatic and hemodynamically contingent, so exposing a hypotensive ACS patient to nitroglycerin risks harm without proven benefit [^113Hrhnq] [^111Fdk8L] [^112VwZwq].

> Now, what should I do instead? Let me think about immediate priorities. First, treat the hypotension: place the patient supine with legs elevated, administer intravenous crystalloid if not contraindicated, and initiate vasopressor support such as norepinephrine or dopamine if SBP remains below 90 mm Hg, while preparing for urgent reperfusion if STEMI is suspected or if there is ongoing ischemia with high-risk features, because revascularization — not nitrates — changes outcomes in ACS [^112VwZwq]. I should confirm the ECG for STEMI, obtain bedside echo to assess ventricular function and look for RV involvement, and start guideline-directed antithrombotic therapy once bleeding risk is addressed, escalating to cath lab activation as indicated [^113PUmRb].

> But wait, what if the pain is severe and the patient is still hypotensive? I should verify whether opioids are appropriate. Morphine or fentanyl can be used judiciously for analgesia in ACS when nitrates are contraindicated by low SBP, recognizing potential delays in P2Y12 absorption and the need for close monitoring; this is a safer symptomatic bridge while I correct hemodynamics and pursue reperfusion [^111oFs3f] [^112VwZwq].

> I will now examine when nitroglycerin becomes appropriate again. Once SBP is consistently at or above 90 mm Hg and the patient is hemodynamically stable, I can consider sublingual nitroglycerin 0.3–0.4 mg every 5 minutes up to three doses for persistent ischemic chest pain, followed by IV nitroglycerin if pain continues and there are no contraindications such as RV infarction or recent PDE5 inhibitor use, with frequent reassessment of blood pressure and symptoms to avoid recurrent hypotension [^113PUmRb] [^111oFs3f].

> In summary, I should confirm that nitroglycerin is contraindicated in suspected ACS when SBP is below 90 mm Hg because of the risk of precipitating or worsening hypotension, compromising coronary perfusion, and worsening shock. The correct action is to withhold nitroglycerin, stabilize blood pressure with fluids and vasopressors as needed, and proceed with definitive ACS care and reperfusion, only reconsidering nitrates once SBP is at least 90 mm Hg and the patient is hemodynamically stable [^113PUmRb] [^111oFs3f] [^1121rh1Z] [^113Hrhnq].

Do not administer nitroglycerin to patients with suspected ACS and **SBP < 90 mmHg** because it can cause severe hypotension, reduce coronary perfusion, and worsen ischemia [^111oFs3f] [^113PUmRb]. Nitrates are contraindicated in hypotension, right ventricular infarction, and with recent PDE5 inhibitor use [^112Mg7gw] [^1149GrTL]. Instead, treat hypotension with fluids and vasopressors, and use alternative analgesics such as morphine or fentanyl for pain control [^111oFs3f] [^114Y7Qor]. If SBP rises to ≥ 90 mmHg and there is no RV infarction, carefully consider nitroglycerin with close hemodynamic monitoring [^113PUmRb].

---

## Pharmacological effects of nitroglycerin relevant to hypotension

Nitroglycerin is a potent vasodilator that **reduces preload and afterload**, thereby decreasing myocardial oxygen demand and relieving ischemic symptoms [^1121rh1Z]. However, in hypotensive patients, these effects can precipitate further blood pressure drops, reduce coronary perfusion, and worsen ischemia [^113hDLsa].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) provide **clear recommendations** regarding nitroglycerin administration in ACS patients with hypotension:

- **Sublingual nitroglycerin**: Recommended for hemodynamically stable patients with SBP ≥ 90 mmHg, up to three doses of 0.3–0.4 mg every 5 minutes as needed [^113PUmRb].

- **Intravenous nitroglycerin**: Initiate at 10 µg/min and titrate to pain relief and hemodynamic tolerability, but avoid use in patients with SBP < 90 mmHg or suspected right ventricular infarction [^111oFs3f].

- **Contraindications**: Hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg), suspected right ventricular infarction, and recent use of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (e.g. sildenafil, tadalafil) [^112Mg7gw] [^1149GrTL].

---

## Risks associated with nitroglycerin administration in hypotensive patients

Administering nitroglycerin to hypotensive patients with suspected ACS carries **significant risks**:

- **Exacerbation of hypotension**: Nitroglycerin-induced vasodilation can further lower blood pressure, compromising coronary perfusion and worsening ischemia [^113Hrhnq].

- **Increased risk of shock**: Hypotension can precipitate cardiogenic shock, a life-threatening complication with high mortality [^notfound].

- **Paradoxical bradycardia**: Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia, further compromising cardiac output [^113Hrhnq].

---

## Alternative pharmacological strategies

When nitroglycerin is contraindicated due to hypotension, **alternative pharmacological strategies** should be employed:

- **Intravenous fluids**: Administer crystalloid solutions (e.g. normal saline) to restore intravascular volume and improve blood pressure [^112gwA9y].

- **Vasopressors**: Consider vasopressor agents such as norepinephrine or dopamine to stabilize hemodynamics and maintain adequate coronary perfusion pressure [^112gwA9y].

- **Alternative analgesics**: Morphine or fentanyl can be used for pain control without causing significant hypotension [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios where nitroglycerin may be considered despite low blood pressure

In rare cases, nitroglycerin may be considered despite low blood pressure if **careful hemodynamic monitoring** and supportive measures are in place. Examples include use in a controlled critical care setting with invasive hemodynamic monitoring, where cautious titration may be considered if the potential benefits outweigh the risks, and in suspected coronary vasospasm, where nitrates can be diagnostic and therapeutic; however, this approach requires close monitoring and immediate access to supportive therapies [^115vpXrv].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Nitroglycerin administration** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| SBP < 90 mmHg | Contraindicated | Risk of exacerbating hypotension, reduced coronary perfusion, and worsening ischemia [^113PUmRb] [^111oFs3f] |
| SBP ≥ 90 mmHg, hemodynamically stable | Recommended | Effective for symptom relief and reducing myocardial oxygen demand [^113PUmRb] |
| Suspected right ventricular infarction | Contraindicated | Risk of profound hypotension and shock [^113PUmRb] [^111oFs3f] |
| Recent PDE5 inhibitor use | Contraindicated | Risk of severe hypotension [^1149GrTL] [^114R4Ujm] |

---

Nitroglycerin should not be administered to patients with suspected ACS and **SBP < 90 mmHg** due to the risk of exacerbating hypotension, reducing coronary perfusion, and worsening ischemia. Alternative strategies — such as intravenous fluids, vasopressors, and alternative analgesics — should be used to manage hypotension and pain. If SBP rises to ≥ 90 mmHg and there is no suspicion of right ventricular infarction, nitroglycerin may be considered with careful hemodynamic monitoring [^113PUmRb].

Angina pectoris — symptom pattern and diagnostic caveat: Angina pectoris is perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort that builds gradually in intensity (over several minutes), is usually precipitated by stress or occurring at rest (as in the case of an ACS) with characteristic radiation to the left arm, neck, or jaw and associated symptoms such as dyspnea, nausea, and lightheadedness. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion, and a detailed assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, review of systems, past medical history, and family and social history should complement the assessment of presenting symptoms.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Tolerance: Excessive use may lead to tolerance. (5.1)
Hypotension: Severe hypotension may occur. (5.2)

5.1 Tolerance

Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates.

5.2 Hypotension

Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume- depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses.

5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy

Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

5.4 Headache

Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persist but usually subside with continued use.

Results

Clinical characteristics in the GTN and the non-GTN groups

This study analysed 947 patients with a median age of 71 years and with 71.5% of male patients. Hypertension was the most common coronary risk factor, followed by dyslipidaemia, smoking and diabetes. Two hundred and eighty-nine patients (30.5%) received GTN preceding PCI as primary care for ACS in prehospital and in-hospital phases: 228 with sublingual or oral spray, 57 with intravenous and 4 with both. In the pre-PCI baseline characteristics, the GTN group (vs non-GTN group) had significantly lower systolic blood pressure (132 (110–143) mm Hg vs 134 (112–157) mm Hg, p = 0.03), a trend towards lower diastolic blood pressure (80 (66–93) mm Hg vs 83 (69–94) mm Hg, p = 0.08), and significantly higher prevalence of hypertension (82.6% vs 72.6%, p < 0.001) and dyslipidaemia (76.8% vs 66.1%, p < 0.001). In addition, the GTN group had a trend towards a higher proportion of patients who previously received PCI (17.9% vs 13.3%, p = 0.065) (online supplemental table S1). In a survey of antithrombotic pharmacotherapy regimens before the onset of ACS, the GTN group showed significantly higher rates of aspirin (20.7% vs 12.7%, p = 0.003) and warfarin use (2.4% vs 0.5%, p = 0.016) and a trend towards higher rates of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) use (2.4% vs 0.8%, p = 0.066), compared with the non-GTN group (online supplemental table S1).

### Nitroglycerin (Nitro-bid) [^1121rh1Z]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:

The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined.

Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentrations that are continuously greater than a minimally effective concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the anti-anginal efficacy of continuously-delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were indistinguishable from placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates had been absent from the body for several hours was their anti-anginal efficacy restored.

### Vericiguat in combination with short-acting nitroglycerin in patients with chronic coronary syndromes: the randomized, phase Ib, VENICE study [^1142DKn1]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

The magnitude of the global burden of heart failure (HF) is significant. As well as being a growing economic problem, clinical outcomes for patients with chronic HF remain poor, despite the availability of HF therapies and the implementation of current guidelines.

Comorbidities are of great importance in HF, as they add to the complexity of patient management as well as potentially increase mortality risk. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major risk factor for HF, and recent guidelines categorize patients with CAD as having acute or chronic coronary syndromes (CCSs). Angina pectoris is a common symptom in patients with HF and CCSs. Short‐acting nitrates, such as nitroglycerin, are recommended for the acute treatment of angina in patients with CCSs, according to recent guidelines.

Vericiguat is an orally administered, direct soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization following a hospitalization for HF or need for outpatient intravenous diuretics in adults with symptomatic chronic HF and ejection fraction less than 45%. Nitric oxide (NO) availability and the functionality of sGC are impaired in HF; this results in a loss of production of the molecular messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which may contribute to the progression of cardiovascular disease. Vericiguat enhances the NO–sGC–cGMP pathway by directly stimulating sGC through a binding site independent of NO and by sensitizing sGC to endogenous NO. Given that vericiguat and nitroglycerin both act on the NO–sGC–cGMP pathway, and may be coadministered to patients with HF, it is important to understand their potential pharmacodynamic interactions.

In a previous phase I drug–drug interaction study in healthy male subjects (EudraCT number: 2014‐001235‐36; data on file), exposure to vericiguat (5 mg) was not affected by coadministration with nitroglycerin (0.2 mg sublingual), and the combination was generally well tolerated. In this article, we report the results from the phase Ib Vericiguat Nitroglycerin Clinical Interaction (VENICE) study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02617550; EudraCT number: 2015‐001444‐11), which investigated the hemodynamic effects of vericiguat plus nitroglycerin in patients with CCSs and whether concomitant administration would be well tolerated without clinically significant adverse effects beyond those known for nitroglycerin.

Results

Forty patients (34 male; age, 65.2 ± 7.6 years) completed the protocol, 21 in the nitroglycerin group and 19 in the control group. A total of 56 patients consented to the study but did not complete the protocol. Reasons for noncompletion were as follows: 9 had left main or 3-vessel disease, 4 had chronic total occlusions, 20 had angiographically normal or only minor disease, 3 experienced radial spasm necessitating use of nitroglycerin, 3 were unable to cycle, 3 had very tight lesions where flow was compromised on passing of the wire necessitating immediate percutaneous coronary intervention, and 4 had taken nitrates tablets, 5 had taken β-blockers, and 2 had taken a calcium channel antagonist within 48 hours of the study. Three patients had their research procedures canceled because of a medical emergency in another patient.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^114Y7Qor]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular — ACS/STEMI prehospital nitroglycerin dosing and precautions: Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual (SL), can repeat q (quaque, every) 3–5 minutes if SBP greater than 100 mmHg. The use of nitrates should be avoided in any patient who has used a phosphodiesterase inhibitor within the past 48 hours; examples include sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil. Also avoid use in patients receiving intravenous epoprostenol (Flolan®) or treprostinil (Remodulin®) which is used for pulmonary hypertension. Care should always be taken when giving nitroglycerin when the patient's blood pressure is marginal. If used in this setting, the clinician should weigh the risk and benefit of nitrate administration over the administration of an opiate analgesic and be ready to respond to hypotension with fluid bolus or pressor. The location of the infarct does not preclude the use of nitrates, and right-sided leads are of no additional value if an inferior STEMI has been diagnosed; such findings do not preclude the use of nitroglycerin and clinicians should continually monitor hemodynamic status and be prepared to resuscitate if hypotension occurs.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) — analgesics: Patients presenting with known or suspected ACS often experience chest pain or other uncomfortable symptoms, and rapid and effective pain relief remains an important treatment goal to prevent sympathetic activation and adverse clinical sequelae. Analgesic therapies may provide symptomatic relief, but they have not been shown to improve clinical outcomes in patients with ACS. Nitrates and opiate medications remain effective treatment options for management of pain in ACS but should be thoughtfully utilized to prevent potential harm, and rapid coronary revascularization should be pursued for patients with ongoing ischemic symptoms that are not relieved with nitrates.

### Nitroglycerin use and adverse clinical outcomes in elderly patients with acute coronary syndrome [^1179STif]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)and optimal medical therapy (OMT), including antithrombotic therapyand lipid-lowering therapy, have significantly improved cardiovascular outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, ACS remains a leading cause of death worldwide. To further improve clinical outcomes, strategies have been implemented to shorten the time from the onset of ACS to the initiation of the diagnostic process or medical intervention, which extends to the prehospital or pretransport phase. These management protocols, before primary PCI, include the administration of nitroglycerin (GTN).

GTN has long been incorporated as a first-line drug for ACS. This is primarily because it decreases venous return, thereby reducing left ventricular filling pressure and blood pressureand, consequently, myocardial oxygen demand. However, limited studiessupport the use of GTN for improving ACS outcomes; moreover, these investigations were mainly conducted over three decades ago when the clinical demographics of patients with ACS significantly differed from the current situation. The changes in patient characteristics (eg, an increased number of elderly patients) and advances in ACS management, including PCI and OMT, have raised the need to reassess the efficacy of GTN for clinical outcomes after primary PCI for ACS. Therefore, this study investigated the association between pre-PCI use of GTN and clinical outcomes in patients with ACS.

### Hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin ointment in emergency department patients [^115AvoD2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Nitroglycerin ointment is commonly used in the treatment of emergency department (ED) patients with suspected acute heart failure (AHF) or suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but its hemodynamic effects in this population are not well described.

Objective

Our objective was to assess the effect of nitroglycerin ointment on mean arterial pressure (MAP) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) in ED patients receiving nitroglycerin. We hypothesized that nitroglycerin ointment would result in a reduction of MAP and SVR in the acute treatment of patients.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, observational pilot study in a convenience sample of adult patients from a single ED who were treated with nitroglycerin ointment. Impedance cardiography was used to measure MAP, SVR, cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), and thoracic fluid content (TFC) at baseline and at 30, 60, and 120 min after application of nitroglycerin ointment. Mixed effects regression models with random slope and random intercept were used to analyze changes in hemodynamic parameters from baseline to 30, 60, and 120 min after adjusting for age, sex, and final ED diagnosis of AHF.

Results

Sixty-four subjects with mean age of 55 years (interquartile range, 48–67 years) were enrolled; 59% were male. In the adjusted analysis, MAP and TFC decreased after application of nitroglycerin ointment (p = 0.001 and p = 0.043, respectively). Cardiac index, CO, SVR, and SV showed no change (p = 0.113, p = 0.085, p = 0.570, and p = 0.076, respectively) over time.

Conclusions

Among ED patients who are treated with nitroglycerin ointment, MAP and TFC decrease over time. However, other hemodynamic parameters do not change after application of nitroglycerin ointment in these patients.

Nitroglycerin — an anti-anginal nitrate — has pharmacologic action as an "Organic nitrate which causes systemic venodilation, decreasing preload", with additional effects that "reduce both preload and afterload, and myocardial O2 demand" and may "Lower BP, increase heart rate, occasional paradoxical bradycardia". Indications are "As an anti-anginal medication for the management of chest pain as well as a reducer of preload for patients suffering from acute pulmonary edema". Contraindications include "Hypersensitivity, acute myocardial infarction, severe anemia, recent use of erectile dysfunction medications (sildenafil (Viagra® — within last 24 hours), tadalafil (Cialis® — within last 48 hours), vardenafil (Levitra® — within last 48 hours), or other phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors)", with a note of "narrow angle glaucoma (controversial: may not be clinically significant)". Nitrates are contraindicated in the presence of "hypotension (SBP less than 90 mmHg or ≥ 30 mmHg below baseline), extreme bradycardia (less than 50 BPM), tachycardia in the absence of heart failure (greater than 100 BPM), and right ventricular infarction".

### Towards appropriate polypharmacy in older cardiovascular patients: how many medications do I have to take? [^117Vs2mW]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

β ‐blockers: Beta‐blockers such as metoprolol and carvedilol carry a class I recommendation post‐ACS per consensus guidelines and are usually started as early as 24 hours after ACS. 3, 9 In the older adult, beta‐blocker therapy may contribute to cognitive impairment and fatigue, especially with highly lipophilic agents such as metoprolol, while carvedilol can lead to pronounced hypotension. In the era of postrevascularization, the long‐term benefits of beta‐blockers have been called into question; guidelines even suggest to reassess their utility at 3 years post‐ACS in patients with Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) > 40%. 37

Renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system inhibitors (ie, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker [ARB], aldosterone inhibitors): Renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors are a cornerstone of guideline‐directed medical therapy post‐ACS, especially if left ventricular dysfunction is present. 37 Older adults are at higher risk of acute kidney injury, and should be closely monitored for worsening renal dysfunction and hyperkalemia. Addition of an aldosterone antagonist to either an ACE‐inhibitor or ARB should be done cautiously, while the combination of an ACE‐inhibitor and an ARB should be avoided altogether. Consider reducing the dose or a temporary hold vs stopping therapy for worsening renal dysfunction or hyperkalemia (ie, serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL in women, 3 mg/dL in men, K+ > 5 mEq/L). 30 Avoid nephrotoxic medications like over‐the‐counter Non‐Steroidal Anti‐Inflammatory Drug (NSAIDs) or medications that can induce hyperkalemia, such as potassium‐sparing agents, trimethoprim, or potassium‐based salt substitutes. 3, 9

Nitrates: Nitrates can relieve symptoms associated with cardiac ischemia but do not reduce mortality, in which case chronic use should be reserved for coronary vasospasm or incomplete revascularization. 3 Long‐acting, once‐a‐day formulations cause less hypotension and are preferred. Sublingual nitroglycerin remains an important medication to have on hand for a relief of an ischemic attack.

### Effect of high (200 μ g / kg per minute) adenosine dose infusion on fractional flow reserve variability [^113T8oGw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

In a prospective, single‐arm study performed between January 2015 and October 2015, we assessed Pd/Pa variations using a standardized protocol of a 3‐minute adenosine infusion at 140 μg/kg per minute, through the femoral vein in all cases. 11 Consecutive patients with stable coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndrome were considered as candidates if they presented with an angiographically significant de novo stenosis (> 50% and < 90% diameter stenosis by visual assessment) in at least 1 major epicardial coronary artery amenable to percutaneous coronary intervention. We excluded patients > 80 years old, with a history of coronary artery bypass surgery, acute myocardial infarction within the previous 5 days, hemodialysis or creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min, allergy or contraindication to adenosine, left main disease, anatomy suitable for coronary artery bypass surgery, angiographically visible thrombus at a target lesion, left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%, previous q‐wave myocardial infarction in the area of target vessel or presence of collaterals, primary myocardial or valvular heart disease, severe left ventricular hypertrophy, hypotension, significant arrhythmia (eg, excessive premature ventricular contractions or atrial fibrillation), bradycardia (< 50 beats/min), or increased risk for bradycardia and caffeine consumption or smoking within the previous 24 hours. All patients were on aspirin (100 mg/day) before FFR measurements.

For each patient, only 1 lesion was assessed by FFR. Intracoronary nitroglycerin (0.3 mg) was administered before coronary angiography and before each FFR measurement, except in the case of systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg. A 0.014‐inch high‐fidelity pressure‐recording guidewire (PressureWire, St Jude Medical, St Paul, MN) was introduced through a 6‐F end‐hole guiding catheter into the coronary artery. The guidewire was externally zeroed and equalized between the pressure recorded through the catheter and the pressure wire. Careful attention was paid to avoid arterial pressure dampening or variation of the measured coronary catheter pressure. The pressure wire was advanced into the coronary artery with the pressure sensor placed beyond the lesion site under study. Infusion of adenosine was given using a rate‐controlled infusion pump, with continuous pressure signals recording for 30 s prior to and throughout the infusion. Following adenosine discontinuation, a pullback recording was performed to exclude wire drift.

### General pharmacologic treatment of acute myocardial infarction [^112rzUMa]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The general pharmacotherapeutic issues surrounding AMI are complex and expanding, especially with regard to treatment aimed at the [table: see text] culprit, coronary atherosclerotic thrombus. Basic, well-established therapy includes the routine administration of oxygen, nitroglycerin, aspirin, and at times morphine, with selected cases invoking caution with respect to these agents (e.g., nitroglycerin and the risk of hypotension in right ventricular infarction; contraindication to nitrolycerin in patients on sildenafil). Cardioprotective agents, especially beta-adrenergic antagonists, should be considered early in light of their demonstrated benefit; others, such as ACE inhibitors, need not be administered in the ED. Heparin, both UFH and the newer LMWHs, have well-established roles in acute coronary syndromes. The GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors are the most recent addition to the pharmacologic armamentarium; their role is evolving rapidly as research on this frontier continues. Table 2 reviews recommended dosing of selected agents in acute coronary syndromes.

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)

An elevated BP increases myocardial oxygen demand. Rapid and/or excessive lowering of BP might reduce the oxygen supply. Exaggerated responses to anti-hypertensive therapy frequently occurs in these patients. HTN per se does not determine the revascularisation strategy in ACS patients. However, stabilising patients to facilitate prompt coronary reperfusion is important and this may influence the pace of reduction of BP.

There is conflicting evidence relating to the impact of admission BP on patient outcomes. Similarly, the benefits of a particular BP target in the immediate period following ACS are uncertain. ESC guidelines recommend reducing SBP in patients with acute coronary events associated with HTN to < 140 mmHg. In patients with elevated BP with concomitant ACS, guidelines suggest decreasing MAP by 20–25% over 1–2 h, followed by a more gradual reduction, whilst preparing for emergency intervention. In any case reduction of DBP to < 70 mmHg is best avoided. AHA/ ACC guidelines propose treating patients with ACS and HTN with esmolol/ labetalol, ACEi and/or nitro-glycerine. β blockers are contraindicated if moderate to severe pulmonary oedema coexists. GTN used to relieve pain, should be avoided in patients with inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and right ventricular infarction. Esmolol or labetalol are second line treatments. Appropriate β blockade helps reduce DBP and tachycardia, and thus myocardial oxygen demand. Nicardipine has been used safely in patients in whom β blockers are contraindicated. However, the exact benefit is yet to be outlined as some CCBs may be negatively inotropic and there have been concerns about increased mortality with the routine use of dihydropyridines. Sodium nitroprusside is avoided as a first-line agent as it can cause coronary steal by decrease regional blood flow and worsening myocardial ischaemia secondary to differential vasodilation. BP management should not delay emergency management of ACS itself.

ACEi/ ARB, and β blocker along with anti-platelet therapy and statins form part of the secondary prevention strategy (Table 10).

Materials and methods

Patient selection

COPD patients who were intubated and mechanically ventilated because of acute decompensation in the intensive care unit of the Evangelismos Hospital, Athens, Greece, were considered eligible for the study. COPD was diagnosed on the basis of clinical history, blood gases, chest radiographic findings, and previous pulmonary function tests and hospital admissions. The appropriate institutional ethics committee approved the study, and informed written consent was obtained from each patient's close relative.

Inclusion criteria for study entry were the following: (a) The underlying cause of acute decompensation of COPD had resolved, and the primary physician had considered the patients ready to wean by performing spontaneous breathing trials. Criteria used in our institution for not attempting such spontaneous breathing trials are similar to those of others: known or suspected increased intracranial pressure, unstable coronary artery disease, heart rate of at least 120 beats per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure of greater than 5 cm H 2 O, pulse oximetric measurement of arterial oxygen saturation of less than 92%, fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (FiO 2) of greater than 0.6, infusion of neuromuscular blocking drugs within the preceding 3 days, absent cough and gag reflex, or unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli. (b) Patients were difficult to wean; that is, they had failed at least three consecutive spontaneous breathing trials. (c) During spontaneous breathing trial failure, patients presented respiratory distress and systemic arterial hypertension, defined as systolic arterial blood pressure of at least 140 mm Hg. (d) Systemic and pulmonary artery catheters inserted by the patients' physicians as part of patient management to support the weaning process were present. Exclusion criteria were previous home care ventilation, unconsciousness or need for sedation, and occurrence of an unstable coronary episode (acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina) and/or prior nitroglycerin use during current intensive care unit admission/stay. All consecutive patients fulfilling the criteria between January 2002 and February 2007 were included in the study. During this period, 52 patients with acute COPD decompensation requiring invasive mechanical ventilation were admitted to our center (2.6% of total admissions). Of these patients, 22 (42.3%) were difficult to wean, but only 12 patients fulfilled the criteria as 2 patients did not exhibit systemic arterial hypertension during spontaneous breathing trial failure, 2 patients had received nitroglycerin because of a coronary episode, and 6 patients did not have a pulmonary artery catheter in place during weaning. During the study, a physician not involved in the protocol was present to provide patient care.

### Chest pain relief by nitroglycerin does not predict active coronary artery disease [^114nKjW6]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The belief that chest pain relief with nitroglycerin indicates the presence of active coronary artery disease is common. However, this hypothesis has not been tested.

Objective

To define the diagnostic and prognostic value of chest pain relief with nitroglycerin.

Design

Prospective observational cohort study.

Setting

Urban community teaching hospital.

Patients

459 consecutive patients with chest pain admitted through the emergency department who received nitroglycerin from emergency services personnel or an emergency department nurse. Follow-up was obtained by telephone contact at 4 months.

Measurements

Chest pain relief was defined as a decrease of at least 50% in patients' self-reported pain within 5 minutes of the initial dose of sublingual or spray nitroglycerin. Active coronary artery disease was defined as any elevated serum enzyme levels, coronary angiography demonstrating a 70% or greater stenosis, or a positive exercise test result.

Results

Nitroglycerin relieved chest pain in 39% of patients (181 of 459). In patients with active coronary artery disease as the likely cause of their chest pain, 35% (49 of 141) had chest pain relief with nitroglycerin. In contrast, in patients without active coronary artery disease, 41% (113 of 275) had chest pain relief (P > 0.2). Four-month clinical outcomes were similar in patients with or without chest pain relief with nitroglycerin (P > 0.2).

Conclusions

These data suggest that, in a general population admitted for chest pain, relief of pain after nitroglycerin treatment does not predict active coronary artery disease and should not be used to guide diagnosis.

Intravenous antihypertensive drugs for hypertensive emergencies — selected comorbidities and key directives: For acute aortic dissection, preferred drugs are esmolol and labetalol and management requires rapid lowering of SBP to ≤ 120 mm Hg with beta blockade preceding vasodilator administration if needed; SBP ≤ 120 mm Hg should be achieved within 20 min. For acute pulmonary edema, preferred drugs are clevidipine, nitroglycerin, and nitroprusside, and beta blockers are contraindicated.

### Nitroglycerin (Nitro-dur) [^1157sD89]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined.

Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentrations that are continuously greater than a minimally effective concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the antianginal efficacy of continuously delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were indistinguishable from placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates have been absent from the body for several hours has their antianginal efficacy been restored.

Additional information

In a pilot trial, 15 patients recruited within 7 days of symptom onset, with > 20% diffusion – perfusion mismatch on MRI and quantifiable, stable or worsening of aphasia, hemispatial neglect and/or hemiparesis were randomly assigned to induced hypertension with phenylephrine or control. There was more improvement in NIHSS scores in the induced hypertension group compared to the control group on day 3 and on day 90. Since functional outcome was not assessed with mRS at 90 days the study was not included in our meta-analysis.

The Early Manipulation of Arterial Blood Pressure in Acute Ischaemic Stroke (MAPAS) trial randomised 218 patients within 12 hours of acute ischaemic stroke to maintain systolic blood pressure during 24 hours within three ranges; Group 1: SBP target 140–160 mm Hg, Group 2: SBP target 161–180 mm Hg, and Group 3: SBP target 181–200 mm Hg. Overall, systolic blood pressure was increased in 41% of the patients. Norepinephrine was used to increase blood pressure in 17% of patients in Group 1, 48% of patients in Group 2 and 62% of patients in Group 3. There was no difference between the groups in functional outcome at 90 days. Adverse events (acute coronary syndrome and bradycardia) were limited to group 2 (4%) and Group 3 (7.6%) and were associated with norepinephrine infusion. There was also a significantly higher sICH rate in Group 3.

In addition, observational data from small pilot studies indicate that phenylephrine induced hypertension may be associated with neurological improvement in patients with AIS due to large artery atherosclerotic steno-occlusive disease or small vessel occlusion. –

Expert consensus statement

In patients with acute ischaemic stroke not treated with reperfusion therapies (intravenous thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy) and with clinical deterioration where a haemodynamic mechanism is suspected or shown to be directly responsible for the deterioration, we suggest:

- stopping existing blood pressure lowering therapy,

- administering intravenous fluids and

- introducing non-pharmacological procedures to raise blood pressure

before considering

- careful use of vasopressor agents to increase blood pressure with close monitoring of blood pressure values. Vote 10 of 10.

### Is it time to retire the diagnosis "Hypertensive emergency"? [^1159bcEu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Acute Coronary Syndromes

According to hypertension guidelines, unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction are traditionally listed as criteria to diagnose a hypertensive emergency. Unlike the detailed recommendations for managing high BP in patients with stroke, the hypertension guidelines superficially address BP management in patients with acute cardiac ischemia.

There are no clinical trials of major cardiovascular outcomes assessing the benefits of different strategies to reduce BP in the context of acute coronary syndromes. Differently from guidelines for hypertension, guidelines for acute coronary syndromes focus on revascularization therapies, which are firmly based on the results of randomized clinical trials and do not include BP in the flow charts and algorithms for the management.

Physicians are more often concerned with low BP values in patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes, which can signal incipient cardiogenic shock. High BP is usually secondary to pain (reversal causality), particularly in patients with previous hypertension, and is evidence of preserved cardiac output. These patients are treated with nitrates, drugs that have a BP‐lowering effect as one of their mechanisms to reduce myocardial ischemia, while the procedures to promote coronary reperfusion are prepared.

Nine-hundred and forty-seven patients who underwent PCI for ACS were examined and classified into two groups: those who were treated with GTN before PCI (GTN group) and those who were not (non-GTN group). The incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), which consist of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke and rehospitalisation for heart failure at 1 year, was compared between the two groups.

Results

This study identified 289 patients with ACS who used GTN preceding PCI. Pre-PCI systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in the GTN group than in the non-GTN group (median (IQR); 132.0 (110.0–143.5) mm Hg vs 134.0 (112.0–157.0) mm Hg, respectively, p = 0.03). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that GTN use preceding PCI showed an independent association with the incidence of MACE (HR 1.57; 95% CI 1.09–2.28; p = 0.016). Overall, the incidence of MACE 1 year after PCI for ACS was significantly higher in the GTN group than in the non-GTN group (log-rank test, p = 0.024); however, this trend was consistently found in elderly patients aged ≥ 75 years (p = 0.002) but not in non-elderly patients aged < 75 years (p = 0.773).

Conclusions

GTN use preceding PCI for ACS is associated with lower blood pressure and adverse clinical outcomes in elderly patients.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Tolerance: Excessive use may lead to tolerance. (5.1)

Hypotension: Severe hypotension may occur. (5.2)

5.1 Tolerance

Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest number of doses required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

5.2 Hypotension

Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur even with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses.

5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy

Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.

5.4 Headache

Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persistent but usually subside with continued use.

The benefits of nitroglycerin are numerous, from ensuring accurate interpretation of diagnostic angiograms to treatment of coronary spasm and support of PCIs in simple or complex lesion types. The founders of the field were convinced that no coronary arteriography should be considered complete unless a vasodilator is used at some point during the study. This recommendation is valid. The guidelines should change to include administration of intracoronary nitroglycerin.

WARNINGS:

Amplification of the vasodilatory effects of nitroglycerin by sildenafil can result in severe hypotension. The time course and dose dependence of this interaction have not been studied. Appropriate supportive care has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion.

The benefits of transdermal nitroglycerin in patients with acute myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure have not been established. If one elects to use nitroglycerin in these conditions, careful clinical or hemodynamic monitoring must be used to avoid the hazards of hypotension and tachycardia.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and consequent dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood and decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, systolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined.

Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentrations that are continuously greater than a minimally effective concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the antianginal efficacy of continuously-delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were indistinguishable from placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome nitrate tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates had been absent from the body for several hours was their antianginal efficacy restored.

2.5 Data extraction

Using a pre‐tested extraction sheet, four reviewers (M. A. M. A. A. M.G. and S.S.) independently extracted the following data from the included articles: study characteristics (first author name, year of publication, country, study design, total participants, catheterization indication, nitroglycerin's dose, route of administration, and time of administration; any adjuvant drug's dose, route of administration, and time of administration; method of radial artery occlusion assessment); baseline information (age, sex, height, weight, basal metabolic index, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and acute coronary syndrome); efficacy outcomes data (incidence of RAS, RAO, radial artery diameter, procedure time, and radial artery puncture attempts); safety outcomes data (hematoma, residual arm pain, hand ischemia, hypotension, and headache). Conflicts were resolved through discussion.

2.6 Risk of bias and quality assessment

Four reviewers (M. A. M. A. A. M.G. and S.S.) independently assessed the included studies for the risk of bias (ROB) using The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias in randomized trials, based on the following domains: random sequence generation (selection bias), allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias), blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective reporting (reporting bias), and other potential sources of bias. Conflicts were resolved by discussion. Two reviewers (M. A. A. and M.G.) used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group recommendation, for quality of evidence assessment. We considered inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, publication bias, and risk of bias. Our conclusions on the quality of evidence were justified, recorded, and included in the results reporting for each outcome. A third reviewer (M.T.) resolved any conflicts.

Intravenous vasodilators in acute decompensated heart failure — use is primarily symptomatic and limited by tolerance and toxicity. The role for direct vasodilators in acute decompensated HF remains uncertain, and patients with hypertension, coronary ischemia, or significant MR may be suitable candidates for the use of intravenous nitroglycerin. Tachyphylaxis may develop within 24 hours, and up to 20% of those with HF may develop resistance to even high doses. Because of sodium nitroprusside's potential for producing marked hypotension, invasive hemodynamic blood pressure monitoring (eg, an arterial line) is typically required, and nitroprusside is usually used in the intensive care setting; longer infusions have been associated, albeit rarely, with thiocyanate and cyanide toxicity. Overall, there are no data that suggest that intravenous vasodilators improve outcomes in the patient hospitalized with HF; as such, use is limited to the relief of dyspnea in the hospitalized HF patient with intact or high blood pressure.

### Atenolol (Tenormin) [^113QYP15]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

TENORMIN may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

Angina Pectoris Due to Coronary Atherosclerosis

TENORMIN is indicated for the long-term management of patients with angina pectoris.

Acute Myocardial Infarction

TENORMIN is indicated in the management of hemodynamically stable patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction to reduce cardiovascular mortality. Treatment can be initiated as soon as the patient's clinical condition allows. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, CONTRAINDICATIONS, and WARNINGS .) In general, there is no basis for treating patients like those who were excluded from the ISIS-1 trial (blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg systolic, heart rate less than 50 bpm) or have other reasons to avoid beta blockade. As noted above, some subgroups (e.g., elderly patients with systolic blood pressure below 120 mm Hg) seemed less likely to benefit.

### What is the optimal blood pressure in patients after acute coronary syndromes? relationship of blood pressure and cardiovascular events in the PRavastatin OR atorVastatin evaluation and infection therapy-thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (PROVE IT-TIMI) 22 trial [^112B51Mj]. Circulation (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Aggressive blood pressure (BP) control has been advocated in patients with acute coronary syndrome, but few data exist in this population relative to cardiovascular outcomes.

Methods and Results

We evaluated 4162 patients enrolled in the PRavastatin Or atorVastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (PROVE IT-TIMI) 22 trial (acute coronary syndrome patients randomized to pravastatin 40 mg versus atorvastatin 80 mg). The average follow-up BP (systolic and diastolic) was categorized into 10-mm Hg increments. The primary outcome was a composite of death due to any cause, myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring rehospitalization, revascularization after 30 days, and stroke. The secondary outcome was a composite of death due to coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or revascularization. The relationship between BP (systolic or diastolic) followed a J- or U-shaped curve association with primary, secondary, and individual outcomes, with increased events rates at both low and high BP values, both unadjusted and after adjustment for baseline variables, baseline C-reactive protein, and on-treatment average levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. A nonlinear Cox proportional hazards model showed a nadir of 136/85 mm Hg (range 130 to 140 mm Hg systolic and 80 to 90 mm Hg diastolic) at which the incidence of primary outcome was lowest. The curve was relatively flat for systolic pressures of 110 to 130 mm Hg and diastolic pressures of 70 to 90 mm Hg.

Conclusions

After acute coronary syndrome, a J- or U-shaped curve association existed between BP and the risk of future cardiovascular events, with lowest event rates in the BP range of approximately 130 to 140 mm Hg systolic and 80 to 90 mm Hg diastolic and a relatively flat curve for systolic pressures of 110 to 130 mm Hg and diastolic pressures of 70 to 90 mm Hg, which suggests that too low of a pressure (especially < 110/70 mm Hg) may be dangerous.

### Safety of intravenous nitroglycerin after administration of sildenafil citrate to men with coronary artery disease: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover trial [^115YBP7t]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Although contraindicated, there are situations when a patient who has recently taken a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (e.g., sildenafil) might need intravenous nitroglycerin (NTG) treatment. This study determined if, and at what dose, intravenous NTG could be administered safely to men with coronary artery disease who had recently ingested sildenafil.

Design

Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover trial.

Setting

Four clinical practice sites in Canada, Scotland, and the United States.

Patients

A total of 34 men (≥ 35 yrs) with a history of angina pectoris and coronary artery disease (> 50% stenosis of at least one coronary artery), most of whom were taking antihypertensives.

Interventions

Sildenafil (100 mg) or placebo (single dose; crossover after 3–7 days) followed 45 mins later by escalating doses of intravenous NTG (160 microg/min maximum).

Measurements and Main Results

After sildenafil, there were slightly greater maximum (supine) blood pressure decreases and heart rate increases (e.g., 4 to 6 mm Hg [systolic] and ≤ 1 beat/min, at NTG doses of ≤ 80 microg/min) than after placebo. The median maximum tolerated NTG dose (range) was 80 (0–160) microg/min for sildenafil vs. 160 (20–160) microg/min for placebo (adjusted mean ± se, 77 ± 7 vs. 127 ± 7; p < .0001; analysis of variance), and NTG 160 microg/min was tolerated by eight (25%) and 19 (59%) men, respectively (p = .0008). Treatment-related adverse events were mostly mild/moderate hypotension, headache, and dizziness, which are often associated with NTG alone. Sildenafil and metabolite plasma concentrations were lower than previously reported in healthy men.

Conclusions

With close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate, men with stable coronary artery disease who have taken sildenafil may tolerate intravenous NTG (≤ 160 microg/min) with low starting dosage and gradual upward titration. The hemodynamic response might be different in subgroups not specifically examined in the study (e.g., men presenting with acute coronary symptoms). The explanation for the lower than expected plasma concentrations remains uncertain.

### Sublingual nitroglycerin administration in coronary computed tomography angiography: a systematic review [^111deps5]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) has become a useful tool for the exclusion of significant coronary artery disease (CAD). CT allows for image acquisition with high spatial and temporal resolution. Nonetheless, it can be challenging to visualize coronary branches with a small diameter. In clinical practice, nitroglycerin is applied for rapid coronary vasodilation, without causing significant changes in heart rate or blood pressure. Nitroglycerin generates nitric oxide, which initiates smooth muscle relaxation independent of endothelial function. Nitroglycerin also reduces the likelihood of coronary artery vasospasm. Nitroglycerin is widely administered to alleviate angina pectoris and has a half-life of about 5 minutes. Sublingual spray is the preferred method of administration since it is the most efficacious and is associated with fewer side effects. In acute myocardial infarction, sublingual nitroglycerin rapidly relieves pulmonary congestion and decreases myocardial oxygen consumption, although administration might result in a decline in cardiac output. Headache and dizziness are most frequently associated with the use of nitrates. Headaches following the use of sublingual nitroglycerin are fairly common, but are generally short-lasting and self-limiting. Dizziness is typically the result of nitroglycerin-induced hypotension. More serious side effects can occur in patients with diminished cardiac output/severe hypotension, in patients with increased intracranial pressure or patients using phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Feldman et al. demonstrated in invasive coronary angiography that small doses of nitroglycerin result in significant coronary artery and collateral dilatation, without significant changes in heart rate and blood pressure. The administration of nitrates was recommended for conventional coronary angiography by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) in 1999, because it allowed for reliable assessment of coronary stenosis degree. Subsequently, sublingual nitroglycerin has been routinely used to dilate coronary arteries in CCTA examinations to optimize visualization of the coronary artery lumen and thus improve stenosis assessment.

Multiple studies evaluated the use of sublingual nitroglycerin in CCTA, however the evidence has not been systematically reviewed. This systematic review intended to summarize the current evidence on the effects of sublingual nitroglycerin on coronary diameter, the number of evaluable segments, image quality, heart rate and blood pressure, and diagnostic accuracy of CCTA.

### Nitroglycerin use and adverse clinical outcomes in elderly patients with acute coronary syndrome [^114hA6b8]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

The latest guidelines from the Japanese Circulation Society, European Society of Cardiologyand American College of Cardiology/American Heart Associationrecommend the administration of nitrates in the primary management for ACS, except in cases with contraindications such as marked hypotension, bradycardia and complicated right ventricular infarction. However, as Ekmejian et al recently described, these guidelines rely on the results from the GISSI-3and ISIS-4 studyconducted more than 30 years ago when the treatment of ACS and the demographics of patients with ACS were significantly different from the current situation. Moreover, the results of these studies did not fully support the strong recommendations for the use of GTN for ACS. The percentage of patients with ACS undergoing primary PCI followed by OMT has increased markedly over the past 30 years, and these multidisciplinary treatments have significantly suppressed the development and progression of heart failure and the recurrence of ischaemic events. Additionally, the recent promotion of timely reperfusion after the onset of ST-elevation myocardial infarction includes shortening the D2B time to less than 90 min. Our hospital data also indicated that the D2B time was 73 min, meeting the goal stated in the guidelines. All of these initiatives help preserve cardiac function after ACS, resulting in that the haemodynamically beneficial effect of GTN in the acute phase, might have become relatively limited and less apparent compared with the era without widespread PCI and OMT.

The concerns regarding the safety of GTN use for ACS might have been relatively increased because the number and proportion of elderly patients with ACS increased, and elderly patients are more prone to hypotension after GTN administration. This study also confirmed that the GTN group showed less pre-PCI systolic blood pressure than the non-GTN group among elderly patients. Elderly patients 75 or more years of age account for 30%–40% of all hospitalised patients with ACS, and the incidence of ACS-associated death is also mainly observed in this age group. Similarly, this study included approximately 40% of patients aged 75 or more years, and the trend of outcomes for the study population as a whole and those in this age group were nearly identical. These findings suggest that the incidence of clinical events occurs mainly in elderly patients, which is similar to previous reports. Hence, optimisation of primary management for elderly patients with ACS is required, and the pros and cons of GTN use should be debated and examined separately for elderly and non-elderly patients.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Angina pectoris — recommendation-specific supportive text — notes that angina pectoris is perceived as a retrosternal chest discomfort that builds gradually in intensity (over several minutes), is usually precipitated by stress (physical or emotional) or occurring at rest (as in the case of an ACS) with characteristic radiation (eg, left arm, neck, jaw) and its associated symptoms (eg, dyspnea, nausea, lightheadedness). When actively treated or spontaneously resolving, it dissipates over a few minutes. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion, and associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, lightheadedness, confusion, presyncope or syncope, or vague abdominal symptoms are more common among patients with diabetes, women, and the elderly. A detailed assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, review of systems, past medical history, and family and social history should complement the assessment of presenting symptoms.

Nitrates in acute heart failure — In a Class II, prospective, randomized, unblinded study, high-dose nitrates "3 mg IV isosorbide dinitrate every 5 minutes" with low-dose furosemide "40 mg IV" were "a more effective treatment regimen" than low-dose nitrates "1 mg/hour IV isosorbide dinitrate" with high-dose furosemide "80 mg IV every 15 minutes", in "104 patients", with "significantly fewer myocardial infarctions (3% versus 17%)".

### Nitroglycerin (nitroMist) [^1149GrTL]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

7.1 PDE5 Inhibitors

Administration of NitroMist is contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates. Do not use NitroMist in patients who are taking the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator riociguat. Concomitant use may result in severe hypotension, syncope, or myocardial ischemia.

The time course and dose dependence of this interaction have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another cannot be recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion. The use of any form of nitroglycerin during the early days of acute myocardial infarction requires particular attention to hemodynamic monitoring and clinical status.

7.2 Antihypertensives

Patients receiving antihypertensive drugs, beta-adrenergic blockers, and nitrates should be observed for possible additive hypotensive effects. Marked orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used concomitantly.

Labetolol blunts the reflex tachycardia produced by nitroglycerin without preventing its hypotensive effects. If labetolol is used with nitroglycerin in patients with angina pectoris, additional hypotensive effects may occur.

7.3 Aspirin

Coadministration of aspirin and nitroglycerin has been reported to result in increased nitroglycerin maximum concentrations by as much as 67% and AUC by 73% when administered as a single dose. The vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin may be enhanced by concomitant administration of aspirin.

7.4 Tissue-type Plasminogen Activator (t-PA)

Intravenous administration of nitroglycerin decreases the thrombolytic effect of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). Plasma levels of t-PA are reduced when coadministered with nitroglycerin. Therefore, caution should be observed in patients receiving nitroglycerin during t-PA therapy.

7.5 Heparin

Intravenous nitroglycerin reduces the anticoagulant effect of heparin. Activated partial thromboplastin times (APTT) should be monitored in patients receiving heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin. It is not known if this effect occurs following single nitroglycerin doses.

### Nitroglycerin (Nitro-bid) [^111Ncb2c]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Hemodynamic Effects: The ill effects of nitroglycerin overdose are generally the results of nitroglycerin's capacity to induce vasodilation, venous pooling, reduced cardiac output, and hypotension. These hemodynamic changes may have protean manifestations, including increased intracranial pressure, with any or all of persistent throbbing headache, confusion, and moderate fever; vertigo; palpitations; visual disturbances; nausea and vomiting (possibly with colic and even bloody diarrhea); syncope (especially in the upright posture); air hunger and dyspnea, later followed by reduced ventilatory effort; diaphoresis, with the skin either flushed or cold and clammy; heart block and bradycardia; paralysis; coma; seizures; and death.

Laboratory determinations of serum levels of nitroglycerin and its metabolites are not widely available, and such determinations have, in any event, no established role in the management of nitroglycerin overdose.

No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers (e.g., maneuvers to change the pH of the urine) that might accelerate elimination of nitroglycerin and its active metabolites. Similarly, it is not known which — if any — of these substances can usefully be removed from the body by hemodialysis.

No specific antagonist to the vasodilator effects of nitroglycerin is known, and no intervention has been subject to controlled study as a therapy of nitroglycerin overdose. Because the hypotension associated with nitroglycerin overdose is the result of venodilatation and arterial hypovolemia, prudent therapy in this situation should be directed toward increase in central fluid volume. Passive elevation of the patient's legs may be sufficient, but intravenous infusion of normal saline or similar fluid may also be necessary.

The use of epinephrine or the arterial vasoconstrictors in this setting is likely to do more harm than good.

In patients with renal disease or congestive heart failure, therapy resulting in central volume expansion is not without hazard. Treatment of nitroglycerin overdose in these patients may be subtle and difficult, and invasive monitoring may be required.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

5.1 Tolerance

Excessive use may lead to the development of tolerance. Only the smallest dose required for effective relief of the acute angina attack should be used. A decrease in therapeutic effect of sublingual nitroglycerin may result from use of long-acting nitrates.

5.2 Hypotension

Severe hypotension, particularly with upright posture, may occur with small doses of nitroglycerin particularly in patients with constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, patients who may be volume-depleted, or are already hypotensive. Hypotension induced by nitroglycerin may be accompanied by paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris. Symptoms of severe hypotension (nausea, vomiting, weakness, pallor, perspiration and collapse/syncope) may occur even with therapeutic doses.

5.3 Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy

Nitrate therapy may aggravate the angina caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

5.4 Headache

Nitroglycerin produces dose-related headaches, especially at the start of nitroglycerin therapy, which may be severe and persist but usually subside with continued use.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

- **Tolerance**: Excessive use may lead to tolerance. (5.1)

- **Hypotension**: Severe hypotension may occur. (5.2)

### Nitroglycerin use and adverse clinical outcomes in elderly patients with acute coronary syndrome [^112PtuVG]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

The in-hospital and 1-year mortality among patients with ACS can be effectively estimated and identified by the GRACE score, which consists of eight items, including age and systolic blood pressure. The results of our study indicated a higher incidence of MACE in the GTN rather than the non-GTN group among elderly patients but not among non-elderly patients. Although this study lacks the GRACE score, poor outcomes in the elderly GTN group might be explained partly by risk elevation owing to the accumulation of older age and less systolic blood pressure. Potential mechanisms by which GTN use influences outcomes in elderly patients might include the pronounced blood pressure-lowering effect of GTN via vasomotor instability specific to the elderly population. A future study on whether the risk stratification score incorporating 'GTN use before primary PCI' can be developed in patients with ACS may be required.

This study had several limitations. First, the study was a single-centre cohort. Since the PCI strategy directly influences the incidence of MACE, generalising these single-centre results beyond strategical differences requires multicentre validation. Second, the results do not allow us to simply conclude that GTN use preceding primary PCI causally decreases blood pressure on admission and worsens clinical outcomes. There might be potential undetermined cofounders that influenced the present results; therefore, prospective randomised interventional studies to test the efficacy of GTN on clinical outcomes in ACS patients are warranted. Third, this study failed to show data on the time from the onset of chest symptoms to the use of GTN. Although there was no difference in peak CK elevation or LVEF between the GTN and non-GTN groups, the treatment, including GTN administration itself, might have prolonged the time until primary PCI from symptom onset. Finally, patients with ACS presenting with severe symptoms of chest pain might be more likely to be treated with GTN, suggesting that GTN use may be a marker for more severe ischaemia or more compromised patients. The clinical data regarding coronary severity included in this study (eg, the prevalence of multivessel disease) were compared between the GTN and non-GTN groups, but none showed a clear difference. However, if a more detailed and quantitative coronary severity grading system, such as the SYNTAX score, could have been incorporated into this study, potential confounding factors affecting outcomes in the GTN and non-GTN groups might have been identified.

PCI procedures and pre-PCI and post-PCI medical management

All patients received aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel or prasugrel) in accordance with ACS treatment guidelines. Specifically, a P2Y12 inhibitor was administered after the decision to perform emergency PCI based on coronary angiography results. Also, weight-adjusted intravenous heparin was administered before primary PCI (online supplemental methods S3). Coronary angiography and subsequent PCI were performed according to standard practice, and the culprit lesions requiring urgent revascularisation were determined by angiography in conjunction with electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings. The door-to-balloon (D2B) time was measured from admission to achieving coronary reperfusion, and the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grades were evaluated before and after PCI. Successful reperfusion was defined as the confirmation of TIMI 3 flow on angiography. The indications for emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) included the following: (1) the presence of active ischaemia with contraindications for PCI; (2) successful PCI of the culprit lesion and further indication for CABG and (3) incomplete, insufficient or failed PCI. Patients with haemodynamic compromise refractory to medical treatment and revascularisation for ACS were treated with cardiac and respiratory assist devices, including intra-aortic balloon pumping, venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, temporary pacing, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation and mechanical ventilation with endotracheal intubation, as appropriate. All patients undergoing primary PCI for ACS were treated in the coronary care unit. In detail, OMT was timely initiated, and cardiac monitoring, including peak creatine kinase (CK) assessment, electrocardiography and echocardiography, was performed. Additionally, a cardiac rehabilitation programme was appropriately provided as soon as possible after risk assessment for the development of acute complications after ACS in accordance with cardiac rehabilitation guidelines.

Clinical outcomes

Clinical follow-up information was obtained from medical records and/or telephone interviews with patients or their families. The primary outcome was the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) within 1 year, defined as a composite of all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and rehospitalisation for heart failure. The secondary outcome was stroke and target lesion revascularisation (TLR) after stent implantation at the 1-year follow-up. TLR was defined according to the Academic Research Consortium criteria.

Epicardial vasospasm as a nonatherosclerotic cause of STEMI — recognition and management: Abnormal vasoconstriction sometimes precipitated by a pharmacologic substance and/or emotional stress can lead to transient occlusion of 1 or more epicardial coronary arteries with accompanying ST elevation, and epicardial coronary artery spasm is an uncommon but important nonatherosclerotic mechanism of acute STEMI. The threshold for suspecting coronary artery vasospasm should be especially high in younger patients (< 50 years of age) who do not have cardiac risk factors when diffuse disease is seen on coronary angiography. Irrespective of the suspicion of spasm, unless hemodynamically contraindicated, intracoronary nitroglycerin is useful in patients with an acute STEMI at the time of coronary angiography, helping identify and treat spasm and facilitating accurate assessment of vessel diameter. Patients with myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) and suspected epicardial coronary artery spasm may be referred for comprehensive evaluation with intracoronary acetylcholine provocation in the elective setting, and patients with epicardial coronary vasospasm are best managed with vasodilators such as nitrates or calcium channel blockers.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of action

Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO), which activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an increase of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and other tissues. This eventually leads to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulates the contractile state in smooth muscle and results in vasodilatation.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of the postcapillary vessels, including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial pressure (after load), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear.

Therapeutic doses of nitroglycerin may reduce systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure. Effective coronary perfusion pressure is usually maintained, but can be compromised if blood pressure falls excessively or increased heart rate decreases diastolic filling time.

### Nitrates for acute heart failure syndromes [^112fWFgK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Current drug therapy for acute heart failure syndromes (AHFS) consists mainly of diuretics supplemented by vasodilators or inotropes. Nitrates have been used as vasodilators in AHFS for many years and have been shown to improve some aspects of AHFS in some small studies. The aim of this review was to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of nitrate vasodilators in AHFS.

Objectives

To quantify the effect of different nitrate preparations (isosorbide dinitrate and nitroglycerin) and the effect of route of administration of nitrates on clinical outcome, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of nitrates in the management of AHFS.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1950 to July week 2 2011) and EMBASE (1980 to week 28 2011). We searched the Current Controlled Trials MetaRegister of Clinical Trials (compiled by Current Science) (July 2011). We checked the reference lists of trials and contacted trial authors. We imposed no language restriction.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing nitrates (isosorbide dinitrate and nitroglycerin) with alternative interventions (frusemide and morphine, frusemide alone, hydralazine, prenalterol, intravenous nesiritide and placebo) in the management of AHFS in adults aged 18 and over.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently performed data extraction. Two authors performed trial quality assessment. We used mean difference (MD), odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to measure effect sizes. Two authors independently assessed and rated the methodological quality of each trial using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias.

Main Results

Four studies (634 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Two of the included studies included only patients with AHFS following acute myocardial infarction (AMI); one study excluded patients with overt AMI; and one study included participants with AHFS with and without acute coronary syndromes. Based on a single study, there was no significant difference in the rapidity of symptom relief between intravenous nitroglycerin/N-acetylcysteine and intravenous frusemide/morphine after 30 minutes (fixed-effect MD -0.30, 95% CI -0.65 to 0.05), 60 minutes (fixed-effect MD -0.20, 95% CI -0.65 to 0.25), three hours (fixed-effect MD 0.20, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.67) and 24 hours (fixed-effect MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.31). There is no evidence to support a difference in AHFS patients receiving intravenous nitrate vasodilator therapy or alternative interventions with regard to the following outcome measures: requirement for mechanical ventilation, systolic blood pressure (SBP) change after three hours and 24 hours, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) change after 30, 60 and 90 minutes, heart rate change at 30 minutes, 60 minutes, three hours and 24 hours, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) change after three hours and 18 hours, cardiac output (CO) change at 90 minutes and three hours and progression to myocardial infarction. There is a significantly higher incidence of adverse events after three hours with nitroglycerin compared with placebo (odds ratio 2.29, 95% CI 1.26 to 4.16) based on a single study. There was no consistent evidence to support a difference in AHFS patients receiving intravenous nitrate vasodilator therapy or alternative interventions with regard to the following secondary outcome measures: SBP change after 30 and 60 minutes, heart rate change after 90 minutes, and PAOP change after 90 minutes. None of the included studies reported healthcare costs as an outcome measure. There were no data reported by any of the studies relating to the acceptability of the treatment to the patients (patient satisfaction scores). Overall there was a paucity of relevant quality data in the included studies. Assessment of overall risk of bias in these studies was limited as three of the studies did not give sufficient detail to allow assessment of potential risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

There appears to be no significant difference between nitrate vasodilator therapy and alternative interventions in the treatment of AHFS, with regard to symptom relief and haemodynamic variables. Nitrates may be associated with a lower incidence of adverse effects after three hours compared with placebo. However, there is a lack of data to draw any firm conclusions concerning the use of nitrates in AHFS because current evidence is based on few low-quality studies.
