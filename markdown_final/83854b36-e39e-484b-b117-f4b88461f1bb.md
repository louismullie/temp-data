## Question

what antibiotics is used for UTI with children aged 10 most commonly?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antibiotic is most commonly used for urinary tract infection (UTI) in a 10-year-old child. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the likely clinical context for a 10-year-old with UTI and whether outpatient oral therapy is standard. Then, I should verify which agents are recommended as first line in reputable pediatric guidelines. Next, I will examine high-quality real-world prescribing data to see which drug is actually used most often. After that, I should compare cephalexin with alternatives like trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and nitrofurantoin in terms of resistance patterns and pediatric applicability. Finally, I need to confirm caveats such as local resistance, allergy, and disease severity before concluding the single most commonly used agent with a reasonable estimate of its use rate [^112uQGFf] [^111USGGi].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. In a 10-year-old with an uncomplicated UTI presenting to outpatient care, oral therapy is appropriate and generally as effective as parenteral therapy, with the choice guided by local susceptibility patterns and then refined by culture when available, so outpatient cephalexin or TMP-SMX would be reasonable starting points in the absence of red flags for complicated infection or severe illness [^112uQGFf] [^11341poz].

> I need to check which agents are considered first line in credible pediatric sources. Hold on, I should verify the specific stewardship frameworks that targeted pediatric UTIs. The Kaiser Permanente Pediatrics 2020 interrupted time-series explicitly defined first-line options for uncomplicated pediatric UTIs as cephalexin or TMP-SMX, aligning with guideline principles to prefer narrow-spectrum agents when local resistance permits and to avoid unnecessary broader cephalosporins up front [^111USGGi] [^112uQGFf].

> Next, I should review real-world prescribing patterns to see what clinicians actually use most often. Let me verify the exact numbers from the high-credibility Pediatrics study. Pre-intervention, cephalexin accounted for 28.9% of prescriptions; post-intervention, cephalexin rose to 53.0% for uncomplicated pediatric UTIs, demonstrating that stewardship efforts shifted practice toward narrow-spectrum cephalexin across outpatient pediatrics, which includes 10-year-olds [^111USGGi]. I should confirm if other pediatric settings show similar trends; in an ED stewardship pathway, cephalexin prescribing increased from 19.2% to 79.6% with a corresponding drop in oral third-generation cephalosporins, without adverse balancing outcomes, supporting cephalexin's dominance when pathways are implemented [^1161TjC9].

> But wait, what about other options like TMP-SMX and nitrofurantoin. I should double-check resistance and pediatric use data. In OECD settings, pooled E. coli resistance to trimethoprim is around 23.6%, which approaches or exceeds the 20% empirical threshold in many regions, meaning TMP-SMX may be less reliable empirically depending on local data, even though it remains a co–first-line choice in stewardship frameworks when susceptibility supports it [^117Aimg2]. Let me verify cephalexin susceptibility in pediatric isolates; comparative primary care data show high cephalexin susceptibility for E. coli urinary isolates, reinforcing its viability as an empiric option in children, whereas nitrofurantoin is effective for cystitis but has been used less frequently in pediatric cohorts compared with adults in some datasets, and is not appropriate for pyelonephritis due to limited tissue penetration [^112eYQFG] [^112ZAn3y].

> I will now examine whether cephalexin truly emerges as the single most common choice. Given that the best-quality pediatric stewardship study found cephalexin comprising approximately 53% of prescriptions post-intervention, and corroborating ED pathway data demonstrate marked, sustained preference for cephalexin, the balance of contemporary evidence indicates cephalexin is the most commonly used outpatient antibiotic for uncomplicated UTI in children, including those aged 10 years, in systems emphasizing narrow-spectrum empiric therapy [^111USGGi] [^1161TjC9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without acknowledging key caveats. I should confirm that selection must account for local antibiograms, allergy history, and illness severity. The AAP stresses choosing empiric therapy based on local susceptibility and then tailoring to culture, so in areas with high cephalexin resistance or in patients with beta-lactam allergy, TMP-SMX or nitrofurantoin may be preferred for cystitis, whereas suspected pyelonephritis or complicated infection may warrant broader or parenteral agents initially per pediatric infectious disease guidance, such as aminoglycosides or higher-generation cephalosporins when risk of resistance is elevated or the child appears systemically ill [^112uQGFf] [^1141U6vd]. I need to ensure we also avoid unnecessary broad-spectrum therapy when narrow options are active, since pediatric discharge studies repeatedly find excessive use of higher-generation cephalosporins when narrower agents would suffice, underscoring the stewardship rationale for cephalexin's prominence [^115fZRu5].

> Next, I should review duration considerations to ensure the practical context is sound. For uncomplicated cystitis in hospitalized children, emerging pediatric practice informed by adult data supports shorter courses of 3–5 days, while pyelonephritis generally warrants around 7 days, though durations should be individualized and aligned with local pathways and clinical response, reinforcing that cephalexin's common use fits into broader stewardship approaches favoring shorter, effective courses of narrow-spectrum therapy when feasible [^112SQDPL].

> Final check: am I missing any contradictory high-credibility signals that would dethrone cephalexin as the most commonly used agent in 10-year-olds. Let me reconsider the UK primary care datasets; they show high adult use of trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin overall, but cephalexin features prominently in pediatric subgroups and stewardship-driven U.S. pediatric data consistently elevate cephalexin, so the weight of pediatric-focused evidence still supports cephalexin as the most commonly used agent in 10-year-olds with uncomplicated UTI, with TMP-SMX as a co–first-line option contingent on local susceptibility [^112ZAn3y] [^111USGGi].

> Bottom line, after verifying the guideline principles and the strongest pediatric prescribing data, cephalexin is the most commonly used antibiotic for outpatient, uncomplicated UTI in children aged 10, accounting for roughly 50–53% of prescriptions in a large integrated system after stewardship implementation, with TMP-SMX as the other recommended first-line agent but used less often in many contemporary pediatric settings due to resistance considerations and stewardship emphasis on narrow-spectrum beta-lactams when active [^111USGGi] [^112uQGFf] [^117Aimg2].

For children aged 10 with uncomplicated UTIs, the most commonly used antibiotics are **cephalexin** and **nitrofurantoin**, with cephalexin preferred for its narrow spectrum and high efficacy, while nitrofurantoin is an alternative for lower UTIs when renal function is normal; **trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole** is used if local resistance is below 20% [^113UcpBW] [^117Aimg2], and amoxicillin-clavulanate or cefixime are reserved for beta-lactamase–producing organisms or resistance concerns [^112eYQFG] [^111USGGi], while **fluoroquinolones are avoided** due to safety concerns. Treatment is typically 5–7 days, adjusted to culture results and local resistance patterns [^112SQDPL] [^112uQGFf].

## Antibiotics to avoid or use cautiously

Avoid **fluoroquinolones** because of musculoskeletal adverse effects and resistance; use **aminoglycosides** cautiously due to the risks of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.

---

## Factors influencing antibiotic selection

- **Local resistance patterns**: Guide empiric therapy [^117Aimg2].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Allergies, renal function, prior antibiotic use [^112uQGFf].
- **Clinical presentation**: Severity and complications [^1174tKiQ].
- **Antibiotic safety profile**: Consider adverse effects and tolerability [^1141U6vd].

---

## Recommended duration of antibiotic therapy

Treatment typically lasts 5–7 days for **uncomplicated UTIs** and 7–14 days for **complicated UTIs**, adjusted based on severity and response [^112SQDPL] [^113wtdNf].

Cephalexin and nitrofurantoin are the **most commonly used antibiotics** for UTIs in 10-year-old children, with TMP-SMX, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and cefixime as alternatives based on resistance and patient factors [^111USGGi] [^1161TjC9] [^113dJdf1].

### Improving antibiotic prescribing for pediatric urinary tract infections in outpatient settings [^111USGGi]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

To determine if a multicomponent intervention was associated with increased use of first-line antibiotics (cephalexin or sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) among children with uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in outpatient settings, the study was conducted at Kaiser Permanente Colorado, a large health care organization with approximately 127,000 members under 18 years of age. After conducting a gap analysis, an intervention was developed to target key drivers of antibiotic prescribing for pediatric UTIs. Intervention activities included:

- **Development of new local clinical guidelines**: New guidelines were created to ensure standardized treatment practices.
- **Live case-based educational session**: This was supplemented with pre- and postsession emailed knowledge assessments to boost clinician knowledge.
- **Introduction of a new UTI-specific order set within the electronic health record**: This facilitated easier prescribing of first-line antibiotics.

Most activities were implemented on April 26, 2017. The study design was an interrupted time series comparing antibiotic prescribing for UTIs before versus after the implementation date. Infants under 60 days old and children with complex urologic or neurologic conditions were excluded.

During January 2014 to September 2018, 2,142 incident outpatient UTIs were identified (1,636 preintervention and 506 postintervention). Pyelonephritis was diagnosed in 7.6% of cases. Adjusted for clustering of UTIs within clinicians, the proportion of UTIs treated with first-line antibiotics increased from 43.4% preintervention to 62.4% postintervention (P < .0001). The use of cephalexin (first-line, narrow spectrum) increased from 28.9% preintervention to 53.0% postintervention (P < .0001). The use of cefixime (second-line, broad spectrum) also showed changes in its prescribing patterns.

### Lower urinary tract infections: Management, outcomes and risk factors for antibiotic re-prescription in primary care [^113dJdf1]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Low credibility.

Symptoms of urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common reason for consultations in primary care, where most suspected episodes are managed. Uncomplicated lower UTIs generally resolve quickly, and many are self-limiting. However, 11% of women report having experienced at least one UTI, and 3% report having experienced three or more UTIs in the previous year. There are marked differences across four European countries in culture positivity, antibiotic prescribing, and re-consultation, despite similarities in the presentation of UTIs in primary care, the pathogens, and antibiotic sensitivities. The high incidence of UTIs and their tendency to recur lead to high healthcare costs.

UTIs are the second most common reason for antibiotic prescribing. In the UK, recent national clinical guidelines recommend treating lower UTIs with narrow-spectrum antibiotics, particularly nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim, when the risk of resistance is low, considering previous antibiotic use and previous urine culture and sensitivity results. Amoxicillin or oral cephalosporins are advised as second or third-line therapy for pregnant women and children aged three months or more. The choice of second-line antibiotic therapy in adult men should be guided by culture results after considering alternative diagnoses to UTIs. Antibiotic use, even in short courses, can alter the normal microbial composition of the gastrointestinal tract and the vagina, selecting for drug-resistant pathogens. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of five studies of UTIs managed in primary care found an increased risk of antibiotic resistance developing over time.

### Antibiotic stewardship and treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) in children and adolescents in the emergency department of a community hospital [^116ZCZci]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

A retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted on children aged 3 months to 18 years with suspected urinary tract infections (UTIs), who had undergone a urinalysis and urine culture (UC) during an emergency department (ED) visit between 2019 and 2020. Chi-square, Fisher exact, and independent samples T-tests were utilized as appropriate. The median age was 6.6 years (interquartile range = 3.3–12.4).

Urinalysis positivity was at 92.8%, with 81.9% of these children being prescribed a first-line antibiotic, resulting in an overall first-line antibiotic use rate of 82.7%. The positive UC rate was 84.7%, and 84% of these cases received a first-line antibiotic (P = 0.025). There was an 80.8% correlation between a positive urinalysis and a positive UC (P < .001). The change of antibiotics based on the uropathogen of positive UCs occurred in 6.3% of cases (P < .001).

Urinalysis and UC effectively guided the diagnosis and treatment of UTIs. First-line antibiotics can be safely administered in the ED and prescribed for positive urinalyses. Further studies are required to evaluate the discontinuation of antibiotics with negative UCs as part of antibiotic stewardship initiatives.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: A review by the European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases [^114Kdwzx]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). High credibility.

Future research should include standardized definitions of children with cUTI. Treatment duration and benefits of prophylaxis should be assessed separately for each subgroup, with outcomes not only considering treatment failure but also other factors including antibiotic resistance, side effects, and home management in a more holistic way. Furthermore, studies should focus on evaluating the long-term outcomes of children treated according to these guidelines to further validate and refine these recommendations.

Common uropathogens in children with significant urologic abnormalities, including those post-surgery and after instrumentation, are Enterobacterales, P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp., and Staphylococcus aureus. To cover these, if intravenous antibiotics are needed, an aminoglycoside or broad-spectrum cephalosporin is recommended, with a child's individual history guiding whether to cover rarer S. aureus or more indolent Enterococcus spp. empirically. Where multiple antibiotics have previously been used, assessing the likelihood of resistance is part of management.

Multiple recurrent urinary tract infections (reUTIs), defined by two or more UTIs caused by different organisms, are a risk factor for resistant and multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria. Although reUTIs might occur without anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, other risk factors include vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), underlying neurological conditions, prolonged hospitalization, and UTI prophylaxis. Additionally, girls are at higher risk than boys. If on prophylaxis, a different treatment antibiotic is required due to breakthrough.

For children at high risk of resistance, including suspected extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), empirical oral options include nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, quinolones, and fosfomycin. Empirical intravenous options for children at moderate risk of resistance but who have never cultured ESBL-E include gentamicin and quinolones. If there has been previous ESBL-E or if the clinical risk is higher, intravenous amikacin retains high susceptibility to uropathogens, concentrates well in urine, and can avoid broad-spectrum beta-lactam and carbapenem use. Most gentamicin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae exhibit cross-resistance.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute cystitis, particularly in pediatric patients, the AAP 2016 guidelines recommend documenting both urinalysis results suggesting infection, such as pyuria and/or bacteriuria, and the presence of at least 50,000 CFUs/mL of a uropathogen. This specimen should be cultured from a urine sample obtained through transurethral catheterization or suprapubic aspiration to establish the diagnosis of a urinary tract infection (UTI).

### Compliance with guidelines for the medical care of first urinary tract infections in infants: A population-based study [^115W5qk4]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

No population-based studies have examined the degree to which practice parameters are followed for urinary tract infections in infants.

- **Objective**: To describe the medical care of children in their first year of life following a first urinary tract infection.

- **Methods**: Using Washington State Medicaid data, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of children with a urinary tract infection during their first year of life to determine how many of these children received recommended care based on the most recent guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Recommended care included timely anatomic imaging, timely imaging for reflux, and adequate antimicrobial prophylaxis. Multivariate logistic-regression models were used to evaluate if factors such as hospitalization for first urinary tract infection, young age at time of diagnosis, gender, race, primary language of parents, having a managed care plan, and rural location of household residence were associated with recommended care.

- **Results**: Less than half of all children diagnosed with a urinary tract infection in their first year of life received the recommended medical care. Children who were hospitalized for their first urinary tract infection were significantly more likely than children who were not hospitalized to receive anatomic imaging (relative risk [RR]: 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20–1.57) and imaging for reflux (RR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.34–1.90).

- **Conclusions**: There is poor compliance with guideline-recommended care for first urinary tract infections in infants in a Medicaid population. Given the trend toward…

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: A review by the European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases [^116ksU4f]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Children with a severe clinical presentation need further investigation regarding urological pathology and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). In the absence of these, there is no evidence of benefit for continuous antibiotic prophylaxis (CAP) in children following a severe presentation.

The most relevant non-urologic underlying condition is renal transplant. Although acute urinary tract infections (UTIs) negatively impact graft function, it remains unclear whether CAP can prevent post-transplant UTI. Children with other conditions, such as those who are immunocompromised, may receive antibiotic prophylaxis. However, there is no data supporting the benefit specifically to prevent UTI in such cases.

Although there are no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in neonates and infants under 2 months of age, systematic reviews suggest that CAP may be useful in high-grade antenatal hydronephrosis, hydronephrosis with ureteral dilatation, or hydronephrosis in uncircumcised infants.

### Optimal antibiotics at hospital discharge for children with urinary tract infection [^115fZRu5]. Hospital Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Antibiotic stewardship at hospital discharge is an area of need. We assessed the rate of optimal antibiotic prescriptions at hospital discharge, based on urine culture and susceptibility data, for children diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI).

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective study of patients ≤ 18 years of age who were admitted to a general pediatrics service at a freestanding children's hospital during 2017 with a diagnosis of UTI and received an antibiotic prescription at discharge. For the primary analysis, optimal antibiotic at hospital discharge was determined by evaluating if the cultured urinary pathogen was susceptible to the prescribed antibiotic and if the antibiotic was the narrowest-spectrum option available. Secondary objectives included assessment of antibiotic dosing accuracy and description of antibiotic treatment duration.

- **Results**: A total of 78 cases were included. Sixty-eight (83%) cases were caused by cefazolin-susceptible Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species. Thirty-one (40%) cases had a discharge antibiotic prescription that was determined to be optimal. Of the 47 (60%) cases that were suboptimal, 44 (94%) were considered to be excessively broad spectrum. In 3 (6%) cases, the causative organism was nonsusceptible to the prescribed antibiotic. Ten (13%) discharge antibiotic prescriptions had inaccurate dosing and/or frequency.

- **Conclusions**: Missed opportunities for narrow-spectrum antibiotic selection at hospital discharge for pediatric UTIs frequently occurred. In particular, higher-generation cephalosporins and c

### Lower urinary tract infections: Management, outcomes and risk factors for antibiotic re-prescription in primary care [^113fJVju]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are major drivers of antibiotic prescribing in primary care, and inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for UTIs likely contributes to antibiotic resistance. The aim of this study was to describe investigation and antibiotic treatment to identify opportunities for improved antimicrobial stewardship.

A cohort consisting of all patients with a diagnosis of lower UTI between 2011 and 2015 was identified from the 390 primary care practices contributing data to ResearchOne in England. The study examined investigation, antibiotic treatment, and antibiotic re-prescription within 28 days according to guideline-defined patient groups. Risk factors for re-prescription were assessed using mixed-effect logistic regression.

In total, 494,675 UTIs were diagnosed in 300,354 patients. The median age was 54 years, and 83.3% of patients were women. Same-day antibiotics were prescribed for 85.7% of UTIs. Of these, 56.8% were treated with trimethoprim, and urine sampling was undertaken in 25.0% of patients. The antibiotic re-prescription rate was low at 4.1% (17,430 instances) but it increased slightly over time in men, rising from 5.2% in 2011 to 6.2% in 2015. Overall, 21.1% of re-prescriptions were for the same antibiotic. The percentage of adults with recurrent UTIs ranged from 1.0% in 18–64-year-old men to 2.6% in women aged 65 and over. The risk of antibiotic re-prescription increased with age, calendar year, recent antibiotic prescribing, and treatment with antibiotics other than trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin.

Most patients diagnosed with lower UTI in primary care receive same-day empirical antibiotics, with little variation in treatment practices.

### Short intravenous antibiotic courses for urinary infections in young infants: A systematic review [^117Qgc7y]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in young infants, yet there is no guidance on the optimal duration of intravenous (IV) treatment. The objective of this systematic review is to determine if shorter IV antibiotic courses (≤ 7 days) are appropriate for managing UTIs in infants aged ≤ 90 days.

- **Methods**: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Medline, and Embase (February 2021) were used as data sources. Included studies reported original data for infants aged ≤ 90 days with UTIs, studied short IV antibiotic durations (≤ 7 days), and described at least one treatment outcome. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guideline was followed. Studies were screened by two investigators, and bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Revised Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool.

- **Results**: Eighteen studies with 16,615 young infants were included. The largest two studies on bacteremic UTI found no difference in the rates of 30-day recurrence between those treated with ≤ 7 vs. > 7 days of IV antibiotics. For nonbacteremic UTI, there was no significant difference in the adjusted 30-day recurrence between those receiving ≤ 3 vs. > 3 days of IV antibiotics in the largest two studies identified. Three studies of infants aged ≥ 30 days used oral antibiotics alone and reported good outcomes, although only 85 infants were ≤ 90 days old.

- **Conclusions**: Shorter IV antibiotic courses of ≤ 7 days and ≤ 3 days with early switch to oral antibiotics should be considered in infants aged ≤ 90 days with bacteremic and nonbacteremic UTI, respectively, after excluding meningitis. Further studies of treatment with…

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Yv5D3]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

- **Search strategy and selection criteria**: We searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane for articles published in any language between 1955 and October 2015. MeSH terms for these databases included "drug resistance", "antimicrobial resistance", "bacterial resistance", "primary health care", "urinary tract infections", and "children". MeSH terms were combined with text word searches that included "antibiotic(s)", "primary care", "family practice", "ambulatory care", "community", "UTI", and "urinary bacteria". Grey and unpublished literature was searched with ISI Web of Knowledge software and included journal articles, patents, websites, conference proceedings, government and national reports, and open access material. We screened reference lists of selected key papers and contacted authors who appeared multiple times to request details of further published and unpublished work. All full-text papers were subject to citation searches. Appendix 1 details the full search strategy. Our review protocol was published on PROSPERO.

Two independent reviewers (AB and HT) screened all titles and abstracts independently for eligibility. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: investigated and reported patterns of resistance in laboratory-diagnosed E. coli positive isolates from children with urinary tract infection from primary care, defined as the first point of contact in the healthcare system; or investigated associations between previous antibiotic exposure and bacterial resistance; and study participants were children and young people aged 0–17.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^111ag7A6]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). High credibility.

With nearly half of women experiencing a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, these infections are one of the leading reasons for antibiotic prescriptions in the United States and worldwide. Despite their clinical ubiquity, physicians exhibit significant variation in their approaches to the workup and treatment of uncomplicated UTIs that may not always follow clinical practice guidelines. The use of unvalidated approaches to the management of UTIs may lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate antibiotic treatments; prior studies demonstrate that 50%–70% of antibiotic prescriptions for UTIs may be inappropriate, which contributes to worsening global rates of antibiotic resistance.

Treatment guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA), Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), and American Geriatrics Society (AGS) agree that UTI diagnosis should be based on the clinical symptomatology of urinary symptoms (e.g. dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, new incontinence in the absence of vaginal symptoms) associated with culture-proven bacteriuria with a bacterial uropathogen. Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria range from 1% to 5% in premenopausal women to 16% in older women in the community and as high as 50% for older women in long-term care facilities, demonstrating why appropriate clinical symptoms are needed to diagnose a UTI.

Prior studies, however, have shown that among patients diagnosed with a UTI in the emergency room (ER), only 32% of adults and 17% of the oldest adults have urinary symptoms, demonstrating poor adherence to clinical guidelines.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: A review by the European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases [^112z2pwe]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

- **What is the definition of cUTI**: cUTI is most usefully defined as children with UTI with an increased likelihood of failing conventional management (GRADE D). Children with cUTI have one or more of the following:
	- **Localized risk**: significant anatomical or functional urological abnormality, multiple reUTI.
	- **Generalized risk**: neonates, nonurological underlying condition (renal and nonrenal).
	- **Severe clinical presentations**: sepsis, severe renal parenchymal disease. We have used "complicated" to define subgroups at presentation and consequent management recommendations and "atypical" to refer to unexpected clinical progress (GRADE D).

The term "complicated UTI" has been used to describe multiple different UTI syndromes, with additional characteristics that might complicate the usual UTI course. This includes severe clinical presentations with or without extensive tissue involvement, hosts with abnormal urology or other underlying conditions, and unusual pathogen properties. This variety makes it difficult to compare studies and provide consistent evidence in guidelines for the management of cUTI. UTI has traditionally been categorized as uncomplicated (uUTI) and complicated (cUTI) to standardize trial participants. However, due to the lack of specific and clearly defined criteria at the outset, the definition has become increasingly broad and ambiguous. In a recent systematic review in adults, cUTI was variably defined by host factors and systemic involvement, a combination of both or neither. In children, early attempts to define cUTI variably included all neonates, most children.

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1159bwqx]. BMJ (2016). High credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance is an internationally recognized threat to health. The contribution of primary healthcare is particularly important, as this is where almost 80% of all antibiotics used within the health service are prescribed. Bacterial infections resistant to antibiotics can limit the availability of effective treatment options, rendering some commonly encountered bacterial infections difficult to treat, including those of the urinary tract. Antibiotic-resistant infections are also twice as likely to be associated with greater morbidity and mortality and increased healthcare costs. In low-income countries, the affordability of second-line drugs and reduced access to healthcare can restrict the use of newer broad-spectrum antibiotics, resulting in growing concerns for increased morbidity and mortality from antibiotic-resistant infections in these countries.

Children receive a significant amount of primary healthcare services and, as such, receive a disproportionately high number of antibiotics compared with middle-aged populations. Children are also key drivers of infection within communities and can contribute to the spread of bacteria from person to person. Despite this, little research has been published describing the prevalence of bacterial resistance in children or the risk factors of importance in this group. In 2010, Costelloe and colleagues conducted a systematic review that reported strong associations between previous exposure to routinely prescribed antibiotics in primary care and antimicrobial resistance persisting for up to 12 months.

### Reaffirmation of AAP clinical practice guideline: The diagnosis and management of the initial urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age [^116Ciijs]. Pediatrics (2016). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute cystitis, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, the AAP 2016 guidelines recommend assessing the likelihood of a urinary tract infection (UTI) in a febrile infant with no apparent source for the fever if immediate antimicrobial therapy is not required. This assessment guides further decisions:

- **Low risk**: Obtain clinical follow-up monitoring only, without testing.

- **Non-low risk**:
	- **First option**: Obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration for culture and urinalysis.
	- **Second option**: Obtain a urine specimen through the most convenient means for urinalysis. If urinalysis results suggest a UTI (positive leukocyte esterase test results, nitrite test, or microscopic analysis results for leukocytes or bacteria), obtain a urine specimen through catheterization or suprapubic aspiration for culture. Consider monitoring the clinical course without initiating antimicrobial therapy if urinalysis of fresh urine (less than 1 hour since void) yields negative leukocyte esterase and nitrite results, recognizing that a negative urinalysis does not rule out a UTI with certainty.

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^1147t1dq]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

For many of the antibiotics reported in this review, the pooled prevalence of resistance was higher in children aged 0–5 than in all children and young people (0–17). It has been previously suggested that resistance levels are likely to be higher in those communities with a higher proportion of young children because of their high consumption of antibiotics. A study conducted in France found that children aged under 7 consumed three times more antibiotics than older populations. The findings in our review support this theory, as resistance to all commonly prescribed antibiotics worldwide was higher in younger children than in children of predominantly older age. Our findings also suggest there could be a reversible element of antibiotic resistance, whereby reduced use of antibiotics (in older children) reduces the selective pressure that favors antibiotic-resistant strains.

- **Association between previous antibiotic exposure and bacterial resistance**: Our meta-analysis showing an association between exposure to antibiotics in the previous six months and isolation of resistant urinary isolates is similar to our previous 2010 review, which explored the effect of antibiotic prescribing in primary care on the development of resistance in individual patients of all ages. Consistent with our previous review, we found some evidence from Duffy and colleagues of decreasing resistance for increasing time from antibiotic prescribing.

### Pediatric urinary tract infections: the role of fluoroquinolones [^112HqAF8]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Infections of the urinary tract (UTI) occur commonly in the pediatric population. Because of the high association of pediatric UTIs with congenital structural anomalies of the urinary tract and dysfunctional elimination syndromes, it is far more common for children to be categorized as having complicated UTIs than their adult counterparts. For children, more intensive therapy is often required.

Early and effective treatment of UTIs in pediatric patients is essential to prevent long-term morbidity and potential mortality from end-stage renal disease. An oral antimicrobial is more convenient than parenteral therapy and is preferable as long as clinical efficacy and safety can be assured. Oral fluoroquinolones are an attractive alternative for the treatment of complicated UTIs in children, and safety must always be a factor in considering their use in this population. Although the role of fluoroquinolones in pediatric UTIs is still under investigation, the limited data available demonstrate a likelihood of efficacy and safety.

### Lower urinary tract infections: Management, outcomes and risk factors for antibiotic re-prescription in primary care [^116MgLK6]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Low credibility.

A urine sample for microbiological investigation is recommended in all children under 3 months, all children under 16, pregnant women, and all men. An annual average increase in urine sampling for culture of 3% has been reported. We found that microbiological investigation is not being carried out as recommended. However, even if microbiological examination and/or culture was coded for one in four of all episodes of UTI in patients older than 3 months, we cannot exclude the lack of recording of this information by some GPs.

As in previous studies, we investigated antibiotic re-prescription as a measure of treatment effectiveness. Because this approach has limitations, we used different definitions of re-prescription: the earliest subsequent prescription of a UTI-specific antibiotic issued within 4–28 days after the initial antibiotic prescription in the primary analysis; and within 6–28 and 8–28 days in sensitivity analyses. However, due to the lack of linkage to hospital and emergency services, we did not consider the progression of UTI to pyelonephritis and sepsis in the definition of re-prescription and might have missed some events. The percentage of patients re-prescribed antibiotics after an index prescription for the same UTI episode was low (3–4%) but still represents over 3,000 patients each year. We also found evidence of a statistically significant, gradual increase in antibiotic re-prescription over the five years covered by the study. Previous studies have reported rates ranging between 2% when failure requiring hospitalization was studied in a population-based analysis.

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Zz68S]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

We believe our rates of prevalence of resistance are accurate as they are consistent with other data sources. The highest reported resistance to ampicillin in our review was similar to the reported aminopenicillin group resistance in the European EARS-Net database and US Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy (CDDEP) databases. Resistance to ampicillin in other studies from the US ranged between 36% and 54%, suggesting that resistance to antibiotics in young children is similar to that of the general population. The similarities observed here could be a result of transmission between age groups of genetic resistance factors such as plasmids, facilitated through frequent interaction between children and adults.

Trimethoprim resistance was reported by three studies from the UK, all with large sample sizes (> 1700 isolates); all reported resistance in excess of 20%. These are similar to levels of trimethoprim resistance reported by other UK-based studies. Bean and colleagues reported trimethoprim resistance in community-acquired urinary isolates from adults and children at 39%. Additionally, Farrell and colleagues reported 27% resistance in E. coli urinary isolates from all age groups. In total, seven OECD studies from five countries (UK, Ireland, Austria, Australia, and Sweden) reported susceptibility to trimethoprim. These were also the only countries to report trimethoprim as a first-line antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection (appendix 5). Trimethoprim resistance was infrequently tested for in many studies from OECD countries.

### A review for clinical practice in the treatment and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in women over age 65 [^113ZsabT]. Journal of Women's Health (2024). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are pervasive, costly, and dangerous causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, which can lead to further complications if they reoccur or progress to urosepsis. Recurrent UTIs (reUTIs) are of particular concern among postmenopausal females due to increased risk factors and decreased estrogen levels, leading to changes in the urogenital epithelium and consequently causing alterations in the urogenital microbiome.

Prevention strategies for reUTIs are often incorporated into patient-centered care plans. However, finding the right management can be difficult for older women since many common treatment options have contraindications and adverse side effects. This review aims to describe the diagnosis, treatment, and special considerations for the treatment and prevention of reUTIs in women over 65.

- **Prevention strategies**: Include both antibiotic and nonantibiotic options. The antibiotic choice for older women presents unique challenges, such as frequent allergy or intolerance to side effects, renal or liver dysfunction, and polypharmacy or drug interactions. Nonantibiotic options range from readily accessible drugstore remedies to experimental vaccines, each accompanied by specific advantages and disadvantages.

Appropriate management plans can help reduce symptoms and poor outcomes among older females. Additionally, we hope future studies will continue to investigate proper dosing and routes for optimal management in this aging female population.

### Antibiotic prescription practice for pediatric urinary tract infection in a tertiary center [^113E6hgP]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Low credibility.

Prescribing antibiotics for suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) is common practice and may lead to unnecessary antibiotic exposure. We aimed to review UTI diagnosis and management in the emergency department and to identify targets for antimicrobial stewardship.

- **Methods**: Single-center, retrospective cohort study of children aged 12 weeks to younger than 18 years discharged from the emergency department with a diagnosis of UTI between October and December 2016. Children with genitourinary malformations were excluded. Clinical information, urine collection method, laboratory findings, and urine culture results were gathered. The sensitivity and specificity of nitrite and leukocyte esterase for UTI diagnosis were calculated. The relationship between urinalysis characteristics and confirmed UTI was examined using logistic regression.

- **Results**: A total of 183 children with a median (interquartile range) age of 4.2 (1.1–7.5) years were included; 82.5% were female. Almost all children were discharged home on antibiotics (n = 180, 98%) for a median (interquartile range) duration of 7 (7–10) days. A total of 85 patients (46.4%) received antibiotics despite negative urine cultures, leading to 525 unnecessary antibiotic days. The presence of nitrites was the strongest predictor of UTI (odds ratio = 20.22, P < 0.001) and was highly specific.

- **Conclusions**: Practice in managing suspected pediatric UTIs in our ED resulted in significant and unnecessary antibiotic exposure. We identified targets to reduce unnecessary antibiotic exposure, including improving the diagnosis.

### Reaffirmation of AAP clinical practice guideline: The diagnosis and management of the initial urinary tract infection in febrile infants and young children 2–24 months of age [^112uQGFf]. Pediatrics (2016). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute cystitis in pediatric patients, the management guidelines by AAP (2016) recommend initiating treatment for UTI either orally (PO) or parenterally, as both routes are equally efficacious. The choice of agent should be based on local antimicrobial sensitivity patterns, if available, and adjusted according to the sensitivity testing of the isolated uropathogen.

### Urinary tract infection: Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^113wtdNf]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this guideline is to revise the American Academy of Pediatrics practice parameter concerning the diagnosis and management of initial urinary tract infections (UTIs) in febrile infants and young children.

- **Methods**: Analysis was conducted on the medical literature published since the last version of the guideline. This was supplemented by data provided by authors of recent publications. Each recommendation's strength of evidence and the strength of the recommendation were assessed and graded.

- **Results**: Diagnosis is based on the presence of both pyuria and at least 50,000 colonies per mL of a single uropathogenic organism in an appropriately collected urine specimen. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained to permit prompt diagnosis and treatment of reinfections. Ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder should be performed to detect anatomic abnormalities. Recent data from six studies do not support the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent febrile reUTI in infants without vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) or with grade I to IV VUR. Therefore, voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) is not routinely recommended after the first UTI; it is indicated if renal and bladder ultrasonography reveal hydronephrosis, scarring, or other findings suggesting high-grade VUR or obstructive uropathy, and in other atypical or complex clinical circumstances. VCUG should also be performed if there is a recurrence of a febrile UTI.

The recommendations in this guideline do not indicate further action.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: A review by the European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases [^113seaNn]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) present a challenge to the clinician due to the variety of clinical syndromes and the consequent difficulties in synthesizing evidence. A harmonized definition of cUTI does not exist, and national guidelines often overlook management recommendations for cUTI. This review aims to define the four most important controversies and formulate management recommendations for cUTI in children and adolescents.

- **Methods**: The European Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases Guideline Committee convened a working group of experts from microbiology, pediatric nephrology, and infectious diseases, all with expertise in managing children with UTI. A comprehensive literature review was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to find studies in children under 18 years published until December 2024. From experience and available evidence, four controversies were defined. Children with cUTI were categorized into five subgroups: anatomical/functional urological abnormalities, multiple UTI recurrences, severe clinical presentation, non-urological underlying conditions, and neonates. Respective management guidelines were formulated through the evidence and by consensus of working group members. Recommendations were made using GRADE criteria.

- **Results**: The term cUTI is generally used to define children with UTI with an increased likelihood of failing conventional management. The included five subgroups are the most likely to need additional investigations at diagnosis and during the course of infection, initial intravenous antibiotics, and long-term management strategies.

### Antibiotic overprescription for "urinary tract infections" is associated with poor diagnostic stewardship and low adherence to guidelines [^117EvPBG]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

Overtesting for UTIs is leading to overtreatment in asymptomatic patients. The presence of urinary symptoms occurring with a positive culture, in the absence of vaginal symptoms, are key features of appropriate UTI diagnosis; however, our data showed that of the patients in the ER who were diagnosed with a UTI, only 28% had symptoms consistent with a UTI. This aligns well with previous studies examining rates of cystitis symptoms in those diagnosed with a UTI in the ER.

In addition to being more likely to be tested for a UTI, patients treated in the ER were also more likely to receive antibiotics for a UTI than patients who sought care in an outpatient setting (ER: 95%, 189/209 vs. Office: 55%, 390/740). While it might be hypothesized that ER patients would have a more severe presentation or be more frail, our data showed the ER patients tended to be younger overall with similar clinical features, including similar rates of urinary symptoms, vaginal symptoms, and culture positivity. Together, these findings may indicate that overtesting of patients in the ER for UTI is driving much of the inappropriate treatment of both asymptomatic bacteriuria and culture-negative subjects with nonspecific symptoms.

Urinary testing should be reserved for patients with symptoms consistent with a UTI. It is important to note that more than half of urine cultures for both patients evaluated in the ER and outpatient-based clinics were negative. In most of the encounters in which culture-negative patients were treated with antimicrobials for UTI, the rationale to provide antibiotics was either not documented or unclear.

### Diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of catheter-associated urinary tract infection in adults: 2009 international clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^117SVS32]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, specifically with respect to closed catheter systems, the IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend maintaining a closed catheter drainage system. This includes ports in the distal catheter for needle aspiration of urine to reduce catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria (CA-ASB) and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CA-UTI) in patients with short-term indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheters. This approach also reduces CA-ASB and CA-UTI in patients with long-term indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheters.

### Defining effective durations of antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infections in hospitalized children [^112SQDPL]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and urinary tract infections (UTI) are two common childhood infections often leading to hospital admission. National guidelines for CAP and UTI in children recommend durations of antibiotic therapy of 10 days and 7–14 days, respectively. Due to concerns of rising antimicrobial resistance and an increased awareness of harms associated with prolonged courses of antibiotics, there is a renewed emphasis on reevaluating commonly prescribed durations of antibiotic therapy across bacterial infections. Recent clinical trials and observational studies have been described, evaluating durations of therapy for CAP and UTI in adults and children, and translating the findings to suggest approaches for selecting durations of antibiotic therapy in hospitalized children.

- **Recent findings**: There is a growing body of evidence, primarily in adults, that shorter durations of therapy than are commonly prescribed are just as effective as longer durations for CAP and UTIs.

- **Summary**: Combining clinical trial data from adults with available data in children, it is reasonable to consider 5 days of therapy for CAP, 3–5 days of therapy for cystitis, and 7 days of therapy for pyelonephritis for most hospitalized children with uncomplicated infections.

### National imaging and antibiotic practice patterns in children presenting with urinary tract infection to community practices: Little impact from the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines [^116kTQci]. Clinical Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Our objective was to use community-based, national databases to evaluate diagnostic imaging and antibiotic prophylaxis practice patterns before and after the release of the 2011 American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for acute febrile urinary tract infection. Using the National Ambulatory and Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys, urinary tract infection encounters were identified for patients aged 2 months to 18 years. The primary outcomes were the utilization of antibiotics (as a proxy for prophylaxis) and diagnostic imaging during encounters. Weighted multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the association between time periods (before and after 2011) and each of the primary outcomes.

Among 8,588,035 weighted encounters, adjusting for covariates, there was insufficient evidence to suggest a difference between time periods for antibiotic utilization (odds ratio = 0.66, P = 0.12) or diagnostic imaging (odds ratio = 1.16, P = 0.56). Thus, we did not find evidence of changes in antibiotic utilization or diagnostic imaging practice patterns after the release of the 2011 American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: A review by the European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases [^116x7fcQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Over the last five years, new and updated pediatric UTI guidelines from around the world have become increasingly consistent for uncomplicated UTI but either do not address or differ in the definition and recommendations for complicated UTI. This is the first comprehensive guideline focused exclusively on cUTI in children, addressing its diagnosis and management according to the features making it complicated: young age, disease severity/extent, and comorbidities.

The guideline is comprehensive in addressing gaps in existing guidelines by first highlighting that cUTI is not a uniform entity but rather constitutes a wide range of disease processes. It presents the evidence for diagnosing and managing the subgroups presenting with each of these processes to ensure more individualized patient management. Additionally, it reviews emerging evidence for conceptualizing cUTI as an amalgamation of patients' individual features and attainment of a threshold for more intense management.

Regardless of the subgroup, accurate diagnosis is the critical first step in managing children with cUTI, for which additional investigations, such as blood culture, serum biochemistry, and USS, might be required. While several subgroups benefit from initial IV (sepsis, VUR 3–5, neonates) and broad-spectrum antibiotics (sepsis, high risk of resistance from reUTI and immunocompromise), oral narrow-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for most children with cUTI who are not severely unwell. Prophylaxis is not needed universally in cUTI and its relatively small benefits.

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^117TcBoR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common in elderly patients. Authors of non-systematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7 to 14 days) for older women, but the evidence for such recommendations is unclear.

- **Objectives**: To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic lower UTI in elderly women.

- **Search strategy**: We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies, screened reference lists of identified articles, reviews, and books. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International, and Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings without language restriction. The date of the most recent search was 7 May 2008.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower UTIs in elderly women were included. Whenever possible, we obtained outcome data for older women included in studies with a broader age range. We excluded patients with fever, flank pain, or complicating factors; studies with treatment durations longer than 14 days; and prevention studies.

- **Data collection and analysis**: The two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

- **Main results**: Fifteen studies, including 1,644 elderly…

### Treatment of positive urine cultures in the neonatal intensive care unit: A guideline to reduce antibiotic utilization [^113xNHSU]. Journal of Perinatology (2021). Low credibility.

The pediatric definition of bacterial urinary tract infection (UTI) is > 50,000 colony-forming units (CFU) of a single organism on catheterized culture or 10,000–50,000 CFU with pyuria on urinalysis.

- **Local problem**: The diagnosis of UTI in our NICU is clinician-dependent and not based on the accepted pediatric definition.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of positive urine cultures between 2015 and 2017 was performed.

- **Intervention**: A treatment guideline for positive urine cultures was adopted and PDSA methodology utilized for incremental improvements.

- **Results**: For 909 pre-intervention neonates, 26 of 38 positive urine cultures were treated for UTI, but only 23% (6/26) met the pediatric definition. For 644 post-guideline neonates, only 7 of 25 positive urine cultures were treated, and 86% met guideline criteria with no increase in urosepsis.

- **Conclusions**: A guideline to treat positive urine cultures resulted in a decreased rate of UTI diagnosis and thus prevented unnecessary antibiotic exposure.

### Improving antibiotic prescribing for children with urinary tract infection in emergency and urgent care settings [^1161TjC9]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Low credibility.

Children with urinary tract infection (UTI) are often diagnosed in emergency and urgent care settings and increasingly are unnecessarily treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. This study evaluated the effect of a quality improvement intervention on empiric antibiotic prescribing for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI in children.

- **Methods**: A local clinical pathway for uncomplicated UTI, introduced in June 2010, recommended empiric treatment with cephalexin, a narrow-spectrum (first-generation) cephalosporin antibiotic. A retrospective quasi-experimental study of pediatric patients older than 1 month presenting to emergency and urgent care settings from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2014, with uncomplicated UTI was conducted. Hospitalized patients and those with chronic conditions or urogenital abnormalities were excluded. Control charts and interrupted time-series analysis were used to analyze the primary outcome of narrow-spectrum antibiotic prescribing rates and the balancing measures of 72-hour revisits, resistant bacterial isolates, and subsequent inpatient admissions for UTI.

- **Results**: A total of 2134 patients were included. There was an immediate and sustained significant increase in cephalexin prescribing from 19.2% before to 79.6% after pathway implementation, and a significant decline in oral third-generation cephalosporin (cefixime) prescribing from 50.3% to 4.0%. There was no significant increase in 72-hour revisits, resistant bacterial isolates, or inpatient admissions for UTI.

- **Conclusions**: A clinical pathway produced a significant impact on prescribing patterns.

### Conflicting views of physicians and surgeons concerning pediatric urinary tract infection: a comparative review [^114bnMZj]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

The European Association of Urology - European Society for Paediatric Urology 2015 was the only guideline formulated by surgeons that addresses the investigation and management of a first febrile UTI in children. It advocated VCUG to detect VUR during the study period of this paper. The guideline has been recently updated, recommending VCUG following a first febrile UTI where an ultrasound was abnormal or the infection was due to an atypical organism. The authors of the guideline did not reference any RCTs and lament the low quality of evidence cited, acknowledging most of the recommendations are based on "panel and expert opinion". The relative lack of prospective, well-designed studies involving elective surgical procedures (such as correction of VUR) is highlighted by data from major publicly-funded research bodies such as the UK's National Institute for Health Research and Medical Research Council. Their combined spending on surgical research has been reported as less than 2% of the total research budget of £1.53 billion, even though 30% of National Health Service patients receive surgical care. Similar funding levels are reported in other countries.

There appear to be two distinct directions in the literature on the investigation and management of febrile UTIs in children: one published predominantly by physicians in medical journals, and the other predominantly by surgeons in surgical journals. In undertaking this comparative study, we came to realize that, as physicians, almost all our reading has been in the medical literature, with the likelihood that surgeons may restrict their research to surgical literature.

### Changes in urinary tract infection hospitalizations post 2011 revised American Academy Pediatrics guidelines [^11341poz]. Clinical Pediatrics (2018). High credibility.

Multiple randomized trials over the past two decades have supported oral antimicrobial treatment for urinary tract infection (UTI), and the 2011 revised American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines on the management of UTI provide further support for outpatient management. It is unknown whether practice patterns have changed as a result of these developments.

- **Objective**: To examine temporal trends in UTI hospitalizations between 1997 and 2012 as measured by the Kids' Inpatient Database.

- **Design and methods**: The Kids' Inpatient Database was used to analyze trends in UTI hospitalizations between 1997 and 2012. This triennial database is publicly available through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Hospitalization volume for clinical classification software principal diagnosis category 159 urinary tract infection was examined for trends across years by age. Changes in length of stay and charges corrected for inflation were also examined.

- **Results**: There were significantly fewer weighted UTI hospitalizations in 2012 compared with 1997 to 2009 (48,102 SE ± 1494 in 2009 vs. 41,177 SE ± 1467 in 2012, P < .0001). The largest decrease was observed in the 15- to 17-year-old (19.2%) and < 1-year-old (18.6%) groups. The length of stay trended down consistently, but charges have increased despite correcting for the consumer price index.

- **Conclusions**: The year 2012 represents the first significant decrease in national hospitalization rates for UTI since 1997, a trend that may be explained by the accumulating evidence supporting outpatient management in addition to recommendations from the 2011 guidelines.

### Urinary tract infection at the age extremes: Pediatrics and geriatrics [^112KTmNx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common and generally benign conditions among healthy, sexually active young women without long-term medical sequelae. In contrast, UTIs present more complications among individuals at either end of the age spectrum: infants/young children and geriatrics. UTI in children younger than 2 years has been associated with significant morbidity and long-term medical consequences. This association necessitates an extensive and somewhat invasive imaging evaluation to identify possible underlying functional or anatomic abnormalities. Pediatric UTI should be considered complicated until proven otherwise, and treatment should reflect the severity of signs and symptoms.

Management in the acutely ill child frequently involves parenteral broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, while less ill children can be treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), beta-lactams, and cephalosporins. UTI among older patients (> 65 years) may be complicated by comorbidities, the baseline presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, and benign urinary symptoms that can complicate diagnosis. The etiology of UTI encompasses a broader spectrum of infecting organisms than is seen among younger patients and includes more gram-positive organisms. Symptomatic UTI is generally more difficult to treat than among younger populations. Management should be conservative, entail longer treatment durations, and cover a broad spectrum of possible uropathogens. Oral or parenteral treatment with a fluoroquinolone for 7 days is the preferred empiric approach. TMP-SMX can also be considered a first-line agent.

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113UcpBW]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

Our findings detail global high-level resistance to some of the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for children's primary care, which could result in several drugs becoming ineffective first-line treatments in many countries. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), in collaboration with the European Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID), recommends that an antibiotic should be selected for first-line empirical treatment of urinary tract infection only if the local prevalence of resistance is less than 20%. According to these guidelines, our review suggests ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, and trimethoprim are no longer suitable first-line treatment options for urinary tract infection in many OECD countries. As a result, many guidelines, such as those published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), might need updating. In non-OECD countries, resistance to all first-line antibiotics specified for urinary tract infections was in excess of 20%, suggesting that choices for first-line treatment might need to be reevaluated in less well-developed countries. Our results also support the need for prescribing guidelines to reflect patterns of local resistance and that, for many areas, nitrofurantoin might be the most appropriate first-line treatment for lower urinary tract infection. That said, care is needed because ruling out the use of some first-line antibiotics could lead clinicians to prescribe broad-spectrum second-line antibiotics, such as co-amoxiclav.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: A review by the European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases [^1174tKiQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). High credibility.

Patient history and clinical review are fundamental in the diagnosis of UTI and the assessment of complicating features at presentation (GRADE D). Urine collection should be done using clean catch, catheterization, or suprapubic aspiration. Urine analysis, culture, and susceptibility testing should be undertaken for all children (GRADE C). Additional blood investigations for complicated UTI (cUTI) may include inflammatory markers, full blood count, blood culture, urea, creatinine, and electrolytes (GRADE C). An acute ultrasound scan is helpful in some clinical situations (GRADE D).

All children with cUTI should be reassessed for treatment response at 48 hours. If progress is atypical, consider complications and/or differential diagnosis (GRADE D). Repeat urine testing is only needed if there is an inadequate treatment response (GRADE D).

All children, irrespective of uncomplicated or complicated UTI (uUTI or cUTI), need urinary investigations to confirm UTI diagnosis.

- **Diagnostic and other initial investigations in children with cUTI**: As with uncomplicated UTI, clean catch urine collection is preferred due to its noninvasive nature, with catheterization or suprapubic aspiration as the gold standards if collection is difficult or diagnosis is uncertain. In infants under two months, clean catch methods are challenging and can result in up to 38% contaminated samples; therefore, catheterization or suprapubic aspiration is advised.

Regarding quality improvement for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, specifically concerning infection prevention, the IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend ensuring that hospitals and long-term care facilities develop, maintain, and promulgate policies and procedures. These should cover the recommended catheter insertion indications, insertion and maintenance techniques, discontinuation strategies, and replacement indications. Additionally, facilities should include the education and training of their staff relevant to these policies and procedures.

### Urinary tract pathogens and resistance pattern [^111nQb4W]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

Epidemiology and resistance patterns of bacterial pathogens in pediatric urinary tract infections (UTIs) show large inter-regional variability, and rates of bacterial resistance are changing due to different antibiotic treatments. Empiric therapy to treat UTIs should be tailored to surveillance data on the epidemiology and resistance patterns of common uropathogens to reduce treatment failures and the emergence of bacterial resistance within the community.

- **Objective**: A retrospective data review was carried out to evaluate the resistance patterns to commonly used antibiotics in children with culture-proven UTIs.

- **Methods**: All infants and children with culture-proven UTIs from 2002 to 2008 were included. A urine culture was deemed positive with a pure growth > 10⁵ (single organism).

- **Results**: A total of 547 UTIs were confirmed on urine cultures in 337 patients. An average of 78 cases were diagnosed each year. E. coli was the most commonly grown pathogen (92%). From 2002 to 2008, rising resistance patterns were noted for trimethoprim (p ≤ 0.05) and Augmentin (p < 0.001). In contrast, resistance to cefalexin and nitrofurantoin remained relatively low (11% and 7%, respectively, in 2008).

- **Conclusion**: Our data suggest that there has been an increasing resistance trend to first-line antibiotics like trimethoprim and Augmentin against E. coli. In accordance with NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) guidance, each region should monitor resistance patterns to urinary pathogens on a regular basis and use antibiotics with a low resistance pattern.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® urinary tract infection-child: 2023 update [^117W3So1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). High credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent infection in childhood. The diagnosis is usually made by history and physical examination and confirmed by urine analysis. Cystitis is an infection or inflammation confined to the bladder, whereas pyelonephritis is an infection or inflammation of the kidneys. Pyelonephritis can cause renal scarring, which is the most severe long-term sequela of UTI, and can lead to accelerated nephrosclerosis, resulting in hypertension and chronic renal failure.

The role of imaging is to guide treatment by identifying patients at high risk of developing recurrent UTIs or renal scarring. This document provides initial imaging guidelines for children presenting with a first febrile UTI with the appropriate response to medical management, atypical or recurrent febrile UTI, and follow-up imaging for children with established vesicoureteral reflux.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions, reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles, such as the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios.

### Improving management: Novel guidelines for diagnosing urinary tract infection in infants [^116JMB4i]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). High credibility.

The diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) in the pediatric field remains a topic of debate. In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) introduced new guidelines for the diagnosis of UTI in patients aged 2–24 months. However, concerns were raised regarding these guidelines.

- **Methods**: This retrospective data extraction study included patients aged 0–6 months who were examined in the pediatric emergency department between 2016 and 2021 and had a urine culture. For each patient, we recorded the diagnosis documented in the medical records, the diagnosis based on the AAP and Israeli guidelines, and the diagnosis according to our two proposed protocols. We then compared the percentage of UTI diagnoses according to each diagnostic guideline.

- **Results**: A total of 1,432 patients under the age of 6 months underwent urine culture testing during the study period. Of these, 83 (5.81%) were diagnosed with UTI according to the AAP guidelines, 184 (12.8%) according to the Israeli guidelines, 102 (7.1%) according to our first proposed guidelines, and 109 (7.6%) according to our second proposed guidelines.

- **Conclusions**: We propose a new diagnostic method (guidelines II) that is suitable for patients older than 2 months, with obligatory criteria of an abnormal urine test and a lower threshold for the colony count required for diagnosis compared to the AAP guidelines. Further research is required to examine the sensitivity and specificity of our proposed guidelines, with the aim of potentially replacing the existing standards.

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^115D6P2i]. BMJ (2016). Low credibility.

Of the five studies we included in our meta-analysis, most reported the association between previous antibiotic exposure and resistance within overlapping time periods. This implies that the associations with longer time periods, such as 0–6 months, could reflect a combination of long- and short-term associations. The odds ratios were highest in the 0–6 months time period, probably because this individual study measured exposure to antibiotics for a combined total of four weeks or more within the previous six months compared with no exposure within the same time period. The other studies measured exposure to antibiotics within an undefined combined length of prescription time within the measured time period versus no antibiotic prescriptions. None of the studies we included in our meta-analysis reported antibiotic doses, so we were unable to evaluate any dose-response effects.

In most countries, it is standard practice to treat empirically with an antibiotic when a child presents to primary care with a suspected urinary tract infection. Sometimes a urine sample is taken only if the illness does not respond to first-line antibiotic treatment. This can lead to falsely high reported resistance rates to first-line antibiotics. This problem would be resolved if only incident cases were included or systematic urine sampling was used, but studies did not present this information. That said, there were no obvious differences in resistance rates according to the timing of the urine sampling. Furthermore, variation in sampling strategies could explain some of the variation in pooled estimates of resistance rates.

### Prevalence of urinary tract infection in childhood: a meta-analysis [^113grp7Z]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Knowledge of baseline risk of urinary tract infection can help clinicians make informed diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. We conducted a meta-analysis to determine the pooled prevalence of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children by age, gender, race, and circumcision status.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for articles about pediatric urinary tract infection. Search terms included urinary tract infection, cystitis, pyelonephritis, prevalence, and incidence. We included articles in our review if they contained data on the prevalence of UTI in children 0–19 years of age presenting with symptoms of UTI. Of the 51 articles with data on UTI prevalence, 18 met all inclusion criteria. Two evaluators independently reviewed, rated, and abstracted data from each article.

- **Results**: Among infants presenting with fever, the overall prevalence (and 95% confidence interval) of UTI was 7.0% (CI: 5.5–8.4). The pooled prevalence rates of febrile UTIs in females aged 0–3 months, 3–6 months, 6–12 months, and > 12 months were 7.5%, 5.7%, 8.3%, and 2.1%, respectively. Among febrile male infants less than 3 months of age, 2.4% (CI: 1.4–3.5) of circumcised males and 20.1% (CI: 16.8–23.4) of uncircumcised males had a UTI. For the four studies that reported UTI prevalence by race, UTI rates were higher among white infants at 8.0% (CI: 5.1–11.0) than among black infants at 4.7% (CI: 2.1–7.3). Among older children (< 19 years) with urinary symptoms, the pooled prevalence of UTI (both febrile and afebrile) was 7.8% (CI: 6.6–8.9).

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: A review by the European Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases [^112xqzWq]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). High credibility.

The most systematic effort to categorize the diversity of UTI syndromes and provide a basis for the definition of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) has been by the European Association of Urology (EAU) through a four-component classification system that identifies children likely to fail conventional UTI management. This includes clinical presentation, severity of tissue involvement, host risk factors (ORENUC acronym, O: no risk factors, R: recurrences, E: extra-urological risk factors, N: nephropathic diseases, U: urological risk factors, C: catheter), and pathogen susceptibility.

Most of the broadly recognized subgroups of cUTI include components of the EAU system and are incorporated into the 2015 EAU/ESPU Guideline, although the 2021 revision does not include neonates. Uncomplicated pyelonephritis is no longer considered cUTI. Part of the problem with clearly defining cUTI is that the spectrum of disease is wide, with multiple mild to severe complicating factors. It has been found that if more complicating features exist, clinicians are more likely to manage these differently from uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTI), that is, by using intravenous (IV) antibiotics.

Rather than categorizing UTI as either uncomplicated or complicated, the concept of less complicated or more complicated may be useful, with an increasing number of abnormal features guiding more aggressive management. This requires further study. Despite the broadness and inconsistencies in the term cUTI, it is preserved in the present guideline, where "complicated" refers to components at presentation that impact immediate management and "atypical" to additional factors.

### Lower urinary tract infections: management, outcomes and risk factors for antibiotic re-prescription in primary care [^112ZAn3y]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Low credibility.

- **Antibiotic treatment**: Antibiotics were prescribed on the same date of diagnosis for 85.7% of UTIs, with a range from 20.7% in children under 3 years to 89% in women aged 18–64 years. Only 17% of those who received antibiotics had a recorded urine test within 10 days of diagnosis, ranging from 9.1% for the under 3 years group to 30.6% for women aged 18 to 64 years.

	- Overall, the most commonly prescribed antibiotics initially were trimethoprim (56.8%) and nitrofurantoin (23.9%). Cephalexin was the most commonly prescribed antibiotic in pregnant women (30.4%) and the second most commonly prescribed in children under 4 years (24.0% in those under 3 months and 5.6% in those aged 3 months to 3 years).

	- Multiple antibiotics were administered to 3,543 (0.8%) patients. Six percent of UTI episodes diagnosed in pregnant women (n = 62) were treated with trimethoprim, and the proportion of UTIs treated with co-amoxiclav varied between 4.3% in children aged 4–15 years (n = 1,086) and 7.6% in men aged 18–64 years (n = 1,830). Chronic kidney disease of stage ≥ 3 was diagnosed in 9.4% of episodes treated with nitrofurantoin in women and 15.0% of those in men (0.6% of episodes in women and 1.9% of those in men with stage ≥ 4).

### Antibiotic management of urinary tract infection in elderly patients in primary care and its association with bloodstream infections and all cause mortality: Population based cohort study [^11382d8c]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

In the context of randomized controlled trials, strict exclusion criteria, particularly related to age, have been applied, preventing the results from being generalized to older adult populations who may require a different approach in the management of UTI. In contrast, our study specifically looked at the group of older patients (> 65 years) who are more susceptible to complications and are often neglected in UTI-related research. We showed that antibiotics prescribed at the time of UTI diagnosis may benefit this vulnerable population by significantly reducing the risk of all-cause mortality and the rate of bloodstream infection and hospital admission.

Recent guidance from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence has proposed no antibiotic or delayed antibiotic prescriptions when infection is likely to be self-limiting in an effort to reduce inappropriate prescribing. Evidence and recommendations, however, refer mainly to upper respiratory tract infections. Evidence is nonetheless emerging that delayed prescribing in the treatment of UTI is becoming more acceptable in practice.

A randomized controlled trial evaluated various antibiotic management strategies, including empirical delayed (by 48 hours) antibiotics and immediate antibiotics strategies for UTI in women younger than 70 years. No significant differences in symptom duration, severity, or frequency of symptoms between the strategies were reported. In our study, deferred antibiotics were associated with less severe adverse outcomes than no antibiotics for older adults but still showed a significantly higher risk.

### Global prevalence of antibiotic resistance in paediatric urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and association with routine use of antibiotics in primary care: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Aimg2]. BMJ (2016). High credibility.

Objectives: To systematically review studies investigating the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli in children and, when appropriate, to meta-analyse the relation between previous antibiotics prescribed in primary care and resistance.

Design and data analysis: This study involves a systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled percentage prevalence of resistance to the most commonly used antibiotics in children in primary care was stratified by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) status of the study country. A random effects meta-analysis was utilized to quantify the association between previous exposure to antibiotics in primary care and resistance.

Data sources: Observational and experimental studies were identified through Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases, with searches for articles published up to October 2015.

Eligibility criteria for selecting studies: Studies were eligible if they investigated and reported resistance in community-acquired urinary tract infections in children and young people aged 0–17. Electronic searches with MeSH terms and text words identified 3115 papers. Two independent reviewers assessed study quality and performed data extraction.

Results: Fifty-eight observational studies investigated 77,783 E. coli isolates in urine. In studies from OECD countries, the pooled prevalence of resistance was 53.4% (95% confidence interval 46.0% to 60.8%) for ampicillin, 23.6% (13.9% to 32.3%) for trimethoprim, 8.2% (7.9% to 9.6%) for co-amoxiclav, and 2.1% (0.8 to 4.4%) for ciprofloxacin; nitrofurantoin.

### Diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of catheter-associated urinary tract infection in adults: 2009 international clinical practice guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115owYCb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, more specifically with respect to patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria, the IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend diagnosing CA-ASB in patients with:

- **Indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheter, or intermittent catheterization**:
	- Patients should have an indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheter, or they should undergo intermittent catheterization.

- **Absence of symptoms and signs compatible with UTI**:
	- Patients must exhibit no symptoms or signs that are compatible with urinary tract infections.

- **Growth of ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL of ≥ 1 bacterial species in a single catheter urine specimen**:
	- There should be the growth of 100,000 colony-forming units per milliliter or more of at least one bacterial species in a single catheter urine specimen.

### Lower urinary tract infections: Management, outcomes and risk factors for antibiotic re-prescription in primary care [^115wWZLz]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are major drivers of antibiotic prescribing in primary care. Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for UTIs likely drives antibiotic resistance. This study aimed to describe investigation and antibiotic treatment to examine opportunities for improved antimicrobial stewardship.

- **Methods**: A cohort of all patients with a lower UTI diagnosis was identified between 2011 and 2015 in the 390 primary care practices contributing data to ResearchOne in England. Investigation, antibiotic treatment, and antibiotic re-prescription within 28 days were examined according to guideline-defined patient groups. Risk factors for re-prescription were assessed using mixed-effect logistic regression.

- **Findings**: In total, 494,675 UTIs were diagnosed in 300,354 patients. The median age was 54 years, and 83.3% of the cases were in women. Same-day antibiotics were prescribed for 85.7% of UTIs, with 56.8% treated with trimethoprim, and urine sampling was undertaken in 25.0% of cases. The antibiotic re-prescription rate was low (17,430, 4.1%) and increased slightly over time in men (from 5.2% in 2011 to 6.2% in 2015). Overall, 21.1% of re-prescriptions were for the same antibiotic. The percentage of adults with recurring UTIs ranged from 1.0% in 18–64-year-old men to 2.6% in women aged 65 years and older. The risk of antibiotic re-prescription increased with age, calendar year, recent antibiotic prescribing, and treatment with an antibiotic other than trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin.

- **Interpretation**: Most patients diagnosed with lower UTI in primary care receive same-day empirical antibiotics with little diversity.

### Empiric antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection in preschool children: susceptibilities of urine sample isolates [^112eYQFG]. Family Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Antibiotic treatment recommendations based on susceptibility data from routinely submitted urine samples may be biased because of variation in sampling, laboratory procedures, and inclusion of repeat samples, leading to uncertainty about empirical treatment.

- **Objective**: To describe and compare susceptibilities of Escherichia coli cultured from routinely submitted samples, with E. coli causing urinary tract infection (UTI) from a cohort of systematically sampled, acutely unwell children.

- **Methods**: Susceptibilities of 1458 E. coli isolates submitted during the course of routine primary care for children under 5 years (routine care samples) were compared to susceptibilities of 79 E. coli isolates causing UTI from 5107 children under 5 years presenting to primary care with an acute illness [systematic sampling: the Diagnosis of Urinary Tract Infection in Young Children (DUTY) cohort].

- **Results**: The percentage of E. coli sensitive to antibiotics cultured from routinely submitted samples were as follows: amoxicillin 45.1% (95% confidence interval: 42.5–47.7%); co-amoxiclav using the lower systemic break point (BP) 86.6% (84.7–88.3%); cephalexin 95.1% (93.9–96.1%); trimethoprim 74.0% (71.7–76.2%); and nitrofurantoin 98.2% (97.4–98.8%). The percentage of E. coli sensitive to antibiotics cultured from systematically sampled DUTY urines considered to be positive for UTI were as follows: amoxicillin 50.6% (39.8–61.4%); co-amoxiclav using the systemic BP 83.5% (73.9–90.1%); co-amoxiclav using the urinary BP 94.9% (87.7–98.4%); cephalexin 98.7% (93.2–99.8%); and trimethoprim 70.9% (60.1–80.0%).
