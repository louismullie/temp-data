## Question

Arm pain after tetanus vaccine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage arm pain after a tetanus vaccine, including how to distinguish expected local reactions from concerning complications and what steps to take next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the temporal pattern and onset of pain to classify the reaction. Then, I should verify the expected frequency and severity of injection-site pain from randomized trials. Next, I will consider red flags that suggest an Arthus reaction, SIRVA, brachial neuritis, or infection. After that, I should review risk modifiers such as interval since last tetanus vaccine, needle length/site, and age. Finally, I will outline management strategies, counseling points, and when to escalate care or report to VAERS, ensuring I reconcile any conflicting guidance along the way.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and timing, because that drives the differential. Expected local injection-site pain typically begins within hours of vaccination, peaks in 24–48 hours, and resolves within 1–3 days. By contrast, Arthus-type reactions begin 4–12 hours after injection and feature severe pain with swelling and induration, whereas persistent shoulder pain beyond a week raises concern for SIRVA or coincident shoulder pathology, and neurologic deficits appearing over days suggest brachial neuritis or other neuropathies [^1148ADWt] [^115RyatE] [^115boLja].

> Wait, let me verify the expected frequency and severity of injection-site pain from high-quality data. In randomized trials of Tdap revaccination in adults, injection-site pain is extremely common, reported by roughly 87% of recipients, but only about 3–4% report grade 3 pain that prevents daily activity; median duration is 1–2 days, and systemic myalgia is also common, which helps frame what is "normal" versus excessive [^112knntH] [^1155qMhk]. Hold on, I should also check booster intervals: shorter intervals after prior Td/Tdap can modestly increase local reactogenicity, but serious events remain rare, which supports counseling rather than deferring indicated vaccination [^112MkMia] [^114P7SeM].

> I will now examine the features that distinguish an Arthus reaction from typical soreness. Arthus reactions are type III hypersensitivity and classically present 4–12 hours after vaccination with severe pain, marked swelling, induration, edema, and sometimes hemorrhagic change; they typically resolve without sequelae but warrant avoiding tetanus toxoid-containing vaccines for at least 10 years and prioritizing TIG for wound management when indicated, even if the wound is dirty or severe [^1148ADWt] [^113ofiLX]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "never give TIG if there was a prior Arthus", but that is not correct; TIG is still indicated for wound prophylaxis when criteria are met, while tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine should be deferred for a decade after the Arthus episode [^113ofiLX].

> Next, I should review persistent shoulder pain beyond a week. Let me consider SIRVA and coincident shoulder pathology. Published case series and systematic reviews show that among patients with persistent shoulder pain after vaccination, about half receive a specific diagnosis such as rotator cuff tendinopathy or adhesive capsulitis, and most improve with conservative care over months; this argues for a high likelihood of coincidental pathology rather than a unique vaccine injury, though injection technique and deltoid needle placement can contribute [^115RyatE]. I need to ensure I do not over-attribute pain to vaccination when imaging reveals common shoulder disorders, and I should counsel that prognosis is generally favorable with physical therapy and analgesics [^115RyatE].

> But wait, what if the pain is accompanied by weakness or sensory changes? Brachial neuritis, while rare, has been associated with tetanus toxoid–containing vaccines and typically presents with sudden severe shoulder/arm pain followed by weakness over days to weeks; electrodiagnostics can confirm the diagnosis, and although recovery is often substantial, it may take months and does not constitute a contraindication to future tetanus vaccination per ACIP, though some experts advise caution and shared decision-making [^115boLja] [^1131heQT]. Hold on, I should verify that ACIP does not list brachial neuritis as a contraindication; yes, it is not a contraindication, but documenting the event and discussing risk-benefit is prudent [^115boLja].

> I need to check for infection masquerading as a local reaction. If there is progressive erythema, warmth, fluctuance, fever, or systemic toxicity, I should consider cellulitis or abscess and manage with clinical assessment and appropriate antibiotics. Tetanus vaccines are not live and do not cause infection, but breaks in aseptic technique or patient-specific factors can lead to bacterial infection at the injection site, which requires prompt recognition and treatment [^113G6uSZ] [^114cPTPu].

> Let me consider risk modifiers that can shape counseling and expectations. Shorter intervals since the last tetanus-containing vaccine are associated with modestly higher rates of local erythema, swelling, and pain, yet ACIP concluded the benefits of pertussis protection outweigh these manageable local effects, so vaccination should proceed when indicated rather than be deferred solely for this reason [^112MkMia] [^114P7SeM]. I should double-check needle length and site data: in children, shorter needles and arm injection are associated with more redness and pain; using an appropriate-length needle and, for certain pediatric boosters, the thigh may reduce large local reactions, though pain differences are less consistent and adult data are limited, so technique remains important across ages [^111U1xY9] [^116Hritt] [^114u6KXz]. Age and sex also influence reactogenicity, with younger adults and women tending to report more local symptoms, which can guide anticipatory guidance [^115LcEF5].

> Next, I should review management of expected local pain. For mild to moderate pain, rest, ice, and acetaminophen or NSAIDs are reasonable; prophylactic acetaminophen or ibuprofen around the fifth DTaP dose did not prevent large local reactions, so routine prophylaxis is not supported, but therapeutic use for symptom relief is appropriate and commonly used in practice [^113XV5sQ] [^1134kSPC]. I need to ensure I counsel on expected duration and red flags: most local pain resolves within 1–3 days; if pain is severe, rapidly worsening, accompanied by large swelling, bruising, or systemic symptoms, or persists beyond a week, reassessment is warranted [^1148ADWt] [^115RyatE] [^115boLja].

> Hold on, I should verify when to escalate or report. Severe pain with extensive swelling, hemorrhagic discoloration, or necrotic changes suggests an Arthus reaction and warrants avoiding tetanus toxoid-containing vaccines for 10 years and documenting the event. Persistent shoulder pain with limited motion beyond a week should prompt evaluation for SIRVA or coincident shoulder pathology, often with ultrasound or MRI and referral for physical therapy. New neurologic deficits such as weakness or sensory loss require urgent assessment for brachial neuritis or other neuropathies. And any serious adverse event should be reported to VAERS even if causality is uncertain, to support pharmacovigilance [^1148ADWt] [^113ofiLX] [^115RyatE] [^114ru3Ya]. I should confirm that VAERS reporting is appropriate for serious events temporally related to vaccination. Yes, that is correct and recommended by ACIP practice parameters [^114ru3Ya].

> Let me reconsider future vaccination strategy so I do not over-restrict indicated care. After a documented Arthus reaction, tetanus toxoid-containing vaccines should be deferred for 10 years, but TIG can be used for wound prophylaxis when indicated; otherwise, ACIP advises that Tdap can be administered regardless of interval since the last tetanus- or diphtheria-containing vaccine because pertussis protection benefits outweigh the risk of increased local reactogenicity, and this applies to adolescents and adults, including during pregnancy when Tdap is recommended each time [^1148ADWt] [^111zAads] [^11426iZE]. I should double-check that this interval guidance aligns with current ACIP statements; yes, the 2018 and 2020 ACIP updates support administering Tdap when indicated without regard to prior Td/Tdap interval in most non-Arthus contexts [^111zAads] [^114HtDQ2].

> Finally, I need to ensure preventive technique is addressed to reduce recurrence risk. Using the correct intramuscular site for age, an appropriate needle length to reach muscle, avoiding aspiration, and employing distraction and other pain-mitigation strategies can reduce pain and may reduce local reactions. In young children, topical anesthetics and sucrose can be considered, and in older children and adults, distraction and coaching on relaxation can improve the experience and potentially lessen reported pain intensity [^111ToD9U] [^113H6Ccj] [^112q4REy] [^1134kSPC]. Hold on, I should verify that aspiration is not recommended; yes, current guidance advises against aspiration during intramuscular vaccine injections, which streamlines administration without compromising safety [^113H6Ccj].

Arm pain after a tetanus vaccine is common and usually mild, with **pain in 58–87%** and severe pain in 3–4% of recipients [^112knntH] [^115mKPVa]. It typically begins within 24 hours, peaks at 1–2 days, and resolves within 3–5 days; **management is supportive** with ice, rest, and acetaminophen or NSAIDs [^1134kSPC]. Persistent pain beyond 7 days, severe swelling, or neurologic symptoms warrant evaluation for rare complications such as Arthus reaction, SIRVA, or brachial neuritis [^1148ADWt] [^115RyatE] [^115boLja]. Future tetanus-containing vaccines can still be given unless a severe reaction occurred; if an Arthus reaction is documented, wait at least 10 years before the next dose [^1148ADWt] [^113ofiLX].

---

## Incidence and severity of arm pain

- **Pain incidence**: Injection-site pain is the most common local reaction, reported by 58–87% of recipients [^112knntH] [^115mKPVa].
- **Severity**: Most pain is mild to moderate; severe pain occurs in about 3–4% of recipients [^112knntH].
- **Duration**: Pain typically begins within 24 hours, peaks at 1–2 days, and resolves within 3–5 days [^114P4jY9].

---

## Factors influencing severity and duration

Several factors influence the **severity and duration** of arm pain after tetanus vaccination:

| **Factor** | **Influence on pain** |
|-|-|
| Age | Younger adults report more pain than older adults [^notfound] |
| Sex | Females report more pain than males [^notfound] |
| Needle length | Shorter needles increase risk of local reactions and pain [^111U1xY9] |
| Injection site | Deltoid injections have higher risk of local reactions than thigh injections in children [^116Hritt] |
| Interval since last dose | Shorter intervals (< 2 years) increase local reactions [^112Qpan3] |

---

## Clinical management of arm pain

Most cases of arm pain after tetanus vaccination are self-limited and **managed supportively**:

- **Ice application**: Apply ice packs to the injection site for 15–20 minutes every few hours during the first 24–48 hours [^1134kSPC].
- **Analgesics**: Acetaminophen or NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen) are effective for pain relief [^1134kSPC].
- **Rest**: Avoid strenuous activities involving the injected arm for 24–48 hours [^1134kSPC].

---

## Potential complications and rare adverse events

While most arm pain is benign, **rare complications** can occur:

- **Arthus reaction**: A rare, severe local hypersensitivity reaction with extensive swelling, erythema, and pain, typically occurring 4–12 hours after vaccination [^1148ADWt].
- **Shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA)**: Persistent shoulder pain due to improper injection technique or pre-existing shoulder pathology [^115RyatE].
- **Brachial neuritis**: Rare neurological complication characterized by severe arm pain followed by weakness, typically resolving within months [^115boLja].

---

## Long-term outcomes and recurrence risk

Long-term outcomes are **generally favorable**, with most cases resolving without sequelae. Recurrence risk is low; future tetanus-containing vaccines can be administered safely unless a severe reaction (e.g. Arthus reaction) occurred previously [^1148ADWt].

---

## Patient education and counseling

Patients should be counseled on the **expected duration** of pain and the use of ice and analgesics. They should also be advised to seek medical attention for persistent pain beyond 7 days, severe swelling, redness, or systemic symptoms. Emphasize the importance of tetanus vaccination despite mild arm pain, as the benefits outweigh the risks [^114P7SeM].

---

Arm pain after tetanus vaccination is common and usually mild, resolving within a few days; **supportive care suffices**. Persistent or severe pain needs evaluation for rare complications, and future tetanus vaccines remain indicated unless a severe reaction occurred.

Tetanus Prophylaxis for Wound Management Recommendations

A tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated for wound management when > 5 years have passed since the last tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine dose. If a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated for persons aged ≥ 11 years, Tdap is preferred for persons who have not previously received Tdap or whose Tdap history is unknown. If a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated for a pregnant woman, Tdap should be used. For nonpregnant persons with documentation of previous Tdap vaccination, either Td or Tdap may be used if a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine is indicated. Complete information on tetanus prophylaxis and the use of tetanus immunoglobulin when indicated for wound management is available at.

Interval of Tdap After Td

When Tdap was licensed in 2005, the safety of administering a dose of Tdap at intervals < 5 years after Td or pediatric DTP/DTaP had not been studied. Evaluations of the safety of administering Tdap at intervals < 5 years after Td, including as short as 18 months, suggest that the safety of much shorter intervals is acceptable. Two studies were conducted in adults who received a Tdap or combined Tdap-inactivated polio (Tdap-IPV) vaccine < 2 years following a previous Td-containing vaccine. Observed adverse events were limited to local reactions, including pain (68%–83%), erythema (20%–25%), and swelling (19%–38%). Although serious adverse events did not occur, the numbers of subjects in these studies were small and the potential for rare, but serious, adverse events cannot be excluded. ACIP concluded that although longer intervals between Td and Tdap vaccination could decrease the occurrence of local reactions, the benefits of protection against pertussis outweigh the potential risk for adverse events.

Persons Aged 7–10 Years

ACIP concluded that the overall safety of Tdap and the frequency of local reactions in persons aged 7–10 years who have not completed the childhood DTaP series likely would be similar to those observed in children who received 4 doses of DTaP. Although both Tdap products are approved for use in persons as young as age 10 years, no data have been published regarding the safety of Tdap in children aged 7–9 years who have never received pertussis-containing vaccines. Several studies assessing the safety and immunogenicity of Tdap or Tdap-IPV as the fifth dose of acellular pertussis vaccine in children aged 4–8 years were reviewed. No increase in the risk for severe local reactions or systemic adverse events was observed. The most commonly reported adverse events that occurred within 15 days after receipt of Tdap were pain (40%–56%), erythema (34%–53%), and swelling (24%–45%). Fewer local reactions were observed or reported among Tdap or Tdap-IPV recipients compared with those who received DTaP or DTaP-IPV, but the differences were not statistically significant. No differences were noted when children aged 4–6 and 7–8 years were compared with respect to the frequency of solicited or unsolicited adverse reactions following vaccination with Tdap-IPV.

### A case of tetanus infection in an adult with a protective tetanus antibody level [^116799zH]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Tetanus is a bacterial infection caused by Clostridium tetani and most commonly presents as trismus or other muscle spasms. Despite the development of the tetanus toxoid vaccine, tetanus infection has not been eradicated. Additionally, while there are hypothesized protective levels of tetanus antibody, tetanus infection may still occur in properly vaccinated individuals. We report the case of a 31-year-old male that presented to the emergency department (ED) with a 2-day history of neck and jaw pain. He reports puncturing his hand with a rusty nail 10 days prior. His reported vaccination history was that he received his last booster vaccination 13 years prior to presentation. In the ED, tetanus vaccine, tetanus immune globulin, and metronidazole were administered. His symptoms improved over the next 2 days and resolved at day 6. Despite his presentation of tetanus infection and rule out of other causes for his symptoms, his tetanus antibody level was reported at 8.4 U/mL, which is considered to be protective. A tetanus antibody level that is adequate for protective immunity should not preclude a patient from treatment of tetanus infection. This case demonstrates that a thorough history, physical exam, and rule out of other causes should guide treatment when there is concern for a tetanus infection.

### Use of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine among adults aged ≥ 65 years: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^116MFZvx]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

What are the new recommendations?

Both PCV13 and PPSV23 should be routinely administered in series to all adults aged ≥ 65 years. The recommendations for routine PCV13 use among adults aged ≥ 65 years will be reevaluated in 2018 and revised as needed. ACIP recommendations for routine use of PCV13 in adults aged ≥ 19 years with immunocompromising conditions, functional or anatomic asplenia, cerebrospinal fluid leak, or cochlear implants remain unchanged.

Safety of PCV13 was evaluated in approximately 6,000 PPSV23-naïve and PPSV23-experienced adults aged ≥ 50 years. Overall incidence of serious adverse events reported within 1 month of an initial study dose of PCV13 or PPSV23 did not differ between the two vaccines and ranged from 0.2% to 1.7%. From 1 to 6 months after an initial study dose, the overall incidence of serious adverse events ranged from 1.2% to 5.8% among persons vaccinated with PCV13 and 2.4% to 5.5% among persons vaccinated with PPSV23. Rates of reported serious adverse events in the treatment groups were similar among studies that enrolled PPSV23-naïve subjects and studies that enrolled PPSV23-experienced subjects. Common adverse reactions reported with PCV13 were pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site; limitation of movement of the arm in which the injection was given; fatigue; headache; chills; decreased appetite; generalized muscle pain; and joint pain. Similar reactions were observed in adults who received PPSV23.

Summary of Key Findings

Safety and immunogenicity. Two clinical trials found no increased risk for adverse events among adults who received Tdap, compared with those who received Td 10 years after receipt of the initial Tdap dose. In addition, the proportion of persons with seroprotective levels of antibodies to tetanus and diphtheria was similar in the Tdap and Td groups. Another clinical trial compared adults receiving a second dose of Tdap 9 years after their initial Tdap dose with adults receiving Tdap for the first time as a control group. Solicited adverse events, the most frequent of which were injection site pain, fatigue, and headache, were higher in the groups receiving a second dose of Tdap. Grade 3 adverse events, defined in this study as redness and swelling with diameter > 50 mm, pain, headaches, fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms preventing normal activity, and fever with temperature > 104°F(40°C), were similar in both groups. A retrospective VSD study identified 68,915 adolescents and adults who had received an initial dose of Tdap and then received another Td-containing vaccine, either a second Tdap (61,394, 89%) or Td (7,521, 11%). There was no statistically significant increase in medical visits for cellulitis, limb swelling, pain in limb, seizure, cranial nerve disorders, paralytic syndromes, encephalopathy, encephalitis, or meningitis among those who received a subsequent dose of Tdap compared with those who received Td.

### Vaccination site and risk of local reactions in children 1 through 6 years of age [^114u6KXz]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to assess whether the occurrence of medically attended local reactions to intramuscularly administered vaccines varies by injection site (arm versus thigh) in children 1 to 6 years of age.

Methods

This is a retrospective cohort study of children in the Vaccine Safety Datalink population from 2002 to 2009. Site of injection and the outcome of medically attended local reactions were identified from administrative data.

Results

The study cohort of 1.4 million children received 6.0 million intramuscular (IM) vaccines during the study period. The primary analyses evaluated the IM vaccines most commonly administered alone, which included inactivated influenza, hepatitis A, and diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines. For inactivated influenza and hepatitis A vaccines, local reactions were relatively uncommon, and there was no difference in risk of these events with arm versus thigh injections. The rate of local reactions after DTaP vaccines was higher, and vaccination in the arm was associated with a significantly greater risk of this outcome compared with vaccination in the thigh, both for children 12 to 35 months (relative risk: 1.88 [95% confidence interval: 1.34–2.65]) and 3 to 6 years of age (relative risk: 1.41 [95% confidence interval: 0.84–2.34]), although this difference was not statistically significant in the older age group.

Conclusions

Injection in the thigh is associated with a significantly lower risk of a medically attended local reaction to a DTaP vaccination among children 12 to 35 months of age, supporting current recommendations to administer IM vaccinations in the thigh for children younger than 3 years of age.

### Injection site and risk of medically attended local reactions to acellular pertussis vaccine [^116Hritt]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess whether the risk of medically attended local reactions to the fifth dose of the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine varies according to injection site (arm versus thigh).

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children aged 4 through 6 years in the Vaccine Safety Datalink population who received a DTaP vaccination during the period from 2002 through 2006. Medically attended local reactions to the DTaP vaccine were presumptively identified from administrative data and were confirmed by medical record review.

Results

Among the 233,616 children in the study population, 1017 (0.4%) had a confirmed medically attended local reaction to the fifth dose of the DTaP vaccine. The rate of those reactions was significantly higher with vaccinations given in the arm (47.4 per 10,000 vaccinations) compared with vaccinations given in the thigh (32.1 per 10,000 vaccinations) (P < .001). In a multivariable analysis adjusted for age, gender, and study site, children vaccinated in the arm had a 78% higher risk of a local reaction (relative risk: 1.78 [95% confidence interval: 1.43–2.21]).

Conclusions

Local reactions to the fifth dose of the DTaP vaccine that require medical evaluation are uncommon, but the risk of those reactions is significantly higher when the vaccine is injected in the arm. These findings suggest that the thigh should be considered as an acceptable site of injection for this vaccination.

### A randomized controlled trial administration of tetanus toxoid (TT) versus tetanus and reduced diphtheria (Td) in pregnant women [^115tLSGr]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

The present study was designed as a randomized clinical trial to compare the immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and efficacy of tetanus toxoid (TT) and the combined tetanus and reduced diphtheria (Td) in pregnant women in four rural communities in Egypt. The pregnant women in each four villages received either TT or Td randomly. Both TT and Td vaccines are manufactured by the Egyptian Company for Biological Products & Vaccines (VACSERA) in Egypt. A total of 131 pregnant women were enrolled during the time of antenatal care visit (at 20 weeks gestational age of pregnancy) in one of four health units in Abu Homos district, Beheira Governorate, Egypt.

Discussion

Unimmunized women received two random doses of either TT or Td 8 weeks apart during their pregnancy. Outpatient follow-up for adverse reactions occurred at the third day after each vaccine dose as either local effects such as pain, redness, and swelling or systematic effects such as fever, malaise, and headache or body aches which was served as primary safety endpoint. Blood was collected three times from each woman for determination of antibody titer against tetanus and diphtheria by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. The first sample was collected immediately before the first dose, the second before the second dose, and the third sample 1 week after delivery. Active surveillance home visits to all study participants were done twice: the first home visit during the first week after delivery and the second 1 month after labor to report the health status of the mother and the baby. A total of 122 pregnant women received two ordinary doses with interdose intervals within the allowable range and three blood samples were collected in each protocol analysis (62 in the TT group and 60 in the Td group). There was no statistically significant difference between groups in the percentage of reporting a primary safety endpoint (fever, malaise, body ache, headache) or local reactions at the site of injection as redness and swelling, at third day after each dose. While in the Td group, after doses I and II, there was significant reporting pain at injection site as compared with TT group, home visits clinical examination revealed that the mothers and children were normal on in both groups. However, in the TT group, some children suffered from physiological jaundice. In all women in the two groups, protective immunity for tetanus was acquired, which reflected in neutralization of antibodies at titer (> 0.10 IU/ml) after complete vaccination; however, the tetanus geometric mean titers postdoses I and II were significantly higher in TT vaccines group (P < 0.001). The postvaccination seroprotection titer (> 0.10 IU/ml) in diphtheria was significantly higher in Td group than the TT group; diphtheria geometric mean titers of postdose II were significantly higher in Td vaccines as compared to the other group (P < 0.0001). From this results, we can conclude that the use of Td vaccine improves immunogenicity for both tetanus and diphtheria more than the use of TT vaccine alone and we can recommend to replace TT in immunization of pregnant women.

### Pain reduction during pediatric immunizations: evidence-based review and recommendations [^11259Dip]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

The pain associated with immunizations is a source of anxiety and distress for the children receiving the immunizations, their parents, and the providers who must administer them. Preparation of the child before the procedure seems to reduce anxiety and subsequent pain. The limited available data suggest that intramuscular administration of immunizations should occur in the vastus lateralis (anterolateral thigh) for children < 18 months of age and in the deltoid (upper arm) for those > 36 months of age. Controversy exists in site selection for 18- to 36-month-old children. A number of studies suggest that the ventrogluteal area is the most appropriate for all age groups. Longer needles are usually associated with less pain and less local reaction. During the injection, parental demeanor clearly affects the child's pain behaviors. Excessive parental reassurance, criticism, or apology seems to increase distress, whereas humor and distraction tend to decrease distress. Distraction techniques vary with the age, temperament, and interests of the child, but their efficacy is well supported in the literature. Sucrose solution instilled directly into the mouth or administered on a pacifier reduces evidence of distress reliably in children < 6 months of age and should be used routinely. Although there is no perfect topical anesthetic available at this time, selective use for children who are particularly fearful or who have had negative experiences in the past is highly endorsed. Pressure at the site, applied with either a device or a finger, clearly reduces pain. Finally, in the era of multiple injections, it seems that parents prefer that multiple injections be given simultaneously, rather than sequentially, if there are enough personnel available. Immunizations are stressful for many children; until new approaches are developed, systematic use of available techniques can significantly reduce the burden of distress associated with these procedures.

Tetanus Toxoid Safety

Tetanus toxoid is one of the most extensively used vaccines globally, either as a monocomponent vaccine (TT) or combined with diphtheria toxoid (DT and Td) and pertussis antigens (DTP, DTaP, and Tdap). Historically, mild local reactions (i.e. redness, pain and tenderness, and mild swelling) after receipt of TT vaccine are common (0–95%). Systemic reactions (i.e. fever, malaise, headache, and lymphadenopathy) are less common but might occur, particularly after receipt of a booster dose of vaccine. Severe reactions, including neurologic (e.g. peripheral neuropathy, particularly brachial plexus neuropathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, seizures, and acute encephalopathy) and hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylaxis) are exceedingly rare.

An evaluation by IOM concluded that evidence from case reports and uncontrolled studies involving tetanus toxoid–containing vaccines favored a causal relation between tetanus toxoid–containing vaccines and brachial neuritis. Although brachial neuritis is considered to be a compensable event through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), ACIP considers that occurrence of brachial neuritis following vaccination with a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine does not preclude their future use in the same person; brachial neuritis is usually self-limited.

As with the recent conclusions regarding acellular pertussis–containing vaccines, IOM also concluded that the evidence was inadequate to accept or reject a causal relation between receipt of diphtheria toxoid- and tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine and encephalitis, encephalopathy, infantile spasms, seizures, ataxia, autism, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, transverse myelitis, optic neuritis, onset of multiple sclerosis in adults, relapse of multiple sclerosis in adults, relapse of multiple sclerosis in children, Guillain-Barré syndrome, chronic inflammatory disseminated polyneuropathy, opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome, or Bell's palsy. ACIP considers Guillain-Barré syndrome occurring < 6 weeks after receipt of a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine a precaution for subsequent administration of tetanus toxoid–containing vaccines. Active surveillance data covering two million doses of Tdap administered to both adolescent and adult populations failed to demonstrate an association between receipt of a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine and onset of Guillain-Barré syndrome within six weeks following vaccination.

### Prevention of pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria with vaccines in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^116GATpn]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

This report compiles and summarizes all previously published recommendations from CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) regarding prevention and control of pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria in the United States, specifically after the introduction of acellular pertussis vaccines, and does not contain any new recommendations. A timeline of ACIP recommendations for DTaP and Tdap during 1991–2015 is available at. This report describes the process undertaken and the rationale used in support of these recommendations and is intended for use by clinicians and public health providers as a resource.

From the late 1940s through the 1990s, vaccination against pertussis, diphtheria, and tetanus with a combined diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole-cell pertussis (DTP) vaccine was recommended for infants and young children. Receipt of DTP was commonly associated with local adverse events (e.g. redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site) and less commonly with serious adverse events. Because of safety concerns about the whole-cell pertussis component of DTP, diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines were developed and subsequently replaced doses of DTP in the 1990s. Since 1997, infants and young children have been recommended to receive a 5-dose series of DTaP. In 2005, ACIP recommended that adolescents and adults receive a single dose of a tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine. After receipt of Tdap, adolescents and adults are recommended to receive a booster dose of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) vaccine every 10 years or when indicated for wound management. In 2012, in an effort to reduce the burden of pertussis in infants, ACIP recommended a dose of Tdap for women during each pregnancy.

There are no published data comparing rates of adverse events among pregnant women who received multiple doses of Tdap during a single pregnancy with those who received a single Tdap dose and additional Td doses for catch-up vaccination. A cohort study examining reactogenicity of Tdap in pregnant women included only eight study participants who received > 1 Tdap dose within a 12-month period; none experienced severe reactions or fever. A VSD study examining safety of Tdap during pregnancy identified 187 women who had received > 1 Tdap dose during a single pregnancy among 633,542 singleton pregnancies screened for potential study inclusion. Although these 187 women were excluded from the published study, the authors found similar rates of adverse birth outcomes (i.e. small for gestational age, preterm delivery, and low birthweight) in these women compared with women who had received a single Tdap dose in pregnancy (29,155). Among these 187 women who received > 1 Tdap dose during pregnancy, one had a medically attended acute adverse event, which was diagnosed as limb pain and swelling 7 days after vaccination. One woman received 3 Tdap doses during a single pregnancy; she did not experience any adverse events, and her baby was born at term (CDC, unpublished data, 2019).

DISCUSSION

In this study, more than 1000 adults received a dose of Tdap vaccine approximately 10 years after their first dose. The second dose was well tolerated, and its safety profile was indistinguishable from that of control participants who were immunized with Td vaccine. High antibody responses to all vaccine component antigens were elicited. The results of this study are consistent with those of previous studies of this vaccine in which second doses were given 5 years and 10 years after the first dose. In both of those studies, rates of headache, malaise (only collected in 1 study), myalgia, and injection-site pain were similar to those in our study; rates of injection-site erythema, swelling, and fever tended to be lower in our study. Antibody GMCs against the 4 pertussis antigens, diphtheria, and tetanus were remarkably similar in the 3 repeat-dosing studies.

RESULTS

Study Participants

Of 713 randomized female participants aged 18‒49 years, 709 were vaccinated across all groups (Figure 1). Overall, 695 participants completed the visit 1 month after vaccination, and 14 withdrew before the visit; all withdrawals were lost to follow-up. Demographic characteristics were similar across vaccine groups; 70.9% were White, 21.0% Black or African American, 13.7% Hispanic or Latino, and 5.8% Asian. Mean age was 35.6 (standard deviation, 8.9) years (Table 1).

Safety

The observed incidence of reported local reactions in the left arm (RSVpreF in the RSVpreF groups or placebo in the placebo/Tdap group) and systemic events was generally similar across vaccine groups with the exception of injection site pain, which was more common in groups that received 240 μg antigen with Al(OH)₃ (Figure 2). Two participants reported severe pain at the injection site (1 participant each in the RSVpreF 120 μg/Tdap and RSVpreF 240 μg + Al[OH]₃ /placebo groups). Three participants reported a fever of grade ≥ 4 (2 in the RSVpreF 120 μg/Tdap group and 1 in the placebo/Tdap group). Most other local reactions and systemic events were mild or moderate in severity. Median duration of local reactions after vaccination was similar across vaccine groups and ranged from 1.0 to 2.0 days for injection site pain and redness and 1.5 to 2.5 days for swelling. Median duration of systemic events was also similar across vaccine groups and ranged from 1.0 to 2.0 days for nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, muscle pain, and joint pain and 2.0 to 3.0 days for fatigue/tiredness. Median fever duration was 1.0 day.

### Safety of reduced-antigen-content tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine in adolescents as a sixth consecutive dose of acellular pertussis-containing vaccine [^116DDkgF]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The safety of a booster dose of a reduced-antigen-content tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine was evaluated in adolescents previously vaccinated with five doses of acellular pertussis-containing vaccine.

Study Design

Adolescents (n = 319) previously vaccinated with either 5 doses of diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) (n = 193) or 4 doses of DTaP plus another acellular pertussis-containing vaccine received one dose each of Tdap and hepatitis A vaccine in a double-blinded, randomized, crossover trial. Rates of adverse events (AEs) after vaccination with Tdap versus hepatitis A and rates of local AEs among adolescents vaccinated with Tdap (sixth acellular pertussis-containing vaccine dose) versus rates in these same individuals after vaccination with their fifth DTaP dose were assessed.

Results

After Tdap, pain (63.6%), redness (51.7%), and swelling (41.4%) were the most frequently reported AEs. Large injection site swelling (swelling > 100 mm, arm circumference increase > 50 mm or diffuse swelling interfering with daily activities) occurred in three adolescents and resolved without sequelae. After the sixth dose of acellular pertussis-containing vaccine, adolescents reported more pain and less redness and swelling compared with incidences of these AEs reported when these same individuals received their fifth DTaP dose.

Conclusions

These results suggest that Tdap is well tolerated as a sixth consecutive dose of acellular pertussis-containing vaccine.

### How soon after a prior tetanus-diphtheria vaccination can one give adult formulation tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine? [^112MkMia]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Adult formulation tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccines (Tdap) have been developed to prevent pertussis in adolescents and adults. There are concerns that unacceptable rates of severe injection site reactions, including Arthus-type reactions might occur if Tdap is administered too soon after a previous tetanus and diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine formulated for infants and younger children (TD) or older children and adults (Td).

Methods

To evaluate whether adverse reactions after Tdap might be related to time since last receipt of TD/Td, we performed an open label, province-wide, clinical trial comparing the reactogenicity of Tdap given 18 months-9 years versus ≥ 10 years after a previous TD/Td.

Results

Seven thousand one hundred fifty-six children and adolescents were enrolled in the study (464–963 subjects per cohort), and 7001 had documented dates of the previous immunization within the specified intervals; adverse event data were provided by 5931 (84.7%). No whole limb swelling, Arthus-like reactions or serious adverse events related to vaccination were reported. No differences in reports of fever were found by interval since last immunization. Injection site erythema and swelling were slightly and statistically significantly increased among those participants with most recent prior TD/Td. Compared with the 10-year interval group, the maximum increase for any other group was ≤ 8.6% for any erythema, ≤ 6% for erythema > 10 mm, ≤ 10.3% for any swelling, ≤ 6.9% for swelling > 10 mm, ≤ 5.2% for any pain and ≤ 3.7% for moderate/severe pain.

Conclusion

Although there is a slight increase in injection site events with decreasing interval since a previous immunization, Tdap can be safely administered at intervals of ≥ 18 months since a previous TD/Td vaccine.

### Complex regional pain syndrome following immunisation [^111DSdCr]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2012). Low credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS-1) is a clinical syndrome that affects one or more extremities and is characterised by persistent pain disproportionate to any inciting event, and at least one sign of autonomic dysfunction in the affected limb(s). The pathogenesis of this syndrome is poorly understood, but its onset is often precipitated by a physical injury, such as minor trauma, fracture, infection or a surgical procedure. In the literature, there are reports of CRPS-1 following immunisation with rubella and hepatitis B vaccines. Here we present a case series of CRPS-1 following immunisation in adolescents, with either diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (1 case), or human papillomavirus vaccines (4 cases). Enhanced awareness of this syndrome and its potential to occur following immunisation in the paediatric population is vital to the prompt and effective management of this condition.

### Safety of a fifth dose of diphtheria and tetanus toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccine in children experiencing extensive, local reactions to the fourth dose [^111xCLLz]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Extensive local reactions have been reported after booster doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccine, but few data are available on revaccination after these reactions. Of 20 children with extensive local reactions after dose 4, only 4 experienced entire upper arm swelling and 7 had swelling > 5 cm after dose 5. These reactions were well tolerated and support revaccination.

AE Monitoring

Temperature and solicited AEs were recorded daily by each participant on a diary card for 1 week after immunization; unsolicited AEs were collected until the follow-up serology visit 1 month after immunization. Solicited injection-site events were erythema, swelling, and pain. Systemic solicited AEs were fever, headache, malaise, and myalgia. AE severity was described as grade 1 (erythema or swelling measuring ≥ 25 to ≤ 50 mm, temperature of ≥ 38.0 to ≤ 38.4°C, and, for all other AEs, no interference with activity), grade 2 (erythema or swelling measuring ≥ 51 to ≤ 100 mm, temperature of ≥ 38.5 to ≤ 38.9°C, and, for all other AEs, some interference with activity), or grade 3 (erythema or swelling measuring > 100 mm, temperature of ≥ 39°C, and, for all other AEs, prevention of daily activity). Medically attended AEs and SAEs were collected until the end of participation in the study after the 6-month telephone contact.

Immunogenicity

Sera collected on days 0 and 28 were assayed for antibodies against diphtheria and tetanus toxins and Bordetella pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, PRN, and FIM); all assays were performed in the laboratories of Sanofi Pasteur in Swiftwater, Pennsylvania, by technicians who were unaware of vaccine allocation. Tetanus antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and expressed in international units per milliliter (IU/mL) using the WHO human reference standard TE3; the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of the assay was 0.01 IU/mL. Diphtheria antibodies were measured by toxin microneutralization on Vero cells and expressed in international units per milliliter using the WHO international standard; the LLOQ was 0.005 IU/mL. Pertussis antibodies against PT, FHA, PRN, and FIM were measured by ELISA and expressed as ELISA units per milliliter (EU/mL) using a company reference serum standard; the LLOQ was 4 EU/mL for PT, PRN, and FIM antibodies and 3 EU/mL for FHA antibodies.

### Parsonage-Turner syndrome after COVID-19 vaccination in a child [^111oR7RT]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Parsonage-Turner syndrome (PTS) is a rare peripheral neuropathy involving the brachial plexus characterized by sudden onset pain affecting the upper extremity associated with muscle weakness. With an estimated incidence of 1.64 cases per 100,000 people, PTS usually develops in people aged between 20 and 60 years, being very rare in children.

The diagnosis is based on clinical history, physical examination, electrophysiological study, and exclusion of other pathologies. The clinical picture of PTS is very diverse because a large variety of nerves can be affected. Muscle paresis commonly manifests as scapula alata, secondary to paresis of the muscles involved in scapular fixation. Pain is the first symptom in 90% of patients, being the location of pain variable, but in most cases radiated from the cervical spine or shoulder region into the arm. Electrodiagnostic testing is widely used to diagnose PTS. Abnormal sensory potentials, lack of denervation potentials, and abnormal conduction velocities are the most frequent findings.

The etiology and pathophysiology of PTS still remain unclear. Recent viral infections, such as herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, HIV, hepatitis B virus, and parvovirus B19 infections, have been reported as the probable trigger in 25% of patients with PTS. Vaccination has been described to precede PTS in 4.3% to 15.5% of cases. To date, only a few cases of PTS after COVID-19 vaccination have been reported, none of them in the childhood. -

In this study, we report a case of a child affected by PTS after the second dose of COVID-19 vaccination.

§ Persons with HIV infection or severe immunodeficiency who have contaminated wounds should also receive TIG, regardless of their history of tetanus immunization.

¶ Yes, if > 10 years since the last tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine dose.

 Yes, if ≥ 5 years since the last tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine dose.

Persons who have completed the 3-dose primary tetanus vaccination series and have received a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine < 5 years earlier are protected against tetanus and do not require a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine or TIG as part of wound management. An attempt should be made to determine whether a patient has completed the 3-dose primary tetanus vaccination series. Persons with unknown or uncertain previous tetanus vaccination histories should be considered to have had no previous tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine. Persons who have not completed the primary series might require tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine and passive vaccination with TIG at the time of wound management (Table 6). When both TIG and a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine are indicated, the products should be administered using separate syringes at different anatomical sites. Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or severe immunodeficiency who have contaminated wounds should also receive TIG, regardless of their history of tetanus immunizations.

Persons with a history of an Arthus reaction following a previous dose of a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine should not receive a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine until > 10 years after the most recent dose; this interval is recommended regardless of the wound condition (e.g. even if contaminated or severe). In all circumstances, the decision to administer TIG should be based on the primary vaccination history for tetanus (Table 6).

### Administering diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccines… [^111ToD9U]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Administering Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis Vaccines On This Page This page provides a brief summary of guidance for administering diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccines, including route, number of doses, and co-administration with other vaccines. Visual Inspection Do not use any diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine or diluent beyond the expiration date printed on the label. Prior to administration, visually inspect the vaccine for particulate matter and/or discoloration. If these conditions exist, do NOT use. Just before use, shake vial or manufacturer-filled syringe well. Do not use vaccine if you cannot resuspend it after thorough agitation.
- After shaking, Td should be a cloudy, whitish-gray colored liquid.
- After shaking, Tdap should be a cloudy, white-colored liquid. Administer all diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccines by the. intramuscular route.

Infants and young children: The preferred injection site is the vastus lateralis muscle of the thigh. Older children and adults: The preferred injection site is the deltoid muscle in the upper arm. Use a needle length appropriate for the age and size of the person receiving the vaccine. Administering Vaccines: Dose, Route, Site, and Needle Size Immunization Action Coalition. Number and Timing of Doses The number and timing of doses depends on the type of vaccine used and the person receiving the vaccine. Infants and young children CDC recommends DTaP for all infants and children younger than 7 years of age. If the pertussis component is contraindicated, use Td to complete the primary series in this age group.
- The recommended DTaP series is 5 doses, administered at 2, 4, and 6 months, 15 through 18 months, and 4 through 6 years.
- Administer the fourth dose of DTaP no earlier than 6 months after the third dose.

However, you do not need to repeat the fourth dose if it was administered at least four months after the third dose.
- Do not administer the fourth dose of DTaP to children younger than 12 months of age. You can give it to children at 12 through 15 months of age if the child is unlikely to return at 15 through 18 months of age; this is an off-label recommendation from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
- The fifth dose of DTaP is not necessary if the patient received the fourth dose on or after their fourth birthday. Older children and adults CDC recommends 1 dose of Tdap for all adolescents.
- The preferred age for Tdap administration in adolescents is 11 to 12 years.
- If adolescents missed getting Tdap at 11 to 12 years of age, administer at the next patient encounter or sooner if adolescent will have close contact with infants.
- You can administer Tdap regardless of interval since the last tetanus toxoid- and diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine. CDC recommends 1 dose of Tdap for women during each pregnancy.
- The preferred timing for Tdap administration in pregnancy is during the early part of gestational weeks 27 through 36.
- You can safely administer Tdap earlier in pregnancy if it is indicated for wound care or during a community pertussis outbreak. If you administer Tdap earlier in pregnancy, do not repeat vaccination between 27 and 36 weeks gestation; CDC recommends only one dose during each pregnancy.
- You can administer Tdap regardless of interval since the last tetanus toxoid- and diphtheria toxoid- containing vaccine.
- Do not offer Tdap as part of routine preconception care.
- CDC only recommends Tdap in the immediate postpartum period for new mothers who did not receive Tdap during their current pregnancy and did not receive a prior dose of Tdap (i.e.

Adverse Events

Rates of solicited AEs following immunization were similar in Tdap and Td vaccine recipients (Table 2). A total of 87.7% (95% CI, 85.5%–89.7%) of Tdap vaccine recipients and 88.0% (95% CI, 84.0%–91.3%) of Td vaccine recipients reported at least 1 injection-site reaction; a grade 3 reaction was reported by only 3.9% (95% CI, 2.8%–5.3%) of Tdap vaccine recipients and 2.8% (95% CI, 1.3%–5.2%) of Td vaccine recipients. Injection-site pain was the most common AE and was reported by 87.1% (95% CI, 84.8%–89.1%) of Tdap vaccine recipients and 87.4% (95% CI, 83.3%–90.8%) of Td vaccine recipients; only 3.6% (95% CI, 2.5%–4.9%) of Tdap vaccine recipients and 2.8% (95% CI, 1.3%–5.2%) of Td vaccine participants reported grade 3 injection-site pain. Systemic AEs were reported by 72.5% (95% CI, 69.6%–75.3%) of Tdap vaccine recipients and 71.7% (95% CI, 66.5%–76.5%) of Td vaccine recipients; grade 3 events were reported by 6.6% (95% CI, 5.1%–8.4%) and 7.7% (95% CI, 5.0%–11.1%), respectively. Myalgia was the most common systemic AE, reported by 58.1% (95% CI, 55.0%–61.3%) of Tdap vaccine recipients and 58.2% (95% CI, 52.6%–63.6%) of Td vaccine recipients. Fever was uncommon, reported by only 0.9% (95% CI, 0.4%–1.7%) of Tdap vaccine recipients and 1.8% (95% CI, 0.7%–4.0%) of Td vaccine recipients. Similar proportions of Tdap and Td vaccine recipients reported unsolicited AEs (26.2% and 25.9%, respectively); no apparent differences in the nature or frequency of any of the unsolicited AEs grouped according to the MedDRA system or preferred terms were found.

### Reactogenicity of tetanus, diphtheria, 5-component acellular pertussis vaccine administered as a sixth consecutive acellular pertussis vaccine dose to adolescents [^111TzgQc]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Safety of a sixth consecutive dose of acellular pertussis vaccine in adolescents was assessed in a 2-armed, randomized study.

Methods

Adolescents who had received 5 doses of acellular pertussis vaccine combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (6-dose group) received 1 dose of reduced 5-component acellular pertussis vaccine combined with tetanus toxoid and reduced diphtheria toxoid (Tdap). Adolescents who had received a primary series of 3 doses of whole-cell pertussis and 1 acellular or whole-cell pertussis booster received 1 dose of Tdap vaccine (5-dose group).

Results

Of 214 participants, 176 (82%) reported an injection-site reaction with pain (80%), erythema (22%), and swelling (19%) most frequently reported. A systemic reaction was reported by 169 of 214 (79%) with myalgia (66%), headache (42%), malaise (39%), and fever (9%) most frequently reported. The overall rate of solicited reactions was lower in the 6-dose group than in the 5-dose group (for injection-site reactions: 76.1% vs. 89.7%; for systemic reactions 72.6% vs. 86.6%). Significant differences were observed for injection-site pain, erythema, and for grade 1 or grade 2 increases in arm circumference. Fever, myalgia, and headache were reported at a significantly lower rate in the 6-dose group. Swelling > 10 cm was observed in 5 patients (2%), 4 in the 5-dose group.

Conclusions

Tdap vaccine was safe when given to adolescents who had received 5 prior doses of acellular pertussis vaccine.

### Tetanus [^114ogzLj]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Tetanus [tet′ə-nəs]

From the Greek tetanos ("tension", from teinein, "to stretch"), an often fatal infectious disease caused by the anaerobic bacillus Clostridium tetani. Tetanus was well known to the ancients; Greek physician Aretaeus wrote in the first century, "Tetanus in all its varieties, is a spasm of an exceedingly painful nature, very swift to prove fatal, but neither easy to be removed". Active immunization with tetanus toxoid was described in 1890, but cases continue to be reported (275 in the United States from 2001 through 2010), almost exclusively in persons who were never vaccinated or had not received a booster immunization in the previous 10 years. In developing countries, neonatal tetanus — when infants are infected through nonsterile delivery — is a major contributor to infant mortality. Worldwide, an estimated 59,000 infants died of neonatal tetanus in 2008.

### Missed opportunities for tetanus postexposure prophylaxis – California, January 2008-March 2014 [^11752Q2Q]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Tetanus is an acute and sometimes fatal disease characterized by sudden muscle contractions. The number of tetanus cases reported annually in the United States has declined significantly since the 1930s and 1940s as a result of the introduction of tetanus vaccines. However, sporadic cases continue to occur in persons who are not up-to-date with tetanus toxoid-containing vaccinations (TT) and do not receive appropriate postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). To assess the extent of these cases, the California Department of Public Health reviewed all tetanus cases reported during January 2008–March 2014. A total of 21 tetanus patients were reported; five (24%) died. An average of three cases were reported each year during 2008–2013; the average annual incidence among patients aged ≥ 65 years (0.23 cases per 1 million population) was twice that among patients aged 21–64 years (0.10 cases per 1 million population). Of 16 patients with an acute injury before illness and diagnosis, nine (56%) sought medical care, and two (22%) of the nine received appropriate PEP. Although tetanus is rare, it is a life-threatening disease that is preventable. Health care providers should ensure that their patients are up-to-date with TT vaccination and provide appropriate postexposure prophylaxis for patients with wounds.

During 2008–2010, a confirmed case was defined by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) as a patient with acute onset of hypertonia or painful muscular contractions (usually of the muscles of the jaw and neck) and generalized muscle spasms without other apparent medical cause. * In 2010, CSTE removed the "confirmed" classification and defined all clinically compatible cases as probable. † The California Department of Public Health analyzed all confirmed and probable cases in accordance with CSTE case definitions. Using the CDC tetanus surveillance worksheet, local health department and California Department of Public Health staff reviewed case surveillance and medical record data, including demographics, clinical presentation and course, vaccination status, and wound management. Vaccination and wound data were reviewed to determine whether health care providers followed wound management and PEP recommendations. Tetanus incidence rates were calculated using population estimates from the California Department of Finance. Hospitalization costs were estimated using discharge data from the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development.

### Prevention of pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria with vaccines in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^116JrtfT]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Epidemiology of Tetanus

Tetanus is a life-threatening but vaccine-preventable disease caused by a potent neurotoxin produced by Clostridium tetani. The organism is a ubiquitous, spore-forming, motile Gram-positive bacillus found in high concentrations in soil and animal excrement. C. tetani spores enter the body through breaches in the skin or mucous membranes. Germination of C. tetani spores occurs under anaerobic conditions, such as in necrotic tissue that can result from deep puncture wounds or blunt trauma. C. tetani bacilli vegetate and produce tetanospasmin, a powerful exotoxin that binds irreversibly with neural tissue and causes spasms and rigidity of skeletal muscles. Direct person-to-person transmission of C. tetani does not occur.

The incubation period from injury to symptom onset varies from 3 to 21 days (median: 7 days), with extremes of 1 day to several months. The incubation period depends on the severity and site of the wound. Shorter incubation periods are associated with more severe disease and a poorer prognosis; longer incubation periods are associated with injuries furthest from the central nervous system. The course of disease is variable but is usually intense for ≥ 4 weeks before subsiding. The convalescent period is usually protracted and long-term neurologic sequelae and intellectual and behavioral abnormalities might follow recovery. The case-fatality ratio for tetanus is highest in infants and the elderly, and can be as high as 100% without high-quality medical care, but is approximately 10%–20% even in modern health care facilities.

### Additional recommendations for use of tetanus toxoid, reduced-content diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (tdap) [^112gZXTZ]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are amending previous recommendations and making additional recommendations for the use of tetanus toxoid, reduced-content diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap). Review of the results from clinical trials and other studies has revealed no excess reactogenicity when Tdap is given within a short interval after other tetanus- or diphtheria-containing toxoid products, and accrual of postmarketing adverse-events reports reveals an excellent safety record for Tdap. Thus, the recommendation for caution regarding Tdap use within any interval after a tetanus- or diphtheria-containing toxoid product is removed. Tdap should be given when it is indicated and when no contraindication exists. In further efforts to protect people who are susceptible to pertussis, the American Academy of Pediatrics and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend a single dose of Tdap for children 7 through 10 years of age who were underimmunized with diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP). Also, the age for recommendation for Tdap is extended to those aged 65 years and older who have or are likely to have contact with an infant younger than 12 months (eg, health care personnel, grandparents, and other caregivers).

Key points
- The best ways to prevent tetanus are vaccination and wound management.
- Tetanus vaccination and TIG prophylaxis may be indicated depending on the wound type and patient's vaccination history.
- Antibiotics aren't recommended during wound care to protect against tetanus.
- Follow CDC's immunization schedule to ensure your patients are protected from tetanus. Recommendations Healthcare providers should take the following steps to prevent tetanus:

- Assess the wound and provide appropriate wound care.
- Assess the need for tetanus vaccination and provide if indicated.
- Assess the need for prophylactic tetanus immune globulin and provide if indicated. Wound assessment and care Appropriate wound care consists of
- Assessing the type of wound
- Observing for signs of infection
- Properly treating infected wounds. Assessment Wounds can be categorized based on their tetanus exposure risk.

Clean and minor wounds don't pose a major risk. Dirty or major wounds pose an increased risk. For example, wounds containing devitalized tissue can allow Clostridium tetani to proliferate. The following are examples of dirty or major wounds:

- Penetrating or puncture wounds
- Wounds containing dirt, soil, feces, or saliva
- **Wounds containing devitalized tissue**:

- Burns
- Compound fractures
- Crush injuries
- Frostbite
- **Necrotic or gangrenous wounds Care Healthcare providers should**:

- Clean all wounds
- Remove dirt or foreign material
- Remove or debride necrotic material. Tetanus vaccination status evaluation Vaccination not recommended Regardless of wound type, no tetanus vaccination is needed if the patient meets both criteria below:

- Received last tetanus vaccination less than 5 years ago
- Completed the primary vaccine series.

Vaccination recommended For all wounds
- People with an unknown vaccination history
- Unvaccinated people
- People with an incomplete tetanus primary series For clean and minor wounds People with a complete tetanus primary series who received their last tetanus vaccine 10 or more years ago. For dirty or major wounds People with a complete tetanus primary series who received their last tetanus vaccine 5 or more years ago. TIG assessment TIG contains antibodies against tetanus toxin and functions as an antitoxin. TIG can provide temporary protection against tetanus by directly binding and neutralizing circulating toxin. TIG cannot neutralize toxin that's already bound to nerve endings. TIG prophylaxis indications For clean and minor wounds TIG is never indicated for clean and minor wounds.

For dirty or major wounds
- People with an unknown tetanus vaccination history
- People who have never received tetanus vaccines
- People with an incomplete tetanus vaccine primary series
- People with HIV
- People with a severe immunodeficiency. Care If indicated, administer 250 international units of TIG intramuscularly. TIG is commercially available for purchase. CDC doesn't stockpile or supply TIG.

### The diphtheria and pertussis components of diphtheria-tetanus toxoids-pertussis vaccine should be genetically inactivated mutant toxins [^1152xVAc]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Replacement of cellular with acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines has considerably reduced the systemic reactions observed with diphtheria-tetanus toxoids-pertussis vaccine but has not eliminated the extensive swelling (sometimes involving an entire limb) observed after the fifth injection of diphtheria-tetanus toxoids-aP (DTaP) vaccine. This local reaction, which is likely an Arthus hypersensitivity reaction caused by high levels of antibodies reacting with DTaP vaccine, could discourage its use in adults, who serve as the major reservoir of pertussis for infants. That a critical level of antibodies to pertussis toxin is both essential and sufficient to prevent infection with Bordetella pertussis is derived from data from animal and clinical studies, including data showing the similarities between the immunity induced by diphtheria and pertussis toxoids. The genetically inactivated diphtheria and pertussis mutant toxins are more immunogenic and, therefore, induce comparable levels of antitoxin at lower protein levels than do the formalin-treated native toxins. Replacement of the diphtheria and aP components with these improved antigens will reduce the amount of protein in DTaP vaccine and, most likely, the incidence and severity of local reactions in teenagers and adults.

### Tetanus presenting as painful muscle spasms, dysphagia and delirium in an older adult [^112FnpuN]. Age and Ageing (2021). Medium credibility.

While tetanus is now a rare disease in the UK, it remains an important differential diagnosis for trismus and muscle spasms. Even more so in older adults, as this population is less likely to have received full vaccination. Hence, the highest incidence of tetanus in England is seen in older adults. Written informed consent for publication of their clinical details was obtained from the patient proxy.

### A single-center, randomized, double-blind, positive-controlled, phase IV clinical trial to assess the immunogenicity and safety of adsorbed tetanus toxoid vaccine in individuals aged ≥ 16 years [^112dzf2c]. Human Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Tetanus prevention is effectively managed in infants and young children, yet there remains a need for enhanced measures to improve tetanus prevention among adults.

Methods

This phase IV, single-center, randomized, double-blind, positive-controlled trial evaluated an adsorbed tetanus vaccine in individuals aged ≥ 16 years, stratified into 16–18 years, 19–49 years, and ≥ 50 years cohorts.

Results

Pre-vaccination seroprotection rates (SPR, ≥ 0.1 IU/mL) demonstrated age-dependent declines (44.00%→18.47%→5.38%), paralleled by decreasing geometric mean concentrations (GMC: 0.079 IU/mL → 0.052 IU/mL → 0.033 IU/mL). A single booster dose achieved universal seroprotection (100% SPR) and near-complete seroconversion (SCR ≥ 99.48%) across all groups, elevating GMCs to 6.831 IU/mL (16–18 years), 3.400 IU/mL (19–49 years), and 1.430 IU/mL (≥ 50 years), while two doses in the ≥ 50 years cohort further increased GMC to 2.938 IU/mL with 100% SCR. The vaccine exhibited a favorable safety profile, with mild vaccination-site pain (7.2%) and pruritus (4.2%) as predominant reactions, no vaccine-related serious adverse events, and self-limiting systemic effects (pyrexia: 1.6%; myalgia: 1.2%).

Conclusion

These results confirm robust immunogenicity and safety in adults, supporting tailored booster strategies for aging populations with waning immunity.

### Safety and immunogenicity of biken acellular pertussis vaccine in combination with diphtheria and tetanus toxoid as a fifth dose at four to six years of age. munich vaccine study group [^115mKPVa]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Biken acellular pertussis vaccine in combination with diphtheria and tetanus toxoid (Biken DTaP) vaccine administered to children 4 to 6 years of age who had previously received four doses of Biken DTaP.

Methods

580 children were enrolled to receive one dose of Biken DTaP. Local and systemic reactions were collected by parent diary for all subjects within 3 days after vaccination and in a subset for 14 days. All adverse events occurring within 30 days after vaccination were recorded.

Results

Any redness and swelling occurred in 59.8 and 61.4%, respectively. Redness or swelling larger than 5 cm/10 cm occurred in 31%/6.1% and 25%/6.5% of the children, respectively. Any pain was reported in 58.8%, but clinically significant pain occurred in 2.1% of the children. Fever > 38.0 degrees C occurred in 3.8% of the children. Fussiness, drowsiness, anorexia and vomiting were experienced by 19.7, 15.5, 7.3 and 2.2%, respectively. Sixty-three of 247 adverse events (25%) occurring within 30 days after vaccination were assessed to possibly be vaccine-related. Fifty-eight of the 63 possibly related events (92%) were caused by local reactions as redness, swelling or itchiness. The remaining 5 events included hematoma, headache, stomachache and sleep disturbance. All local and systemic reactions and adverse events resolved without sequelae. Immunogenicity analysis showed a 4-fold antibody increase to pertussis toxin in 97% of subjects and to filamentous hemagglutinin in 82%. All subjects had postvaccination antibody titers of 0.1 IU/ml or greater against diphtheria and tetanus. Higher prevaccination antibody titers against diphtheria toxoid, pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin were associated with a higher frequency of large local reactions.

Conclusion

In comparison with a fourth dose of Biken DTaP administered at 18 to 24 months of age in the same population, the rate of local reactions increased after the fifth dose, whereas systemic reactions remained similarly low or decreased.

RESULTS

Study Population

Of the 6077 randomized subjects, 6000 were vaccinated between 22 February and 9 October 2010: 4004 in the PsA-TT group and 1996 in the PsACWY group (Figure 1). All vaccinated subjects were included in the analyses. The duration of study participation for each subject was 3 months: all subjects completed the initial vaccine period of 28 days, and all but 4 subjects completed the study with an additional 56 days of follow-up (Figure 1). Demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1.
Age, Sex, Height, and Weight of Study Subjects

Figure 1.
Study population. Abbreviations: PsACWY, group A, C, W, Y meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine; PsA-TT, group A meningococcal polysaccharide-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine.

Safety

Primary Endpoint

No vaccine-related SAE occurred during the 3 months of follow-up. Therefore, no further analyses were required on the primary criterion.

Secondary Endpoints

Postimmunization reactions and AEs are shown in Table 2. No allergic or anaphylactic reaction occurred immediately after immunization. Rates of systemic reactions during the first 4 days after immunization, rates of AEs during the first 28 days after immunization, and SAEs within 84 days after immunization were similar among vaccine groups.

Table 2.
Overall Vaccine Safety Profile

However, the rate of local reactions was 3 times as high in the PsA-TT group as in the PsACWY group (13.1% vs 4.3%; P < .0001). All but 2 mild indurations were injection-site tenderness, with a between-group rate difference increasing with age of the subjects. Intensity of tenderness was rated 1 (mild pain to touch) for all subjects in the PsACWY group and for most of the subjects in the PsA-TT group. In the PsA-TT group, tenderness intensity rated 2 (significant pain to touch) was reported as follows: 0 children, 7 adolescents (3.7% of 189 adolescents who reported tenderness), and 21 adults (8.0% of 264 adults who reported tenderness). Only 1 adult reported a tenderness of intensity 3 (significant pain on moving the limb).

Figure 2.
Local reactions (A) and systemic events (B) by maximum severity across vaccination groups within 7 days after vaccination (safety population). Local reactions are those at the injection site of the left deltoid muscle (ie, site of vaccination for GBS6 for the GBS6 + Tdap and GBS6 + placebo groups and for placebo in the Tdap + placebo group). GBS6 indicates group B Streptococcus 6-valent polysaccharide conjugate vaccine; Tdap indicates tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine.

The most frequently reported systemic event was fatigue (GBS6 + Tdap, 51.0%; GBS6 + placebo, 50.5%; Tdap + placebo, 46.6%), followed by headache (GBS6 + Tdap, 35.3%; GBS6 + placebo, 48.5%; Tdap + placebo, 38.8%; Figure 2 B). Fever > 38.9°C was reported in 2 participants (2.0%) in the GBS6 + placebo group. All systemic events lasted for a median of ≤ 3.0 days across all vaccine groups. Fatigue had a median onset of 1.0 days after vaccination in the Tdap + placebo group and 1.5 days after vaccination in both the GBS6 + Tdap and GBS6 + placebo groups; all other systemic events had a median onset of 2.0–3.0 days after vaccination. Antipyretic/pain medications were used for a median of 2.0 days.

### Vaccines for preventing typhoid fever [^117NDcCy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Summary of main results

Ty21a vaccine (three doses)

A three‐dose schedule of Ty21a vaccine probably prevents around half of typhoid cases during the first three years after vaccination (moderate‐certainty evidence). These data include patients aged 3 to 44 years.

Compared with placebo, this vaccine probably does not cause more vomiting, diarrhoea, nausea, or abdominal pain, (moderate‐certainty evidence) headache, or rash (moderate‐certainty evidence); however, fever is probably more common following vaccination (moderate‐certainty evidence).

See Table 1.

Vi polysaccharide vaccine (one dose)

A single dose of Vi polysaccharide vaccine prevents around two‐thirds of typhoid cases in the first year after vaccination (high‐certainty evidence). In year 2, trial results were more variable, with the vaccine probably preventing between 45% and 69% of typhoid cases (moderate‐certainty evidence). These data included participants aged 2 to 55 years of age. The three‐year cumulative efficacy of the vaccine may be around 55% (low‐certainty evidence). These data were taken from a single trial conducted in South Africa in the 1980s in participants aged 5 to 15 years.

Compared with placebo, this vaccine probably did not increase the incidence of fever (moderate‐certainty evidence) or erythema (low‐certainty evidence); however, swelling (moderate‐certainty evidence) and pain at the injection site (moderate‐certainty evidence) were more common in the vaccine group.

See Table 2.

Vi‐rEPA vaccine (two doses)

Administration of two doses of the Vi‐rEPA vaccine probably prevents between 50% and 96% of typhoid cases during the first two years after vaccination (moderate‐certainty evidence). These data were taken from a single trial with children two to five years of age conducted in Vietnam.

Compared with placebo, both the first and the second dose of this vaccine increased the risk of fever (low‐certainty evidence) and the second dose increased the incidence of swelling at the injection site (moderate‐certainty evidence).

See Table 3.

Vi‐TT vaccine (two doses)

We are uncertain of the efficacy of administering two doses of Vi‐TT (PedaTyph) in typhoid cases in children during the first year after vaccination (very low‐certainty evidence). These data are taken from a single cluster‐randomized trial in children aged six months to 12 years conducted in India.

See Table 4.

WIth all vaccines, there were no reported serious adverse effects in RCTs.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2016). Low credibility.

Safety

Data on local reactions at the bivalent rLP2086 injection site were collected from participants in the bivalent rLP2086 + DTaP/IPV group and reactions at the saline injection site from participants in the saline + DTaP/IPV group, which allowed for comparison of local reactions associated with bivalent rLP2086 + saline injections. After vaccinations 1, 2, and 3, local reactions were reported by a higher proportion of participants who received the bivalent rLP2086 vaccine than those who received saline. Injection-site pain was the most commonly reported local reaction after each injection. Most cases of injection-site pain, swelling, and redness were mild or moderate in severity. The median durations of injection-site pain, redness, and swelling in both groups were comparable. One participant in the rLP2086 + DTaP/IPV group withdrew from the study after vaccination 1 because of moderate pain and swelling at the injection site. There was a trend toward lower rates of local reactions with each subsequent dose of the bivalent rLP2086 vaccine. Across all 3 injections, 16.4%–26.1% and 8.0%–18.3% of the participants used antipyretic medications after the bivalent rLP2086 + DTaP/IPV and saline + DTaP/IPV vaccines, respectively.

After vaccination 1, fever (temperature ≥ 38.0°C) was reported in 12.1% of participants in the bivalent rLP2086 + DTaP/IPV group and 5.3% of participants in the saline +DTaP/IPV group. No temperature of ≥ 40.0°C was reported after vaccination 1 or throughout the study. Headache and fatigue were the most commonly reported systemic events after any vaccination. Severe occurrences of headache were reported in 1.1% of participants in the bivalent rLP2086 + DTaP/IPV group and in 2.1% of participants in the saline + DTaP/IPV group. Severe occurrences of fatigue were reported in 4.0% of the participants in the bivalent rLP2086 + DTaP/IPV group and 2.9% of participants in the saline + DTaP/IPV group. Three participants in the bivalent rLP2086 + DTaP/IPV group and no participants in the saline + DTaP/IPV group withdrew from the study after vaccination 1 because of systemic events.

Participants

From 12 August 2022, to 27 April 2023, 306 participants were randomized and 304 were vaccinated and included in the safety population; of these, 102 received GBS6 + Tdap, 99 received GBS6 + placebo, and 103 received Tdap + placebo. Overall, 96.1%, 93.9%, and 94.2% of participants who received GBS6 + Tdap, GBS6 + placebo, and Tdap + placebo, respectively, completed the study (Figure 1). Participant demographics are shown in Table 1 and were generally well balanced across groups. The median age overall was 36.0 (range, 18‒49) years and 73.4% of participants were White.

GBS6 indicates group B Streptococcus 6-valent polysaccharide conjugate vaccine; Tdap indicates tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine.

Table 1.
Demographic and Baseline Characteristics by Vaccine Group (Safety Population)

Safety

Local reactions and systemic events were mostly mild or moderate in severity with no clear differences in frequencies between the 3 vaccination groups (Figure 2). The most frequently reported local reaction was injection-site pain (GBS6 + Tdap, 39.2%; GBS6 + placebo, 45.9%; Tdap + placebo, 33.0%; Figure 2 A). One participant in the GBS6 + placebo group reported severe injection-site pain; all other local reactions were mild or moderate and no grade 4 events were reported. In any vaccine group, the median onset day of any local reaction was the same day as the day of vaccination, and all local reactions lasted for a median of ≤ 2.5 days, except for swelling in the GBS6 + Tdap group, which lasted for a median of 4.5 days.

Case

A 15-year-old boy presented to the clinic because of acute pain and functional impotence in his left shoulder that started 1 week before. Physical examination revealed reduced range of motion for shoulder flexion and abduction because of weakness and pain. He had full flexion and extension of the wrist and fingers as well as hand interosseous muscles. Four weeks earlier, he had received the second dose of the BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, Pfizer-BioNTech) coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine. Since the administration of the first dose, 3 weeks before the second one, he suffered from hypoesthesia in his left shoulder. His medical history was normal. No previous vaccine reactions were recorded. The pain was partially controlled after placing the arm in a sling together with oral nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs. After 2 weeks of treatment, the pain improved, but severe paresis in the left shoulder, mainly in the elevation and abduction involving the deltoid, and also in the infraspinatus muscle, along with hypoesthesia in the lateral aspect of the shoulder, after the distribution of the axillary nerve, still persisted. Cervical spine and left shoulder MRI performed 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms were normal. The electrophysiological study, performed 4 weeks after the onset of symptoms, showed a severe axonal loss of the left axillar nerve with fibrillation and positive spontaneous waves in the deltoid muscle, suggesting a severe acute denervation.

Clinical Guidance

Vaccine Storage and Handling

The vaccine is supplied as single-dose vials containing a 1-mL dose and must be stored frozen at −112°F to −76°F (−80°C to −60°C) for long-term storage. To administer the vaccine, thaw the vial at room temperature until no visible ice is present. The vaccine should be administered immediately after thawing. However, if the vaccine is not used immediately, the thawed vial may be stored at 35.6°F–46.4°F (2°C–8°C) for a maximum of 2 weeks and up to 4 hours at room temperature (up to 77°F [25°C]), protected from light. Additional information is available in the package insert.

Dosage and Administration

Ervebo should be administered as a single 1-mL intramuscular dose, preferably in the deltoid area of the nondominant arm. The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. The vaccination injection site should be covered with a bandage that provides a physical barrier to protect the site from direct contact. The bandage can be removed when there is no visible fluid leakage. Contaminated bandages should be placed in a sealed plastic bag and disposed of in the trash. Hands should be washed with soap and water after disposing the plastic bag. Additional information is available in the package insert.

Adverse Reactions

The most commonly reported injection-site adverse events were pain, swelling, and redness. The most commonly reported systemic adverse events were headache (37%), fever (34%), muscle pain (33%), fatigue (19%), joint pain (18%), nausea (8%), arthritis (5%), rash (4%), and abnormal sweating (3%).

Some vaccinated persons might experience arthralgia and arthritis after vaccination. Typically, arthralgia began within 1–2 days after vaccination, was mild to moderate in intensity, and resolved within 1 week after onset. Typically, arthritis began 1 week after vaccination and resolved within days to weeks after onset. However, some vaccinated persons reported prolonged and recurrent symptoms. One post hoc analysis identified women and persons with a medical history of arthritis to have a 2.2-fold to 2.8-fold higher risk for developing postvaccination arthritis.

Safety

Participants were observed for 30 min after vaccination to ensure their safety, during which, any unsolicited systemic adverse event (AE) was recorded. The occurrence of solicited injection site (pain, erythema and swelling) and systemic reactions (fever, headache, malaise and myalgia) were recorded up to 7 days after vaccination in the participant's diary card provided to the parents/guardians. Parents or guardians were asked to inform the investigators of any potential serious adverse events (SAEs) immediately.

Unsolicited AEs were collected from Day 0 to Day 30 and medically attended AEs (MAAEs) and (SAEs) including AEs of special interest (AESIs) were recorded throughout the study (up to the 6-month [+14 days] follow-up phone call). Adverse events classified as AESIs were generalized seizures (febrile and non-febrile), Kawasaki disease, Guillain–Barré syndrome and idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura.

Adverse events were assessed by the investigator for relatedness to the study vaccine and for intensity (grade 1 intensity [mild] to grade 3 [severe; interrupts usual daily activity]).

Acute Renal Dysfunction and Acute Renal Failure which includes decreased urine output, sudden weight gain, fluid retention/edema, and/or shortness of breath. Such symptoms may suggest kidney damage (see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions [5.3]).
Aseptic Meningitis Syndrome (AMS) which includes severe headache, neck stiffness, drowsiness, fever, sensitivity to light, painful eye movements, nausea and vomiting (see Warnings and Precautions [5.5]).
Hemolysis which includes fatigue, increased heart rate, yellowing of skin or eyes, dark- colored urine (see Warnings and Precautions [5.5]).
Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) which includes trouble breathing, chest pain, blue lips or extremities, fever (see Warnings and Precautions [5.7])

Inform patients that ASCENIV:

Is made from human plasma and may contain infectious agents that can cause disease. While the risk that ASCENIV can transmit an infection has been reduced by screening plasma donors for prior exposure, testing donated plasma, and inactivating or removing certain viruses during manufacturing, patients should report any symptoms that concern them (see Description [11] and Warnings and Precautions [5]).
Can interfere with their immune response to live viral vaccines (e.g., measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella). Instruct patients to notify their healthcare professional of this potential interaction when they are receiving vaccinations (see Drug Interactions [7]).

### A novel VI-diphtheria toxoid typhoid conjugate vaccine is safe and can induce immunogenicity in healthy Indonesian children 2–11 years: a phase II preliminary report [^114FVuYv]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Previous phase 1 study of the Vi-DT vaccine (SK bioscience) conducted in Philippines showed that 100% of subjects in the Vi-DT group whereas 97% of subjects in the Vi-PS group showed seroconversion respectively. The Vi-DT group had a significantly higher GMT than the Vi-PS group (p < 0.001). Our trial also showed similar results where 100% of the subjects in the Vi-DT group showed antibody increment of ≥ 4 fold whereas 93% of subjects in the Vi-PS group showed increment of ≥ 4 fold as compared to baseline. GMT at 28 days post vaccination was also significantly higher in the Vi-DT group as compared to the Vi-PS group (p < 0.001).

A randomized study in India aimed to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of a Vi- tetanus toxoid vaccine (PedaTyph™) in subjects 6 months to 12 years. They were given two doses of vaccines 6 weeks apart. Like our trial, this trial also had pain and fever as the most common adverse reactions. Identical to our trial, 100% of the subjects in this trial exhibited seroconversion at 6 weeks post vaccination.

Another randomized controlled study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a Vi polysaccharide- tetanus toxoid vaccine (Typbar TCV) was carried out in India. This trial involved subjects 2 to 45 years. Similar to our trial, the most common adverse reaction found was fever. 97.3% of subjects who received TCV and 93.1% of subjects who received control (Vi-polysaccharide Typbar) exhibited seroconversion. This value of seroconversion was found higher in our trial where 100% of the subjects who received Vi-DT TCV exhibited seroconversion. Like our trial, this trial had significant GMT increment (p < 0.001).

When compared to the phase II trial on children 6 to < 24 months, both these age groups had pain as the most common local reaction and fever as well muscle pain as the most common systemic reactions. Antibody increment for Vi-DT was slightly higher in 2–11 years age group compared to 6 to < 24 months group (100 and 98.99% respectively). GMT for both groups increased significantly.

Based on the safety and immunogenicity described in this study and previously published papers, it can be concluded that the typhoid conjugate Vi-DT vaccine is safe and immunogenic.

### Trismus, the first symptom in a challenging diagnosis of tetanus [^1132HqG5]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Tetanus is a severe, life-threatening infectious disease present worldwide. The incidence of this disease is very low in developed countries, and practitioners are unfamiliar with its symptoms and signs, resulting in late diagnosis and low recovery rate. Furthermore, main symptoms, such as trismus, are often associated with several confounding factors: these may lead the physician to send patients towards an incorrect diagnostic management and the calling on of wrong specialists. This case focuses on the importance of considering tetanus in the differential diagnosis of trismus associated with systemic symptoms, and discusses the clinical implications of an initial wrong diagnostic pathway.

### Prevention of pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria with vaccines in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^111zAads]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Tdap

Two vaccines are licensed for the pertussis, tetanus and diphtheria vaccination booster dose for adolescents and adults (Table 5). The dose of Tdap is 0.5 mL, administered intramuscularly, preferably into the deltoid muscle. Tdap may be administered simultaneously with other vaccines at a different anatomical site.

Interval between Td and Tdap. ACIP recommends that for pertussis vaccination, when indicated, Tdap should be administered regardless of interval since the last tetanus or diphtheria toxoid–containing vaccine. ACIP concluded that, while longer intervals between Td and Tdap vaccination could decrease the occurrence of local reactions, the benefits of protection against pertussis outweigh the potential risk for adverse events. For persons aged ≥ 7 years with incomplete or unknown vaccine history, the interval between doses of tetanus toxoid–containing vaccines should follow the catch-up series schedule.

Tdap products in adults aged ≥ 65 years. Providers should not miss an opportunity to vaccinate persons aged ≥ 65 years with Tdap. When feasible, Boostrix (approved for use in persons aged ≥ 10 years) should be used for adults aged ≥ 65 years instead of Adacel (approved for use in persons aged 10–64 years); however, ACIP concluded that either vaccine administered to a person aged ≥ 65 years is immunogenic and would provide protection. A dose of either Tdap product is considered valid; therefore, providers may administer the Tdap vaccine they have available.

Td

For tetanus and diphtheria toxoids adsorbed vaccines, there are two licensed vaccines (Table 5). The dose of Td is 0.5 mL, administered intramuscularly, preferably into the deltoid muscle.

### Updated recommendations for use of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (tdap) in pregnant women – advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP), 2012 [^11426iZE]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Safety of Repeat Tdap Administration to Pregnant Women

In 2011, ACIP concluded that available data did not suggest any elevated frequency or unusual patterns of adverse events in pregnant women who received Tdap and that the few serious adverse events reported were unlikely to have been caused by the vaccine; at that time, a dose of Tdap for every pregnancy was not considered. Published data on receipt of 2 doses of Tdap and multiple doses of tetanus toxoid–containing vaccines were reviewed. Receipt of a second dose of Tdap at a 5- or 10-year interval in healthy nonpregnant adolescents and adults was well tolerated; injection site pain was the most commonly reported adverse event (,–). The frequency of reported adverse events for the second dose was similar to the first dose in these same subjects and in naïve controls receiving Tdap for the first time. Of the few serious adverse events reported, none were attributed to the vaccine. Fever was reported in 2.4%–6.5% of recipients of a Tdap booster; the frequency of fever was similar to that in the same subjects after their first Tdap dose and in naïve controls (,–). Studies on short intervals (i.e. within 21 days or ≤ 2 years) between receipt of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) and Tdap or Tdap-inactivated polio vaccine in healthy, nonpregnant adolescents and adults found no serious adverse events. Fever was reported in 1.7%–6.8% of subjects who received Tdap ≤ 2 years after Td; rates were comparable to the control group and to cohorts that received Tdap longer after receipt of Td. The number of subjects in these studies was small, and therefore, the findings do not rule out the possibility of rare but serious adverse events.

### Return of the old guard: a case of tetanus in an unvaccinated patient [^113jKqSr]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 78-year-old woman with no known medical history presented with severe neck pain that began 4 days prior to admission located in the paraspinal cervical region radiating to the shoulders, legs and back. She had associated stiffness of her neck and progression of pain to her jaw and throat with progression to generalised body spasms with lower extremity stiffness and weakness that limited her ability to walk. She quickly developed dysphagia and odynophagia with subsequent generalised spasms and profound hypoxic respiratory failure requiring nasotracheal intubation. The presumptive diagnosis of tetanus was made and she was given tetanus toxoid immune globulin and Tdap vaccine. She was managed in the intensive care unit and after a week of admission, required a tracheostomy and gastrostomy tube placement. She required a prolonged hospitalisation stay of 21 days before being transferred to a long-term vent facility.

Introduction

Vaccines confer safety and are the most effective means of protection against infectious disease as demonstrated by the success of vaccines against polio, smallpox, measles, diphtheria, and tetanus among others. Introduction of infant immunization against these pathogens or their disease-provoking toxins has led to an impressive reduction of global disease burden and improved survival of neonates and children worldwide.

Tetanus is a serious illness caused by exposure of a wound to the spores of the bacterium Clostridium tetani, which persist in soil, dust, saliva, or manure. The bacterial toxins affect the nervous system and infection leads to painful muscle spasms and ultimately to death. Tetanus toxoid (TT), e.g. tetanus toxin inactivated with formaldehyde, is the basis for tetanus vaccine formulations, which induce a strong and long-lasting neutralizing antibody response to the toxin –.

Booster vaccinations are required to acquire long-term protection against tetanus and to maintain immunity over a lifetime. Having established immunity in childhood, adolescents, and adults are recommended to receive booster vaccinations every 10 years at the latest. Reflecting this, in Germany, > 75% of adults have been vaccinated within last 10 years.

TT-induced antibodies represent the correlate of protection for these vaccines, because they neutralize the bacterial toxin, and, thus, prevent disease manifestation. The antibodies are derived from the pool of long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells previously exposed to TT. Anti-TT IgG serum antibody titers above 0.1 IU/ml are considered protective.

The secondary immune response to antigen induces proliferation and differentiation of antigen-specific memory B cells into antibody-secreting cells, which is in vivo accompanied by a transient elevation in serum antibodies. This process has a key role in the neutralization and elimination of pathogens and their virulence factors –. The currently employed in vivo models for batch release testing of TT vaccines are based on inducing in vivo humoral immunity and evaluated either by protection from tetanus toxin challenge or presence of tetanus toxin-specific antibodies.

### Use of lidocaine-prilocaine patch to decrease intramuscular injection pain does not adversely affect the antibody response to diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis-inactivated poliovirus-Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate and hepatitis B vaccines in infants from birth to six months of age [^112WqDKR]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Topical lidocaine-prilocaine (EMLA) effectively decreases the pain associated with minor procedures including immunization, although the effect on the antibody response to diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis-inactivated poliovirus-Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate (DTaP-IPV-Hib) and hepatitis B vaccines has not been assessed.

Objective

To measure the antibody response to DTaP-IPV-Hib and hepatitis B vaccines; to measure pain reduction associated with the use of the lidocaine-prilocaine (EMLA) patch; and to assess safety by comparing adverse reactions.

Participants and Setting

One hundred nine healthy 6-month-old infants (Part A of study) and 56 healthy infants birth to 2 months of age (Part B of study) undergoing primary immunization with DTaP-IPV-Hib and hepatitis B vaccines in an ambulatory setting.

Design and Interventions

Two center, randomized, double blind, controlled trial of EMLA patch or placebo before DTaP-IPV-Hib and hepatitis B immunization. Antibody titers measured at 0 to 2, 6 and 7 months.

Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure was the antibody response to diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis antigens, Haemophilus influenzae type b and hepatitis B by enzyme immunoassay; and poliovirus 1, 2 and 3 by neutralization. The secondary outcomes were pain scores by the Modified Behavioral Pain Scale and drug- and vaccine-associated adverse events collected with a parent diary and structured questionnaire.

Results

There was no difference in the antibody response between the EMLA- and placebo-treated groups as assessed by geometric mean antibody titers, rates of seroconversion or the proportion of participants achieving protective or positive antibody titers postimmunization. At the 6-month visit, EMLA recipients had less pain after immunization (total pain score, 6.75 vs. 7.35; P = 0.005; pain score increase, 3.99 vs. 4.74; P = 0.004) than did placebo recipients. Skin pallor and erythema at the patch application site were more frequently reported after EMLA use. Rates of vaccine-associated adverse events were similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

The EMLA patch has no adverse effect on the antibody response to the vaccine antigens, is effective in reducing pain associated with DTaP-IPV-Hib and hepatitis B immunizations and does not result in any significant or unexpected adverse reactions.

### Prophylaxis with acetaminophen or ibuprofen for prevention of local reactions to the fifth diphtheria-tetanus toxoids-acellular pertussis vaccination: a randomized, controlled trial [^113XV5sQ]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The frequency of local vaccination reactions increases with successive doses of diphtheria-tetanus toxoids-acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine, and local reactions occur for the majority of children receiving the fifth DTaP vaccination. It is not known whether these reactions can be prevented with prophylactic use of acetaminophen or ibuprofen.

Methods

In this 3-group, randomized, blinded, controlled trial, 372 children were assigned randomly, in a 2:2:1 ratio, to receive 3 doses of acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or placebo. The first dose of study medication was administered within 2 hours before the fifth DTaP vaccination, and the remaining 2 doses were given at 6-hour intervals. The primary outcome measures included a local reaction with an area of redness or discoloration ≥ 5 cm in diameter on the evening of or during the 2 days after vaccination, an increase in mid-limb circumference of ≥ 2 cm on the evening of or during the 2 days after vaccination, and a persistent local reaction, defined as an area of redness or discoloration present on the third day after vaccination.

Results

Local reactions with a ≥ 5-cm area of redness or discoloration were reported for 35% of children in the placebo group, compared with 33% of children in the acetaminophen group and 37% of children in the ibuprofen group. There was also no significant difference between the placebo and treatment groups in the proportions of children with a ≥ 2-cm increase in mid-limb circumference or with a persistent local reaction.

Conclusions

We did not find evidence that prophylaxis with acetaminophen or ibuprofen offers a clinically significant benefit in prevention of local reactions to the fifth DTaP vaccination.

### Current practice in the management of tetanus [^114b9ZWR]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Tetanus is still a scourge among the under-privileged populations of the world, and unfortunately remains an important cause of death although a cheap, safe and highly efficacious vaccine is available. The rarity of the disease in some parts of the world results in newly trained physicians being unable to make a clinical diagnosis, and hampers the conduct of adequately powered randomized controlled trials. Several new and experimental pharmacological agents are being used to control the spasms in tetanus, and to combat the autonomic instability that occurs in the disease. New evidence is emerging regarding the use of antibiotics and intrathecal immunoglobulin in tetanus. It is imperative, therefore, that all physicians working in critical care should be aware of the current advances and evidence-based guidelines for management of tetanus in order to achieve the best outcomes, which Rodrigo and colleagues have reviewed in a recent issue of Critical Care.

Tetanus toxoid–containing vaccines and Tdap — About 5% of immunizations cause large local swelling at the injection site. The recommended interval between doses of Td had been 10 years, but a recent study showed the rate of Tdap injection-site reactions was the same in patients who had received Td less than 2 years previously or more than 2 years previously, and another study found no higher rates when a Tdap-containing vaccine was administered 1 month after a Td-containing vaccine or placebo. With the pertussis disease burden continuing to be substantial, it is now recommended that Tdap be given to all adolescents and adults (including those ≥ 65 years of age), regardless of the interval since the last Td.

Arthus Reactions

Arthus reactions (type III hypersensitivity reactions) are rarely reported after vaccination, but can occur after tetanus toxoid- or diphtheria toxoid–containing vaccines (CDC, unpublished data, 2005) (,–). An Arthus reaction is a local vasculitis associated with deposition of immune complexes and activation of complement. Immune complexes form in the setting of a high local concentration of vaccine antigens and high concentration of circulating antibody. Arthus reactions are characterized by severe pain, swelling, induration, edema, hemorrhage, and occasionally necrosis. These symptoms and signs usually occur 4–12 hours after vaccination; by contrast, anaphylaxis (an immediate type I hypersensitivity reaction) usually occurs within minutes of vaccination. As with extensive limb swelling, Arthus reactions usually resolve without sequelae. ACIP recommends that persons who have experienced an Arthus reaction following a dose of tetanus toxoid or diphtheria toxoid–containing vaccine should not receive a tetanus toxoid–containing vaccine more frequently than every 10 years, even for tetanus prophylaxis as part of wound management.

Table 2
Incidence of blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever and protective effectiveness of Vi-TT *

Table 3
Incidence of blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever and protective effectiveness of Vi-TT by age group *

Among the 7-day, active surveillance subset of 2507 children who received SA 14–14–2 and 2500 who received Vi-TT, including participants in the pilot study, the most common complaints were fever (5.3%), a general feeling of unwellness (4.3%), diarrhoea (2.1%), and pain at the injection site (1.6%). Risks of these events were similar in the two vaccine groups. In the 6 months post-vaccination (the period prespecified for analysis), there were 370 serious adverse events reported in the SA 14–14–2 vaccine group and 314 in the Vi-TT group (p = 0.029) among all vaccinees. None was judged related to receipt of vaccine, and no component cause appeared to account for the overall difference (appendix p 8). During the entire period of follow-up, there were 13 deaths in the SA 14–14–2 vaccine group and 25 in the Vi-TT group (p = 0.073); none were judged to be related to vaccination. Although there were 12 more deaths in the Vi-TT group than in the SA 14–14–2 group, there were eight more deaths due to trauma or drowning in the Vi-TT group than the SA 14–14–2 group.

### Ultrasound examination of extensive limb swelling reactions after diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis or reduced-antigen content diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis immunization in preschool-aged children [^111VgU3x]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine the site, extent, and resolution of tissue involvement when extensive limb swelling occurred in the injected limb for children who received diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis or reduced-antigen content diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine at 4 to 6 years of age.

Methods

Children who had experienced an injection site reaction at 18 months of age were assigned randomly to receive an intramuscular injection of either reduced-antigen content diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine or diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine between 4 and 6 years of age. Children who developed extensive limb swelling were recruited for assessment by clinical examination; ultrasound studies of the affected and opposite (control) arms were performed 24 to 48 hours after immunization and 48 to 96 hours later.

Results

Twelve children with extensive limb swelling were enrolled in the study. Ultrasound examinations demonstrated swelling of both the subcutaneous and muscle layers of the vaccinated arm. Ultrasound assessment showed that the swelling exceeded the clinical measurements of skin redness and swelling. Subcutaneous and muscle tissues expanded to 281% and 111% of the tissue thicknesses of the control arm, respectively. Repeat ultrasound examinations after 48 to 96 hours showed considerable resolution of muscle swelling, compared with subcutaneous tissue swelling. There was no significant difference in the extent of swelling detected between children who received diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine and those who received reduced-antigen content diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine.

Conclusion

Extensive limb swelling reactions after diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis or reduced-antigen content booster immunizations involved swelling of subcutaneous and muscle tissues with swelling and duration more marked in subcutaneous tissue.

### The how's and what's of vaccine reactogenicity [^112DzuKz]. NPJ Vaccines (2019). Medium credibility.

Pre-existing immunity (pre-existing before vaccination and vaccine-induced)

With few exceptions, natural immunity has not been found to affect the overall safety profile of vaccines targeting the said pathogen. Efforts to correlate pre-vaccination antibody titres with the incidence of injection-site or systemic reactions following vaccination have not identified consistent associations. –

Some vaccines cause increased injection-site and general reactions after repeated doses. For example, injection-site and systemic symptoms increase with successive doses of whole-cell and acellular pertussis-containing vaccines. Varicella-containing vaccines (monovalent and combined measles-mumps-rubella and varicella, MMRV) cause increased rates of injection-site reactions in those children receiving the varicella antigen for the second time. Five–six-year-old children receiving MMRV were more likely to have injection-site reactions including pain, redness, and swelling if they had previously received a dose of MMRV as opposed to MMR. The underlying mechanisms are not fully understood and may be related to pre-existing immunity induced by priming to antigen or another vaccine component, mediated by T cells which can be quickly recruited to the site of inflammation, or to local innate immune memory responses, or to the age of the vaccinee at booster dose administration. For some vaccines, such as hepatitis A vaccine, adverse reactions become less frequent after additional doses.

Periodic booster doses with tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis vaccines are recommended in adults, as well as annual influenza vaccination and 5-yearly pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination. In adults vaccinated with polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccines, increased symptoms after re-vaccination has not been consistently observed, although increased reactogenicity compared to the first dose seemed to occur if the interval between doses was below 5 years. Reactogenicity can increase with the number of tetanus vaccines administered (either alone or combined with diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis components), which can be reduced by decreasing the dose of toxoid administered to adults. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported after repeated immunization with tetanus toxoid. These are thought to be caused by antigen-antibody complex formations as a result of vaccination. Influenza vaccines are administered annually to various populations but the impact of repeated annual vaccination on reactogenicity is poorly defined. Three studies showed no differences in injection-site or systemic symptoms in adults and children who had received up to five previous influenza vaccinations, – whereas one study showed an increased rate in local reactions after repeated seasonal influenza vaccination in children.

### A modified vaccine reduces the rate of large injection site reactions to the preschool booster dose of diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine: results of a randomized, controlled trial [^111gZiiQ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Large injection site reactions commonly follow booster doses of diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccines at 4–6 years of age. A vaccine with lower diphtheria and pertussis dosage (Tdap) might be better tolerated for this dose.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, controlled, evaluator-blinded comparison of local reactions to DTaP.inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine (IPV) or Tdap booster vaccinations, in 4- to 5.5-year-old children. Reactions were assessed daily by parents and after 48 hours by study nurses. Serologic responses were measured before and 4 weeks after vaccination and examined in relation to large local reactions (≥ 50 mm redness and/or swelling).

Results

288 children were vaccinated, 145 with DTaP. IPV and 143 with Tdap, and after 48 hours examiners noted local redness ≥ 50mm in 17.2 and 6.3%, respectively (P = 0.004). DTaP. IPV vaccinees initially experienced local pain (in 54%) which limited arm motion (in 37%), but symptoms largely resolved by 48 hours. Tdap vaccinees had fewer symptoms (pain in 20%, limited arm motion in 14%). Children with large reactions to DTaP. IPV more often than nonreactors had elevated preimmunization antibody concentrations to 1 or more of diphtheria, pertussis toxin or pertactin and elevated postimmunization antibody concentrations to all antigens except fimbriae. Booster responses to Tdap were reduced with the smaller antigen doses but were generally satisfactory.

Conclusions

This preschool DTaP. IPV booster vaccination caused large local reactions in 1 in 5 children, with transient discomfort. With Tdap vaccine, such reactions were significantly fewer but not eliminated. A Tdap. IPV vaccine warrants study for routine use at 4–6 years of age.

Summary of findings tables

We created separate summary of findings (SoF) tables for vaccines for each infectious disease compared to placebo or no vaccine (Schünemann 2024). The order of the SoF tables was prioritised by clinical experts based on their relevance to decision‐makers.

We presented the following outcomes in the SoF tables, prioritised by clinical experts, people with cancer, and their representatives.

Incidence of the infection concerned (using methods as defined in the respective study)
All‐cause mortality (at longest follow‐up available)
Quality of life, if measured at a time point most commonly reported in studies, if the reported time points differ significantly, we will choose the longest follow‐up available
Number of participants with any grade adverse events at longest follow‐up available
Number of participants with serious adverse events at longest follow‐up available
Number of participants with localised events at the injection site (e.g. tenderness or soreness, erythema, arm stiffness)
Number of participants with systemic events (e.g. myalgia, fever, headache, fatigue, rash) at the longest follow‐up available

If evidence from both RCTs and controlled NRSIs was available for a single outcome, we presented only the RCT data in the SoF tables.

### Shortened interval between tetanus vaccines [^112Qpan3]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify the minimum safe interval between tetanus-diphtheria (Td) and tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccines.

Data Sources

Literature was retrieved through a review of ImmunoFacts, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Web site, MEDLINE (1966-February 2012) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-February 2012) using the terms Tdap, Td, and interval. In addition, reference citations from publications identified were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language articles identified from the data sources were evaluated. Studies addressing an interval of 2 years or less between Td and Tdap vaccines were included.

Data Synthesis

Two observational noninferiority studies have evaluated the safety of an interval of 2 years or less. The first involved a school-based immunization program to compare the safety of a single dose of Tdap given 18 months to 9 years after a tetanus and diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine versus an interval of 10 or more years. Injection site erythema and swelling were increased among participants with shortened intervals between vaccines; however, no serious adverse events, entire limb swelling, or Arthus-like reactions were reported. The second study involved health care workers who received Tdap during a pertussis outbreak with the objective to compare safety of intervals less than 2 years between prior tetanus vaccination and Tdap with intervals 2 years or more. Criteria for noninferiority were met overall between the 2 intervals in terms of moderate and severe injection site reactions. Fever was more common with the shortened interval, as was any redness or any swelling. No serious adverse events were reported among the group with an interval of less than 2 years between vaccine administration.

Conclusions

Although well-designed randomized controlled trials are lacking, the current observational evidence and CDC provisional recommendations support a shortened interval between Td and Tdap vaccines to protect health care workers from pertussis. Intervals less than 2 years may be associated with an increased incidence of local injection site reactions.

### Persistent shoulder pain after vaccine administration is associated with common incidental pathology: a systematic review [^115RyatE]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Claims of shoulder injury now account for half of all claims to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Reports from databases of claims or potential adverse events note a relatively high mean age and high prevalences of rotator cuff tendinopathy and adhesive capsulitis-common shoulder problems that might be incidental to vaccination. Published case reports provide much more detail about individual patients than is available in databases. A review of published cases provides an opportunity for more detailed review of symptoms, diagnoses, pathology, treatment, and prognosis. Such a review can better assess the relative likelihood that pathologies associated with new persistent shoulder symptoms after vaccination are coincidental or unique to and caused by vaccine.

Questions/Purposes

Regarding published case reports addressing persistent shoulder pain after vaccination: (1) In what proportion of patients was a specific diagnosis made? (2) What diagnoses were most common? (3) Among patients treated nonsurgically, what proportion resolved, and over what time span did they resolve?

Methods

In August 2020, we searched PubMed and Embase between 2006 and 2020 using the following search strategy: Search 1: (shoulder dysfunction OR shoulder pain OR shoulder bursitis OR rotator cuff tendonitis OR adhesive capsulitis OR glenohumeral arthritis AND [vaccine OR vaccination OR immunization]); Search 2: (shoulder injury related to vaccine administration or SIRVA). The search was supplemented by reviewing reference lists of identified studies. Inclusion criteria were any detailed report of three or fewer cases involving shoulder pain after vaccine administration. Twenty published reports of 29 patients were identified and assessed by two reviewers independently. One reported glenohumeral joint infection was excluded because the relationship between this type of relatively uncommon, discrete diagnosis and vaccination raises different considerations. We assumed a high risk of bias, although we are not aware of bias assessment tool for case reports. We recorded and summarized patient demographics, symptoms, examination and imaging findings, surgery findings, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes. Seventy-five percent (21 of 28) of patients were women, with a mean age of 54 ± 19 years. In search of an underlying pathology, at least one diagnostic study was performed in 82% (23 of 28) of patients including radiographs in seven, ultrasound in seven, and MRI in 16 patients (some patients underwent more than one type of imaging). We distinguished specific pathophysiological diagnosis from shoulder pain and stiffness, counted the most common diagnoses among patients a specific diagnosis, and tracked symptom resolution among patients treated nonoperatively.

Results

A specific diagnosis was made in 57% (16 of 28) of patients. Twelve patients had pain and limitation of motion due to pain but no specific pathological diagnosis. The most common specific diagnoses were rotator cuff tendinopathy (9 of 16) and adhesive capsulitis (4 of 16). Less common specific diagnoses included rotator cuff arthropathy (and rheumatoid arthritis) and suspected septic arthritis with nonspecific synovitis on arthroscopy. One patient had transient MRI signal change in the humeral head, which was interpreted as osteonecrosis that resolved in a manner not typical for that diagnosis. Of the 17 patients treated nonsurgically, 15 reported resolution, and two had incomplete symptom resolution with the mean 6-month evaluation period.

Conclusion

The observation that persistent shoulder pain after vaccination overlaps with common shoulder pathology-both in large databases as well as in more detailed reports of specific patients as analyzed in this review-establishes a high probability of a coincidental rather than a causal association. In the absence of high-quality experimental evidence of vaccine-specific shoulder pathology, in our opinion, it seems safest and healthiest to assume that perceived shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA) is due to misinterpretation of new symptoms from established pathology rather than a new, vaccine-specific pathology.

Adverse Reactions

Evidence from trials and postmarketing studies suggest that parenteral Vi vaccines are usually tolerated well. In field trials, pain (risk ratio [RR] = 8.0; CI = 3.7–17.2) and swelling at the injection site (RR = 6.0; CI = 1.1–34.2) were more common among vaccinees than placebo recipients, but no significant difference was found in the incidence of fever or erythema. In a manufacturer-funded postmarketing safety study conducted in 11 U.S. travel clinics, the most common reactions were injection site pain (77%), tenderness (75%), and muscle aches (39%). In postmarketing surveillance of the Vi vaccine (administered alone or simultaneously with other vaccines) during 1995–2002, an estimated 0.3 serious events * per 100,000 doses distributed were reported to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). Among the 321 VAERS reports of events occurring after Vi vaccination, the most commonly reported symptoms included injection site reactions, fever, headache, rash, urticaria, abdominal pain, and nausea. It is important to note that adverse events reported to VAERS might not be caused by the vaccine.

### Use of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccines: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2019 [^114HtDQ2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Since 2005, a single dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine has been recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for adolescents and adults (1,2). After receipt of Tdap, booster doses of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) vaccine are recommended every 10 years or when indicated for wound management. During the October 2019 meeting of ACIP, the organization updated its recommendations to allow use of either Td or Tdap where previously only Td was recommended. These situations include decennial Td booster doses, tetanus prophylaxis when indicated for wound management in persons who had previously received Tdap, and for multiple doses in the catch-up immunization schedule for persons aged ≥ 7 years with incomplete or unknown vaccination history. Allowing either Tdap or Td to be used in situations where Td only was previously recommended increases provider point-of-care flexibility. This report updates ACIP recommendations and guidance regarding the use of Tdap vaccines (3).

### Prospective assessment of the effect of needle length and injection site on the risk of local reactions to the fifth diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccination [^111U1xY9]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Local reactions are relatively common after the fifth diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccination, but factors associated with an increased risk of those reactions are not well defined. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between needle length and injection site on the risk of local reactions to the fifth diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccination administered in the context of usual clinical care.

Methods

In this prospective assessment, parents reported signs and symptoms of adverse events for 7 days after vaccination. The relative risk of adverse events in relation to needle length (16 or 25 mm) and injection site (arm or thigh) was estimated in multivariate analyses that adjusted for age, gender, and BMI. RESULTS; Of the 1315 study participants, 89% were vaccinated in the arm, and 67% were vaccinated with a 25-mm needle. Among children vaccinated in the arm, use of the shorter 16-mm needle was associated with a significantly higher risk of any redness, ≥ 5 cm of redness, persistent redness on day 2, and pain compared with vaccination with a 25-mm needle. Similar trends among the smaller group of children vaccinated in the thigh were also suggested but were not statistically significant. In analyses that were restricted to children vaccinated with a 25-mm needle, vaccination in the thigh versus arm was associated with a substantially lower risk of ≥ 5 cm of redness and a significantly lower risk of swelling and any itching but not with any difference in the risk of pain, irritability, or change in activity.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that a 25-mm needle should be used for the fifth diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccination regardless of injection site and that vaccination in the thigh is an option that may be considered by parents and providers who would like to decrease the risk of local reactions characterized by redness and swelling.

### Safety and immunogenicity of a respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F vaccine when coadministered with a tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine [^1136grLL]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Investigational Product

Each RSVpreF formulation was provided as a lyophilized vial containing a mixture of equal amounts of 2 stabilized prefusion F antigens from RSV subgroups A and B at 2 dose levels (120 μg and 240 μg). Before administration, the RSVpreF lyophilized cake was reconstituted with diluent; the 120-μg dose was reconstituted with sWFI, and the 240-μg dose was reconstituted with sterile Al(OH)₃ suspension (0.4mg/mL). The placebo was sterile normal saline (0.9% NaCl). US-licensed Tdap (Boostrix; GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, United Kingdom) contained 5 limits of flocculation (Lf) of tetanus toxoid (TTd), 2.5 Lf of diphtheria toxoid (DTd), and acellular pertussis antigens (8 μg of inactivated pertussis toxin [PT], 8 μg of filamentous hemagglutinin [FHA], and 2.5 μg of pertactin [PRN]) per dose. Participants received 2 intramuscular injections of a 0.5-mL dose in accordance with the randomization schedule.

Safety Assessments

The primary safety objective was to evaluate safety and tolerability of RSVpreF administered concomitantly with Tdap and RSVpreF administered alone. Safety endpoints included local reactions (redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site) at the left arm injection site (RSVpreF in the RSVpreF groups or placebo in the placebo/Tdap group) and systemic events (fatigue, headache, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, muscle pain, joint pain, and fever) collected for 7 days following vaccination and recorded in an electronic diary. Local reactions and systemic events were categorized during analysis as mild, moderate, or severe based on a predefined grading scale following the US Food and Drug Administration Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research guidance. Participant-reported local reactions and systemic events could only be classified as grade 4 after evaluation by the site investigator. Adverse events (AEs) within 1 month after vaccination and medically attended AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) throughout the study were recorded. Safety analyses used the safety population, which included all randomized participants who received the investigational product.

### Decennial administration of a reduced antigen content diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine in young adults [^117MYuzt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Booster vaccination against tetanus and diphtheria at 10-year intervals is commonly recommended. Reduced antigen content diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (dTpa) vaccines developed for booster vaccination of preschool children, adolescents, and adults are licensed for once-in-a-lifetime use in most countries. Objective. To evaluate decennial administration of a dTpa vaccine. Methods. Young adults vaccinated with dTpa or diphtheria and tetanus toxoids followed by acellular pertussis (DT+ap) 1 month later in a clinical trial 10 years previously received 1 dTpa dose. Blood samples were taken before and 1 month after vaccination. Antibody concentrations against vaccine antigens were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Solicited and unsolicited symptoms and serious adverse events were recorded.

Results

Eighty-two individuals were enrolled in the study. In the 75 individuals who had received the dTpa vaccine 10 years previously, prevaccination seroprotection or seropositivity rates were 98.8% (diphtheria), 97.5% (tetanus), 64.6% (pertussis toxoid), 100% (filamentous hemagglutinin), and 96.3% (pertactin). One month after the second booster, all study participants were seroprotected or seropositive against all vaccine antigens. Antibody concentrations increased by a similar magnitude as 10 years previously. During the 4-day follow-up, 9.9% of participants recorded grade 3 pain; 17.3% and 18.5% recorded redness and swelling of 50 mm or larger, respectively; and 8.6% recorded fever (temperature, 37.5 degrees C). No serious adverse events were considered causally related to the vaccine.

Conclusions

A second dTpa booster was highly immunogenic and well tolerated in this population of young adults. This study supports the use of this vaccine as a decennial booster.

Trial Registration

Table 1
Basic immunological work-up (pre-PCV vaccination)

Given the history of recurrent lower respiratory tract infections, the patient was vaccinated with PCV13 (Prevenar13, Pfizer). Three days later, she developed a progressive, extensive, and painful swelling and erythema of about 10 × 20 cm (4 × 8 inches), affecting almost all of her upper arm around the site of injection (Fig. 1a). Given the strong pain and extensive local inflammatory reaction, she received glucocorticosteroid (20 mg prednisone daily) and an antihistaminic for 4 days, with a favorable evolution. A skin biopsy obtained on day 4 following vaccination, and 46 h following the first dose of prednisone/antihistamine, showed a dense dermal and subdermal perivascular-intensified infiltration dominated by CD4 + T cells and CD68 + macrophages. This pathology is classical of a type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction — as seen with a positive Mantoux tuberculosis skin test(Fig. 1b). CD8 + T cells were very sparse and B cells were almost completely absent (Fig. 1b). Pre-vaccine and 4 weeks post-vaccine anti-pneumococcal IgG levels were determined in a multiplexed serotype-specific assay testing a total of 14 serotypes: 7 that are included in PCV13, and 7 that are not (Fig. 1c). Seroresponses were very vigorous against all tested PCV13 serotypes plus serotypes 9N and 20, not included in PCV13. Strikingly, a very high pre-vaccination IgG titer was observed against the non-PCV13 serotype 8, suggesting prior infection with this serotype (Fig. 1c). There was a humoral response against the diphtheria carrier protein CRM 197, as anti-diphtheria titers increased following PCV13 vaccination, which was not observed for an irrelevant control protein (tetanus) (Fig. 1d). Notably, this anti-diphteria titer increase was recorded before the subsequent DiTe booster dose that was given 4 weeks after the PCV vaccination.

### Updated recommendations for use of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (tdap) in pregnant women – advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP), 2012 [^114Pd4Xx]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

A theoretical risk exists for severe local reactions (e.g. Arthus reactions, whole limb swelling) for pregnant women who have multiple closely spaced pregnancies. Arthus reactions and whole limb swelling are hypersensitivity reactions that have been associated with vaccines containing tetanus toxoid, tetanus and diphtheria toxoids, and/or pertussis antigens. Historical data on multiple doses of Td and tetanus toxoid vaccines (TT) indicate that hypersensitivity was associated with higher levels of preexisting antibody. The frequency of side effects depended on antigen content, product formulation, preexisting antibody levels related to the interval since last dose, and the number of doses. Challenges to reviewing historical data on multiple doses of TT and Td include differences in adjuvant and toxoid amounts in vaccines over time and severity of adverse events by number of vaccines received. Most of the data are historical, and the risk for severe adverse events likely has been reduced with current formulations that contain lower doses of TT.

TT and Td have been used extensively in pregnant women worldwide to prevent neonatal tetanus; large studies on use of TT during pregnancy have not reported clinically significant severe adverse events. Safety data on use of Td during multiple pregnancies have not been published. ACIP believes the potential benefit of preventing pertussis morbidity and mortality in infants outweighs the theoretical concerns of possible severe adverse events.

ACIP concluded that experience with tetanus-toxoid containing vaccines suggests no excess risk for severe adverse events for women receiving Tdap with every pregnancy. ACIP stated the need for safety studies of severe adverse events when Tdap is given during subsequent pregnancies. Plans for safety monitoring in pregnant women following Tdap administration include enhanced monitoring in Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and utilizing the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) to assess acute adverse events, adverse pregnancy outcomes affecting the mother, and birth outcomes; assessing risks for rare adverse events in pregnant women after Tdap will require data collection for several years.

### Inadequate pain management during routine childhood immunizations: the nerve of it [^113oXiDq]. Clinical Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Immunization is regarded as one of the most significant medical achievements of all time. Recently, increasing attention has been paid to the pain resulting from routine childhood immunizations.

Objective

This narrative review summarizes existing knowledge about: (1) the epidemiology of childhood immunization pain; (2) the pain experience of children undergoing immunization; (3) current analgesic practices; (4) barriers to practicing pain management in children; and (5) recommendations for improvements in pain management during immunization.

Methods

We conducted a search of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for primary research and review articles published from inception of the databases through October 2008. Key search terms included immunization, pain, child/infant, vaccine, and intervention. Additional studies were identified through searches of the reference lists in the retrieved articles. No language restrictions were imposed regarding the type of article (eg, full article, abstract) or language.

Results

Vaccine injections are the most common iatrogenic procedure performed in childhood and a major source of distress for children (of all ages), their parents, and the participating health care professionals, as well as a direct cause of vaccine nonadherence. In addition, lack of adequate pain management during immunization exposes children to unnecessary suffering and the potential for long-term consequences, such as fear of needles. Numerous pain management strategies are available to reduce vaccine injection pain, including: (1) physical interventions and injection techniques; (2) psychological interventions; and (3) phar-macologic and combined interventions. However, adoption of pain-relieving techniques into clinical practice has been suboptimal. The underutilization of pain management strategies can be attributed to a lack of knowledge about pain and effective pain prevention strategies, and the persistence of attitudes about pain that interfere with optimal clinical practices. Current analgesic practices could be improved substantially if all stakeholders involved in immunization (eg, policy makers, practitioners, consumers) participate in efforts to reduce pain. Treating pain during childhood immunization has the potential to reduce distress during the procedure and greatly improve satisfaction with the immunization experience through more positive experiences for children and their families. Other potential benefits include improved adherence to immunization schedules and reduced sequelae of untreated pain.

Conclusion

Immunization is a global health priority. Medical care can be improved if pain management becomes a routine aspect of the delivery of vaccine injections.

### Pertussis vaccination of health care workers [^115UsYts]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2007). Medium credibility.

Adult acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) — "In 2005, the Food and Drug Administration approved two adult acellular pertussis vaccines", which contain "pertussis antigens in a reduced quantity compared to the pediatric formulation" with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids similar to adult boosters. "The protective efficacy for pertussis ranges from 66% to 92%, and the side-effect profile does not differ significantly from the tetanus and diphtheria booster vaccine". Common reactions are "pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site", with other symptoms including "headache, fatigue, and gastrointestinal symptoms". Safety is supported: "Serious adverse events have not been attributed to Tdap". Regarding policy, "The ACIP recommends administration of Tdap to the general population and especially to pregnant women", and "ACIP recommends that the vaccine be given as soon as feasible to health care workers employed in hospitals and ambulatory settings who have direct patient contact".

### Comparison of intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange in treatment of mechanically ventilated children with Guillain barrésyndrome: a randomized study [^11613Pcq]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is, currently, the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis following the worldwide decline in incidence of poliomyelitis. Incidence varies according to age, geographic areas and diagnostic criteria used for inclusion. Annual incidence in western countries varies from 1.1 to 1.8/100,000 population per year with a considerably lower annual incidence of 0.66/100,000 population per year in each of Taiwan and China.

GBS usually follows infection by a number of bacterial and viral agents with Campylobacter jejuni representing the most common preceding infection. The syndrome is also reported to rarely temporally follow vaccination with measles vaccine, tetanus toxoid, rabies vaccine, oral polio vaccine, polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine, measles-rubella vaccine, flu vaccine and hepatitis B vaccine.

Since the publishing of the first report of the condition by Guillain, Barré, and Strohl in 1916, GBS has remained a clinically-diagnosed disorder. The condition is a polyneuropathy involving mainly motor but sometimes also sensory and autonomic nerves. It starts with rapidly progressive bilateral and relatively symmetric weakness in the lower limbs with diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes. Paralysis follows an ascending pattern involving trunk, upper limb and, finally, bulbar muscles. There can be numbness, parathesia and muscle pain and tenderness. Labile blood pressure with postural hypotension and labile heart rate with episodes of bradycardia up to asystole rarely occur denoting autonomic neuropathy. van Doorn et al. categorize diagnostic features of the condition into features required for diagnosis, including progressive weakness in both arms and legs, and areflexia or hyporeflexia, and features that strongly support the diagnosis, including progression of symptoms to a nadir over days to four weeks, relative symmetry of symptoms, mild sensory symptoms or signs, cranial nerve involvement, autonomic dysfunction, pain, a high concentration of protein in CSF without increase in cells and typical electro-diagnostic features.

### The how's and what's of vaccine reactogenicity [^1134kSPC]. NPJ Vaccines (2019). Medium credibility.

Symptom management

Pain and distress at the time of vaccination are important clinical issues for individuals of all ages undergoing injection. Not addressing pain at the time of vaccination can engender vaccine hesitancy and may impact on future health-seeking behaviour and healthcare decisions. There are numerous interventions that can help reduce both the immediate and delayed side-effects that may result from vaccination, should they occur. In 2015, WHO published recommendations for pain mitigation at the time of vaccination, aiming at decreasing anxiety in the vaccine recipient and reminding healthcare professionals about good injection practices including the use of appropriate needle length and selection of appropriate anatomical location for injection (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4
Practical recommendations to decrease side-effects that may occur at the time of injection: adapted from the World Health Organization recommendations.*There are no additional evidence-based, age-specific recommendations available for adolescents beyond the general measures recommended for all age groups

Topical anaesthetics used in children before injection can also reduce immediate pain and needle distress. WHO does not recommend the routine use of topical anaesthetics because of their high cost, lack of availability in many settings and the prolonged onset of action. Routine use of topical anaesthetics is recommended for 0- to 12-year-old children in Canada in view of evidence of reduced distress in young children when they are used, and to reduce long-term development of needle fears and future non-compliant behaviours. Novel active distraction techniques that use virtual reality can be used effectively to reduce pain and anxiety in paediatric patients undergoing vaccination.

Redness and mild swelling are not usually associated with significant discomfort and usually require no treatment or can be managed with local application of ice. Pain in the days following injection, and systemic symptoms, such as headache, fever, and myalgia can cause substantial discomfort that may be mitigated by the administration of paracetamol (acetaminophen), aspirin or anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen.
