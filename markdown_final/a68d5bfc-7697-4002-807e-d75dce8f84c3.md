## Question

What are the ldl goals

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) goals to target. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle of risk-stratified LDL targets. Then, I should contrast the European treat-to-target approach with the US intensity-based, threshold approach. Next, I will specify the numeric LDL-C goals by European risk category and special situations, verify diabetes-specific targets, and confirm the recurrent-event threshold. After that, I should review the US thresholds for adding nonstatins and the role of percent reduction. Finally, I will check the safety of very low LDL-C, translate goals into a practical treatment sequence, and synthesize a succinct answer with references.

> Let me consider the foundational principle first. LDL-C goals are not one-size-fits-all; they are determined by absolute atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, with lower goals for higher-risk patients, which is a consistent theme across major guidelines, especially in the ESC/EAS framework that explicitly ties targets to risk categories [^116GYDVx] [^112QMZmt].

> I need to check the philosophical split between guideline systems. The European ESC/EAS guidelines endorse explicit treat-to-target LDL-C levels with percentage reduction requirements, whereas the ACC/AHA guidelines moved toward fixed-intensity statin therapy with LDL-C thresholds prompting nonstatin add-on, rather than numeric targets per se; I should confirm that shift occurred in 2013 and was refined in 2018, which it did [^113wVuy7] [^1138QxsW] [^116GYDVx].

> Now, I will specify the European targets, but wait, let me verify the exact numbers and percent-reduction requirements. For very high risk, the goal is LDL-C less than 55 mg/dL (less than 1.4 mmol/L) plus at least a 50% reduction from baseline; for high risk, less than 70 mg/dL (less than 1.8 mmol/L) plus at least a 50% reduction; for moderate risk, less than 100 mg/dL (less than 2.6 mmol/L); and for low risk, less than 116 mg/dL (less than 3.0 mmol/L), as laid out in the 2019 ESC/EAS guideline suite published in 2020, with the percent-reduction mandate emphasized for high and very high risk [^116GYDVx] [^1147iChS] [^113U5npo] [^116Bfjt6].

> Hold on, I should verify special situations within the European framework. For patients with recurrent atherothrombotic events within 2 years while on maximally tolerated statin-based therapy, the target can be intensified to less than 40 mg/dL (less than 1.0 mmol/L); and for chronic coronary syndromes, the current ESC guidance reiterates less than 55 mg/dL with at least 50% reduction, alongside an instruction to initiate and uptitrate high-intensity statins to reach goal, which I need to confirm is in the 2023 ACS and 2024 CCS documents, and it is [^112sLSQr] [^112Cw6Wv] [^113Ext4y] [^112S8aht].

> Next, I should review diabetes-specific targets because these often cause confusion. Wait, let me verify the diabetes stratification. In T2DM, ESC/EAS categorizes many as high or very high risk: very high risk aims for less than 55 mg/dL and at least a 50% reduction; high risk aims for less than 70 mg/dL and at least a 50% reduction, and ESC 2023 diabetes guidance reaffirms less than 70 mg/dL with at least 50% reduction in high-risk T2DM, which aligns with the broader treat-to-target strategy [^112UJbcF] [^1168g1ef].

> I will now examine the US approach to ensure I'm not over-assigning numeric targets where they don't exist. The ACC/AHA 2013 guideline deliberately moved away from LDL-C targets to statin intensity, and the 2018 update retained intensity-based therapy while using LDL-C 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) as a threshold to consider adding ezetimibe and/or a PCSK9 inhibitor in very high-risk ASCVD; the USPSTF 2022 primary prevention recommendations also do not specify LDL-C targets, focusing instead on global risk and initiation criteria [^113wVuy7] [^1138QxsW] [^112rA5Hz].

> Wait, I should double-check the percent-reduction requirement because it is easy to underemphasize. The ESC/EAS model pairs absolute goals with a percentage reduction of at least 50% from baseline in high and very high risk, which operationalizes both relative and absolute LDL-C lowering to reduce residual risk, and I need to state that explicitly [^116GYDVx] [^1147iChS].

> But wait, what if very low LDL-C raises safety concerns? Hmm, I should confirm the evidence base. Large trials and meta-analyses show no safety signal with very low LDL-C levels, including down to less than 30 mg/dL in some analyses, and genetic evidence plus PCSK9 outcomes trials support the "lower is better" paradigm without an established floor where harm outweighs benefit, which underpins the aggressive ESC/EAS goals and the willingness to intensify therapy as needed [^113DKmHK] [^1113KeWi] [^116kRVgD].

> Next, I should translate these goals into clinical action. First-line is a high-intensity statin to the highest tolerated dose; if the patient does not reach the risk-stratified goal or the ACC/AHA threshold, add ezetimibe; if still not at goal or above the threshold in very high-risk ASCVD, escalate to a PCSK9 inhibitor, recognizing that the ESC/EAS uses treat-to-target while ACC/AHA uses thresholds to prompt add-on therapy; and I need to remember that guideline-directed uptitration is emphasized in chronic coronary syndromes [^1138QxsW] [^112mFCb6] [^112S8aht].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about real-world attainment; I should review implementation gaps and adherence, since goals are only meaningful if achieved. Contemporary data show underuse of lipid-lowering therapies, suboptimal intensity, and poor adherence, with many high- or very high-risk patients failing to reach guideline levels or thresholds; adherence and intensity correlate with LDL goal attainment and lower MACE in routine care, which means systematic follow-up and escalation are critical [^111LRNyB] [^112uARWX] [^114szVzL].

> Let me synthesize succinctly and make sure I did not miss anything important. In Europe (ESC/EAS), LDL-C goals are risk-stratified: very high risk aims for less than 55 mg/dL with at least a 50% reduction, high risk for less than 70 mg/dL with at least a 50% reduction, moderate risk for less than 100 mg/dL, and low risk for less than 116 mg/dL, with intensification to less than 40 mg/dL considered after recurrent events; diabetes targets follow the same risk strata, and chronic coronary syndromes reiterate less than 55 mg/dL plus at least 50% reduction, all within a treat-to-target framework that assumes "lower is better" and no proven harm at very low levels [^116GYDVx] [^1147iChS] [^113U5npo] [^116Bfjt6] [^112Cw6Wv] [^113Ext4y]. In the US (ACC/AHA), there are no numeric targets; instead, clinicians use high- or maximal-intensity statins and consider adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitor if LDL-C remains at or above 70 mg/dL in very high-risk ASCVD, with primary prevention decisions based on estimated risk rather than LDL goals, which I should underscore to avoid conflating systems [^1138QxsW] [^113wVuy7] [^112rA5Hz]. For completeness, some endocrine and specialty societies endorse targets like less than 70 mg/dL for adults at high risk, which can align operationally with either framework in shared decision-making, but I should be clear that these are society-specific recommendations [^1137Afwa].

---

LDL goals are risk-based [^1147iChS] [^116GYDVx]: **< 55 mg/dL with ≥ 50% reduction for very high risk** [^113Ext4y] (ASCVD, recent ACS, or T2DM with target organ damage) [^112UJbcF]; **< 70 mg/dL with ≥ 50% reduction for high risk** [^112mFCb6] (severe hypercholesterolemia, T2DM with additional risk, or high-risk primary prevention) [^112UJbcF] [^1168g1ef]; **< 100 mg/dL for moderate risk** [^113U5npo] and **< 116 mg/dL for low risk** [^116Bfjt6]. For recurrent events within 2 years despite maximal therapy, consider a target of **< 40 mg/dL** [^112sLSQr] [^112Cw6Wv]. US guidelines use a threshold approach [^1138QxsW]: add nonstatins if LDL-C remains ≥ 70 mg/dL in very high-risk patients [^112QMZmt].

In regard to medical management of dyslipidemia, specifically concerning treatment targets, the EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend targeting an LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline and achieving an LDL-C level of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L) in high-risk patients, with or without T2DM.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: A personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^112QMZmt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

The 2019 ESC/EAS guideline recommends using the Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation system, based on large European cohort data sets, for estimating the 10‐year risk of fatal ASCVD events in adults over 40 years of age. The Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation tool has since been updated as Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation 2, which predicts 10‐year risk for both fatal and nonfatal ASCVD events. Additionally, CAC scoring is recommended in asymptomatic individuals classified as low or intermediate risk for whom statin therapy is being considered.

Both the US and European guidelines recommend consideration of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy in addition to statins for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events. However, the guidelines differ in their respective definitions of patients at "very high risk". In the ACC/AHA/Multisociety guidelines, patients with a history of multiple major ASCVD events or those who have had one major ASCVD event plus multiple high‐risk conditions are considered very high risk. Recommendation for add‐on nonstatin therapy is therefore restricted to secondary prevention for patients at an LDL‐C threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL. The ESC/EAS guideline adopts a broader definition of very high risk, encompassing those with documented ASCVD, either clinical or unequivocal on imaging or various other higher‐risk conditions.

### How low to go with glucose, cholesterol, and blood pressure in primary prevention of CVD [^115XUj1B]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension are modifiable risk factors that predict cardiovascular disease events. The effect of these risk factors on incident cardiovascular disease increases with progressively higher levels of glucose, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and blood pressure. The thresholds for initiating treatment of these modifiable risk factors and the optimal goals of risk factor modification are a focus of primary prevention research. Although an aggressive approach is appealing, adverse events may occur, and potential physiological barriers may exist. This paper discusses primary prevention of coronary heart disease that may be achieved through modification of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, by summarizing guidelines and pertinent clinical trial data from intervention trials that included a primary prevention cohort.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: A personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^113DKmHK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Observational studies have raised questions about the safety of low levels of LDL-C achieved through intensive lipid lowering; however, there does not appear to be a "too low" level of LDL-C. Populations with naturally occurring low levels of LDL-C exist, and studies of individuals with genetic mutations leading to reduced LDL-C levels reveal no safety issues and have shown an association with reduced ASCVD risk. This notion is recognized by the lower LDL-C goals in the 2019 ESC/EAS guideline, which recommend target LDL-C levels as low as < 55 and < 40 mg/dL, the latter for patients who have had multiple ASCVD events within 2 years.

Achievement of very low LDL-C levels in clinical trials of lipid-lowering therapies has not been associated with an increased prevalence of adverse events. In the FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk) trial of evolocumab added to statin therapy, 42% of patients achieved LDL-C levels ≤ 25 mg/dL at 48 weeks with no significant difference between the evolocumab and placebo groups in terms of adverse events beyond injection-site reactions. In a prespecified analysis of IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial), patients who achieved very low LDL-C levels (< 30 mg/dL) at 1 month after acute coronary syndrome had a similar safety profile over a period of 6 years compared with patients who achieved LDL-C concentrations ≥ 30 mg/dL; furthermore, the very low LDL-C group had the numerically lowest rate of cardiovascular events.

### Statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^1148dNK8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Reducing high blood cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in people with and without a past history of coronary heart disease (CHD), is an important goal of pharmacotherapy. Statins are the first-choice agents. Previous reviews of the effects of statins have highlighted their benefits in people with coronary artery disease. The case for primary prevention, however, is less clear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects, both harms and benefits, of statins in people with no history of CVD.

- **Search strategy**: To avoid duplication of effort, we checked reference lists of previous systematic reviews. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE (2001 to March 2007), and EMBASE (2003 to March 2007). There were no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of statins with a minimum duration of one year and follow-up of six months, in adults with no restrictions on their total low density lipoprotein (LDL) or high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and where 10% or less had a history of CVD, were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events, combined endpoints (fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events), change in blood total cholesterol concentration, revascularisation, adverse events, quality of life, and costs. Relative risk (RR) was calculated for dichotomous data, and for continuous data pooled weighted.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: A personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^112uARWX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Despite guideline recommendations and evidence supporting the use of lipid-lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, recent population studies indicate that their use for preventing ASCVD events is insufficient. Most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL-C thresholds. Long-term adherence and persistence with statin therapy are poor, even following catastrophic events such as acute myocardial infarction. Consequently, in patients who fall within established benefit groups according to guidelines, there is a significant need to increase the use of available lipid-lowering therapies, especially statins, at the recommended intensity.

Guidelines categorize recommendations for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL-C by primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD events. However, as demonstrated by tools for imaging coronary atherosclerosis, including coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring, coronary computed tomographic angiography, intravascular ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography, a continuum of ASCVD and associated risk exists. Patients are at increased risk as both plaque burden and high-risk plaque features accumulate before their first ASCVD event. Intensive LDL-C lowering is, therefore, critical to halt plaque progression, with the potential to induce regression and prevent outcomes such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, or the need for coronary revascularization. This concept is recognized in the 2019 ESC/EAS guideline, which considers unequivocal evidence of ASCVD on imaging as very high risk.

### Optimal target of LDL cholesterol level for statin treatment: challenges to monotonic relationship with cardiovascular events [^113B2rSk]. BMC Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The "The lower, the better" concept for LDL-C has been proposed by many statin trials and was strengthened by recent non-statin lipid-lowering therapy trials. The 2019 European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines for the management of dyslipidemias recommend aggressive goals for LDL-C lowering, such as < 1.8 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL) for patients at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, < 1.4 mmol/L (< 55 mg/dL) for patients at very high risk or with clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and < 1.0 mmol/L (< 40 mg/dL) for very high-risk patients who experienced a secondary vascular event within 2 years.

Some proponents of the "The lower, the better" concept, especially followers of PCSK9 inhibitors, state that no level of LDL-C below which benefit ceases or harm occurs has been defined.

On the other hand, the 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines identified a threshold LDL-C value of 70 mg/dL, at which the addition of a non-statin to high-intensity statin therapy could be considered. However, it recommends high-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention and for patients with a high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease regardless of the baseline LDL-C, without setting a specific target LDL-C. This approach is known as "Fire and forget", which contrasts with the "Treat to target" concept.

Therefore, regarding statin treatment, no consensus has yet been reached as to whether "The lower, the better", "Fire and forget", or "Treat to target" is the preferable approach. This debate has persisted for a considerable time.

### Improving statin treatment strategies to reduce LDL-cholesterol: Factors associated with targets' attainment in subjects with and without type 2 diabetes [^111pXbmS]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In these patients, dyslipidemia is a major cardiovascular risk factor. As such, the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, are the best therapy for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) reduction.

Several trials have shown significant cardiovascular risk reduction through LDLc lowering in patients with diabetes, supporting its causal role in atherogenesis, as demonstrated in genetic studies. Statin therapy is considered essential for both primary and secondary prevention of CVD in diabetes. Trials have shown that statin therapy is beneficial for people with diabetes even if they do not have manifest coronary heart disease or high cholesterol concentrations. In the Health Protection Study (HPS), allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rate of first major vascular events by about a quarter in the diabetic patients included in that study.

Key observations provide evidence that, in patients with type 2 diabetes, the benefit of statin therapy confers protection at considerably low LDLc levels of less than 1.8 mmol/l (< 70 mg/dl). Additional trials and meta-analyses have highlighted a benefit by further reducing LDL cholesterol down to 55 mg/dl. This concept has been incorporated in most of the recent guidelines, which now recommend the initiation of statin treatment based on the LDL cholesterol target levels and the cardiovascular risk profile of the patient.

### Effect of 2013 ACC/AHA blood cholesterol guidelines on statin treatment patterns and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease patients [^115e1AQY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Preceding the release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) blood cholesterol guidelines (hereafter referred to as the "2013 guidelines" or simply "guidelines"), LDL‐C goals were < 4.1 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) for patients with a single CVD risk factor, < 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) for patients with two or more risk factors, and < 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) for patients with known CVD or risk factor equivalent. The guidelines were revised in 2013 to recommend moving away from a "treating to goal" approach with respect to LDL‐C and instead focus on treating with the most appropriate statin intensity based on the patient's risk.

The four statin benefit groups described in the guidelines are:

- **Clinical ASCVD**: Patients with clinical ASCVD.
- **High LDL-C levels**: Adult patients with LDL‐C ≥ 4.9 mmol/L (190 mg/dL).
- **Diabetes and specific LDL-C range**: Patients aged 40 to 75 years with diabetes mellitus and LDL‐C levels from 1.8 to 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL).
- **10-year ASCVD risk assessment**: Patients with an estimated 10‐year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% and LDL‐C levels from 1.8 to less than 4.9 mmol/L (70–189 mg/dL; primary prevention).

With some exceptions for age and risk, in general, high-intensity statin therapy is recommended for those in statin benefit groups 1 and 2, whereas moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy is recommended for most patients in statin benefit group 3. For statin benefit group 4, the recommendation is to estimate 10-year ASCVD risk and engage in patient-clinician discussions to determine an appropriate course of action. In addition, the 2013 guidelines no longer recommend monitoring LDL‐C to assess the achievement of a particular LDL‐C level.

### Knowledge of HbA1c and LDL-C treatment goals, subjective level of disease-related information and information needs in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^113r1Y2e]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Risk factor control of diabetes mellitus (DM), especially dyslipidemia, remains unsatisfactory in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). We aimed to analyze the knowledge of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) treatment goals, subjective level of information, and information needs in very high-risk patients with ASCVD.

- **Methods**: ASCVD patients (n = 210; 75 ± 9 years; 71.4% male; 89.5% coronary disease) with DM (96.7% type 2) completed a questionnaire assessing knowledge of HbA1c and LDL-C treatment goals, subjective level of information, and information needs on disease-related topics of DM and ASCVD. Serum LDL-C and HbA1c were measured.

- **Results**: The HbA1c goal (< 7.0% in 60.6%) was attained more frequently than the LDL-C goal (< 70 mg/dl in 39.9%; p < 0.01). Significantly more participants named the correct goal for HbA1c compared to LDL-C (52.9% vs. 2.4%; p < 0.01). Subjective levels of information were higher, and information needs were lower for DM than for ASCVD (p < 0.01 for all topics). No associations of knowledge of treatment goals and level of information with the attainment of treatment goals for HbA1c and LDL-C were found. However, in multivariate regression, higher levels of education were associated with knowledge of treatment goals (HbA1c: odds ratio [OR] 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–1.72, p = .04; LDL-C: OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.07–5.03; p = .03).

- **Conclusion**: In very high-risk patients with ASCVD, a deficit of knowledge of treatment goals to control dyslipidemia exists when compared to DM.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: A personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^115dFvXB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

In summary, a personalized approach, identifying patients at risk of ASCVD earlier in the risk continuum and optimizing the use of available lipid‐lowering therapies in combination with statins will enable more patients to achieve LDL‐C targets and help to address the high global burden of ASCVD.

### LDL cholesterol: How low to go [^116kRVgD]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2018). High credibility.

Epidemiology and the results of large-scale outcome trials indicate that the association of LDL with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is causal and continuous not only across levels seen in the general population but also down to sub-physiological values. There is no scientific basis, therefore, to set a target or 'floor' for LDL cholesterol lowering. This presents a clinical and conceptual dilemma for prescribers, patients, and payers.

With the advent of powerful agents such as proprotein convertase/subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, LDL cholesterol can be lowered profoundly. However, health economic constraints mandate that this therapeutic approach needs to be selective. Based on the need to maximize the absolute risk reduction when prescribing combination lipid-lowering therapy, it is appropriate to prioritize patients with the highest risk of aggressive and established cardiovascular disease. These are the patients who will obtain the highest benefit, specifically those with elevated LDL cholesterol on optimized statin therapy.

### Pharmacological strategies for lowering LDL cholesterol: Statins and beyond [^114jMY6d]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

A continuous, graded relationship exists between LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This finding has been confirmed at progressively lower levels of LDL-C by results from clinical trials of therapies, particularly high-potency statins, which provide increasingly greater reductions in LDL-C levels. Based on this clinical trial evidence, progressively lower LDL-C goals for increasing numbers of patients, stratified by absolute CVD risk, have been recommended in guidelines for cholesterol management and CVD prevention. However, some notable exceptions have been made, such as for patients with end-stage renal disease or heart failure.

To achieve low LDL-C goals, statins are first-line pharmacological therapy and can be combined with other agents to provide additional reductions in LDL-C levels, as well as improvements in other lipoprotein fractions. Investigational agents that reduce LDL-C levels by other mechanisms are under development and could provide additional therapeutic strategies to achieve optimal LDL-C levels. These agents could be particularly appropriate for patients with severely elevated LDL-C levels, such as those with genetic dyslipidemia, for whom maximal drug therapy is insufficient to reduce LDL-C concentrations to recommended levels.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: Opportunities and challenges [^113115Yt]. Heart (2021). Low credibility.

Elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Guidelines for the management of dyslipidemia from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) were updated in late 2019 in light of recent intervention trials involving innovative lipid-lowering agents in combination with statins. The new guidelines advocate achieving very low LDL-C levels in individuals at highest risk, within the paradigm of 'lower is better'. With the advent of combination therapy using ezetimibe and/or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors in addition to statins, the routine attainment of extremely low LDL-C levels in the clinic has become a reality.

Moreover, clinical trials in this setting have shown that over the 5–7 years of treatment experience, profound LDL-C lowering leads to further reduction in cardiovascular events compared with more moderate lipid lowering, with no associated safety concerns. These reassuring findings are bolstered by genetic studies showing that lifelong very low LDL-C levels (< 1.4 mmol/L; < 55 mg/dL) are associated with lower cardiovascular risk than in the general population, with no known detrimental health effects. Nevertheless, long-term safety studies are required to consolidate the present evidence base. This review summarizes key data supporting the ESC/EAS recommendation to markedly reduce LDL-C levels, with aggressive goals for LDL-C in patients at highest risk, and provides expert opinion on its significance.

### 2013 ACC/AHA guideline recommends fixed-dose strategies instead of targeted goals to lower blood cholesterol [^113wVuy7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). High credibility.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on Practice Guidelines recently issued the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults. This new guideline endorses a paradigm shift in strategies for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by lowering blood cholesterol. Whereas previous guidelines focused on therapy to decrease low-density lipoprotein and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to specific target levels, the new guideline instead proposes implementation of cholesterol-lowering treatment using evidenced-based intensity of statin therapy without such targets.

The guideline also provides a new risk estimator for primary prevention decisions, including stroke outcomes and data on African Americans, which will significantly increase the number of patients recommended for outcome-related benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy.

- **Process and recommendations**: The first section of this paper reviews the process by which the task force developed the new evidence-based guideline, the major findings and recommendations, and their implications.
- **Risk assessment considerations**: The second section primarily focuses on the question of how much low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be lowered and on additional considerations in risk assessment.

Regarding medical management for dyslipidemia, specifically concerning treatment targets, the EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend targeting an LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline. They also suggest maintaining an LDL-C level of < 55 mg/dL or < 1.4 mmol/L for both primary and secondary prevention in very high-risk patients.

### Alternative LDL cholesterol-lowering strategy vs high-intensity statins in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: A systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^113HBHrV]. JAMA Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

In patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), intensive lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels with high-intensity statins is generally recommended. However, alternative approaches considering statin-related adverse effects and intolerance are needed.

The objective was to compare the long-term efficacy and safety of an alternative LDL cholesterol-lowering strategy vs a high-intensity statin strategy in patients with ASCVD in randomized clinical trials.

The data were sourced from PubMed, Embase, and other websites such as ClinicalTrials.gov, European Society of Cardiology, and tctMD, systematically searched from inception to April 19, 2024.

- **Study selection**: Randomized clinical trials comparing an alternative LDL cholesterol-lowering strategy vs a high-intensity statin strategy in patients with ASCVD, with the presence of cardiovascular events as endpoints.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Individual patient data were obtained from randomized clinical trials that met the prespecified eligibility criteria: RACING (Randomized Comparison of Efficacy and Safety of Lipid-Lowering With Statin Monotherapy vs Statin/Ezetimibe Combination for High-Risk Cardiovascular Disease) and LODESTAR (Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol-Targeting Statin Therapy vs Intensity-Based Statin Therapy in Patients With Coronary Artery Disease). The moderate-intensity statin with ezetimibe combination therapy in the RACING trial and the treat-to-target strategy in the LODESTAR trial were classified as alternative LDL cholesterol-lowering strategies.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^112rA5Hz]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for acute ischemic stroke, specifically in primary prevention, lipid-lowering therapy is emphasized. The USPSTF 2022 guidelines recommend initiating statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in adults aged 40–75 years who have one or more CVD risk factors, including dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or smoking, and an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 10% or greater.

### The role of niacin in raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and optimally treated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol rationale and study design. The Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic syndrome with low HDL/high triglycerides: Impact on Global Health outcomes (AIM-HIGH) [^117CTEBL]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular (CV) disease, optimally treated on a statin but with residual atherogenic dyslipidemia (low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C] and high triglycerides), will benefit from the addition of niacin, resulting in fewer CV events compared with placebo. Statin monotherapy trials have demonstrated a 25%-35% CV risk reduction relative to placebo, leaving significant residual risk. Patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia have substantially increased CV risk.

- **Methods**: Participants were men and women with established CV disease and atherogenic dyslipidemia. Lipid entry criteria varied by gender and statin dose at screening. All participants received simvastatin (or simvastatin plus ezetimibe) at a dose sufficient to maintain low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels between 40–80 mg/dL (1.03–2.07 mmol/L). Participants were randomized to receive either extended-release niacin or a matching placebo. The primary endpoint was the time to occurrence of the first of the following events: coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome, or symptom-driven coronary or cerebral revascularization. This event-driven trial will have 85% power to demonstrate a 25% reduction in the primary event frequency after 850 patients have experienced a primary outcome event.

- **Results**: AIM-HIGH completed enrollment in April 2010. Follow-up is expected to continue through 2012.

- **Summary**: AIM-HIGH was designed to determine whether treating residual dyslipidemia with niacin further reduces cardiovascular events in patients already optimally treated with statin therapy.

### Practical solutions for implementation of blood cholesterol guidelines in clinical practice [^1167uBfE]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Underutilization of lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) and failure to attain guideline-recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals are important quality gaps in cardiovascular risk optimization, especially among patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Large database analyses demonstrate an unmet need for improved LDL-C measurement, indicating that nearly 75% of patients with ASCVD have an LDL-C level above guideline-recommended levels. Additionally, more than 50% of these patients are not treated with statins or ezetimibe.

- **Proposed solutions**: Provider- and patient-facing educational interventions, health information technology strategies, implementation of incentive-based care, advocacy efforts, and systems-based process innovations.

While individual interventions may not be enough to overcome the totality of barriers to optimal LLT, comprehensive multifaceted approaches that address barriers at the provider, patient, and healthcare delivery level are likely to offer the greatest likelihood of success and improved patient outcomes.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: opportunities and challenges [^114jJwm2]. Heart (2021). Low credibility.

All clinicians attest to the fact that guidelines, although helpful, do not match day-to-day practice. Many patients do not fit neatly into the categorized recommendations, and judgment must be made on the most prudent course of action. The recently updated guidelines for the management of dyslipidemia from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) present a further challenge since they recommend aggressive goals for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering:

- **High-risk patients**: < 1.8 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL) for patients at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).
- **Very high-risk patients**: < 1.4 mmol/L (< 55 mg/dL) for patients at very high risk or with clinically evident ASCVD.
- **Patients with recurrent events**: < 1.0 mmol/L (< 40 mg/dL) for very high-risk patients who experienced a second vascular event within 2 years.

The ESC/EAS approach of recommending these very low goals for LDL-C is in distinction to the recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines where a threshold of 70 mg/dL was identified as a level at which the addition of non-statin to maximally tolerated statin therapy could be considered, but no lower goal was set. The European guideline writers believe that the science is strong enough to state that "no level of LDL-C below which benefit ceases or harm occurs has been defined".

This approach prompts a number of questions — how do we translate this into clinical practice? Should it be applied universally or selectively? This review briefly lays out the evidence that led the writers to recommend the most aggressive goals yet for LDL-C lowering.

### 2018 cholesterol clinical practice guidelines: Synopsis of the 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Multisociety Cholesterol Guideline [^1138QxsW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

In November 2018, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) released a new clinical practice guideline on cholesterol management, accompanied by a risk assessment report on primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

- **Methods**: A panel of experts, free of recent and relevant industry-related conflicts, conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined cardiovascular outcomes. High-quality observational studies were employed to estimate ASCVD risk. An independent panel systematically reviewed RCT evidence concerning the benefits and risks of adding nonstatin medications to statin therapy compared with receiving statin therapy alone in individuals who have or are at high risk for ASCVD.

- **Recommendation**: The guideline endorses a heart-healthy lifestyle beginning in childhood to reduce lifetime risk for ASCVD. It contains several new features compared with the 2013 guideline. For secondary prevention, patients at very high risk may be candidates for adding nonstatin medications, such as ezetimibe or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, to statin therapy. In primary prevention, a clinician-patient risk discussion is strongly recommended before making decisions regarding statin treatment. The AHA/ACC risk calculator categorizes patients into four risk groups. Those at intermediate risk should engage in a focused clinician-patient discussion prior to the initiation of statin therapy.

### Modifiable factors associated with failure to attain low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal at 6 months after acute myocardial infarction [^1123k6Wm]. American Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Although controversial, reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to target levels remains a common therapeutic goal after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We sought to illuminate patient and provider characteristics associated with LDL-C goal nonattainment after AMI.

- **Methods**: In an observational registry of 24 US hospitals, we included 366 patients with AMI who had baseline LDL-C levels ≥ 100 mg/dL and underwent 6-month fasting LDL-C reassessment. Our primary outcome was failure to reach the guideline-recommended LDL-C goal of < 100 mg/dL at 6 months post-AMI.

- **Results**: One in three patients with AMI and initially elevated LDL-C failed to attain the LDL-C goal at 6 months. Compared with those who attained the LDL-C goal, those who did not were more often discharged without a statin (21% vs. 9%, P < .001), despite only 4% having documented contraindications. Patients not achieving the LDL-C goal also more frequently discontinued statin use by 6 months (24% vs. 6%, P < .001). Multivariable modeling (c index, 0.78) revealed the absence of a statin prescription at discharge and lack of persistence on statin therapy as the strongest independent factors associated with failure to reach the LDL-C goal. Additional independent risk factors included patient reports of not consistently adhering to prescribed medications, not participating in cardiac rehabilitation, nonwhite race, and lack of insurance.

- **Conclusions**: One-third of patients with AMI with baseline hyperlipidemia do not attain the LDL-C goal of < 100 mg/dL at 6 months. Our findings support targeted interventions in the trans.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol corrected for lipoprotein(a) cholesterol, risk thresholds, and cardiovascular events [^1113TbEL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is the cornerstone in cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. LDL-C is used as a screening test, diagnostic marker for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), target of therapy for diet, drugs, and apheresis, and goal for adequate care in the outpatient clinic, after hospital discharge, and in clinical guidelines. It is generally accepted that the laboratory measure "LDL-C" is an accurate representation of what is being measured. However, because of methodological limitations, all available clinical methods that measure and report "LDL-C" are affected by the presence of the cholesterol content of lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]-C). This includes all methods of calculated or measured "LDL-C", including the Friedewald formula, ultracentrifugation, or direct LDL-C methods. The main issue is the inability to separate low-density lipoprotein from lipoprotein(a) particles and quantify cholesterol content separately on these particles.

Lipoprotein(a) is composed of apolipoprotein(a), apolipoprotein B-100, cholesteryl esters, free cholesterol, phospholipids, and carbohydrates on apolipoprotein(a). Based on observations from multiple laboratories with expertise in lipoprotein(a) biochemical analyses, the cholesterol content of lipoprotein(a) constitutes approximately 30% to 45% of total lipoprotein(a) mass. This implies that if lipoprotein(a) mass levels are low (e.g. < 10 mg/dL), the contribution of Lp(a)-C to plasma LDL-C is small (< 5 mg/dL). However, if lipoprotein(a) mass is high (e.g. 150 mg/dL)…

### Effective use of statins to prevent coronary heart disease [^113C5w2e]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Primary and secondary prevention trials have demonstrated that the use of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (commonly known as statins) to lower elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels can significantly reduce coronary events and mortality from coronary heart disease. In 1987 and 1993, the National Cholesterol Education Program issued guidelines for cholesterol screening and treatment. However, primary care physicians have not adequately integrated these guidelines into clinical practice. A 1991 study revealed that cholesterol screening was conducted in only 23 percent of patients, leaving many patients with elevated LDL levels and a high risk of ischemic events unidentified and untreated. A study published in 1998 found that fewer than 15 percent of patients with known coronary heart disease achieved the recommended LDL level of below 100 mg per dL (2.60 mmol per L). By identifying patients with elevated LDL levels and implementing appropriate lipid-lowering therapies, family physicians could play a crucial role in preventing cardiovascular events and deaths in many of their patients.

### Clinical lipidology and the prevention of vascular disease: Time for personalized therapy [^112w5RN7]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Genetic, metabolic, and lifestyle modifications can cause elevations of lipoproteins that contribute to atherosclerotic lesions over time. In the modern world, with life extension from many improvements in medicine and public health, most humans live long enough to develop atherosclerosis with concentrations of blood plasma lipoproteins that are very common. Familial abnormalities are prevalent and provide additional challenges in identifying unhealthy but treatable values of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). Multiple community studies and clinical trials have provided guidance on selecting targets and new tools that make possible effective goals of treatment. Lipid-lowering drugs are making it possible to achieve those goals and place responsibility on physicians to master the art of preventing atherosclerotic events. Lipoprotein management remains a very focused effort and requires an artful individualized approach for each patient. Few skills are more important for healthcare providers in primary care and cardiovascular medicine.

### Efficacy and safety of further lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients starting with very low levels: A meta-analysis [^1113KeWi]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). High credibility.

The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration (CTTC) observed that in patients starting with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels of approximately 3.4 mmol/L (131.5 mg/dL), there was a 22% reduction in major vascular events per 1-mmol/L (38.7-mg/dL) lowering of LDL-C. However, the magnitude of clinical benefit of further LDL-C lowering in patients already with very low LDL-C levels remains debated.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of further lowering LDL-C levels in patient populations presenting with median LDL-C levels of 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or less.

- **Data sources and study selection**: The CTTC was utilized for statin data. For nonstatin therapy, the Medline database was searched between 2015 and April 2018. Key inclusion criteria were randomized, double-blind, controlled cardiovascular outcome trials involving LDL-C lowering with data in populations starting with LDL-C levels averaging 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or less.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Two authors independently extracted data into standardized data sheets, and the data were analyzed using meta-analysis.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The risk ratio (RR) of major vascular events (a composite of coronary heart death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or coronary revascularization) was assessed per 1-mmol/L (38.7-mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C level.

- **Results**: In the subgroup of patients from the CTTC meta-analysis of statins with a mean LDL-C in the control arm of 1.7 mmol/L (65.7 mg/dL), 1922 major vascular events occurred. The RR for major vascular events per 1-mmol/L (38.7-mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.65–0.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: Opportunities and challenges [^1118q1vi]. Heart (2021). Low credibility.

Elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease and stroke. Guidelines for the management of dyslipidemia from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) were updated in late 2019, in light of recent intervention trials involving the use of innovative lipid-lowering agents in combination with statins.

### LDL-C: Lower is better for longer-even at low risk [^115cjydc]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) causes atherosclerotic disease, as demonstrated in experimental and epidemiological cohorts, randomized controlled trials, and Mendelian randomization studies.

There is considerable inconsistency between existing guidelines regarding the effective management of patients at low overall risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) who have persistently elevated levels of LDL-C. We propose a step-by-step practical approach for the management of cardiovascular risks in individuals with low (140 mg/dL, 3.6 mmol/L) LDL-C. The strategy proposed is based on the level of adherence to lifestyle interventions (LSI), and in cases of non-adherence, stepwise practical management, including lipid-lowering therapy, is recommended to achieve target LDL-C levels (< 115 mg/dL, 3.0 mmol/L).

Further studies are necessary to answer questions about the long-term efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of the suggested approach. This is critical, considering the ever-increasing numbers of such low-risk patients seen in clinical practice.

### Counterpoint: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets are not needed in lipid treatment guidelines [^111PbaPQ]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2016). Low credibility.

On the basis of accumulating evidence, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) treat-to-goal approaches no longer seem to be the best way to optimize lipid-modifying therapy to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The potential for a net ASCVD risk reduction benefit is a more individualized approach to clinical decision-making and may better inform patient preferences. However, risk estimation tools will need to be developed to facilitate more personalized CVD risk estimation in statin-treated patients. In the meantime, LDL-C thresholds rather than targets may aid in determining which patients might benefit from additional LDL-C-lowering therapy beyond statins.

### Effect of electronic prescription on attainment of cholesterol goals [^113162Am]. Clinical Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Although recent federal mandates provide incentives for physicians to use electronic prescribing (e-prescribing), clinical endpoints to support its use are lacking. E-prescribing should improve low-density lipoprotein (LDL) goal attainment.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective cohort study, we queried the electronic medical records (Allscripts Electronic Health Record [EHR]) of a multispecialty outpatient academic medical practice to identify patient encounters during which consecutive lipid panels were drawn in 2007 (n = 2218). The EHR did not include a clinical decision tool for guideline adherence but did include formulary decision support (FDS), which informs physicians about drug costs specific to each patient. Logistic regression was used to examine whether the odds of reaching LDL goal were influenced by e-prescribing and adjusted for characteristics known to affect prescribing patterns and goal attainment.

- **Results**: Of 796 patients not at LDL goal at baseline, 49% (n = 393) were at goal at follow-up. Patients receiving an e-prescription with FDS were 59% more likely to achieve LDL goal than those with a manual prescription (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12–2.25). Superior LDL goal attainment may be due to the lower cost of medications; patients with an e-prescription were significantly more likely to receive a generic statin than patients with a manual prescription (38% vs. 22.9%; P = 0.0004), and for each $10 increase in prescription price, the likelihood of being at goal decreased by 5% (odds ratio = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.93–0.98).

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: A personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^1147bDQZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Management of elevated low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first‐line therapy for LDL‐C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL‐C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL‐C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL‐C lowering with statins alone.

Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid‐lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL‐C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL‐C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from "primary" versus "secondary" prevention to a "continuum of risk". The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL‐C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL‐C, both now and in the future, is provided.

### Management of LDL-cholesterol after an acute coronary syndrome: Key comparisons of the American and European clinical guidelines to the attention of the healthcare providers [^111DDNMT]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

In secondary prevention of very high‐risk patients, an LDL‐C reduction of ≥ 50% from baseline and an LDL‐C goal < 55 mg/dL are both recommended (class I, level A). A reduction in LDL‐C by 50% from baseline with high‐intensity statin is a first common step in both guidelines. However, the European guidelines recommend intensifying lipid‐lowering treatment even in patients who achieve an LDL‐C < 70 mg/dL, whereas the addition of a non-statin agent is recommended in the US guidelines only for those above the threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL. In the European guidelines, for patients with ASCVD who experienced a second vascular event within 2 years while taking maximally dosed statin therapy, an LDL‐C goal of < 40 mg/dL (< 1 mmol/L) may be considered (class IIb, level B). Compared to the US guidelines, the European guidelines support even lower LDL‐C goals with further intensification of therapy in patients with a reASCVD event with an LDL‐C of 55 to 70 mg/dL. The concept of goals implies that therapeutic options will be added sequentially to achieve a specific recommended LDL‐C level.

### PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe for the reduction of cardiovascular events: a clinical practice guideline with risk-stratified recommendations [^112SYNSK]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

In adults with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels > 1.8mmol/L (> 70mg/dL) who are already taking the maximum dose of statins or are intolerant to statins, should another lipid-lowering drug be added, either a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor or ezetimibe, to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events? If so, which drug is preferred? Having decided to use one, should we add the other lipid-lowering drug?

- **Practice**: Most guidelines emphasize LDL cholesterol targets in their recommendations for prescribing PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe in adults at high risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event. However, achieving these goals in very high-risk patients with statins alone is almost impossible. Physicians are increasingly considering other lipid-lowering drugs solely for achieving LDL cholesterol treatment goals rather than for achieving important absolute cardiovascular risk reduction. Most guidelines do not systematically assess the cardiovascular benefits of adding PCSK9 inhibitors and/or ezetimibe for all risk groups across primary and secondary prevention. Nor do they report, in accordance with explicit judgments of assumed patients' values and preferences, absolute benefits and harms, and potential treatment burdens.

- **Recommendations**: The guideline panel provided mostly weak recommendations, which means we rely on shared decision-making when applying these recommendations. For adults already using statins, the panel suggests adding a second lipid-lowering drug in people at very high risk.

Evidence for the underuse of lipid-lowering therapies in clinical practice

Despite guideline recommendations and compelling clinical trial evidence, recent population studies conducted in the United States and Europe have revealed that pharmacotherapy with a primary mechanism of LDL-C lowering is underused. Gu and colleagues reported an increase in the use of lipid-lowering therapies for ASCVD within the United States between 2014 and 2019; however, overall use remained low, with most patients not at guideline-recommended LDL-C thresholds. The persistent underuse of statins in contemporary practice is highlighted by a recently published retrospective study of over 600,000 US patients with established ASCVD; during the study period of 2018 to 2019, half of the included patients were not on any statin.

Among patients who receive lipid-lowering therapies, evidence suggests that management of lipid levels remains suboptimal, with many not receiving appropriate treatment intensity or available combination therapies needed to achieve LDL-C goals. A retrospective cohort study of approximately 1.5 million patients with a history of one or more major ASCVD events reported that over 50% of patients meeting the 2018 AHA/ACC/Multisociety guideline very high-risk criteria had LDL-C levels of 70 mg/dL or higher, despite receiving statins and/or ezetimibe. Similarly, data from the GOULD (Getting to an Improved Understanding of Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Dyslipidemia Management) registry showed that over a 2-year period, two-thirds of patients with ASCVD remained with LDL-C levels above 70 mg/dL, and only 17% received triple therapy.

### Clinical efficacy and safety of evolocumab in high-risk patients receiving a statin: Secondary analysis of patients with low LDL cholesterol levels and in those already receiving a maximal-potency statin in a randomized clinical trial [^114GnPmP]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). High credibility.

Guidelines for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease emphasize the use of high-intensity statins and targeting a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level of less than 70 mg/dL for the highest-risk patients. Whether further reduction of LDL-C beyond these boundaries would be beneficial remains unknown.

The objective of this study was to compare outcomes of evolocumab versus placebo in patients with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and a baseline LDL-C of less than 70 mg/dL, as well as in those receiving background treatment with a maximal-potency statin.

The design, setting, and participants for this secondary ad hoc analysis of the Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk (FOURIER) trial involved comparing randomized treatments in two subgroups of patients with stable atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease currently receiving statin therapy. Patients were categorized by a baseline LDL-C of less than 70 mg/dL or at least 70 mg/dL and by statin intensity. Maximal intensity was defined as atorvastatin calcium, 80 mg/d, or rosuvastatin, 40 mg/d; submaximal included all other dosages. Patients with baseline LDL of less than 70 mg/dL either had a final screening LDL-C of at least 70 mg/dL or a final screening non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of at least 100 mg/dL. Data were retrieved from 2013 to 2016 and analyzed in 2017 based on intention to treat.

The main outcomes and measures focused on the primary efficacy endpoint, which was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization.

### The evolution of European guidelines: Changing the management of cholesterol levels [^1165rLhC]. Atherosclerosis (2006). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in Europe and the US. This paper reviews the evolution of the Joint European Societies' guidelines with respect to their lipid recommendations. We stress the importance of lowering lipid levels to, or below, the currently recommended goals and argue that patients' global risk for CVD, rather than baseline lipid levels, should direct the intensity of lipid-lowering treatment. However, the emphasis on near-term (i.e. in the next 10 years) global risk estimation may under-emphasize the importance of considering lifetime cardiovascular risk in treatment decisions. Although various guidelines' thresholds for treatment initiation and recommended goals differ, they are similar in the theme of treating global risk. Most clinical trials have not identified a threshold of cholesterol level beyond which lowering cholesterol levels no longer provides cardiovascular benefit. An urgent call for action is needed to improve goal attainment in patients with or at risk for CVD. Improving access to risk-reducing treatments should be a priority.

### 2016 Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidelines for the management of dyslipidemia for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in the adult [^116s2q8s]. The Canadian Journal of Cardiology (2016). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to treatment targets, the CCS 2016 guidelines recommend targeting a > 50% reduction of LDL-C in patients with LDL-C > 190 mg/dL (> 5.0 mmol/L) who are already receiving treatment, in order to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: A personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^112Bav1w]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

- **The role of other atherogenic lipids**: Beyond LDL-C, elevated levels of other atherogenic lipids contribute to an individual's ASCVD risk. For example, elevated lipoprotein(a) is a genetically determined, independent, causal risk factor for ASCVD. AHA/ACC/Multisociety guidelines recommend consideration of a lipoprotein(a) level ≥ 50 mg/dL (or ≥ 125 nmol/L) if measured as a risk-enhancing factor to guide statin initiation in those at borderline or intermediate risk of ASCVD events. Guidance on how to incorporate lipoprotein(a) concentration into a person's 10-year ASCVD risk has also recently been provided within a statement from the AHA. Statins do not lower lipoprotein(a) and, in some studies, have been associated with increased lipoprotein(a) levels among recipients. Consequently, clinicians should be aware that elevated lipoprotein(a) remains an important contributor to ASCVD risk in the setting of LDL-C lowering with statins.

In addition to lipoprotein(a), triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (which are reflected in measures such as non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and remnant cholesterol) contribute to lipid-related risk for ASCVD. Persistent elevations of triglycerides ≥ 175 mg/dL are recognized as a risk-enhancing factor in the AHA/ACC/Multisociety guidelines.

### The challenge of achieving national cholesterol goals in patients with diabetes [^112tczAt]. Diabetes Care (2005). Low credibility.

This study analyzed lipid results from a large community-based population of patients with diabetes to assess the feasibility of attaining the standard and new optional LDL-based lipid goals using currently available lipid-lowering medications.

- **Research design and methods**: Ambulatory patients with diabetes who were interviewed as part of the Vermont Diabetes Information System trial with a reported LDL were analyzed. Patients were categorized into high-risk and very-high-risk cardiovascular status. For patients not at the LDL goal, the required changes in therapy to achieve the goal were assessed.

- **Results**: Of the entire cohort, 49.4% (321 of 650) had LDL < 100 mg/dl. According to the National Cholesterol Education Program, 29.4% (191 of 650) of patients were very high risk and have an optional LDL goal of < 70 mg/dl. Only 15.7% (30 of 191) of very high-risk patients had an LDL < 70 mg/dl. Based on our analysis of high-risk patients, 17 of 459 (3.7%) would require more than two lipid-lowering drugs to achieve an LDL < 100 mg/dl. In the very-high-risk group, we estimate that 26.2% (50 of 191) of patients will not reach LDL < 70 mg/dl with two lipid-lowering medications.

- **Conclusions**: In many patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, it will be difficult to attain an LDL goal of < 70 mg/dl. Approximately 25% of patients will require more than two lipid-lowering drugs at maximal doses to attain this goal, assuming 100% tolerance of lipid-lowering medications.

### Cholesterol lowering therapies and achievement of targets for primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention in type 2 diabetes: Unmet needs in a large population of outpatients at specialist clinics [^112uh2vT]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). High credibility.

The well-established benefit of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c) lowering treatments (LLTs) has led clinical guidelines to lower the cardiovascular prevention targets. Despite this, there is a surprising scarcity of real-world studies (RWS) evaluating whether recommendations are applied in the routine clinical management of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We therefore evaluated, in a large RWS, the pattern of LLTs use and the achievement of LDL-c targets in patients with T2D in Italian diabetes specialist clinics.

- **Methods**: We collected data from 46 diabetes outpatient clinics (following 281,381 subjects), including 104,726 T2D patients, for whom use of LLTs between 2015 and 2016 was ascertained. We used the 2016 and 2019 European Atherosclerosis Society and European Society of Cardiology (EAS-ESC) guidelines to define cardiovascular risk categories, LDL-c targets, and the expected LDL-c reduction and cardiovascular benefit achievable with LLT intensification.

- **Results**: 63,861 patients (61.0%) were on statin therapy, 9.2% of whom were also on ezetimibe. Almost all subjects were at high (29.3%) or very high (70.4%) cardiovascular risk, including 17% being in secondary prevention. Among very high-risk patients, 35% were not on statin despite half of them having LDL-c > 2.6 mmol/l, and only 15% of those on statins had LDL-c ≤ 1.8 mmol/l. Overall, 35% and 14% of subjects achieved the LDL-c targets as suggested by 2016 and 2019 EAS-ESC Guidelines, respectively.

### Statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^114QX3as]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Reducing high blood cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in people with and without a past history of CVD, is an important goal of pharmacotherapy. Statins are the first-choice agents. Previous reviews of the effects of statins have highlighted their benefits in people with CVD. The case for primary prevention was uncertain when the last version of this review was published (2011), and in light of new data, an update of this review is required.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects, both harms and benefits, of statins in people with no history of CVD.

- **Search methods**: To avoid duplication of effort, we checked reference lists of previous systematic reviews. The searches conducted in 2007 were updated in January 2012. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2022, Issue 4), MEDLINE OVID (1950 to December Week 4, 2011) and EMBASE OVID (1980 to 2012 Week 1). There were no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials of statins versus placebo or usual care control with a minimum treatment duration of one year and follow-up of six months in adults, with no restrictions on total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and where 10% or less had a history of CVD.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD, and stroke events, combined endpoints (fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events).

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes [^112Cw6Wv]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for ST-elevation myocardial infarction, specifically in relation to the management of dyslipidemia, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend considering setting an LDL-C goal of less than 1.0 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) in patients who experience a recurrent atherothrombotic event (recurrence within two years of the first acute coronary syndrome episode) while on maximally tolerated statin-based therapy.

### 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidemias: Lipid modification to reduce cardiovascular risk [^115Qq6KL]. European Heart Journal (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dyslipidemia, specifically concerning lipoprotein(a), the EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining lipoprotein(a) at least once in each adult person's lifetime. This is to identify patients with very high inherited lipoprotein(a) levels (> 180 mg/dL or > 430 mmol/L), which present a lifetime risk of ASCVD equivalent to the risk associated with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

### Intensity of and adherence to lipid-lowering therapy as predictors of goal attainment and major adverse cardiovascular events in primary prevention [^114szVzL]. American Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

The effectiveness of lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in routine care may depend on treatment intensity and adherence.

- **Methods**: Observational study of adults with newly initiated LLT for primary prevention of ASCVD in Stockholm, Sweden, during 2017–2021. Study exposures were LLT adherence [proportion of days covered (PDC)], LLT intensity (expected reduction of LDL cholesterol), and the combined measure of adherence and intensity. At each LLT fill, adherence and intensity were calculated during the previous 12 months, and the patients' estimated ASCVD risk was categorized. Study outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and LDL-C goal attainment.

- **Results**: Thirty-six thousand two hundred eighty-three individuals (mean age 63 years, 47% women, median follow-up 2 years), with a baseline low-moderate (40%), high (49%), and very-high (11%) ASCVD risk started LLT. Increases in LLT adherence, intensity, or adherence-adjusted intensity of 10% over 1 year were associated with lower risks of MACE (with hazard ratios of 0.95 [95% CI, 0.93–0.98]; 0.93 [0.86–1.00]; and 0.90 [0.85–0.95], respectively) and higher odds of attaining LDL goals. Patients with good adherence (≥ 80%) had similar risks of MACE and similar odds ratios for LDL-C goal attainment with low-moderate and high-intensity LLT. Treatment discontinuation was associated with increased MACE risk. The relative and absolute benefits of good adherence were greatest in patients with very high ASCVD risk.

- **Conclusion**: In routine-care primary prevention, adhering to lipid-lowering therapy plays a significant role in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events and achieving LDL-C goals.

### High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and treatment guidelines [^111fbp94]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Setting consistent guidelines for the treatment of lipid abnormalities must take into consideration several factors and must balance the need for precision, favored by specialists, and practicality in the patient setting, favored by general medical practitioners. The appropriate populations for treatment should be clearly defined, and usual threshold levels, target levels, and treatment should be well established. Plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) has not been widely incorporated in guidelines as a significant abnormality predictive of cardiovascular risk and as a therapeutic target. However, that view is changing in light of the recent improved understanding of the importance of each lipid fraction abnormality, including HDL-C, in the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic disease. In addition, clinical trials have demonstrated the apparent benefit of increasing low levels of HDL-C in reducing cardiovascular events. The use of guidelines incorporating threshold and target levels for managing HDL-C in high-risk populations is increasingly being seen as a practical means of improving outcomes for patients, especially for special groups, such as the elderly and those with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in adults: Synopsis of the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guideline [^113qL1Ed]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). High credibility.

In November 2013, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) released a clinical practice guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular risk in adults. This synopsis summarizes the major recommendations.

- **Methods**: In 2008, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) IV to update the 2001 ATP-III cholesterol guidelines using a rigorous process to systematically review randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses of RCTs that examined cardiovascular outcomes. The panel commissioned independent systematic evidence reviews on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals in secondary and primary prevention and the effect of lipid drugs on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events and adverse effects. In September 2013, the panel's draft recommendations were transitioned to the ACC/AHA.

- **Recommendations**: This synopsis summarizes key features of the guidelines in eight areas: lifestyle, groups shown to benefit from statins, statin safety, decision making, estimation of cardiovascular disease risk, intensity of statin therapy, treatment targets, and monitoring of statin therapy.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease: Evidence and guidance for management [^113Uk3bE]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Even at low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal, patients with cardiometabolic abnormalities remain at high risk of cardiovascular events. This paper aims to critically appraise evidence for elevated levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) as cardiovascular risk factors, and to advise on therapeutic strategies for management.

Evidence supports a causal association between elevated TRLs and their remnants, low HDL-C, and cardiovascular risk. This interpretation is based on mechanistic and genetic studies for TRLs and remnants, together with epidemiological data suggestive of the association for circulating triglycerides and cardiovascular disease. For HDL, epidemiological, mechanistic, and clinical intervention data are consistent with the view that low HDL-C contributes to elevated cardiovascular risk. However, genetic evidence is unclear, potentially reflecting the complexity of HDL metabolism.

The panel believes that therapeutic targeting of elevated triglycerides (≥ 1.7 mmol/L or 150 mg/dL), a marker of TRLs and their remnants, and/or low HDL-C (< 1.0 mmol/L or 40 mg/dL) may provide further benefit. The first step should be lifestyle interventions, together with consideration of compliance with pharmacotherapy and secondary causes of dyslipidaemia. If inadequately corrected, adding niacin or a fibrate, or intensifying LDL-C lowering therapy may be considered. Treatment decisions regarding statin combination therapy should take into account relevant safety concerns, such as risk.

### Evolving management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: A personalized approach to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across the risk continuum [^111BLQN9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

In addition to the assessment of traditional risk factors, there is extensive evidence on the utility of coronary artery calcium (CAC) in refining the prediction of vascular events. The MESA (Multi‐Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) 10‐year coronary heart disease risk score was the first to include CAC and traditional risk factors and was developed to help guide therapeutic decision‐making. CAC scoring is recommended by both the AHA/ACC/Multisociety and ESC/EAS guidelines to aid risk assessment in those at borderline or intermediate risk under consideration for statin therapy. In support of these recommendations, a study of individuals at intermediate risk of ASCVD within MESA demonstrated an association between CAC score and significant improvements in discrimination and risk reclassification for ASCVD events.

- **AHA/ACC/Multisociety guidelines**: The guidelines recommend initiation of statin therapy for any patient with a CAC score ≥ 100 Agatston units and/or ≥ 75th percentile. Statin therapy can be considered for any non‐0 score (i.e. CAC > 0). Recently, a CAC score > 300 Agatston units in primary prevention patients has been associated with ASCVD mortality rates equivalent to people with a stable ASCVD secondary prevention‐level risk. As such, a CAC score > 300 Agatston units may be a suitable threshold at which to treat patients according to the recommended approach for the secondary prevention population (i.e. LDL‐C reduction ≥ 50% and target LDL‐C < 70 mg/dL), who may require the addition of nonstatin lipid‐lowering therapy to statins.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes [^1168g1ef]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, specifically in managing dyslipidemia (lipid targets), the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend setting an LDL-C target of < 1.8 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL) and achieving an LDL-C reduction of at least 50% in patients with T2DM at high cardiovascular risk.

### Network meta-analysis of randomized trials evaluating the comparative efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies added to maximally tolerated statins for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^112mFCb6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is an important causal, modifiable risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Evidence from multiple prospective, randomized studies has substantiated that patients achieving the lowest LDL-C levels have the lowest risk of future major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) without associated safety concerns or adverse events, even when LDL-C is reduced to very low levels (< 40 mg/dL [< 1 mmol/L]). Managing LDL-C in a risk-stratified manner is particularly important in patients at high or very-high risk of MACEs.

European guidelines now recommend even lower LDL-C levels in groups at very-high risk of ASCVD. The 2019 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines and the more recent 2021 ESC guidelines recommend an LDL-C goal of < 55 mg/dL (< 1.4 mmol/L) and ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction from baseline for very high-risk patients, whereas US guidelines suggest high-intensity or maximal statin therapy, with the addition of ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor if LDL-C remains above the threshold of ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L).

### Frequency of attainment of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals in cardiovascular clinical practice (from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry PINNACLE Registry) [^116BsmMU]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Studies have found that non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) is a superior marker for coronary heart disease compared to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Little is known about the achievement of non-HDL-C goals outside clinical trials. Within a population of 146,064 patients with dyslipidemia in the PINNACLE Registry, and a subgroup of 36,188 patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), we examined the proportion of patients and patient characteristics associated with having LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and both LDL-C and non-HDL-C levels at National Cholesterol Education Program goals. LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and both LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals in the overall cohort were achieved by 73%, 73.4%, and 68.9% of patients, respectively.

Significant predictors of meeting all three goals were age, male gender, and the use of statins, nonstatins, and combined statin plus nonstatin therapies. Patients with comorbidities such as hypertension, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, peripheral arterial disease, myocardial infarction, and smoking were less likely to have LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and both LDL-C and non-HDL-C levels at National Cholesterol Education Program goals. In the overall cohort, patients with DM were less likely to meet non-HDL-C and both LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals. In the subgroup of patients with DM, predictors of meeting lipid goals were similar to the overall cohort.

In conclusion, these data suggest that contemporary treatment patterns by cardiologists successfully achieve lipid goals in most patients. However, younger, female patients and those with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and risk factors were less successful in meeting these targets.

### Effects of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin compared over 52 weeks of treatment in patients with hypercholesterolemia [^112GHh2m]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Despite the demonstrated benefits of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease, many patients receiving lipid-lowering therapy fail to achieve LDL-C goals. We compared the effects of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin in reducing LDL-C and achieving LDL-C goals in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.

- **Methods and results**: In this 52-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial (4522IL/0026), 412 patients with LDL-C 160 to < 250 mg/dL received a 5-mg dose of rosuvastatin (n = 138), a 10-mg dose of rosuvastatin (n = 134), or a 10-mg dose of atorvastatin (n = 140) for 12 weeks; during the following 40 weeks, dosages could be sequentially doubled up to 80 mg if National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel II (ATP-II) LDL-C goals were not achieved. At 12 weeks, 5- and 10-mg doses of rosuvastatin were associated with significantly greater LDL-C reductions than 10-mg doses of atorvastatin (46% and 50% vs 39%, both P < 0.001). At 12 weeks, both rosuvastatin dosages brought more patients to within ATP-II and European LDL-C goals than atorvastatin (86% and 89% vs 73% and 75%, and 86% vs 55%, respectively). At 52 weeks, compared with atorvastatin, both initial rosuvastatin treatment groups significantly reduced LDL-C (47% and 53% vs 44%, P < 0.05 and P < 0.001). Overall, more patients in the initial rosuvastatin 10-mg group achieved their ATP-II LDL-C goal than those in the initial atorvastatin 10-mg group (98% vs 87%), with 82% of patients treated with rosuvastatin achieving their goal at the 10-mg level.

### Narrative review: Lack of evidence for recommended low-density lipoprotein treatment targets: A solvable problem [^115uY7g7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Recent national recommendations have proposed that physicians should titrate lipid therapy to achieve low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels less than 1.81 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL) for patients at very high cardiovascular risk and less than 2.59 mmol/L (< 100 mg/dL) for patients at high cardiovascular risk. To examine the clinical evidence for these recommendations, the authors reviewed all controlled trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies that examined the independent relationship between LDL cholesterol and major cardiovascular outcomes in patients with LDL cholesterol levels less than 3.36 mmol/L (< 130 mg/dL).

For those with LDL cholesterol levels less than 3.36 mmol/L (< 130 mg/dL), the authors found no clinical trial subgroup analyses or valid cohort or case-control analyses suggesting that the degree to which LDL cholesterol responds to a statin independently predicts the degree of cardiovascular risk reduction. Published studies had avoidable limitations, such as a reliance on ecological (aggregate) analyses, use of analyses that ignore statins' other proposed mechanisms of action, and failure to account for known confounders (especially healthy volunteer effects).

Clear, compelling evidence supports near-universal empirical statin therapy in patients at high cardiovascular risk (regardless of their natural LDL cholesterol values), but clinical evidence does not demonstrate that titrating lipid therapy to achieve proposed low LDL cholesterol levels is beneficial or safe.
