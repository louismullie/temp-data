## Question

A 28-year-old is brought to the emergency department after exposure to a malfunctioning home furnace. He has headache, nausea, confusion, and a carboxyhemoglobin level of 25%. He is diagnosed with acute carbon monoxide poisoning. What ICD-10 code should be used for billing?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which ICD-10 code should be used for billing a 28-year-old with acute carbon monoxide poisoning from a malfunctioning home furnace, with headache, nausea, confusion, and a carboxyhemoglobin level of 25%. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct ICD-10 category for toxic effects of carbon monoxide. Then, I should verify the intent and whether an external cause code is required. Next, I will check the encounter type and whether a seventh character is needed. Finally, I will confirm whether any additional codes are warranted for the source or complications, and I will double-check that the chosen code aligns with authoritative guidance and epidemiologic usage.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis category. Carbon monoxide poisoning is coded under T58 in ICD-10-CM, which covers toxic effects of carbon monoxide, and this is the standard category used in clinical and epidemiologic studies of CO poisoning, including large cohorts and surveillance work, so T58 is the correct starting point [^72e185d8] [^9eba72cd].

> Wait, let me verify the intent and whether I need a separate external cause code. In ICD-10-CM, poisoning codes in the T36–T65 range include intent within the code itself, so I should not add a separate external cause code for intent; I need to select the T58 code with the correct intent character, and for an accidental exposure from a home furnace, that intent is accidental, which corresponds to the fifth character "1" in T58 codes [^33894c69] [^653242a6].

> I should confirm the encounter type next. For an initial emergency department visit with active treatment, ICD-10-CM uses a seventh character "A" to denote an initial encounter; I initially thought I might need to add this as a separate suffix, but hold on, I should verify the exact code structure. Let me reconsider: the full ICD-10-CM code for accidental CO poisoning on initial encounter is T58.01XA, where the "X" is a placeholder to allow for the seventh character "A", so the correct billing code is T58.01XA [^33894c69] [^653242a6].

> But wait, what if the coder asks about the source of exposure — should I add an external cause code for the furnace? I need to check whether ICD-10-CM requires a separate external cause code here. Since T58 already captures the substance and intent, and ICD-10-CM moved external cause information into the T code itself for poisonings, a separate external cause code is not required for billing in this scenario, though some institutions may optionally document additional detail; I should not force an extra code unless there is a specific institutional or payer requirement [^33894c69] [^653242a6].

> Let me double-check that the clinical severity and mechanism align with standard coding practice. A carboxyhemoglobin level of 25% in a symptomatic patient supports the diagnosis of acute CO poisoning and fits within the T58 category; importantly, COHb levels are not used to select a more specific T58 subcategory, so the correct code remains T58.01XA regardless of the exact COHb value, and the symptoms described are consistent with CO toxicity without altering the code choice [^72e185d8] [^33894c69].

> Final answer: The ICD-10-CM code for acute carbon monoxide poisoning, accidental, initial encounter is T58.01XA [^33894c69] [^653242a6].

---

The correct ICD-10-CM code for acute carbon monoxide poisoning from a malfunctioning home furnace is **T58.01XA** (Toxic effect of carbon monoxide, accidental [unintentional], initial encounter). This code captures the toxic effect of CO, the accidental intent, and that this is the initial encounter. No additional external cause code is needed because the intent is already embedded in the T-code [^33894c69].

---

## ICD-10-CM code structure and explanation

ICD-10-CM codes are alphanumeric and follow a specific structure. For poisoning codes, the **first character is a letter** indicating the chapter (T for toxic effects), followed by two digits indicating the category (58 for carbon monoxide). The fourth character specifies the intent (accidental, intentional, undetermined, adverse effect, or underdosing), and the fifth character provides additional detail. The sixth and seventh characters indicate the encounter type (initial, subsequent, or sequela) [^33894c69].

For this case, the code **T58.01XA** breaks down as follows:

- **T**: Chapter 19 (injury, poisoning, and certain other consequences of external causes)
- **58**: Toxic effect of carbon monoxide
- **0**: Accidental (unintentional) intent
- **1**: Additional detail (specific to carbon monoxide poisoning)
- **X**: Placeholder for future expansion
- **A**: Initial encounter

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the code selection

The patient's presentation — headache, nausea, confusion, and a carboxyhemoglobin level of 25% — is consistent with acute carbon monoxide poisoning from a malfunctioning furnace. The ICD-10-CM code **T58.01XA** accurately reflects the clinical scenario, including the toxic effect of carbon monoxide, the accidental nature of the exposure, and the initial encounter.

---

## Relevant ICD-10-CM coding guidelines

According to ICD-10-CM coding guidelines, poisoning codes from the T36–T65 range include both the substance involved and the intent of exposure. Therefore, **no additional external cause code is required** when the intent is already specified within the T-code [^33894c69]. In this case, the accidental intent is captured by the fourth character "0", so no separate external cause code is necessary.

---

## Alternative ICD-10-CM codes considered

Alternative ICD-10-CM codes considered include:

- **T58.02XA**: Toxic effect of carbon monoxide, intentional self-harm, initial encounter (not applicable, as the exposure was accidental)
- **T58.03XA**: Toxic effect of carbon monoxide, assault, initial encounter (not applicable, as there was no assault)
- **T58.04XA**: Toxic effect of carbon monoxide, undetermined intent, initial encounter (not applicable, as the intent was clearly accidental)

Thus, **T58.01XA** is the most appropriate code for this clinical scenario.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The correct ICD-10-CM code for a 28-year-old patient diagnosed with acute carbon monoxide poisoning from a malfunctioning home furnace is **T58.01XA**. This code accurately reflects the toxic effect of carbon monoxide, the accidental nature of the exposure, and the initial encounter. No additional external cause code is required, as the intent is already embedded within the T-code [^33894c69].

### Practice recommendations in the diagnosis, management, and prevention of carbon monoxide poisoning [^e510fd18]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is common in modern society, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality in the United States annually. Over the past two decades, sufficient information has been published about carbon monoxide poisoning in the medical literature to draw firm conclusions about many aspects of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and clinical management of the syndrome, along with evidence-based recommendations for optimal clinical practice. This article provides clinical practice guidance to the pulmonary and critical care community regarding the diagnosis, management, and prevention of acute CO poisoning. The article represents the consensus opinion of four recognized content experts in the field. Supporting data were drawn from the published, peer-reviewed literature on CO poisoning, placing emphasis on selecting studies that most closely mirror clinical practice.

### Carbon monoxide poisoning: undetected by both patients and their doctors [^8876b842]. Age and Ageing (2004). Low credibility.

Carbon monoxide poisoning represents a potentially preventable and reversible cause of mortality and morbidity if sources and cases can be identified. The elderly have been shown to be particularly at risk. Concerns continue to be raised about potential unrecognised cases of carbon monoxide poisoning. These concerns arise from difficulties in knowing who to suspect as a potential victim of poisoning as well as how, when and what to test. In general carbon monoxide has no helpful unique clinical presentation and is known to mimic common illnesses as well as exacerbate established diseases. As a gas it is undetectable by the human senses and is potentially present in most households. This paper reviews the issues associated with carbon monoxide poisoning including pointers to early diagnosis and discussion of pathophysiology and management.

2 Material and methods

2.1 Data sources

2.1.1 Hospital admission data

We extracted data on all non-elective CO poisoning hospital admissions registered in England between 2002 and 2016 from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) inpatient dataset. HES contains detailed information on any admission at a National Health Service (NHS) hospital – i.e. public hospital – in England, including private patients treated in NHS hospitals. Hospital stays are broken down in periods of care under different consultants, referred to as ‘episodes’. The order of episodes reflects the relevance of events in relation to the reason of hospitalization. Each episode contains a primary diagnosis and up to 19 secondary diagnostic fields, coded based on the International Classification of Disease 10th edition (ICD-10). We included hospital records with any mention of unintentional toxic effects of CO (ICD-10: T58 + X47), excluding fire-related hospital admission (ICD-10: X00-X09; T20-T32 or Y26). Nonetheless, other causes of CO poisoning (Appendix Methods A1 & Table A1) were examined for context (Table 1). We considered both primary and secondary diagnostic fields of a first episode. Multiple admissions by the same patient were retained as exposure to the same emission source is plausible. Data on UNFR CO poisoning admissions were obtained from other high-income countries for which data could be accessed freely online (Canada) or through collaborations (US, France and Spain) (Table A2).

Data challenges constitute many of the limitations of this analysis. First, without data in many countries, our ability to estimate carbon monoxide poisoning was severely affected. Where data were scarce, our cause of death models relied on covariates and regional data to estimate mortality.Although the ability to make informed predictions in the absence of data is an advantage of the GBD methods, it can also introduce biases. Second, although the GBD addresses miscoding in vital registration data through garbage code redistribution, incorrect assignment in cause of death data could affect the estimation of deaths due to carbon monoxide poisoning. For example, deaths due to intentional carbon monoxide poisoning could have inadvertently been coded as unintentional, or a comorbid condition could have been listed as the underlying cause of death.Third, this study only looked at trends after 2000 to reduce the influence of ICD-9-coded data on the analysis, given some of the inconsistencies between poisoning-related codes in ICD-9 versus ICD-10.However, not all countries had switched to ICD-10 by 2000, and ICD-9-coded data could still have influenced the estimates. Fourth, accurately identifying deaths by carbon monoxide poisoning is challenging without a thorough autopsy or strong circumstantial evidence. Many studies have reported that the true number of deaths due to carbon monoxide poisoning might be greater than that captured in the data, particularly in countries without high-quality vital registration systems; however, other evidence suggests that deaths due to carbon monoxide poisoning could be over-counted.,Best practice for ICD-10 cause of death coding is to use the cause of injury ICD code, X47, in conjunction with the nature of injury code T58, as supplemental information; however, most data sources available to the GBD do not contain this level of detail.Additionally, not all countries provide the four-digit detail for the cause of injury code X47 itself (ie, specifying one of X47.0–X47.9), affecting our ability to draw further information about the circumstances surrounding these deaths. Fifth, it was not possible to capture within-country variation, and between-country variation could have been masked by regional estimates. Risk factors for carbon monoxide poisoning can vary greatly, both between and within countries, and by season, climate, and demographic, which might have been masked in this study. Sixth, not all underlying data sources for both risk factors in the risk factor analysis provided detailed age, sex, or cause of injury information, requiring some degree of extrapolation to produce carbon-monoxide-specific results.Both risk factors were estimated for people aged 15 years or older, and as such cannot help to explain patterns seen among children. Currently, only two risk factors are associated with mortality due to carbon monoxide poisoning in the GBD risk factor framework, which means that important associations, such as low temperature, are not captured; we hope to address this in the future. Seventh, this study was unable to examine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unintentional carbon monoxide poisonings might have increased due to increased time at home, and initial studies suggested that those who had contracted COVID-19 might be at increased risk for poisoning, but more data will be necessary to reach conclusions.Finally, because this study only examined unintentional non-fire-related carbon monoxide poisoning mortality, it does not capture the burden of carbon monoxide poisoning more broadly. Other studies have noted that the distribution of types of carbon monoxide poisoning can vary greatly between locations, and approaches to prevention might differ depending on the cause.

Introduction

Deaths due to unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning are often preventable.Quantification of mortality from carbon monoxide poisoning is essential to draw attention to this threat and reduce unnecessary deaths.To our knowledge, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) is the only study that has estimated carbon monoxide poisoning mortality globally. Other studies have sought to estimate the morbidity and mortality associated with carbon monoxide poisoning at the country or regional level and to identify risk factors for such poisoning events. However, many of these studies have been done only in countries in which high-quality mortality data are available, focused on a single country, or relied on previous iterations of the GBD.,,,,,,,,,,,,,Due to differences in the time periods covered, case definitions, and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding systems used, the ability to make comparisons across studies is limited.

Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas that is odourless, colourless, and tasteless, making it undetectable to the human senses.It is produced by the incomplete combustion of fuels, such as wood, coal, and natural gas. Common household sources include heating and cooking equipment, such as furnaces, wood stoves, charcoal grills, gas stoves and heaters, and generators, as well as vehicle exhaust.,Unintentional fatal carbon monoxide poisonings mostly occur within residences and are more common during the winter months when heating systems are employed, windows are closed, and ventilation is reduced.High levels of carbon monoxide or prolonged periods of exposure to the gas can quickly lead to severe bodily harm through multiple mechanisms, such as interrupting the delivery of oxygen throughout the body, impeding the use of oxygen, causing oxidative stress, or impairing cellular function.Mild carbon monoxide poisoning often presents with non-descript symptoms, such as nausea, headache, and fatigue, and more severe poisoning can manifest in several ways, including loss of consciousness, acute cardiac events, and death.Although prompt removal from the source of exposure and hyperbaric oxygen therapy have been recommended as two strategies for reversing the effects of, and reducing lasting harm due to, carbon monoxide poisoning, there is currently no true antidote, underscoring the importance of prevention.

Acute carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning—cardiac testing for risk prediction: Level B recommendations state that in emergency department patients with moderate to severe CO poisoning, obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac biomarker levels to identify acute myocardial injury, which can predict poor outcome. The potential benefits include improved risk stratification and identification of patients at significant risk for cardiac morbidity and mortality, whereas a potential harm is that identifying acute myocardial injury may lead to unnecessary future cardiac testing and monitoring that may not improve patient-centered outcomes.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Previous studies have described single or multinational patterns and trends of unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning deaths, and have identified common risk factors such as age, sex, weather, heating source, and type of cooking equipment. Studies commonly found that males and older people were at greater risk of death due to carbon monoxide poisoning. These studies were identified opportunistically, via PubMed and Google Scholar, using terms such as “carbon monoxide poisoning” and “mortality” or “epidemiology” or “risk factors”. Studies were also shared with us by expert collaborators. However, existing studies use inconsistent versions or sets of codes from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system to identify carbon monoxide poisoning. Furthermore, most identified studies focused on high-income locations and reported findings for different age groups or time periods, making it difficult to make comparisons between studies or discern broad temporal and spatial trends; although, a few national-level studies have shown decreases in carbon monoxide poisoning mortality over the past 20–30 years. Previous work has shown that increasing public awareness about the sources of carbon monoxide and the use of carbon monoxide alarms can reduce the burden of unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning.

American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) clinical policy—acute carbon monoxide poisoning in adults presenting to the emergency department frames the scope and key questions for evidence review. It focuses on the management of adult patients with acute symptomatic carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning and notes that the subcommittee reviewed the medical literature to address two issues: whether hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) therapy should be used for treatment of acute CO poisoning, and whether clinical or laboratory criteria can identify CO-poisoned patients most or least likely to benefit from this therapy.

Input data and data processing

Three main steps were to prepare cause of death data for poisoning by carbon monoxide. First, all available data were identified and assigned to GBD causes of death (appendix pp 7–8). Globally, 3807 data sources were used as input data for the modelling of unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning deaths (appendix pp 58–120). Vital registration data constituted the majority of these sources (97·8%), and the remainder were verbal autopsy studies. However, because this cause of death is not part of the algorithms to classify verbal autopsy data, and most datapoints from these sources reported zero deaths, we marked all verbal autopsy data (40 data sources with 2802 age-specific and sex-specific datapoints) as outliers. The ICD codes mapped to poisoning by carbon monoxide were E862.0–E862.9, E868.0–E868.9, and E869.9 for ICD-9, and X47.0–X47.9 for ICD-10. Hence, this study only captured unintentional non-fire-related carbon monoxide poisoning, and explicitly excludes intentional carbon monoxide poisoning (eg, suicide) and unintentional fire-related carbon monoxide poisoning. This study reports only on 2000–21 data and therefore does not include many years of ICD-9-coded data; this decision was made to emphasise recent trends and reduce the effect of inconsistencies in the coding method. Several countries and geographical regions had scarce data for carbon monoxide poisoning, including much of sub-Saharan Africa, south Asia, and southeast Asia (appendix pp 35–36).

ACEP clinical policy—translation of classes of evidence to recommendation levels states: Level A recommendations are “generally accepted principles for patient care that reflect a high degree of clinical certainty (eg, based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence I or multiple Class of Evidence II studies).” Level B recommendations are “recommendations for patient care that may identify a particular strategy or range of strategies that reflect moderate clinical certainty (eg, based on evidence from 1 or more Class of Evidence II studies or strong consensus of Class of Evidence III studies).” Level C recommendations are “recommendations for patient care that are based on evidence from Class of Evidence III studies or, in the absence of any adequate published literature, based on expert consensus,” and when such consensus is used, “consensus” is placed in parentheses. The policy also notes that recommendations from a body of evidence “should not be rated as highly as the individual studies” when factors such as heterogeneity, uncertainty about effect magnitude and consequences, or publication bias are present, and that “clinically oriented statistics (eg, likelihood ratios [LRs], number needed to treat [NNT]) are presented” when possible.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute carbon monoxide poisoning [^8aef05f3]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

This clinical policy focuses on critical issues concerning the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute symptomatic carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. The subcommittee reviewed the medical literature relevant to the questions posed. The critical questions are: Should hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) therapy be used for the treatment of patients with acute CO poisoning; and Can clinical or laboratory criteria identify CO-poisoned patients who are most or least likely to benefit from this therapy. Recommendations are provided on the basis of the strength of evidence of the literature. Level A recommendations represent patient management principles that reflect a high degree of clinical certainty; Level B recommendations represent patient management principles that reflect moderate clinical certainty; and Level C recommendations represent other patient management strategies that are based on preliminary, inconclusive, or conflicting evidence, or based on committee consensus. This clinical policy is intended for physicians working in hospital-based EDs.

American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) clinical policy—scope and key clinical questions address adult emergency department patients with suspected or diagnosed acute carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning and are based on a systematic review with graded evidence. The policy evaluates whether noninvasive carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) measurement can accurately diagnose CO toxicity, whether hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) compared with normobaric oxygen improves long-term neurocognitive outcomes in diagnosed patients, and whether cardiac testing can predict morbidity or mortality. It updates the 2008 ACEP clinical policy, which concluded that although HBO2 is a therapeutic option for CO-poisoned patients, its use cannot be mandated, and this revision revisits HBO2 and addresses pulse CO oximetry and cardiac testing.

### Carbon monoxide intoxication: what we know [^8e9b4e93]. Burns (2019). Medium credibility.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a toxic, color-, taste- and odorless gas with fatal consequences if undetected. Intoxication caused by CO is frequent possibly leading to a high morbidity and mortality. The disease involves multiple organ systems without a typical clinical presentation. The clinical picture is furthermore unrelated to levels of carboxyhemoglobin - the routine biomarker. Therefore the diagnosis and treatment can be very demanding. This article in detail reviews epidemiology, symptoms, diagnosis and the therapy of this multidisciplinary challenge.

ACEP clinical policy—assessment of classes of evidence explains that all articles were “graded by at least 2 methodologists and assigned a Class of Evidence,” with each article assigned a design class in which “design I” is the strongest and “design 2, design 3” represent weaker designs for therapeutic, diagnostic, or prognostic clinical reports or meta-analyses. Articles were then graded on methodological features (including randomization processes, blinding, allocation concealment, methods of data collection, outcome measures and their assessment, selection and misclassification biases, sample size, and generalizability) and received a final Class of Evidence grade “Class I, Class II, Class III, or Class X.” Articles with fatal flaws or not applicable to the critical question received a Class of Evidence grade “X” and “were not used in formulating recommendations.” Grading was question-specific, so a single article could receive different Classes of Evidence, and question-specific grading is available in the Evidentiary Table online at www.annemergmed.com.

### Clinical analysis of acute poisoning in children [^ceee3c53]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

This study was a cross-sectional study. A total of 112 hospitalized children were selected by using the case screening of Qilu Hospital of Shandong University to input “acute poisoning”. The clinical retrospective analysis was carried out according to age, sex, season, type of poison, poisoning time, visiting time, poisoning route, poisoning manifestation, injured organ, treatment method and so on.

Inclusion criteria

Children aged 0–18 years, discharge records to the first diagnosis as the main diagnosis of this study, and disease diagnosis following the International Classification of Diseases standard coding ICD-10 code (To facilitate the classification of toxic substances). Diagnostic criteria: a clear history of poisoning by mistake or other means, can find contact with poison or container; toxicants and specific enzymatic changes could be detected in the blood and urine of some children.

Grouping method

According to the growth and development stage of children in pediatrics, it is divided into neonatal and infant periods (0–1 year), early childhood (1–3 years), preschool periods (3–7 years), school age and adolescence (≥ 7 years). Divided by gender.

According to China’s climatic and astronomical seasons, it is divided into spring (March-May), summer (June-August), autumn (September-November), and winter (December-February).

Classification and Causes of Poisoning In this study According to ICD-10 code T36.051-T65.951, the toxic substances are divided into drug poisoning (including Chinese herbal medicine), chemical poisoning, pesticide poisoning, rodenticide poisoning, carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, and other substances. According to the code classification of carbon monoxide poisoning as a harmful gas poisoning category, this classification is listed separately. The causes of poisoning are divided into accidental poisoning (refers to children in life due to contact, aspiration, ingestion, and other ways of contact with poisons) and intentional poisoning (refers to the poisoning caused by child’s intentional medications for various reasons and intentional feedings of others).

Clinical manifestations and laboratory tests in children are following medical records. Clinical manifestations include the digestive system, respiratory system, blood circulation system, nervous system, and patients without clinical symptoms. Laboratory tests included liver function, renal function, myocardial enzymes, cholinesterase, coagulation system, and other tests. According to laboratory results, they were divided into groups with or without organ damage.

Second, poorly defined causes were reassigned to other underlying causes of death through garbage code redistribution. This process was used when the underlying cause of death in vital registration data was vague or assigned to a cause that should not be considered the true underlying cause of death (eg, heart failure, or injuries of undetermined intent). Garbage code redistribution was done by age, sex, country, year, and ICD system; this method is complex and variable by type of garbage code, but generally requires estimating the proportions of each group of garbage codes that should be reassigned to true underlying causes of death based on available information (eg, patterns in multiple cause of death data; appendix pp 8–11).Approximately 17% of all deaths in the carbon monoxide poisoning input data were redistributed from ICD codes that were considered garbage codes; visualisations for example countries are available in the appendix (pp 12–15).

Third, a Bayesian noise-reduction algorithm was used to apply an adjustment to zero counts and correct for stochasticity in small populations in the cause of death data (appendix pp 16–18).This method was implemented by cause, sex, and country, and ensured that datapoints of zero deaths were not dropped when modelling in natural logarithm or logit space.

Acute carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning—epidemiology, kinetics, and sequelae in emergency department populations include substantial burden and measurable benefits of oxygen therapy. There are approximately 50,000 emergency department visits per year, with an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 annual deaths from severe toxicity. CO binds hemoglobin with an affinity approximately 220 times that of oxygen, producing an elimination half-life of 4 to 5 hours without therapy; oxygen therapy decreases the elimination half-life to 85 minutes (range, 26 to 148 minutes) with normobaric oxygen and to 20 minutes with hyperbaric oxygen. Neurologic sequelae can be delayed by 2 to 21 days and have been described in 12% to 68% of poisoned patients, and mortality risk can be up to a 3-fold increase at a median follow-up of 7.6 years after exposure.

The wound care industry will gain many benefits when International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10-Clinical Modification (CM) is implemented. One of the main benefits is that the disease classifications will be consistent with current clinical practice and medical technology advances. The new classification codes will be very granular, which means the level of specificity will greatly improve. Numerous new codes will represent more specific anatomic sites, etiologies, comorbidities, and complications, and will improve the ability to demonstrate severity of illness. For instance, the new feature of laterality is directly built into the new codes: separate codes will distinguish right, left, and bilateral, where needed. The increased granularity will provide better analysis of disease patterns and outbreak of disease. Additionally, the United States will finally be using the same diagnosis coding system as the rest of the world. This article will describe what the ICD-9-CM/ICD-10-CM codes are, why they are so important, and how clinicians and researchers will convert from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM effective October 1, 2014.

Added value of this study

This Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) reports trends in global mortality due to unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning from 2000 to 2021, geographically and by age and sex, using vital registration data gathered from all available mortality databases. Unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning mortality was first estimated as part of the GBD in GBD 2017. Compared with previous iterations of the GBD, these results include new input data sources and improved data processing and mortality estimation methods to better account for miscoding in cause of death data and handling of small numbers. We focus on trends over the past two decades, in which vital registrations in most countries had transitioned to ICD-10 coding. Drawing on more than 3000 data sources, we found approximately a 50% decrease in the global age-standardised mortality rate due to unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning from 2000 to 2021. Mortality due to unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning was greater among males than among females. The percentage of deaths attributable to occupational injuries and high alcohol use was higher for males than females, and varied by age. Although unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning events tend to be more common in places with cold winters, they still occur across all locations and affect people of all ages. We also estimated years of life lost (YLLs) due to carbon monoxide poisoning. We found that while children younger than 5 years have lower mortality rates than adults, this young age group contributes similar numbers of YLLs to those estimated for adults.

Implications of all the available evidence

From this analysis, we have identified the locations, ages, and sexes in which mortality due to unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning is highest and most deserving of public health attention. Unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning is a largely preventable cause of death. Future work to increase data collection and public awareness and interventions to reduce carbon monoxide poisoning need to be prioritised, especially in populations most at risk.

Drawing on the most recent iteration of the GBD, we aim to provide a complete time series of mortality estimates for unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning using a common case definition and a standardised modelling approach, globally, for all ages and both sexes, from 2000 to 2021, highlighting countries, regions, and demographic groups at greatest risk of death. This manuscript was produced as part of the GBD Collaborator Network and in accordance with the GBD Protocol.

Carbon monoxide poisoning—hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) versus normobaric oxygen for long-term neurocognitive outcomes: The clinical question asked, “In ED patients diagnosed with acute CO poisoning, does HBO2 therapy as compared with normobaric oxygen therapy improve long-term neurocognitive outcomes?” Level B recommendations state, “Emergency physicians should use HBO2 therapy or high-flow normobaric therapy for acute CO-poisoned patients,” and “It remains unclear whether HBO2 therapy is superior to normobaric oxygen therapy for improving long-term neurocognitive outcomes,” with Level A and Level C recommendations “None specified.” For this question, “Two hundred sixteen articles were identified in the search; 43 articles were selected from the search results for further review, with 7 studies included for this critical question,” and background notes that “Long-term neurocognitive deficits as a result of CO poisoning, generally referred to as neurologic sequelae, are some of the most feared clinical outcomes of acute CO toxicity,” while “its benefits and use in acute CO poisoning remain controversial.”

Carbon monoxide poisoning—patient safety considerations advise to consider affixing a carbon monoxide detector to an equipment bag that is routinely taken into scene (if it signals alarm, don appropriate respiratory protection and exit scene) to assist with detection of occult CO toxicity; remove patient and response personnel from potentially hazardous environment as soon as possible; and provide instruction to the patient, the patient's family, and other appropriate bystanders to not enter the environment where the carbon monoxide exposure occurred until the source of the poisoning has been eliminated. Do not look for cherry red skin coloration as an indication of carbon monoxide poisoning, as this is an unusual finding, and CO oximeter devices may yield inaccurate low/normal results for patients with CO poisoning. All patients with probable or suspected CO poisoning should be transported to the nearest appropriate hospital based on their presenting signs and symptoms.

Acute carbon monoxide poisoning—loss of consciousness and coma subgroup findings: “Two studies randomized patients both with and without loss of consciousness from CO poisoning to HBO2, and non-HBO2 treatment groups,” but “Weaver et al10 did not present outcomes data on patients who lost consciousness separately from the aggregate.” In another trial, “loss of consciousness is one of the 13 criteria used to define “severe CO poisoned” in their study. In this “severely CO-poisoned” subset (N=139; 73% all subjects), HBO2 was associated with a 20% absolute increase in poor neurologic outcomes at hospital discharge.” Specifically, “Neurologic sequelae at hospital discharge were reported in 85% of HBO2-treated and 65% of control patients with severe CO poisoning (reported OR 3.6; 95% CI 1.1 to 11.9; P=0.03),” though “If any multiple-measures statistical correction is used, this finding becomes no longer statistically significant, and outcomes at 1-month follow-up were the same in both treatment groups.” Additional data note that “the 2 Class III studies that enrolled only patients who did not lose consciousness produced conflicting results.” For patients with loss of consciousness or coma, “Raphael et al12 randomized patients who had loss of consciousness or coma (groups B1 and B2, n=286) to receive either 1 or 2 HBO2 treatments,” and this arm “did show that outcomes are worse in the more severe poisoning group, regardless of treatment group assignment.”

Methods

Overview

The GBD is a comprehensive effort to quantify health loss by age and sex for 371 diseases and injuries and 88 risk factors, across 204 countries and territories, from 1990 to the present. This latest iteration of the GBD includes crucial updates such as new input data sources and improved data processing and mortality estimation methods for miscoding in cause of death data and handling of small numbers. Mortality due to unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning was quantified through a systematic modelling process informed by vital registration records and covariates with a relationship to carbon monoxide poisoning. Details of this framework are described elsewhere,,but an overview of methods specific to poisoning by carbon monoxide follows. Regional estimates were computed with estimates from more detailed locations in accordance with the GBD location hierarchy, which consists of seven super-regions, 21 regions, and 204 countries and territories, and was constructed by grouping together countries on the basis of geographical proximity and shared epidemiologically relevant characteristics (appendix pp 6–7).

GBD complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting statement (appendix pp 4–5).Input data sources are available online and in the appendix (pp 58–120). Statistical code used for GBD estimation is available online.

### Carbon monoxide exposures – United States, 2000-2009 [^d95604e3]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2011). Low credibility.

Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is a leading cause of unintentional poisoning deaths in the United States. CO is an odorless, colorless gas that usually remains undetectable until exposure results in injury or death. CO poisoning is preventable; nonetheless, unintentional, non--fire-related CO poisoning is responsible for approximately 15,000 emergency department visits and nearly 500 deaths annually in the United States. National estimates of CO exposures have been based on secondary data sources, such as hospital administrative records, and are limited to exposures treated within the health-care system. To describe more completely the national burden of CO exposure and risk factors associated with vulnerable populations, CDC used data from the National Poison Data System (NPDS) to characterize reported unintentional, non--fire-related CO exposures, including those that were managed at the site of exposure and were not treated at a health-care facility. Among 68,316 CO exposures reported to poison centers during 2000--2009, a total of 30,798 (45.1%) were managed at the site of exposure with instructions from the poison center by telephone, 36,691 (53.7%) were treated at a health-care facility, and the management site for the remainder was unknown. Although symptoms varied slightly between persons managed on-site and those treated at a health-care facility, most CO exposures occurred at home and most often involved females, children aged ≤17 years, and adults aged 18--44 years. Surveillance and analysis of data from NPDS and secondary sources might provide a more comprehensive description of the burden of CO exposure in the United States and assist in the development of interventions better targeted to high-risk populations.

Carbon monoxide poisoning—notes and educational pearls highlight that pulse oximetry is inaccurate due to the carbon monoxide binding with hemoglobin, and as maternal carboxyhemoglobin levels do not accurately reflect fetal carboxyhemoglobin levels, pregnant patients are more likely to be treated with hyperbaric oxygen. Clinicians should consider cyanide toxicity if carbon monoxide poisoning is from a fire. Pertinent assessment findings include that early and repeat assessment of patient's mental status and motor function are extremely useful in determining response to therapy and the need for hyperbaric therapy, along with identification of possible etiology of poisoning, time of symptom onset and time of initiation of exposure-specific treatment, and response to therapy.

### The tragedy of the implementation of ICD-10-CM as ICD-10: is the cart before the horse or is there a tragic paradox of misinformation and ignorance? [^71b70a4c]. Pain Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The forced implementation of ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification) codes that are specific to the United States, scheduled for implementation October 1, 2015, which is vastly different from ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision), implemented worldwide, which has 14,400 codes, compared to ICD-10-CM with 144,000 codes to be implemented in the United States is a major concern to practicing U.S. physicians and a bonanza for health IT and hospital industry. This implementation is based on a liberal interpretation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which requires an update to ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) and says nothing about ICD-10 or beyond. On June 29, 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency unreasonably interpreted the Clean Air Act when it decided to set limits on the emissions of toxic pollutants from power plants, without first considering the costs on the industry. Thus, to do so is applicable to the medical industry with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) unreasonably interpreting HIPAA and imposing existent extensive regulations without considering the cost. In the United States, ICD-10-CM with a 10-fold increase in the number of codes has resulted in a system which has become so complicated that it no longer compares with any other country. Moreover, most WHO members use the ICD-10 system (not ICD-10-CM) only to record mortality in 138 countries or morbidity in 99 countries. Currently, only 10 countries employ ICD-10 (not ICD-10-CM) in the reimbursement process, 6 of which have a single payer health care system. Development of ICD-10-CM is managed by 4 non-physician groups, known as cooperating parties. They include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CMS, the American Hospital Association (AHA), and the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). The AHIMA has taken the lead with the AHA just behind, both with escalating profits and influence, essentially creating a statutory monopoly for their own benefit. Further, the ICD-10-CM coalition includes 3M which will boost its revenues and profits substantially with its implementation and Blue Cross Blue Shield which has its own agenda. Physician groups are not a party to these cooperating parties or coalitions, having only a peripheral involvement. ICD-10-CM creates numerous deficiencies with 500 codes that are more specific in ICD-9-CM than ICD-10-CM. The costs of an implementation are enormous, along with maintenance costs, productivity, and cash disruptions.

### Carbon monoxide (...) [^c661b8a5]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

CARBON MONOXIDE Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, and toxic gas, which is predominantly produced by incomplete combustion of carbon-containing materials. Incomplete combustion occurs when insufficient oxygen is used in the fuel burning process. Consequently, more carbon monoxide, in preference to carbon dioxide, is emitted. Some examples of this are the following: vehicle exhausts, fuel burning furnaces, coal burning power plants, small gasoline engines, portable gasoline-powered generators, power washers, fire places, charcoal grills, marine engines, forklifts, propane-powered heaters, gas water heaters, and kerosene heaters. Exposure to carbon monoxide impedes the blood’s ability to carry oxygen to body tissues and vital organs. When carbon monoxide is inhaled, it combines with hemoglobin, producing carboxyhemoglobin, which greatly diminishes hemoglobin’s oxygen-carrying capacity.

Hemoglobin’s binding affinity for carbon monoxide is 300 times greater than its affinity for oxygen. As a result, small amounts of carbon monoxide can dramatically reduce hemoglobin’s ability to transport oxygen. Common symptoms of carbon monoxide exposure are headache, nausea, rapid breathing, weakness, exhaustion, dizziness, and confusion. Hypoxia due to acute carbon monoxide poisoning may result in reversible neurological effects, or it may result in long-term irreversible neurological or cardiological effects. Carbon monoxide exposure can be dangerous during pregnancy for both the mother and the developing fetus. Please contact CDC-INFO if you have any questions regarding carbon monoxide exposure during pregnancy.

Although fetal outcomes in CO-exposed women have been described in several case series and 1 structured literature review, no study has compared pregnancy outcomes in women of similar poisoning severity treated with different therapeutic options.”

### Hospital burden of unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning in the United States, 2007 [^46e2eda8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Unintentional, non-fire-related (UNFR) carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is a leading cause of poisoning in the United States, but the overall hospital burden is unknown. This study presents patient characteristics and the most recent comprehensive national estimates of UNFR CO-related emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations.

Methods

Data from the 2007 Nationwide Inpatient and Emergency Department Sample of the Hospitalization Cost and Utilization Project were analyzed. The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists' CO poisoning case definition was used to classify confirmed, probable, and suspected cases.

Results

In 2007, more than 230,000 ED visits (772 visits/million) and more than 22,000 hospitalizations (75 stays/million) were related to UNFR CO poisoning. Of these, 21,304 ED visits (71 visits/million) and 2302 hospitalizations (8 stays/million) were confirmed cases of UNFR CO poisoning. Among the confirmed cases, the highest ED visit rates were among persons aged 0 to 17 years (76 visits/million) and 18 to 44 years (87 visits/million); the highest hospitalization rate was among persons aged 85 years or older (18 stays/million). Women visited EDs more frequently than men, but men were more likely to be hospitalized. Patients residing in a nonmetropolitan area and in the northeast and midwest regions of the country had higher ED visit and hospitalization rates. Carbon monoxide exposures occurred mostly (>60%) at home. The hospitalization cost for confirmed CO poisonings was more than $26 million.

Conclusion

Unintentional, non-fire-related CO poisonings pose significant economic and health burden; continuous monitoring and surveillance of CO poisoning are needed to guide prevention efforts. Public health programs should emphasize CO alarm use at home as the main prevention strategy.

### Use of ICD-10-CM coded hospitalisation and emergency department data for injury surveillance [^33894c69]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Epidemiologists and researchers who are transitioning from the use of ICD-9-CM coded data to ICD-10-CM coded data should note the substantial differences in the injury diagnosis and external cause-of-injury codes in the two coding systems. These differences, which have the potential to either introduce or alleviate bias in non-fatal injury measurement, have been described in detail elsewhere.Important differences that have implications for injury surveillance include:

Changes in the codes that identify events involving poisoning or toxic effects. In ICD-9-CM, two codes were required to describe each poisoning event—a diagnosis code (960–979 and 980–989) to describe the type of drug or toxic substance involved and an external cause code (E850–E858, E860–E869, E930–E949, E950–E952, E961–E962 and E980–E982) to describe the intent of the poisoning or adverse effect (eg, accidental (unintentional), intentional self-harm, homicide or undetermined). In ICD-10-CM, the information about both the drug or substance involved and the intent are captured in a single code (T36–T50 for drugs and biological substances, and T51–65 for toxic effects of non-drug substances). These T codes contain a character in the code to specify the intent of the poisoning (ie, accidental (unintentional), intentional self-harm, assault, undetermined, adverse effect and underdosing).
Expansion of codes to identify events involving asphyxiation. ICD-10-CM contains more than 40 diagnosis codes for asphyxiation or strangulation by different mechanisms (T71 codes), compared with a single diagnosis code in ICD-9-CM (994.7). The T71 codes include a character in the code to specify the intent (ie, accidental (unintentional), intentional self-harm, assault and undetermined) of the asphyxiation.
Separate codes in ICD-10-CM (T74 and T76) distinguish between suspected and confirmed child and adult abuse and neglect.
Introduction of the new concept of encounter type in ICD-10-CM. Most injury diagnosis codes and external cause codes in ICD-10-CM include a seventh character (a letter) that provides information on the type of medical care encounter when the diagnosis or external cause-of-injury was determined. The character specifies whether the injury diagnosis is related to: (1) the initial encounter, defined as while the patient is receiving active treatment for the condition, (2) a subsequent encounter, defined as routine care during the healing or recovery phase after the active treatment phase has ended or (3) sequelae, defined as complications or conditions that arise as a direct result of an injury.
Consideration of both diagnosis codes and external cause codes to identify all cases of intentional self-harm. In ICD-9-CM, all mechanisms of intentional self-harm were captured using external cause codes. In ICD-10-CM, while many mechanisms of intentional self-harm are captured using external cause codes (X71–X83), intentional self-harm involving poisoning or asphyxiation are captured by diagnosis codes (subsets of T36–T65 and T71).

HBO2 outcomes in other randomized studies—Thom et al and Scheinkestel et al: In a Class III study of 65 CO-poisoned patients randomized to a single HBO2 treatment session or mask oxygen without blinding, the primary outcome measure was found in 0% (95% CI 0% to 12%) of HBO2-treated patients and 23% (95% CI 10% to 42%) of those treated with ambient pressure oxygen, with all reported neurologic sequelae resolving by 77 days; conversely, a Class II randomized controlled trial reported no difference in outcomes and, in 191 patients treated with continuous oxygen for 3 days after CO poisoning (controls received sham HBO2), adverse neurologic outcomes occurred in 76% of treated patients and 68% of controls (reported OR 1.7; 95% CI 0.8 to 4.0; P = 0.19), within a cohort in which 73% were considered to have “severe CO poisoning,” and additional HBO2 treatments up to 6 daily sessions were performed if neurologic recovery was absent.

### Increased long-term mortality among survivors of acute carbon monoxide poisoning [^5401a9cb]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Recent data suggest that patients surviving acute carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning (COP) may have increased risk for long-term mortality. The objective of this study was to analyze long-term mortality of a large population of CO-poisoned patients treated at one medical center over three decades.

Design

Retrospective cohort study of patients treated with hyperbaric oxygen and surviving the acute poisoning episode. Long-term mortality was compared to a standard population. Comparison of mortality within the cohort by clinical indicators of poisoning severity was assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.

Setting

Regional referral center for hyperbaric treatment of COP.

Patients

One thousand seventy-three patients aged >or=18 years treated from 1978 to 2005.

Interventions

All patients received hyperbaric oxygen treatment.

Measurements and Main Results

During 11,741 person-years of follow-up, 162 subjects died. The expected number of deaths was 87 (standardized mortality ratio [SMR]), 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-2.2). Most of the excess mortality was in the group treated initially for intentional COP (58 excess deaths; SMR, 3.7; 95% CI, 2.9-4.6) vs. those treated for accidental COP (17 excess deaths; SMR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.01-1.6). For the entire cohort, the major causes of death with significantly raised mortality were mental and psychiatric disorders, injuries, and violence. More specific causes of death with significantly raised mortality were alcoholism, motor vehicle accidents with pedestrians, motor vehicle accidents of unspecified type, accidental poisonings, and intentional self-harm. Within cohort comparisons showed that no difference in survival was observed by measure of CO poisoning severity, after controlling for age at poisoning, sex, race, and intent of CO poisoning.

Conclusions

Adult survivors of acute CO poisoning treated with hyperbaric oxygen were at increased risk for long-term mortality. Such patients should be followed closely after discharge with consideration given to psychiatric and/or neurocognitive evaluation, as appropriate.

### Mortality and morbidity of poisonings in the nordic countries in 2002 [^6365b9d1]. Clinical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

Aim

To map and compare mortality and morbidity of poisonings in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden in 2002 and to establish a common understanding of methods and procedures among the National Poisons Information Centres (NPIC) in order to create a Nordic toxico-epidemiological platform.

Methods

Morbidity was for this study defined as acute poisonings treated in hospitals given the ICD-10 codes T36-T65 and F10-F19. The figures were extracted from the National Patient/Hospital Registers. Acute poisonings listed as main as well as side diagnoses were included. Deaths recorded as acute poisoning (using the same ICD-10 codes) were collected from the National Death Cause Registers.

Results

Annual mortality of acute poisonings per 100,000 inhabitants (rate) was 16.6 in Finland and between 8.6 and 11.1 in the other Nordic countries. Morbidity rates varied between 150 and 255 per 100,000 inhabitants.

Conclusion

The death rate due to acute poisoning was 50% higher in Finland compared to the rate in the other Nordic countries. The variable data between countries obtained for morbidity of acute poisonings need further elucidations to verify if the differences are real and not only due to heterogeneous procedures and practice for data collection and recording.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^a07a2400]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Holistic assessment and ICD-10 coding for Long COVID—Long COVID can present as a wide variety of symptoms, either in isolation or more often in clusters, and when one or more of these symptoms occur a holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated; a basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by patients’ specific symptoms. When a patient is assessed to likely be presenting with sequelae of Long COVID, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis code of “U09.9 Post COVID-19 Condition, unspecified” should be documented as a secondary code and the primary ICD-10 code(s) should reflect the patient’s specific presenting symptom(s) and condition(s); systematic inclusion of the U09.9 code facilitates population-level monitoring of Long COVID sequelae, and the U09.9 diagnosis code is not appropriate to use in cases of acute COVID-19 infection.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute carbon monoxide poisoning [^9e7bf392]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Acute carbon monoxide poisoning—Weaver et al observational analysis combined clinical trial participants and eligible nonenrolled patients (238 total patients included in analysis) to evaluate neuropsychiatric testing at 6 wks, 6 mo, and 12 mo, with the primary outcome of 6 wk cognitive sequelae. Interventions were 75 patients received HBO2; 163 did not receive HBO2, of whom 146/163 received 100% O2 for a mean time of 6.9 h and 17/163 received no therapy. At 6 wks, sequelae occurred in 37% (87/238) overall, 24% (18/75) with HBO2, 41% (60/146) with O2 therapy only, and 53% (9/17) with no therapy; risk factors for 6 wk cognitive sequelae were age ≥36 y and CO exposure duration ≥24 h, with risk factor reduction with HBO2 therapy in patients ≥36 y: OR 0.3 (0.2-0.6). The class rating is III (for 6 wk cognitive sequelae), and limitations note that “The mixing of clinical trial data with data from patients not enrolled in the clinical trial makes this a large case series only.”

### National unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning estimates using hospitalization and emergency department data [^ef0a380a]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Unintentional non-fire-related (UNFR) carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is a leading cause of poisoning in the US and a preventable cause of death. We generated national estimates of accidental CO poisoning and characterized the populations most at risk. UNFR CO poisoning cases were assessed using hospitalization and emergency department (ED) data from the Healthcare Costs and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample and Nationwide Emergency Department Sample databases. We used hospitalization data from 2003 to 2013 and ED data from 2007 to 2013. We calculated trends using a linear regression of UNFR CO poisonings over the study period and age-adjusted rates using direct standardization and U.S. Census Bureau estimates. During 2003-2013, approximately 14,365 persons (4.1 cases/million annually) with confirmed or probable UNFR CO poisoning were admitted to hospitals and the annual rate of poisonings showed a weak downward trend (p = 0.12). During 2007-2013, approximately 101,847 persons (48.3 visits/million annually) visited the ED and the annual rate of poisonings showed a significant downward trend (p ≤ 0.01). Most UNFR CO hospital cases involved patients who were older (aged 45-64 years), white, male, or living in the South or Midwest. Overall, the rate of hospitalizations did not change over the study period. Unintentional CO poisoning is preventable and these cases represent the most recent national estimates. ED visits declined over the study period, but the hospitalization rates did not change. This emphasizes the need for prevention efforts, such as education in the ED setting, increased use of CO alarms, and proper use and maintenance of fuel-powered household appliances.

Acute carbon monoxide poisoning—evidentiary table of trials comparing hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) with mask oxygen (O2) summarizes the following outcomes and limitations. In a randomized controlled trial (N=65) excluding loss of consciousness, neurologic sequelae occurred in 0% of HBO2-treated patients (95% CI 0%-12%) versus 23% of controls (95% CI 10%-42%), with NNT=4.3; losses were 4% to enrollment and 8% to follow-up, mean time to treatment was 2.0 h, and the primary outcome resolved in all patients by 77 days. A randomized controlled trial, not blinded, with N=575 reported benefit from HBO2 at 1 and 3 months (NNT=15.4) but no benefit at 1 y. A randomized controlled trial, not blinded (N=26), found no benefit from HBO2 on EEG and CBF tests, with slight benefit on CBF reactivity to acetazolamide (cannot calculate NNT). A not randomized comparison (practice pattern changed by dates) (N=100) of 1 or 3 treatments of HBO2 versus mask O2 found benefit for 3 HBO2 treatments versus 1 session and no benefit for HBO2 versus NBO; because of small numbers in the mask O2 group (N=6), this comparison was underpowered.

### Defining indicators for drug overdose emergency department visits and hospitalisations in ICD-10-CM coded discharge data [^76a4041c]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Which encounter types should be included or excluded? Tyndall Snow and colleagues found that the frequency of subsequent encounters and sequelae among drug overdose codes found in any field were low among hospitalisation records across states and localities and lower among ED records.More important than the number of subsequent encounters and sequelae identified are the conceptual definitions of these encounter types and what they mean for drug poisoning incidence. According to the CMS-issued coding guidelines, subsequent encounters are ‘encounters after the patient has completed active treatment of the condition and is receiving routine care for the condition during the healing or recovery phase’.Sequelae represent ‘complications or conditions that arise as a direct result of a condition, such as scar formation after a burn’.In both cases, these visits do not represent new and acute overdose cases and will not help to approximate overdose incidence. CDC’s guidance also excludes subsequent encounters and sequelae.

Which manners of injury/intent should be included or excluded? Underdosing codes make up a negligible proportion of drug T-codes, suggesting that the exclusion of these codes is unlikely to significantly affect rates.More importantly, underdosing, defined as ‘taking less of a medication than is prescribed by a provider or a manufacturer’s instruction’, does not conceptually fit into drug overdose definitions.Adverse effect codes make up a considerable proportion of drug T-codes identified in Tyndall Snow and colleagues.The inclusion of adverse effects, which can represent clinical symptoms ranging from constipation to respiratory failure, has the potential to introduce a large number of false positives if included in the overdose definition. The exclusion of adverse effects from overdose definitions is in keeping with historical epidemiological practice, as well as conceptual definitions laid out by CMS coding guidelines.According to CMS coding guidelines, adverse effects codes should be used to describe ‘an adverse effect of a drug that has been correctly prescribed and properly administered’, while poisoning codes are used to describe ‘a poisoning or reaction to the improper use of a medication (eg, overdose, wrong substance given or taken in error, wrong route of administration)’.The distinction between an adverse effect and an overdose does not rest on the clinical manifestation of symptoms but instead on how the drug was prescribed and administered. CDC’s guidance excludes underdosing and adverse effect codes from overdose surveillance.

### Carbon monoxide poisoning deaths in the United States, 1999 to 2012 [^f8cb3a1c]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Unintentional, non-fire related (UNFR) carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning deaths are preventable. Surveillance of the populations most at-risk for unintentional, non-fire related (UNFR) carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is crucial for targeting prevention efforts.

Objective

This study provides estimates on UNFR CO poisoning mortality in the United States and characterizes the at-risk populations.

Methods

We used 1999 to 2012 data to calculate death rates. We used underlying and multiple conditions variables from death records to identify UNFR CO poisoning cases.

Results

For this study, we identified 6136 CO poisoning fatalities during 1999 to 2012 resulting in an average of 438 deaths annually. The annual average age-adjusted death rate was 1.48 deaths per million. Fifty four percent of the deaths occurred in a home. Age-adjusted death rates were highest for males (2.21 deaths per million) and non-Hispanic blacks (1.74 deaths per million). The age-specific death rate was highest for those aged ≥85 years (6.00 deaths per million). The annual rate of UNFR CO poisoning deaths did not change substantially during the study period, but we observed a decrease in the rate of suicide and unintentional fire related cases.

Conclusion

CO poisoning was the second most common non-medicinal poisonings death. Developing and enhancing current public health interventions could reduce ongoing exposures to CO from common sources, such as those in the residential setting.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute carbon monoxide poisoning [^77c333bf]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Acute carbon monoxide poisoning—randomized controlled trial of HBO2 with sham control describes that all patients received ≥3 days of mask O2, the HBO2 group had 3 sessions with up to 3 additional if symptoms persisted at a maximum treatment pressure of 2.8 ATA each session, and controls received sham HBO2, with the trial double blinded, N=191, and patients of all severity included. The primary outcome, persistent neurologic sequelae defined as ≥2 of 7 neuropsychological test scores ≥1 SD below predicted, occurred in 74% of HBO2-treated patients and 68% of controls (OR 1.7; 95% CI 0.8-4.0; P=0.19, NS), with number needed to harm=16.7; delayed neurologic sequelae occurred in 4.8% of HBO vs 0% NBO group, with no significant difference between HBO2 and control groups in 6 of 7 neuropsychological test scores after 3 treatments and no difference at 1 mo but with inadequate follow-up. Limitations noted include lost to follow-up 54%, suicidal patients 69%, mean time to treatment 7.1 h, poor follow-up at 1 mo, diminished generalizability because of the high oxygen dose of the control arm, and cluster randomization; classification was II for persistent neurologic sequelae data and X for delayed neurologic sequelae data.

### Defining indicators for drug overdose emergency department visits and hospitalisations in ICD-10-CM coded discharge data [^6d35411e]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Challenges to identifying ED visits and hospital inpatient admissions using ICD-10-CM

Multiple challenges, however, impede the standard use of ICD-10-CM codes for drug overdose surveillance. A primary challenge is translating ED and inpatient drug overdose (referred to as ‘poisoning’ in the ICD-10-CM) definitions from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) to ICD-10-CM. On 1 October 2015, the US Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) mandated that all healthcare providers covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act transition from ICD-9-CM coding to ICD-10-CM coding.The ICD-10-CM coding system is substantially different from the ICD-9-CM coding system (See figure 1 for a breakdown of an ICD-10-CM drug poisoning code). For instance, the number of injury diagnosis codes increased from 2600 to 43 000 in the ICD-9-CM compared with the ICD-10-CM, while the number of external cause of injury codes increased from 1300 to 7500.Thus, translation of ICD-9-CM drug overdose definitions to ICD-10-CM requires extensive conceptual work informed by empirical validation.

### Morbidity and mortality of unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning: United States 2005 to 2018 [^b01bee55]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducts case surveillance through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). This study aimed to provide surveillance report of unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning across multiple data sources to provide baseline data for the new NNDSS carbon monoxide poisoning surveillance.

Methods

For the period 2005 to 2018, we used 4 data sources to describe unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning: exposures reported by poison centers, emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and deaths. We conducted descriptive analyses by the cause of exposure (fire, nonfire, or unknown), age, sex, season, and US census region. Additional analyses were conducted using poison center exposure case data focusing on the reported signs and symptoms, management site, and medical outcome.

Results

Annually, we observed 39.5 poison center exposure calls (per 1 million, nationally), 56.5 ED visits (per 1 million, across 17 states), 7.3 hospitalizations (per 1 million, in 26 states), and 3.3 deaths (per 1 million, nationally) due to unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning. For 2005 to 2018, there was a decrease in the crude rate for non-fire-related carbon monoxide poisonings from hospital, and death data. Non-fire-related cases comprised 74.0% of ED visits data, 60.1% of hospitalizations, and 40.9% of deaths compared with other unintentional causes. Across all data sources, unintentional carbon monoxide poisonings were most often reported during the winter season, notably in January and December. Children aged 0 to 9 years had the highest reported rates in poison center exposure case data and ED visits (54.1 and 70.5 per 1 million, respectively); adults older than 80 years had the highest rates of hospitalization and deaths (20.2 and 9.9 per 1 million, respectively); and deaths occurred more often among men and in the Midwest region. Poison center exposure call data revealed that 45.9% of persons were treated at a health care facility. Headaches, nausea, and dizziness/vertigo were the most reported symptoms.

Conclusion

The crude rates in non-fire-related carbon monoxide poisonings from hospitalizations, and mortality significantly decreased over the study period (ie, 2005 to 2018). This surveillance report provides trends and characteristics of unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning and the baseline morbidities and mortality data for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention national surveillance system of carbon monoxide poisoning.

### Nonfatal, unintentional, non – fire-related carbon monoxide exposures – United States, 2004-2006 [^82aecbac]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2008). Low credibility.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, nonirritating gas that is produced through the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Sources of CO include combustion devices (e.g., boilers and furnaces), motor-vehicle exhaust, generators and other gasoline or diesel-powered engines, gas space heaters, woodstoves, gas stoves, fireplaces, tobacco smoke, and various occupational sources. CO poisoning is a leading cause of unintentional poisoning deaths in the United States; it was responsible for approximately 450 deaths each year during 1999-2004 and an estimated 15,200 emergency department (ED) visits each year during 2001-2003. Health effects of CO exposure can range from viral-like symptoms (e.g., fatigue, dizziness, headache, confusion, and nausea) to more severe conditions (e.g., disorientation, unconsciousness, long-term neurologic disabilities, coma, cardiorespiratory failure, and death). CO poisoning often is misdiagnosed and underdetected because of the nonspecific nature of symptoms. To update a previously published report and provide national estimates of CO-related ED visits during 2004-2006, CDC analyzed data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System--All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) database. During 2004-2006, an estimated average of 20,636 ED visits for nonfatal, unintentional, non-fire-related CO exposures occurred each year. Approximately 73% of these exposures occurred in homes, and 41% occurred during winter months (December-February). Prevention efforts targeting residential and seasonal CO exposures can substantially reduce CO-related morbidity.

### Carbon monoxide: raising awareness of the silent killer in the emergency department [^67b0fae6]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Limited studies are available on how often CO poisoning is accurately diagnosed in the ED and how often a diagnosis is missed. One study found a survey suggesting the possible probability of missing a diagnosis of CO poisoning to currently be up to 98%.Alternatively, anecdotal evidence exists in the form of cases reported in the press where patients who have been unknowingly exposed to CO from domestic sources have been sent home after seeking medical attention for their symptoms and have died from the continued exposure.

CO exposure and subsequent poisoning are thus an important clinical differential that all clinicians should be aware of, particularly among frontline specialists in the National Health Service (NHS). It has long been suspected that medical professionals lack awareness about CO; toxicology is not routinely taught at undergraduate medical schools and is considered to be a ‘fine print’ subject at postgraduate level. This is compounded by a lack of an easily recognised toxidrome meaning diagnosis is easily overlooked. The APPCOG published three reports between 2009 and 2017 which have included recommendations for efforts to be made to increase awareness of the features of CO poisoning to healthcare professionals (HCPs).

A number of initiatives have been set up including: a large epidemiological study currently running in the south of England to more accurately identify the extent of the problem; public education initiatives by Merseyside and West Midlands Fire and Rescue Services and studies of how CO might spread through domestic dwellings by Liverpool John Moores University. Despite national campaigns such as CO awareness week, a current search of the literature identifies no Quality Improvement Projects (QIPs) or initiatives within local frontline clinical settings.

Consequently, this QIP was conceived. University Hospital Aintree (UHA) in Liverpool, UK, is home to a large, busy ED providing treatment for over 80 000 adult patients yearly and is a major trauma centre serving a population covering Merseyside, North Wales and regions of North West of England. The project targeted all HCPs in the department who clinically assess patients presenting to the frontline. The aim of this project was to increase the consideration of CO exposure in patients presenting with non-traumatic headaches in the ED to 50% of presentations by May 2021. Importantly, this project aimed to ascertain how often ED HCPs consider CO exposure as a differential when assessing patients with non-traumatic headache, not to identify how many patients with headache have been exposed to CO.

### Self-harm injury hospitalisations: an analysis of case selection criteria [^39d339a2]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

In 2019, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published recommendations for an injury hospitalisation case definition based on ICD-10-CM codes.These recommendations focused on the creation of an injury subset that included records indicating an initial encounter for active treatment of an injury as the principal diagnosis (ie, the condition chiefly responsible for admission).Once the injury subset has been created, all diagnoses and external cause of morbidity codes noting an initial encounter are reviewed and the case is categorised by intent and mechanism of injury. Identification of cases involving intentional self-harm requires review of both diagnosis and external cause codes as some causes are reflected in unique diagnoses codes (poisoning, asphyxiation and suicide attempt) while others are reflected in unique external cause codes (all other means of intentional self-harm, such as cutting or firearms).

Though the CDC-recommended injury hospitalisation case definition restricts case selection to a subset based on principal diagnosis of injury, an earlier CDC publication indicated that, for self-harm, other considerations may be appropriate.One consideration involves expansion of the definition to include visits with any mention of self-harm (regardless of principal diagnosis). Studies have found strong associations between self-harm injuries and mental health disorders.These disorders may be prioritised in the principal diagnosis field and excluded from an injury subset that requires an injury principal diagnosis. Another consideration involves an exploration of encounter types. ICD-10-CM employs different codes to identify initial encounters (active treatment for a condition), subsequent encounters (routine care during recovery phase) and encounters for sequelae of injury (indicating complications or conditions that arise from a previous injury). ICD-10-CM coding allows for restriction of case selection to initial encounters only; however, this may not be useful or relevant for self-harm, as these injuries can differ from those of other intents. Self-harm injuries are more likely to be repeated, have more return visits to the ED or hospital, and are more likely to result in suicide compared with other injuries.This repeated nature may require consideration of all encounter types, especially if self-harm is viewed as an ongoing health condition requiring active attention.

The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of different case selection criteria of varying inclusivity to develop a standardised surveillance case definition for hospitalisations with ICD-10-CM codes noting self-harm.

### Carbon monoxide poisoning is associated with an increased risk of epilepsy and status epilepticus: a nationwide population-based cohort study conducted in the republic of Korea between 2002-2021 [^72e185d8]. Clinical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Carbon monoxide poisoning may result in various neurological injuries, including acute symptomatic seizures. We aimed to investigate the long-term risk of epilepsy and status epilepticus in patients with previous carbon monoxide poisoning.

Methods

The study population was derived from the National Health Insurance Service database of the Republic of Korea between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2021. We included adults with at least one documented visit to medical facilities because of carbon monoxide poisoning (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, code T58). Patients were matched, on the same index date, with controls, without a T58 code, for age, sex, insurance type, income level, and residence location in a 1:1 ratio. Follow-up continued until death, migration, or the end of the observation period (31 December 2021). The primary outcome was the incidence of epilepsy (codes G40 or R56) and status epilepticus (code G41).

Results

This study included 53,380 patients with carbon monoxide poisoning and 53,380 controls, with 44.2% women and a mean age of 45.7years. The mean (±SD) follow-up period was 5.7±4.3years in the carbon monoxide poisoned group and 6.4±4.4years in controls. The overall risk of epilepsy (adjusted hazard ratio 2.60; 95% CI: 2.43-2.78; P <0.001) and status epilepticus (adjusted hazard ratio 4.10; 95% CI: 2.84-5.92; P <0.001) was significantly increased in the carbon monoxide poisoned group compared to controls. The risk of epilepsy and status epilepticus was increased in patients with previous carbon monoxide poisoning, regardless of sex, age or a history of stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, or central nervous system tumour or infection. However, in the subgroup analysis according to age, the highest risk of epilepsy and status epilepticus was observed in patients less than 40years of age.

Discussion

In this population-based cohort study, previous carbon monoxide poisoning was associated with an increased risk of epilepsy and status epilepticus. The risk was more noticeable in patients aged less than 40years. Further studies are needed to confirm such an association in other populations.

Conclusions

Previous carbon monoxide poisoning was associated with an increased risk of epilepsy and status epilepticus, particularly in the younger population. The long-term management of survivors of carbon monoxide poisoning should include monitoring for epilepsy and status epilepticus.

Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) versus normobaric oxygen—Class II randomized trial (Weaver et al): In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial involving 152 patients, all enrolled patients received either 3 sessions of HBO2 therapy or normobaric oxygen with sham HBO2; at 6 weeks after poisoning, HBO2 was associated with a 21.1% (95% CI 6% to 34%) absolute reduction in neurologic sequelae (46.1% versus 25.0%) with an unadjusted OR 0.39 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.78), and at 12 months the absolute reduction was 14.5% (95% CI 1% to 28%) with unadjusted OR 0.46 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.98); no differences were found in several secondary outcomes at 6 weeks, and a Class III analysis that included 91 eligible but non-enrolled patients found that age 36 or older and CO exposure duration of 24 hours or greater were risk factors for 6‑week cognitive sequelae, whereas symptoms and initial CoHb level were not independent risk factors.

2.1.2 Individual and area-level indicators of risk

Individual characteristics including sex, age, place of residence (postcode) and date of diagnosis were obtained from the HES hospital records. Individual hospital records were spatially assigned to Middle Layer Super Output Areas (MSOA, 1500 population average), based on the residential postcode at diagnosis. MSOAs are administrative area units for England defined by ONS. We considered them to represent the optimum compromise between spatial resolution and statistical power for the presented analyses. Forty-three hospital records had missing information on residential postcode and thus, were excluded from the spatial analysis.

Area-level indicators included: deprivation, rural-urban classification and ethnic composition. For deprivation, we chose the Carstairs Index as it provides a small-area composite measure based on four deprivation indicators: unemployment, household overcrowding, no car ownership and social class. Carstairs scores were computed using 2011 census data, standardized at MSOA level and categorised into quintiles for the analysis. For rurality, MSOAs were classified as urban if their constituent Census Output Areas (COA), the smallest statistical area units available for England (29) were predominantly classed as urban (>10,000 people) based on the ONS Rural/Urban Classification 2011. Ethnic composition was defined as the proportions of Asians and Blacks below or equal to: i) the national average; ii) 2-fold the national average; and iii) 6-fold the national average (Appendix Methods A2). Data on overall non-white population (i.e. Asian, Black, mixed ethnic groups and other ethnic groups) were also used for a sub-analysis with a similar approach for the cut-offs, here derived from the national non-white population proportion.

Mid-year population estimates stratified by sex, age group, year and geography were obtained from the ONS.

### Toxic CO-ingestions in intentional carbon monoxide poisoning [^8eeeee4f]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Intentional carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is responsible for two-thirds of the deaths from CO poisoning in this country and an estimated 15,000 Emergency Department visits annually.

Objectives

In an attempt to optimize medical management of such patients, this study was conducted to examine the frequency and types of toxic co-ingestions that may accompany CO inhalation.

Methods

Records of all patients treated with hyperbaric oxygen for acute, intentional CO poisoning at a regional referral center for hyperbaric medicine in Seattle from 1980 to 2005 were reviewed. For those where co-ingestions were identified, information about type of poison(s) and results of toxicology screens was recorded and analyzed.

Results

Over the 25-year period examined, 433 patients were treated for intentional CO poisoning and records were available for 426. Of those, 188 (42%) had ingested one or more poisons in addition to CO. Ethanol was most common, but a wide variety of other drug classes were also identified. Toxicology screening studies of some type were performed in 49 patients.

Conclusions

Toxic co-ingestions seem to be relatively common in patients treated for intentional CO poisoning. For this reason, providers should be vigilant and open to clinical signs that can't be explained with CO exposure alone, and ready to treat clinical issues that arise from co-ingestions.

### Carbon monoxide: raising awareness of the silent killer in the emergency department [^326d448e]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Background

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a silent killer. Produced by the incomplete combustion of carbon containing fuels, CO is a colourless, odourless and tasteless poisonous gas. Inhalation of CO causes hypoxic injury by displacing oxygen from haemoglobin and myoglobin, compounded by formation of reactive oxygen species. Thus, acute exposure can cause a range of symptoms such as headache, flu-like symptoms or gastrointestinal disturbances. At higher concentrations, it can cause long-term neurocognitive deficits,seizures, coma and death. Headache is the most common symptom of CO poisoning,occurring in up to 90% of patients.

Aside from a patient’s clinical history, CO poisoning is currently most accurately diagnosed via a blood test using the biomarker carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb). However, a low COHb percentage cannot rule out CO exposure as a patient’s COHb level rapidly normalises following removal from the CO source (particularly if supplemental oxygen has been administered before the blood test is taken). In addition, tobacco smoking raises COHb levels and patients may be reluctant to admit to smoking. Nevertheless, a study examining presentations at four large Emergency Departments (EDs) found raised COHb levels in 4.3% of patients presenting with non-specific symptoms.

The exact prevalence of CO poisoning in the UK is currently unknown. Various studies have attempted to reach an answer, with the Department of Health in 2011 reporting that over 50 people die annually due to CO poisoning in England and Wales with an estimated 200 people requiring hospital admission, but this is widely accepted to be an underestimation. Overall, they estimate that 4000 people per year are diagnosed with CO poisoning in EDs in England and Wales; however, this figure does not include those in whom the diagnosis is missed. Studies taking a different approach, focused on identifying sources of CO poisoning by detecting defective gas appliances, found higher than expected levels of appliances deemed to be unsafe.The All Party Parliamentary Carbon Monoxide Group (APPCOG) has estimated that the consequences of CO poisoning incidents cost the UK taxpayer approximately £178 million every year.

### Carbon monoxide--related deaths – United States, 1999-2004 [^b0a3bd96]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2007). Low credibility.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, tasteless toxic gas produced by incomplete combustion in fuel-burning devices such as motor vehicles, gas-powered furnaces, and portable generators. Persons with CO poisoning often overlook the symptoms (e.g., headache, nausea, dizziness, or confusion), and undetected exposure can be fatal. Unintentional CO exposure accounts for an estimated 15,000 emergency department visits and 500 unintentional deaths in the United States each year. The most recent state-level estimates of CO-related deaths were described in 1991 for the years 1979-1988. Using the most recent mortality data available, this report updates national and state-specific unintentional, non-fire-related CO mortality rates and describes the demographic, seasonal, and geographic patterns for 1999-2004. During this period, an average of 439 persons died annually from unintentional, non-fire-related CO poisoning, and the national average annual death rate was 1.5 per million persons. However, rates varied by demographic subgroup, month of the year, and state. Rates were highest among adults aged > or =65 years, men, non-Hispanic whites, and non-Hispanic blacks. The average number of deaths was highest during January. Among the states, Nebraska had the highest reliable CO mortality rate. These findings indicate that improved population-based prevention measures, including educating the public about the dangers of CO exposure, are needed at the state and national levels.

Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) safety profile in CO poisoning indicates that many also point out that HBO2 therapy is generally safe; the most common complications were anxiety and middle ear barotraumas, reported in 0% to 80% of HBO2 treatment subjects; although older studies report the incidence of seizures to be as high as 5%, only 1 of the 1,037 CO poisoning patients who received HBO2 seized or developed other major complications (0.10%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01% to 0.48%).

### Defining indicators for drug overdose emergency department visits and hospitalisations in ICD-10-CM coded discharge data [^653242a6]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1 
The anatomy of an ICD-10-CM drug poisoning diagnosis code. ICD-10-CM, International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification.

Several key changes in the diagnosis codes from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM guidance had to be considered when defining and tracking drug overdose indicators. These include the following:

External cause of injury codes for drug poisoning were combined with diagnostic codes in ICD-10-CM: under ICD-9-CM, poisoning surveillance indicators relied on both poisoning diagnosis codes, which described the substances involved, and poisoning external cause codes, which conveyed the intent (eg, suicide or unintentional). Under ICD-10-CM, the poisoning diagnosis codes or T-codes (T36-T50) include information on both the substances involved and intent of the injury (ie, ‘1’: accidental, ‘2’: intentional self-harm, ‘3’: assault, ‘4’: undetermined, ‘5’: adverse effect and ‘6’: underdosing).
Coding of undetermined and accidental poisonings changed in ICD-10-CM: under ICD-9-CM, medical coders were instructed to select undetermined intent for external causes of injury when the intent was unspecified in the medical record; however, the guidance under ICD-10-CM instructs coders to default to accidental intent and only select undetermined intent if the medical record explicitly indicates that the intent is undetermined.
ICD-10-CM introduced the concept of underdosing: ICD-10-CM introduced the concept of ‘underdosing’,the use of less than the prescribed drug according to a provider or drug manufacturer.
ICD-10-CM introduced the concept of encounter type: ICD-10-CM introduced the new concept of encounter type for many injury diagnosis codes. For drug poisoning T-codes, a seventh character of ‘A’ indicates an initial encounter, ‘D’ indicates a subsequent encounter and ‘S’ indicates sequela. An initial encounter captures when a patient is receiving active treatment for the injury event, though it may not be the first encounter related to that injury event (eg, receiving treatment from two physicians for the same injury). A subsequent encounter captures when a patient is seen after active treatment for a follow-up related to the initial injury (eg, follow-up visit related to an overdose). A sequela captures when a patient is being treated for a secondary condition that arose because of the injury (eg, peripheral neuropathy).

### Analysis of the development and progression of carbon monoxide poisoning-related acute kidney injury according to the kidney disease improving global outcomes (KDIGO) criteria [^399473d7]. Clinical Toxicology (2018). Low credibility.

Context

Acute kidney injury (AKI) can occur after carbon monoxide (CO) intoxication; however, limited data are available. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the development and progression of AKI in patients with acute CO poisoning.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a prospective registry of CO poisoning between January 2010 and December 2015. AKI was defined and classified according to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the association between AKI and adverse outcomes, defined as neurological deficits at discharge or 28-day mortality.

Results

A total of 661 patients were evaluated. According to KDIGO criteria, 114 patients (17.2%) had AKI (initial: stage 1, 70.2%; stage 2, 26.3%; stage 3, 3.5%) on admission and 119 (18.0%) finally developed AKI during their hospital stay (maximum: stage 1, 68.9%; stage 2, 23.5%; stage 3, 7.6%). Almost all patients (99.2%) were diagnosed as having their highest KDIGO stage within three days (median, one day). AKI development was associated with adverse outcomes (odds ratio (OR) 17.53, 95% confidence interval 45.00-77.14). Both initial and maximum AKI stages demonstrated a stepwise increase of adjusted OR for adverse outcomes. AKI stage progression occurred in 8.4% of patients with AKI and was an independent factor for adverse outcomes.

Conclusion

CO poisoning- related AKI occurred in 18% and was mostly detected within one day after CO intoxication. The development and progression of AKI had a strong association with adverse outcomes and deserve further prospective investigation.

### Temporal trends and demographic risk factors for hospital admissions due to carbon monoxide poisoning in england [^ebf229f6]. Preventive Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

Our study combined 15-years of nationally representative health data on UNFR CO poisoning hospitalizations with a range of individual and area-level characteristics, to provide detailed spatio-temporal epidemiological evidence for England, and to identify sub-groups at higher risk to guide future public health interventions.

4.1 Temporal trends

As in previously published studies (;;;;), our data indicated a clear seasonality of CO poisoning, with admissions being more common during colder months. Lower temperatures and especially extreme conditions are strongly associated with higher consumption of gas and electricity, increased heating appliances usage and more time spent indoors (;). This is also reflected in temporal trends observed over our study period. The highest rates of UNFR CO poisoning hospitalizations in England in 2010 coincided with the coldest winter recorded since 1979 with a mean winter temperature 2 °C lower than the average temperature recorded during 1971–2000. This correlated with a peak in energy consumption for home heating, which is associated with an increased likelihood of CO poisoning (;).

Our joinpoint analysis indicated an inflection point around 2010 in the ASR of UNFR CO poisoning hospitalizations both for females and males. Although this shift in the trends could have been driven by the 2010's cold winter, it seems more likely to reflect the impact of a new regulation, implemented in 2010, making the installation of a CO detector mandatory in all new buildings with solid fuel appliances. This legislation, together with a gradual increase in the awareness, prevention campaigns and/or media coverage of CO poisoning fatal cases may have contributed to the observed decreasing trends. This regulation was extended to private sector rental properties in 2015, but our study period did not allow to assess whether this legislation had further impact.

Our international comparison showed substantial variation between countries, with the lowest rates across the reporting periods observed in Canada and the highest in France and the US. This international variability has previously been reported for both CO-related hospital admissions and deaths across different countries in Europe. Multiple factors including climate, data recording differences, socio-demographic characteristics, housing stock characteristics, energy efficiency, and legislation, to mention a few, may have contributed. Standardized regulations, such as those implemented across the European Union, could help facilitating such comparisons.

### Unintentional non-fire-related carbon monoxide exposures – United States, 2001-2003 [^7d4bc185]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2005). Low credibility.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless, poisonous gas that results from incomplete combustion of fuels (e.g., natural or liquefied petroleum gas, oil, wood, coal, or other fuels). CO sources (e.g., furnaces, generators, gas heaters, and motor vehicles) are common in homes or work environments and can put persons at risk for CO exposure and poisoning. Most signs and symptoms of CO exposure are nonspecific (e.g., headache or nausea) and can be mistakenly attributed to other causes, such as viral illnesses. Undetected or unsuspected CO exposure can result in death. To examine fatal and nonfatal unintentional, non-fire-related CO exposures, CDC analyzed 2001-2003 data on emergency department (ED) visits from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) and 2001-2002 death certificate data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). During 2001-2003, an estimated 15,200 persons with confirmed or possible non-fire-related CO exposure were treated annually in hospital EDs. In addition, during 2001-2002, an average of 480 persons died annually from non-fire-related CO poisoning. Although males and females were equally likely to visit an ED for CO exposure, males were 2.3 times more likely to die from CO poisoning. Most (64%) of the nonfatal CO exposures occurred in homes. Efforts are needed to educate the public about preventing CO exposure.

### Death certificate-based ICD-10 diagnosis codes for COVID-19 mortality surveillance-United States, January-December 2020 [^f4fc7651]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Among death certificates from calendar year 2020 listing COVID-19 and at least one other co-occurring diagnosis, the documentation is consistent with these deaths being attributable to COVID-19. Specifically, in 97% of 357,133 death certificates with COVID-19 and at least one other diagnosis, the documented chain-of-event and significant contributing conditions were consistent with those reported in clinical and epidemiologic studies to occur among patients with severe COVID-19–associated outcomes. Only 5.5% of death certificates had COVID-19 without any other conditions listed. Attributability of death to COVID-19 could not be evaluated for these death certificates and represents an opportunity for improvement in documentation.

A small proportion (2.5%) of death certificates documented conditions that have not currently been described to be associated with COVID-19 critical illness or death. This was noted more often among those who died at home, declared dead on arrival, and whose manner of death was not natural. In particular, a higher percentage of decedents aged <18 years (35.2%) and 18–29 years (10.2%) did not have a chain-of-event or significant contributing condition listed on the death certificate, even though their death certificates did have at least one other diagnosis code along with COVID-19 in Part I or II. Although these age categories constituted a very small proportion of the entire decedent group, the information on the death certificate provides a starting point for identification of other conditions that might contribute to mortality in younger persons. Detailed evaluation of death certificates might provide insights into rare and lesser known conditions that are not yet understood to be associated with or contribute to death from COVID-19.

At a glance
- Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that can cause sudden illness and death if inhaled.
- Find quick facts about CO poisoning and what can be done to prevent it. What it is Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that kills without warning. It claims the lives of hundreds of people every year and makes thousands more ill. Many household items including gas- and oil-burning furnaces, portable generators, and charcoal grills produce this poison gas. Symptoms The most common symptoms of CO poisoning are headache, dizziness, weakness, upset stomach, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion. CO symptoms are often described as “flu-like. ” If you breathe in a lot of CO, it can make you pass out or kill you. People who are sleeping, drunk, or under the influence of other substances can die from CO poisoning before they have symptoms. Risk factors Everyone is at risk for CO poisoning.

Infants, the elderly, and people with chronic heart disease, anemia, or breathing problems are more likely to get sick from CO. Each year, more than 400 Americans die from unintentional CO poisoning not linked to fires, more than 100, 000 visit an emergency department, and more than 14, 000 are hospitalized. Reducing risk CO is found in fumes produced any time you burn fuel in cars or trucks, small engines, stoves, lanterns, grills, fireplaces, gas ranges, or furnaces. CO can build up indoors and poison people and animals who breathe it. However, you can reduce your risk of CO poisoning with a few small steps. CO detectors Install battery-operated or battery back-up CO detectors near every sleeping area in your home. Check CO detector batteries when you change the time on your clocks each spring and fall to be sure they are functioning properly. Consider buying a detector with a digital readout.

This type of detector can tell you the highest level of CO concentration in your home, in addition to sounding an alarm. Replace your CO detector following the manufacturer's instructions or every 5 years. Set a reminder on your smartphone or other device calendar when you purchase and install the detector. Oil and gas furnaces and other household appliances Have your heating system, water heater, and any other gas, oil, or coal burning appliances serviced by a qualified technician every year. Make sure your gas appliances are vented properly. Horizontal vent pipes for appliances, such as a water heater, should go up slightly as they go toward outdoors, as shown below. This prevents CO from leaking if the joints or pipes aren't fitted tightly. When you buy gas equipment, buy only equipment carrying the seal of a national testing agency, such as Underwriters' Laboratories. If you smell an odor from your gas refrigerator, have an expert service it.

An odor from your gas refrigerator can mean it could be leaking CO. Never heat your house with a gas oven. Don't cook or burn anything on a stove or fireplace that isn't vented. Chimneys, charcoal, and portable appliances Have your chimney checked or cleaned every year. Chimneys can be blocked by debris, which can cause CO to build up inside your home or cabin. Never burn charcoal indoors. Burning charcoal
- red, gray, black, or white
- gives off CO. Never use a portable gas camp stove indoors. Do not use portable flameless chemical heaters indoors. Portable generators Never use a generator inside your home or garage, even if doors and windows are open. Only use generators outside, more than 20 feet away from any windows, doors, and vents. When using a generator, use a battery-powered or battery backup CO detector in your home. Automobile Have a mechanic check the exhaust system of your car or truck every year.

### Defining indicators for drug overdose emergency department visits and hospitalisations in ICD-10-CM coded discharge data [^fbb3eb1d]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The drug overdose epidemic has worsened over the past decade; however, efforts have been made to better understand and track nonfatal overdoses using various data sources including emergency department and hospital admission data from billing and discharge files.

Methods and findings

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed surveillance case definition guidance using standardised discharge diagnosis codes for public health practitioners and epidemiologists using lessons learnt from CDC’s funded recipients and the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) Drug Poisoning Indicators Workgroup and General Injury ICD-10-CM Workgroup. CDC’s guidance was informed by health departments and CSTE’s workgroups and included several key aspects for assessing drug overdose in emergency department and hospitalisation discharge data. These include: (1) searching all diagnosis fields to identify drug overdose cases; (2) estimating drug overdose incidence using visits for initial encounter but excluding subsequent encounters and sequelae; (3) excluding underdosing and adverse effects from drug overdose incidence indicators; and (4) using codes T36–T50 for overdose surveillance. CDC’s guidance also suggests analysing intent separately for ICD-10-CM coding.

Conclusions

CDC’s guidance provides health departments a key tool to better monitor drug overdoses in their community. The implementation and validation of this standardised guidance across all CDC-funded health departments will be key to ensuring consistent and accurate reporting across all entities.

### Occupational carbon monoxide poisoning among West Virginia workers' compensation claims: diagnosis, treatment duration, and utilization [^b8e678f4]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Incidence rates and characterizations of occupational carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning in terms of sources of exposures, diagnosis, treatment, and health care utilization are critical for public health planning. We identified 182 CO poisoning cases occurring over a 6-year period (IR = 4.3/100000 worker-years) in the West Virginia workers' compensation data. Frequent sources of poisoning were gas-powered engines (28%) and furnaces (20%). Minimum treatment duration ranged from 1 day to 8 years with significant differences in mental health comorbidities between cases treated within 1 year compared with cases treated for more than 1 year (OR = 20.75; 95% CI = 3.5-128.4). The average cost (medical and wage loss replacement) for CO claims was dollars 2130 and median lost time was 45 days. CO poisoning could lead to prolonged disability and treatment in patients with mental health comorbidities, suggesting a possible role for early intervention.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with acute carbon monoxide poisoning [^726cad82]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for inhalation injury, more specifically with respect to management of CO2 poisoning, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, ACEP 2017 guidelines recommend to administer hyperbaric oxygen therapy or high-flow normobaric therapy in patients with acute CO poisoning.

### Does alcohol play the role of confounder or neuroprotective agent in acute carbon monoxide poisoning? [^c3bbc36f]. Clinical Toxicology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives: This study investigated whether alcohol influences the predictive value of initial blood lactate concentration and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score at presentation for the severity of acute carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning and neurologic outcome in patients with acute CO poisoning. Additionally, whether alcohol has a neuroprotective effect after acute CO poisoning was evaluated. Methods: This retrospective study included 158 patients who presented with acute CO poisoning between January 2017 and July 2018 and had an available blood alcohol content (BAC) at presentation. The baseline characteristics, clinical course during hospitalization and neurologic status at 30 days after acute CO poisoning were collected and compared according to BAC. To account for possible confounding or neuroprotective effects of alcohol, BAC was introduced as a continuous variable and a stratified categorical variable in the analysis. Results: The mean and maximum BAC at presentation were 56.8mg/dl and 408mg/dl, respectively, in 158 patients presented at a mean of 1.0hour after acute CO poisoning. Lactate, adjusted for previously suggested predictors, was not associated with acute CO poisoning severity; however, after additional adjustment with BAC variables, lactate was associated with CO poisoning severity. Initial GCS score was associated with CO poisoning severity during hospitalization and neurologic outcome at 30 days after acute CO poisoning, regardless of BAC adjustment. BAC variables were negatively associated with CO poisoning severity but not neurologic outcome at 30 days. Discussion and conclusion: The severity of CO poisoning should never be predicted based on serum lactate alone without adjusting for BAC. However, the initial GCS score can be used as a predictor of CO poisoning severity and the neurologic outcome at 30 days after acute CO poisoning, regardless of alcohol consumption history. Alcohol does not have a neuroprotective effect on acute CO poisoning. Further study is needed to validate these results.

### Descriptive exploration of overdose codes in hospital and emergency department discharge data to inform development of drug overdose morbidity surveillance indicator definitions in ICD-10-CM [^14c41608]. Injury Prevention (2021). Medium credibility.

Another difference of ICD-10-CM is that it includes manner of injury/intent within the drug overdose diagnosis code itself, while ICD-9-CM captured this information with a separate external cause of injury code.In addition to standard intent categories for injury (unintentional, intentional self-harm, assault and undetermined), the drug overdose codes can indicate an adverse effect or underdosing.Adverse effects are pharmacological effects from medication correctly prescribed and properly administered, while underdosing is the effect of using less of a drug than was prescribed.Another change introduced is that guidance instructs coders to choose unintentional intent if no other intent is explicitly noted in the medical record, whereas ICD-9-CM instructs coders to default to undetermined intent.These changes in guidance could result in systematic changes of drug overdose intent categorisation that will affect counts when stratifying drug overdoses by intent. In two studies, by Heslin et al and Moore and Barrett, intentional self-harm and assault cases were excluded in the drug overdose definitions. However, in other studies, Slavova et al and CDC researchers included these cases.

ICD-10-CM codes T36–T50 (poisoning by, adverse effect of, and underdosing of drugs, medicaments and biological substances) have been used frequently to study and surveil acute drug overdose.However, several codes from outside of the injury chapter (‘Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes’) could be relevant for drug overdose surveillance when coded as co-occurring conditions on the medical record. One example is O9A.2, ‘Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium’. In the event that someone experiences a drug overdose during pregnancy, ICD-10-CM mandates placement of O9A.2 as the primary diagnosis.Another example is codes for substance use with intoxication from the mental health chapter of ICD-10-CM, such as F11.22, ‘Opioid dependence with intoxication’, which has been used in syndrome definitions for rapidly identifying suspected drug overdose cases.
