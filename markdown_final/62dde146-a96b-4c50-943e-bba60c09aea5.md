## Question

Are degenerative changes in the bones considered arthritis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether "degenerative changes in the bones" are considered a kind of arthritis, and if so, under what circumstances. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how arthritis is defined clinically and whether osteoarthritis (OA) encompasses bony degeneration. Then, I should verify which specific bone changes are characteristic of OA on imaging and pathology. Next, I will consider scenarios where bone degeneration occurs outside a joint process, such as osteoporosis, and confirm that those are not classified as arthritis. Finally, I will reconcile common clinical and radiology terminology like "degenerative changes" with precise diagnostic categories to give a clear answer.

> Let me first confirm the core definitions. Arthritis refers to diseases of joints, and osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, characterized as a degenerative disease of the whole synovial joint that includes cartilage loss, synovial changes, and characteristic bony remodeling within and adjacent to the joint, rather than a disorder of bone alone [^111VBY2s] [^113vTfsJ] [^111QpSrF].

> I need to check exactly which "degenerative bone" features are part of OA. Hallmark OA changes include subchondral bone sclerosis, marginal osteophyte formation, bone marrow lesions, and altered subchondral bone turnover, all of which are well-described radiographic and histopathologic features of osteoarthritic joints and support that these bony changes are integral to an arthritic process when they occur in the context of a joint disease [^111VBY2s] [^112WwM88] [^113fg6yX] [^1159Ksvf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. "Degenerative changes in the bones" can also describe processes that are not arthritis, such as osteoporosis or osteonecrosis, which involve bone tissue but not necessarily the synovial joint as a unit; I should confirm that arthritis classification requires involvement of the joint structures rather than isolated bone disease, and OA is explicitly defined as a disease of the synovial joint with coordinated cartilage, bone, and synovial pathology, distinguishing it from bone-only disorders like osteoporosis that are not termed arthritis [^1169suuX] [^113vTfsJ].

> Wait, let me verify the common radiology phrasing. In clinical radiology reports, phrases like "degenerative changes" of a knee or hip typically refer to OA and its joint-wide structural features, including osteophytes and subchondral sclerosis, so in that joint-centered context those "degenerative bone changes" are indeed features of arthritis; however, if a report describes bone degeneration without joint involvement, that would not be classified as arthritis, and I should be careful to interpret the terminology in its anatomic context [^113fg6yX] [^111VaNqq] [^1159Ksvf].

> I will now examine whether bone remodeling can precede or accompany cartilage damage, because that affects how we interpret "bone degeneration" temporally in OA. Contemporary data support tight coupling between subchondral bone remodeling and cartilage degeneration in OA, with evidence that abnormal subchondral bone turnover and sclerosis can develop as part of the disease process and may even precede overt cartilage loss in some models, reinforcing that these bony changes are components of the arthritic cascade rather than a separate bone-only disorder when they occur in a joint [^112WwM88] [^1115TPuq] [^113HG6KT].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought all bone "degeneration" around a joint must equal OA, but I should double-check differential considerations. Other arthritides and post-traumatic processes can produce periarticular bone changes, yet the classic OA pattern combines cartilage loss with osteophytes and subchondral sclerosis; recognizing this pattern helps avoid over-calling non-arthritic bone conditions as arthritis and ensures I attribute "degenerative bone changes" to OA only when the joint-level features are present [^111VBY2s] [^113rdq2o] [^113vTfsJ].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the answer is precise. Yes, when "degenerative changes in the bones" are occurring as part of a joint disease with osteophytes and subchondral sclerosis, they are features of osteoarthritis and therefore a form of arthritis; conversely, isolated bone degeneration not involving joint structures, such as osteoporosis, is not called arthritis, so the classification hinges on whether the degeneration is part of a synovial joint disease process [^111VBY2s] [^113fg6yX] [^1169suuX].

Degenerative changes in bones are most commonly due to **osteoarthritis (OA)** [^111VBY2s], the prototypical degenerative arthritis characterized by cartilage loss, subchondral bone remodeling, osteophytes, and sclerosis [^112WwM88] [^112mxT3T]. However, **other degenerative bone diseases** such as osteoporosis, degenerative disc disease, and avascular necrosis can also cause bone degeneration without the classic joint changes of OA. Thus, while degenerative bone changes often indicate OA, they are not exclusive to it and require clinical and imaging correlation for accurate diagnosis [^1152ewor] [^1159Ksvf].

---

## Pathological features of degenerative bone changes in arthritis

Key pathological features, particularly in **OA**, include:

- **Cartilage degeneration**: Progressive loss of articular cartilage, exposing subchondral bone and causing pain and stiffness [^113zGCcg].

- **Subchondral bone remodeling**: Increased bone turnover, sclerosis, and osteophyte formation [^116ziVMd].

- **Synovial inflammation**: Low-grade synovitis contributing to pain and progression [^113H1UvX].

- **Osteophyte formation**: Bony outgrowths at joint margins, a hallmark of OA [^112mxT3T].

---

## Clinical symptoms and diagnostic criteria

Degenerative arthritis typically presents with:

- **Pain**: Worsens with activity, improves with rest [^113KCvMV].

- **Stiffness**: Especially after inactivity or in the morning [^115ATg1E].

- **Reduced range of motion**: Due to joint degeneration [^1152ewor].

- **Crepitus**: Grinding sensation with movement [^113fg6yX].

Diagnosis relies on **clinical assessment and imaging** (radiographs, MRI) [^1152ewor] demonstrating joint space narrowing [^1159Ksvf], osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis, and cysts [^113fg6yX].

## Differences between degenerative arthritis and other forms of arthritis

Degenerative arthritis (OA) differs from **inflammatory arthritis (e.g. RA)** in the following ways [^11252aDt]:

| **Feature** | **Degenerative arthritis (OA)** | **Inflammatory arthritis (RA)** |
|-|-|-|
| Pathology | Cartilage degeneration, subchondral bone remodeling, osteophytes | Synovial inflammation, pannus formation, joint erosion |
| Symptoms | Pain with activity, stiffness after inactivity | Persistent inflammation, swelling, systemic symptoms |
| Progression | Gradual, localized | Rapid, systemic |
| Treatment | Pain management, physical therapy, joint replacement | Immunosuppressive therapy, biologics |

---

## Risk factors and causes

Degenerative arthritis is **multifactorial**, with key risk factors that include [^112mxT3T]:

- **Age**: Most significant risk factor [^115BCKLx].

- **Genetics**: Family history increases risk [^113VhjJa].

- **Obesity**: Excess weight stresses joints [^113D4eMt].

- **Joint injury**: Trauma or repetitive stress [^113rdq2o].

- **Mechanical factors**: Malalignment, instability [^111hCZ8L].

---

## Treatment options

Management includes **non-pharmacological measures** (weight loss, exercise, physical therapy) [^111VaNqq] and pharmacological therapies (NSAIDs, analgesics, intra-articular corticosteroids), with surgical joint replacement considered for advanced disease [^116KGL5r].

---

## Conclusion

Degenerative changes in bones are most commonly due to **OA** [^111VBY2s], but other conditions can cause bone degeneration without the classic features of OA. Accurate diagnosis requires **clinical and imaging correlation** [^1152ewor], and management is tailored to symptoms and disease severity.

### Should subchondral bone turnover be targeted when treating osteoarthritis [^112WwM88]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2008). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritic disease and a major cause of disability and impaired quality of life in the elderly. OA is a complex disease affecting the entire joint, including bone and cartilage, thus presenting alternative treatment approaches. This review summarizes emerging observations from cell biology to preliminary clinical trials, describing interactions between the bone and cartilage components. We speculate whether a treatment for OA would be possible without targeting the bone compartment?

Peer-reviewed articles found using pre-defined search criteria and published in the PubMed database until June 2007 are summarized. In addition, abstracts from the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) conferences from 2000 to 2007 were included.

Bone and cartilage health appear to be tightly associated. Ample evidence exists for bone changes during OA progression, including increased turnover in the subchondral bone, thinning of the trabecular structure, osteophytes, bone marrow lesions, and sclerosis of the subchondral plate. Furthermore, various investigations have described secondary positive effects on cartilage health when bone resorption is suppressed, or deterioration of the cartilage when resorption is increased.

An optimal treatment for OA might include targeting both the bone and cartilage compartments. However, as several cell systems need to be targeted safely, limited options seem possible.

### Nerve growth factor receptor limits inflammation to promote remodeling and repair of osteoarthritic joints [^111VBY2s]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful, incurable disease affecting 500 million adults around the world. Pathological changes of OA include multiple manifestations such as articular cartilage destruction, joint space narrowing, synovial hyperplasia, osteophyte formation, and subchondral bone sclerosis. The hallmark of OA is articular cartilage degradation, which can be induced by aging, injury, overloading, or abnormal inflammation. The bony changes, such as sclerosis in subchondral bone and osteophytes at the periphery or margin of joints, are also prominent radiographic features of OA, indicative of the later stages of the disease. Both subchondral sclerosis and osteophytes are thought to be a spontaneous response of the diseased joint to mechanical overload due to the loss of cartilage. In addition, modification of these bony remodeling processes could potentially treat OA, as antiresorptive agents offer beneficial effects on articular cartilage protection.

Pain is the most prominent complaint from OA patients and an overwhelmingly influential factor in causing disability. Nerve growth factor (NGF) was the first growth factor discovered to be essential for the growth and survival of neurons. A member of the neurotrophin family, NGF has been found to be significantly upregulated in the joints of OA patients, which is believed to be required for the sensitization of nociceptors, the sensory neurons and their endings that detect signals from peripheral tissues. Clinical trials have shown that monoclonal antibodies against NGF, such as tanezumab, offer significant benefits.

### Arthroscopic surgery for degenerative knee arthritis and meniscal tears: A clinical practice guideline [^111VaNqq]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Approximately 25% of people older than 50 years experience knee pain from degenerative knee disease. Management options include watchful waiting, weight loss if overweight, a variety of interventions led by physical therapists, exercise, oral or topical pain medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intra-articular corticosteroid and other injections, arthroscopic knee surgery, and knee replacement or osteotomy. The preferred combination or sequence of these options is not clear and probably varies between patients.

- **What is degenerative knee disease**: Degenerative knee disease is an inclusive term, which many consider synonymous with osteoarthritis. We use the term degenerative knee disease to explicitly include patients with knee pain, particularly if they are over 35 years old, with or without imaging evidence of osteoarthritis, meniscus tears, locking, clicking, or other mechanical symptoms except persistent objective locked knee, and acute or subacute onset of symptoms. Most people with degenerative arthritis have at least one of these characteristics. The term degenerative knee disease does not include patients having a recent debut of their symptoms following a major knee trauma with acute onset of joint swelling, such as haemarthrosis.

### IGF1 drives Wnt-induced joint damage and is a potential therapeutic target for osteoarthritis [^112mxT3T]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis, the most common chronic joint disease affecting more than 500 million people (7% of the global population), is characterized by progressive joint damage, which leads to pain and loss of function. The prevalence and burden associated with the disease are steadily increasing due to the aging of the population and rising obesity rates. This represents a major escalating public health challenge for the decades ahead. Osteoarthritis, ranked as a major contributor to global disability and chronic pain, adversely affects mobility, physical function, and individual well-being. The currently available pharmacological treatments are only able to target the disease symptoms, and in severe cases, joint replacement surgery is the only option. The absence of an effective disease-modifying therapy has led to the recognition of osteoarthritis as a serious disease with a high unmet medical need.

Osteoarthritis is a complex disease that affects the whole joint. It is primarily characterized by articular cartilage damage and is often accompanied by osteophyte formation, subchondral bone sclerosis, and synovial inflammation. Similar to many common diseases, the etiology of osteoarthritis is complex, involving multiple factors that contribute to the condition. These factors include joint injury, altered joint anatomy and biomechanics, aging, obesity, and metabolic alterations, all of which interact with the individual's genetic predisposition. The multifactorial nature of the disease, combined with the multiple alterations in distinct joint tissues, may explain why it remains challenging to develop effective treatments.

### Differential patterns of pathology in and interaction between joint tissues in long-term osteoarthritis with different initiating causes: Phenotype matters [^116jVHoi]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2020). Low credibility.

To determine if osteoarthritis (OA) progression and joint tissue-pathology associations link specific animal models to different human OA phenotypes, 11-week-old male C57BL6 mice were studied. They underwent unilateral medial-meniscal destabilization (DMM) or antigen-induced arthritis (AIA). Joint tissue histopathology was scored from day 3 to week 16. Tissue-pathology associations, corrected for time and at week 16, were determined by partial correlation coefficients. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated for the likelihood of cartilage damage and joint inflammation using ordinal logistic regression.

By week 16, despite distinct temporal patterns of progression, joint-wide OA pathology in DMM and AIA models was equivalent. Significant pathology associations common to both models included osteophyte size and maturity (r > 0.4); subchondral bone (SCB) sclerosis and osteophyte maturity (r > 0.25); cartilage erosion and chondrocyte hypertrophy/apoptosis (r > 0.4), SCB sclerosis (r > 0.26), osteophyte size (r > 0.3), and maturity (r > 0.32).

- **DMM-specific associations**: Cartilage proteoglycan loss was associated with structural damage (r = 0.56), osteophyte maturity (r = 0.49), size (r = 0.45), and SCB sclerosis (r = 0.28).

- **AIA-specific associations**: SCB sclerosis was linked with chondrocyte hypertrophy/apoptosis (r = 0.40) and osteophyte size (r = 0.37). Synovitis was associated with cartilage structural damage (r = 0.18).

No tissue-pathology associations were common to both models at week 16. Increased likelihood of cartilage structural damage was associated with chondrocyte hypertrophy/apoptosis (OR > 1.7).

- **Subchondral bone remodeling**: Mechanisms of subchondral bone remodeling.
- **Synovium and inflammation**: Role of synovium and inflammation.
- **Age-related changes**: Role of age-related changes including cartilage matrix stiffening, cellular senescence, mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic dysfunction, and impaired autophagy.
- **OA pain mechanisms**: Peripheral mechanisms of OA pain.

Progress in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the multiple aspects of OA biology is unraveling novel therapeutic targets for disease modification.

### Osteocyte-derived extracellular vesicles mediate the bone-to-cartilage crosstalk and promote osteoarthritis progression [^117K5jSK]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative joint disease, characterized by a range of joint changes, including articular cartilage damage, synovitis, subchondral bone (SCB) sclerosis, and osteophyte formation. As a leading cause of disability, OA poses a major clinical and socioeconomic burden worldwide. However, due to its poorly understood pathomechanisms, there is currently no effective clinical intervention for OA.

Over the last decade, OA has been recognized as a disease of the whole joint, implicating pathological alterations in the articular cartilage, SCB, ligaments, capsule, synovial membrane, and periarticular muscles. While cartilage degeneration plays a crucial role in OA pathogenesis, a series of studies suggest that SCB remodeling precedes such degeneration. Emerging evidence indicates that abnormal mechanical stress during the early stages of OA progression leads to increased vascularity, porosity, microcracks, and fissures at the bone-cartilage interface. This results in the release of various cytokines and extracellular vesicles (EVs) from the SCB, which likely communicate with the articular cartilage, aggravating cartilage degeneration and OA progression.

- **Calcium-phosphate complexes**: Jung et al. reported that cartilage can acquire calcium-phosphate complexes from the SCB, leading to increased production of MMP13, a key extracellular protease known to contribute to OA progression, in chondrocytes.

- **Exosomal miRNAs**: Liu et al. demonstrated that osteoclast-derived exosomes contain miRNAs that impair chondrocyte function in OA.

Thus, these studies indicate the importance of bone-cartilage interactions in understanding and potentially intervening in OA progression.

### The role of macrophages in osteoarthritis and cartilage repair [^113ZKcoY]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2020). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a family of degenerative diseases affecting multiple joint tissues. Despite the diverse etiology and pathogenesis of OA, increasing evidence suggests that macrophages can play a significant role in modulating joint inflammation, and thus OA severity, via various secreted mediators. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies, coupled with proteomic and epigenetic tools, have greatly facilitated research to elucidate the embryonic origin of macrophages in various tissues, including joint synovium. Furthermore, scientists have now begun to appreciate that macrophage polarization can span beyond the conventionally recognized binary states (i.e. pro-inflammatory M1-like vs. anti-inflammatory M2-like) and may encompass a broad spectrum of phenotypes. Although the presence of these cells has been shown in multiple joint tissues, additional mechanistic studies are required to provide a comprehensive understanding of the precise role of these diverse macrophage populations in OA onset and progression. New approaches that can modulate macrophages into desired functional phenotypes may provide novel therapeutic strategies for preventing OA or enhancing cartilage repair and regeneration.

### Structural correlates of pain in joints with osteoarthritis [^113KCvMV]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2013). Low credibility.

The primary objective of this narrative review is to describe insights into the epidemiology of the pain-structure association in osteoarthritis and discuss the ramifications of these studies for clinical trials. The review summarizes relevant literature, addresses some inherent methodological challenges, and proposes research initiatives to further understanding of this complex science.

The predominant symptom in most patients with osteoarthritis (OA) is pain. In recent years, imaging-based studies have narrowed the discord between structural findings on imaging and symptoms. However, the interpretation of pain in OA remains enigmatic and challenging for both clinicians and scientists.

We anticipate that in the coming years, many pressing questions regarding the relationship between structure and pain in OA will continue to be addressed. Consequently, this can lead to clinically appropriate therapeutic advancements.

### Hip osteoarthritis: What the radiologist wants to know [^1159Ksvf]. European Journal of Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common disease of the hip joint seen in adults. The diagnosis of OA is based on a combination of radiographic findings of joint degeneration and characteristic subjective symptoms. The lack of a radiographic consensus definition has resulted in variations in the published incidences and prevalence of OA. The chronological sequence of degeneration includes the following plain radiographic findings: joint space narrowing, development of osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis, and cyst formation. However, there are cases where plain radiographs show minor changes, and the clinical suspicion of early disease can be confirmed with more sophisticated imaging methods, such as multi-detector computed tomography and MR imaging. The present article reviews all the clinical information on hip OA together with an updated radiological approach, emphasizing the early depiction and differential diagnosis of the disease.

### Cartilage damage in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis — two unequal siblings [^11252aDt]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Cartilage damage is a key feature of degenerative joint disorders — primarily osteoarthritis (OA) — and chronic inflammatory joint diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Substantial progress has been made toward understanding the mechanisms that lead to degradation of the cartilage matrix in either condition, ultimately resulting in the progressive remodelling of affected joints.

The available data have shown that the molecular steps in cartilage matrix breakdown overlap in both OA and RA. However, they have also significantly changed our view of the roles of cartilage in the pathogenesis of these disorders.

- **Complex programme of OA**: In OA, cartilage loss occurs as part of a complex programme that resembles aspects of embryonic bone formation through endochondral ossification.
- **Cellular reactions in RA**: In RA, early cartilage damage serves as a key trigger for cellular reactions in the synovium.

In a proposed model of RA as a site-specific manifestation of a systemic autoimmune disorder, early cartilage damage in the context of immune activation leads to a specific cellular response within articular joints. This model could explain not only the organ specificity of RA but also the chronic nature and perpetuation of the disease.

### Osteoarthritis: New insights. Part 1: The disease and its risk factors [^111QpSrF]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting millions of people in the United States. It is a complex disease whose etiology bridges biomechanics and biochemistry. Evidence is growing for the role of systemic factors (such as genetics, dietary intake, estrogen use, and bone density) and of local biomechanical factors (such as muscle weakness, obesity, and joint laxity). These risk factors are particularly important in weight-bearing joints, and modifying them may present opportunities for prevention of osteoarthritis-related pain and disability. Major advances in management to reduce pain and disability are yielding a panoply of available treatments ranging from nutraceuticals to chondrocyte transplantation, new oral anti-inflammatory medications, and health education. This article is part 1 of a two-part summary of a National Institutes of Health conference. The conference brought together experts on osteoarthritis from diverse backgrounds and provided a multidisciplinary and comprehensive summary of recent advances in the prevention of osteoarthritis onset, progression, and disability. Part 1 focuses on a new understanding of what osteoarthritis is and on risk factors that predispose to disease occurrence. It concludes with a discussion of the impact of osteoarthritis on disability.

### Radiographic assessment of osteoarthritis [^113fg6yX]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis is one of the most prevalent and disabling chronic conditions affecting older adults and a significant public health problem among adults of working age. As the bulk of the U.S. population ages, the prevalence of osteoarthritis is expected to rise. Although the incidence of osteoarthritis increases with age, the condition is not a normal part of the aging process. More severe symptoms tend to occur in the radiographically more advanced stage of the disease; however, considerable discrepancy may exist between symptoms and the radiographic stage.

Roentgenograms of involved joints may be useful in confirming the diagnosis of osteoarthritis, assessing the severity of the disease, reassuring the patient, and excluding other pathologic conditions. The diagnosis of osteoarthritis is based primarily on the history and physical examination, but radiographic findings, including asymmetric joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, osteophyte formation, subluxation, and distribution patterns of osteoarthritic changes, can be helpful when the diagnosis is in question.

### Knee osteoarthritis phenotypes and their relevance for outcomes: A systematic review [^111hMtiG]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature for studies investigating knee osteoarthritis (OA) phenotypes to examine what OA characteristics are relevant for phenotyping.

A comprehensive search was performed in Medline, EMBASE, Web of Sciences, CINAHL, and Scopus databases from inception to September 2016. Inclusion was limited to observational studies of individuals with symptomatic knee OA that identified phenotypes based on any OA characteristics and assessed their association with clinically important outcomes. A descriptive synthesis of the data was performed.

Of the 2,777 citations retrieved, 34 studies were included. Clinical phenotypes were investigated most frequently, followed by laboratory, imaging, and aetiologic phenotypes. Eight studies defined subgroups based on outcome trajectories, including pain, function, and radiographic progression trajectories. Most studies used a single patient or disease characteristic to identify patient subgroups, while five included characteristics from multiple domains. Evidence from multiple studies suggested that pain sensitization, psychological distress, radiographic severity, body mass index (BMI), muscle strength, inflammation, and comorbidities are associated with clinically distinct phenotypes. Gender, obesity, other metabolic abnormalities, the pattern of cartilage damage, and inflammation may be implicated in delineating distinct structural phenotypes. Only a few studies investigated the external validity of the phenotypes or their prospective validity using longitudinal outcomes.

### Pathways to understanding the genomic aetiology of osteoarthritis [^1169suuX]. Human Molecular Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis is a disease of the synovial joint. The synovial joint is a complex structure, comprising articular cartilage, subchondral bone, synovial lining membrane, fibrous joint capsule, and supporting ligaments. The articular cartilage, calcified cartilage, and subchondral bone form the osteochondral unit, which is uniquely adapted to transferring loads during weight bearing and joint motion. This unit provides tensile strength, compressive resilience, and a low-friction articulating surface through the collagen network, proteoglycan aggregates, and layer of lubricants, respectively.

Chondrocytes are the only cell type in articular cartilage, which is avascular and aneural. Under normal physiological conditions, the synovial membrane consists of a thin layer of cells with phenotypic features of macrophages and fibroblasts; it serves to produce synovial fluid responsible for maintaining nutrition and lubrication of the articular cartilage. The subchondral bone adapts its structural and functional architecture in response to its local mechanical environment through remodelling, regulated by osteocytes via interactions with osteoclasts and osteoblasts.

Osteoarthritis is characterized by a gradual process of tissue destruction and remodelling that affects all of the structures of the synovial joint, with degeneration of articular cartilage, remodelling of the underlying bone, and synovitis as its hallmarks. The initiating signals triggering the development of osteoarthritis remain poorly understood, although established clinical risk factors include increases in…

### Vascular pathology and osteoarthritis [^113h6FMP]. Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

There is mounting evidence that vascular pathology plays a role in the initiation and/or progression of the major joint disease: osteoarthritis (OA). Potential mechanisms include episodically reduced blood flow through the small vessels in the subchondral bone at the ends of long bones and, related to this, reduced interstitial fluid flow in the subchondral bone. Blood flow may be reduced by venous occlusion and stasis or by the development of microemboli in the subchondral vessels.

There are several likely effects of subchondral ischemia:

- **Compromised nutrient and gas exchange**: This can lead to degradative changes in the cartilage, potentially initiating such changes.

- **Osteocyte apoptosis**: This occurs in regions of the subchondral bone and would initiate osteoclastic resorption of that bone, at least temporarily reducing the bony support for the overlying cartilage.

Recognizing these potential etiological factors may be important in developing more effective treatments to inhibit the progression of OA.

### Are signs of degenerative joint disease associated with chin deviation [^1134viLM]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between degenerative joint changes in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and chin deviation. TMJ degeneration can lead to chin deviation; however, the extent and characterization of these changes remain unclear. This study aimed to correlate degenerative TMJ changes with condylar volume, grayscale measures, and chin deviation.

This cross-sectional study enrolled women with skeletal Class III malocclusion. Preoperative cone-beam computed tomography scans were used to analyze degenerative TMJ signs and measure condylar volume and grayscale. The predictor variable was the presence of degenerative TMJ signs, categorized as 0 (none), 1 (present in 1 joint), and 2 (present in both joints). The primary outcome variable was a chin deviation of 3 mm or more. Additional variables included age, cephalometric data, and 3-dimensional condylar measurements. Descriptive bivariate statistics and both univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify associations between degenerative TMJ disease and chin deviation.

The study included 85 patients, divided into two groups: those with less than 3 mm of chin deviation (n = 43) and those with 3 mm or more (n = 42). The presence of more than 10 degenerative TMJ signs was significantly associated with chin deviation of 3 mm or more (P < .001). Multiple regression models indicated that subcortical sclerosis in one or both joints was also significantly associated with increased chin deviation.

### Osteoarthritis year in review 2018: Clinical [^115ATg1E]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2019). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease in the world, with an age-associated increase in both incidence and prevalence. Clinical and epidemiologic research is crucial to better understand risk factors for the disease, find the best treatments for symptoms, and identify therapies to slow down or even prevent disease progression. This paper is based on a systematic review of the osteoarthritis literature published in English between May 1, 2017, and April 25, 2018, with a focus on papers which have the potential to improve patient care or suggest novel areas for future research.

### Surgical interventions for symptomatic mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis [^116KGL5r]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis affecting the knee is common and represents a continuum of disease from early cartilage thinning to full-thickness cartilage loss, bony erosion, and deformity. Many studies do not stratify their results based on the severity of the disease at baseline or recruitment.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of surgical intervention for the management of symptomatic mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis, defined as knee pain and radiographic evidence of non-end stage osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1, 2, 3 or equivalent on MRI/arthroscopy). Outcomes of interest included pain, function, radiographic progression, quality of life, short-term serious adverse events, re-operation rates, and withdrawals due to adverse events.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase up to May 2018. We also conducted searches of ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. Authors of trials were contacted if some but not all their participants appeared to fit our inclusion criteria.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials that compared surgery to non-surgical interventions (including sham and placebo control groups, exercise or physiotherapy, and analgesic or other medication), injectable therapies, and trials that compared one type of surgical intervention to another surgical intervention in people with symptomatic mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias.

### Teriparatide as a chondroregenerative therapy for injury-induced osteoarthritis [^1164V7dH]. Science Translational Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

There is no disease-modifying therapy for osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease projected to afflict more than 67 million individuals in the United States alone by 2030. The disease pathogenesis is associated with inappropriate articular chondrocyte maturation, resembling that seen during normal endochondral ossification. Therefore, pathways governing the maturation of articular chondrocytes are considered candidate therapeutic targets. It is well established that parathyroid hormone (PTH), acting via the type 1 PTH receptor, induces matrix synthesis and suppresses chondrocyte maturation. We report that the PTH receptor is up-regulated in articular chondrocytes after meniscal injury, as well as in osteoarthritis in humans and in a mouse model of injury-induced knee osteoarthritis.

To test whether recombinant human PTH(1–34) (teriparatide) would inhibit aberrant chondrocyte maturation and associated articular cartilage degeneration, we administered systemic teriparatide (Forteo), a Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for osteoporosis, either immediately after or eight weeks after meniscal/ligamentous injury in mice. Knee joints were harvested at four, eight, or twelve weeks after injury to examine the effects of teriparatide on cartilage degeneration and articular chondrocyte maturation. Microcomputed tomography revealed increased bone volume within joints from teriparatide-treated mice compared to saline-treated control animals. Immediate systemic administration of teriparatide increased proteoglycan content and inhibited articular cartilage degeneration.

### Role of proinflammatory cytokines in the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis [^114Vqe8Z]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is associated with cartilage destruction, subchondral bone remodeling, and inflammation of the synovial membrane, although the etiology and pathogenesis underlying this debilitating disease are poorly understood. Secreted inflammatory molecules, such as proinflammatory cytokines, are among the critical mediators of the disturbed processes implicated in OA pathophysiology. Interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), in particular, control the degeneration of the articular cartilage matrix, which makes them prime targets for therapeutic strategies. Animal studies provide support for this approach, although only a few clinical studies have investigated the efficacy of blocking these proinflammatory cytokines in the treatment of OA.

Apart from IL-1β and TNF, several other cytokines, including IL-6, IL-15, IL-17, IL-18, IL-21, leukemia inhibitory factor, and IL-8 (a chemokine), have also been shown to be implicated in OA and could possibly be targeted therapeutically. This review discusses the knowledge regarding the role of proinflammatory cytokines in the pathophysiology of OA and addresses the potential of anticytokine therapy in the treatment of this disease.

### Widespread epigenomic, transcriptomic and proteomic differences between hip osteophytic and articular chondrocytes in osteoarthritis [^112bqUEC]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized clinically by pain and loss of physical function. It is prevalent, affecting over 40% of individuals over the age of 70 years. There is currently no curative therapy; end-stage disease is managed by joint replacement surgery. This procedure provides an opportunity to directly examine and characterize diseased tissue from patients using genomic technologies.

A key feature of OA is cartilage degeneration, and several genomics studies have investigated the molecular characteristics of this process. However, another important feature that can develop in joints affected by OA is the osteophyte — an area of apparent new tissue formation consisting of a cartilage-topped bony outgrowth. Osteophytes can significantly impact both pain and loss of movement and are a typical radiographic feature of OA. They primarily arise on the margins of the articular cartilage from cells of the periosteum or synovium through a process of endochondral ossification within newly forming fibrocartilage. While the pathogenesis of osteophytes has been studied in mice, there is still much to be learned from the molecular characterization of these important structures, particularly in human joints.

Previous research on osteophytic cartilage in the knee investigated gene expression using a microarray, suggesting significant differences compared with 'macroscopically intact' articular cartilage. The authors hypothesized that cells in the osteophyte transition between chondrocyte and hypertrophic chondrocyte phenotypes.

### The relationship between clinical characteristics, radiographic osteoarthritis, and 3D bone area: Data from the osteoarthritis initiative [^113vm146]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2014). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) causes pain and disability and profoundly impacts individuals and health economies alike. This impact is destined to increase in our aging and increasingly obese population. Until recently, structural modification trials have depended on conventional radiography to define both the OA phenotype for participant inclusion and for assessing structural progression. Conventional radiography is less sensitive and specific in detecting structural pathology and structural progression than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is therefore increasingly used to provide assessment of OA pathology. Another advantage of MRI is that its three-dimensional data can be harnessed to provide quantification of important tissues using manual segmentation or automated analysis techniques such as active appearance modeling (AAM), which enables relatively rapid, accurate quantification of large datasets.

Modern imaging approaches recognize that OA is a whole joint disease that may involve multiple tissues, which confer different phenotypes. Subchondral bone, in particular, is integral to the pathogenesis and progression of OA. Specifically, the area of subchondral bone at the femorotibial articulation is larger in OA knees than in healthy controls and correlates with knee joint space narrowing, osteophytes, and Kellgren Lawrence (KL) grade after adjusting for appropriate confounders in cross-sectional studies. While the severity of conventional radiographic OA may correlate with 3D subchondral bone area expansion, the additional value of bone area exp…

### Synovial inflammation in osteoarthritis progression [^113vTfsJ]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive degenerative disease that results in joint deterioration. Synovial inflammation is present in the OA joint and has been associated with radiographic and pain progression. Several OA risk factors, including aging, obesity, trauma, and mechanical loading, play a role in OA pathogenesis, likely by modifying synovial biology. Additionally, other factors such as mitochondrial dysfunction, damage-associated molecular patterns, cytokines, metabolites, and crystals in the synovium activate synovial cells and mediate synovial inflammation.

An understanding of the activated pathways involved in OA-related synovial inflammation could form the basis for the stratification of patients and the development of novel therapeutics. This review focuses on the biology of the OA synovium, how the cells residing in or recruited to the synovium interact with each other, how they become activated, how they contribute to OA progression, and their interplay with other joint structures.

### Advances in osteoarthritis genetics [^116n784w]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common form of arthritis, is a highly debilitating disease of the joints and can lead to severe pain and disability. There is no cure for OA, and treatments often fail to alleviate its symptoms, leading to an increased demand for joint replacement surgery. Previous epidemiological and genetic research has established that OA is a multifactorial disease with both environmental and genetic components. Over the past six years, a candidate gene study and several genome-wide association scans (GWAS) in populations of Asian and European descent have collectively established 15 loci associated with knee or hip OA. These have been replicated with genome-wide significance, shedding some light on the aetiogenesis of the disease.

All OA-associated variants at the time of writing are common in frequency and appear to confer moderate to small effect sizes. Some of the associated variants are found within or near genes with clear roles in OA pathogenesis, whereas others point to unsuspected, less characterized pathways. These studies have also provided further evidence in support of the existence of ethnic, sex, and joint-specific effects in OA and have highlighted the importance of expanded and more homogeneous phenotype definitions in genetic studies of OA.

### Osteoarthritis year 2012 in review: Biology [^112Sn1aL]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2012). Low credibility.

This review focuses on recent findings in the pathobiology of osteoarthritis (OA). The progress in this field will be illustrated based on three questions:

1. **What factors maintain or alter the articular chondrocyte phenotype?**

2. **What is the role of inflammation in OA?**

3. **Is there a role for aging-related genes in OA?**

Recent findings make it increasingly apparent that OA is not a single tissue disease. The development and progression of OA result from an integrated complex of local and systemic factors that contribute to the pathobiology of this widespread disease.

### Dual functions of microRNA-17 in maintaining cartilage homeostasis and protection against osteoarthritis [^113zGCcg]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent degenerative disorder of synovial joints and leads to chronic disability due to pain and associated joint dysfunction. Currently, no treatments can effectively impede the progression of OA, and surgical joint replacement is ultimately required in many affected patients. The structural integrity of healthy cartilage is maintained by a fine-tuned balance between anabolism and catabolism of extracellular matrix (ECM) components in chondrocytes. Chondrocytes display zone-specific heterogeneity amongst different layers of the articular cartilage. However, during OA pathogenesis, the cartilage matrix is gradually degraded owing to excessive expression of multiple matrix-destructive enzymes, particularly matrix metallopeptidases MMP3, MMP13, and aggrecanase-2 (ADAMTS5), produced by chondrocytes in response to biochemical and biomechanical stimuli. Thus, exploring molecular mechanisms underlying the imbalance between anabolic and catabolic pathways is expected to help identify new therapeutic targets for OA.

### The role of the cartilage matrix in osteoarthritis [^1144oiEk]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) involves all the structures of the joint. How the disease is initiated and what factors trigger the disease process remain unclear, although the mechanical environment seems to have a role. Our understanding of the biology of the disease has been hampered by the lack of access to tissue samples from patients with early-stage disease because clinically recognizable symptoms appear late in the osteoarthritic process. However, new data about the early processes in articular cartilage and new tools to identify the early stages of OA are providing fresh insights into the pathological sequence of events.

The progressive destruction of cartilage involves the degradation of matrix constituents and rather active, yet inefficient, repair attempts. The release of fragmented molecules provides opportunities to monitor the disease process in patients and to investigate whether these fragments are involved in propagating OA, for example, by inducing inflammation. The role of bone has not been fully elucidated, but changes in bone seem to be secondary to alterations in articular cartilage, which change the mechanical environment of the bone cells and induce them, in turn, to modulate tissue structure.

### Joint injury, repair, and remodeling: roles in post-traumatic osteoarthritis [^113rdq2o]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2004). Low credibility.

Joint injuries, especially intra-articular fractures, frequently lead to progressive joint degeneration that causes the clinical syndrome of post-traumatic osteoarthritis. Orthopaedists attempt to prevent this disease by restoring joint congruity, alignment, and stability; however, many patients develop crippling joint pain and dysfunction despite optimal treatment. The pathophysiology of post-traumatic osteoarthritis has not been fully explained. It is not simply the magnitude and type of injury that determines whether an injured articular surface will repair and remodel or undergo progressive degeneration.

For these reasons, clinically significant progress in preventing post-traumatic osteoarthritis depends on advances in understanding the pathogenesis of this disease. This understanding will make it possible to decrease the risk of articular surface degeneration and facilitate articular surface repair and remodeling. We examine the relationships between joint injury, repair and remodeling, and joint degeneration; the factors that increase the risk of post-traumatic joint degeneration; and the questions that need additional investigation to develop treatments for joint injuries that will decrease the risk or severity of post-traumatic osteoarthritis.

### Bone remodelling in osteoarthritis [^116ziVMd]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

The classical view of the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) is that subchondral sclerosis is associated with, and perhaps causes, age-related joint degeneration. Recent observations have demonstrated that OA is associated with early loss of bone owing to increased bone remodelling, followed by slow turnover leading to densification of the subchondral plate and complete loss of cartilage. Subchondral densification is a late event in OA that involves only the subchondral plate and calcified cartilage; the subchondral cancellous bone beneath the subchondral plate may remain osteopenic. In experimental models, inducing subchondral sclerosis without allowing the prior stage of increased bone remodelling to occur does not lead to progressive OA. Therefore, both early-stage increased remodelling and bone loss, and the late-stage slow remodelling and subchondral densification are important components of the pathogenetic process that leads to OA. The apparent paradoxical observations that OA is associated with both increased remodelling and osteopenia, as well as decreased remodelling and sclerosis, are consistent with the spatial and temporal separation of these processes during joint degeneration. This review provides an overview of knowledge on OA and discusses the role of subchondral bone in the initiation and progression of OA. A hypothetical model of OA pathogenesis is proposed.

### Peripheral pain mechanisms in osteoarthritis [^113VK5pB]. Pain (2020). Low credibility.

There is a well-established historical observation that structural joint damage by plain X-ray correlates poorly with symptomatic disease in osteoarthritis (OA). This is often attributed to the inability to visualize soft-tissue pathology within the joint and the recognition of heterogeneous patient factors that drive central pain sensitization. A major issue is the relative paucity of mechanistic studies in which the molecular pathogenesis of pain is interrogated in relation to tissue pathology.

Nonetheless, in recent years, three broad approaches have been deployed to attempt to address this:

- **Correlative clinical studies**: Peripheral and central pain outcomes using magnetic resonance imaging, where soft-tissue processes can be visualized.
- **Molecular studies**: On tissue from patients with OA.
- **Preclinical models**: Careful molecular interrogation of preclinical models of OA across the disease time course.

Studies have taken advantage of established clinical molecular targets such as nerve growth factor. Not only is the regulation of nerve growth factor within the joint being used to explore the relationship between tissue pathology and the origins of pain in OA, but it also provides a core model on which other molecules present within the joint can modulate the pain response.

In this narrative review, how molecular and pathological tissue change relates to joint pain in OA is discussed. Finally, a model for how tissue damage may lead to pain over the disease course is proposed.

### Ageing and the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis [^115BCKLx]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2016). High credibility.

Ageing-associated changes that affect articular tissues promote the development of osteoarthritis (OA). Although ageing and OA are closely linked, they are independent processes. Several potential mechanisms by which ageing contributes to OA have been elucidated. This review focuses on the contributions of the following factors: age-related inflammation (also referred to as 'inflammaging'); cellular senescence (including the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)); mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress; dysfunction in energy metabolism due to reduced activity of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is associated with reduced autophagy; and alterations in cell signaling due to age-related changes in the extracellular matrix.

These various processes contribute to the development of OA by promoting a proinflammatory, catabolic state accompanied by increased susceptibility to cell death, which together lead to increased joint tissue destruction and defective repair of damaged matrix. The majority of studies at the time of writing have focused on articular cartilage, and it will be important to determine whether similar mechanisms occur in other joint tissues. Improved understanding of ageing-related mechanisms that promote OA could lead to the discovery of new targets for therapies that aim to slow or stop the progression of this chronic and disabling condition.

### Autophagy and cartilage homeostasis mechanisms in joint health, aging and OA [^113mj44C]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent joint disease; however, neither preventive measures nor disease-modifying drugs are currently available, highlighting the continuing need for safe and effective symptom-modifying therapies. Clinical trials of candidate disease-modifying OA drugs in patients with established or advanced disease have not demonstrated their efficacy, motivating further investigation into the mechanisms that maintain joint health. Enhancing these mechanisms could offer a novel approach to reducing the risk of OA.

Aging is a significant risk factor for OA, yet the aging of joint cartilage is a process distinct from the changes that develop following the onset of OA. This review focuses on the mechanisms that maintain cell and tissue homeostasis and examines how these mechanisms fail during the aging process. Autophagy, a cellular homeostasis mechanism for removing dysfunctional organelles and macromolecules, plays a role in this context. Defective autophagy is implicated in the pathogenesis of aging-related diseases, with recent observations indicating that this process is compromised in aging cartilage. The augmentation of homeostasis mechanisms is discussed as a novel avenue to delay joint aging and reduce OA risk.

### Low-grade inflammation as a key mediator of the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis [^113H1UvX]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2016). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) has long been viewed as a degenerative disease of cartilage, but accumulating evidence indicates that inflammation plays a critical role in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, we now appreciate that OA pathogenesis involves not only the breakdown of cartilage but also the remodeling of the underlying bone, formation of ectopic bone, hypertrophy of the joint capsule, and inflammation of the synovial lining. Thus, OA is a disorder of the joint as a whole, with inflammation driving many pathologic changes. The inflammation in OA is distinct from that in rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases: it is chronic, comparatively low-grade, and mediated primarily by the innate immune system.

Treatments for OA currently only control the symptoms, and none have been FDA-approved for the prevention or slowing of disease progression. However, increasing insight into the inflammatory underpinnings of OA holds promise for the development of new, disease-modifying therapies. Indeed, several anti-inflammatory therapies have shown promise in animal models of OA. Further work is needed to identify effective inhibitors of the low-grade inflammation in OA and to determine whether therapies that target this inflammation can prevent or slow the development and progression of the disease.

### Models of osteoarthritis: The good, the bad and the promising [^117QnsUH]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2019). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative disease of diarthrodial joints, predominantly affecting the spine and peripheral joints of the body, particularly the hands, hips, knees, and feet. OA most commonly affects people over the age of forty, with the risk of the disease increasing with age. It is a complex, heterogeneous disease with different clinical and biochemical phenotypes.

The causes of OA are unknown, and many studies have suggested that the pathobiology of OA is far more complex than a simple cartilaginous or bone disease. It is now acknowledged that OA affects many joint structures, including degeneration of cartilage, abnormal bone remodeling, and synovial inflammation. Studies have also shown that there is a complex interplay between the different joint components, making understanding of the degradative sequence of events involved in OA pathogenesis very difficult to dissect.

The initial onset of OA is considered to be due to an imbalance between cartilage degradation and the repair process. The exact sequence of events that trigger the onset of the disease, however, is widely debated throughout the literature. One hypothesis suggests that the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines into the synovial joint induces matrix metalloproteinases, which cause the fragmentation and degradation of the cartilage extracellular matrix, leading to bone remodeling and synovitis. Contrary to this theory, some studies suggest that subchondral bone remodeling and synovitis precede articular degeneration in the early stages of OA.

### HECTD1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of Rubicon regulates autophagy and osteoarthritis pathogenesis [^112ofFon]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common degenerative joint diseases and is associated with autophagy suppression. However, the molecular mechanism of autophagy regulation in the context of OA is not fully understood. In this study, we sought to determine the role that HECTD1 plays in the pathogenesis of OA.

- **Methods**: We used RNA sequencing analysis to explore the differential expression of E3 ubiquitin ligase genes in healthy human cartilage and human cartilage affected by OA. Using surgery- and aging-induced OA mouse models, we comprehensively analyzed the function of the screened gene Hectd1 in the development of OA. Furthermore, we dissected the mechanism by which HECTD1 regulates autophagy and OA progression using a combination of molecular biologic, cell biologic, and biochemical approaches.

- **Results**: HECTD1 was significantly down-regulated in human OA cartilage samples compared to healthy cartilage samples. Overexpression of HECTD1 in mouse joints alleviated OA pathogenesis, whereas conditional depletion of Hectd1 in cartilage samples aggravated surgery- and aging-induced OA pathogenesis. Mechanistically, HECTD1 bound to Rubicon and ubiquitinated Rubicon at lysine residue 534, which targets Rubicon for proteasomal degradation. More importantly, HECTD1-mediated Rubicon degradation regulated chondrocyte autophagy, leading to mitigation of stress-induced chondrocyte death and the subsequent progression of OA.

- **Conclusion**: HECTD1 plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of OA, whereby HECTD1 regulates chondrocyte autophagy by ubiquitinating and targeting Rubicon for degradation.

### Osteoarthritis as a disease of mechanics [^116eiex2]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2013). Low credibility.

Mechanics refers to movement or physical forces. In this paper, I contend that osteoarthritis (OA) is almost always caused by increased physical forces, which damage a joint. While there are numerous examples of joint injury causing OA, I argue that most, if not all, OA is partly caused by mechanically induced injury to joint tissues. Furthermore, once joint pathology develops, as is the case for almost all clinical OA, pathomechanics becomes the dominant factor in disease progression. Treatments that correct the pathomechanics have long-lasting favorable effects on pain and joint function compared to treatments that suppress inflammation, which have only temporary effects. I also argue that mechanically induced joint injury leads to variable inflammatory responses; however, the role of this inflammation in worsening structural damage in an already osteoarthritic joint has not yet been proven.

### Osteoarthritis of the knee: Multicompartmental or compartmental disease [^114yQLjN]. Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) has been conceptualized as a multicompartmental disease, a compartmental disease, or as a combination of these processes. The aim of this study was to determine the associations between four radiographic features — joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, sclerosis, and cysts — across and within the three knee compartments: medial tibiofemoral, lateral tibiofemoral, and patellofemoral compartment in knee OA.

Data from the Amsterdam OA Cohort were used. In 298 patients diagnosed with knee OA, radiographic features were examined in the three knee joint compartments. These features were scored according to standardized scoring methods. Factor analysis was employed to examine associations between the four radiographic features across and within compartments.

A bifactor model revealed a general multicompartmental factor: 10 of 12 radiographic features across the entire joint were associated with this general factor. The model also indicated three compartmental factors, one for each compartment. Joint space narrowing, sclerosis, and to a lesser extent, osteophyte formation, were associated with these compartmental factors.

These findings suggest a multicompartmental disease process in the knee, characterized by associations among features across the entire joint, as well as compartmental disease processes in each knee compartment, characterized by associations among features within specific compartments. Longitudinal studies are needed to explore the possibility of development from a compartmental disease to a multicompartmental disease.

### Osteoarthritis year in review 2018: Biology [^113HG6KT]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2019). High credibility.

This Year in Review highlights a selection of articles published between the 2017 and 2018 Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) World Congress meetings within the field of osteoarthritis biology, presented at OARSI 2018. Selected articles were obtained from a PubMed search covering cartilage, subchondral bone, inflammation, ageing, pain, and animal models. Studies focused on biomechanics, biomarkers, genetics and epigenetics, imaging, and clinical studies were excluded due to their coverage in other articles within the OARSI Year in Review series.

Significant themes including the role of progenitor cells in cartilage homeostasis and repair, novel signaling mechanisms controlling chondrocyte phenotypic stability, and the influence of disrupted or senescent chondrocytes were identified and are discussed in this review. Overarching conclusions derived from these study areas indicate that promising avenues of intervention are on the horizon; however, further understanding is required in order to target therapeutic treatments to suitable patient subgroups and disease stages.

### What is the role of imaging in the clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis and disease management [^1152ewor]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

While osteoarthritis (OA) is predominantly diagnosed on the basis of clinical criteria, imaging may aid with differential diagnosis in clinically suspected cases. Plain radiographs are traditionally the first choice of imaging modality. However, MRI and ultrasound (US) also have a valuable role in assessing multiple pathologic features of OA, although each has particular advantages and disadvantages. Modern imaging modalities provide the capability to detect a wide range of osseous and soft tissue OA-related structural damage, including cartilage, menisci, ligaments, synovitis, and effusion. Despite this, the additional information has not yet favorably influenced the clinical decision-making and management process. Imaging is recommended if there are unexpected rapid changes in clinical outcomes to determine whether it relates to disease severity or an additional diagnosis.

In the development of specific treatments, imaging serves as a sensitive tool to measure treatment response. This narrative review aims to describe the role of imaging modalities in aiding OA diagnosis, disease progression, and management. It also provides insight into the use of these modalities in finding targeted treatment strategies in clinical research.

### Models of osteoarthritis: The good, the bad and the promising [^1115n7ek]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2019). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative disease of diarthrodial joints, most commonly affecting people over the age of forty. The causes of OA are still unknown, and there is much debate in the literature regarding the exact sequence of events that trigger the onset of the heterogeneous disease we recognize as OA.

Currently, there is no consensus model for OA that naturally reflects human disease. Existing ex-vivo models do not incorporate the important inter-tissue communication between joint components required for disease progression. Additionally, differences in size, anatomy, histology, and biomechanics between various animal models complicate the translation to the human model. This narrative review highlights the advantages and disadvantages of the models used to study OA. It discusses the challenges of producing a more reliable OA model and proposes a direction for the development of a consensus model that reflects the natural environment of human OA.

We suggest that a human osteochondral plug-based model may overcome many of the fundamental limitations associated with animal and in-vitro models based on isolated cells. Such a model will also provide a platform for the development and testing of targeted treatment and validation of novel OA markers directly on human tissues.

### Pathways to understanding the genomic aetiology of osteoarthritis [^1111BRQ7]. Human Molecular Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis is typically diagnosed based on relevant clinical symptoms and signs, corroborated by consistent radiographic features. No robust laboratory biomarkers exist for osteoarthritis. Pharmacological therapies, such as paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, can be effective in relieving pain but are incapable of reversing cartilage damage. In the absence of a curative therapy, management strategies currently focus on interventions early in the joint degeneration process and target disease progression. Emerging regenerative therapies hold the potential to promote cartilage repair and ultimately restore the original tissue structure and function. A better understanding of the molecular processes underpinning osteoarthritis in the joint will be crucial to inform and accelerate the success of this new generation of treatments.

### Genetic risk of osteoarthritis operates during human skeletogenesis [^113VhjJa]. Human Molecular Genetics (2023). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a complex disease of the articulating joints, typically impacting individuals over the age of 45, with the risk of developing progressive disease increasing with age. OA affects the lives of over 500 million people worldwide, a figure that increased by 48% between 1990 and 2019, and which continues to rise in aging populations. Despite this, there are currently no disease-modifying OA drugs (DMOADs) available.

In a healthy joint, the articular cartilage lubricates joint surfaces and absorbs mechanical impact. In OA, this cartilaginous surface roughens and breaks down, eventually exposing the underlying bone. This leads to chronic pain, disability, and premature death from secondary comorbidities. The etiology of OA is complex and multifactorial, yet genetic variation accounts for up to 50% of the total disease risk, placing it as one of the highest single risk factors.

- **Developmental origins**: The developmental origins of OA have long been debated due to a plethora of factors, including the association of disease with abnormal joint morphology, the extent of disease heritability, and the reversion to a developmental phenotype within hypertrophic OA articular chondrocytes. The articular chondrocyte, the sole cell type in cartilage, undergoes very little proliferation once adulthood is reached, with the non-dividing cells remaining metabolically active. This raises the question of whether defects in cartilage integrity conferred by genetic variation are established during embryonic and fetal development, manifesting in later life. Such evidence would have considerable implications for understanding and potentially mitigating OA risk.

### Osteocyte-derived extracellular vesicles mediate the bone-to-cartilage crosstalk and promote osteoarthritis progression [^113DvNE8]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis is a common degenerative joint disease in which mechanical overloading disrupts subchondral bone remodeling before cartilage degeneration, with osteocytes in the subchondral bone primarily responsible for mechanosensing. However, their functional role in early osteoarthritis remains unclear. Here, we show that mechanical stress induces osteocytes in subchondral bone to secrete extracellular vesicles that accelerate cartilage metabolic dysregulation in both male and female patients as well as male mice. The miR-23b-3p in extracellular vesicles promotes cartilage catabolism and inhibits anabolism by targeting OTUD4, thereby disrupting mitophagy in chondrocytes. Inhibiting miR-23b-3p in osteocytes or chondrocytes reduces cartilage degeneration and osteoarthritis progression in male mice. Together, these findings highlight that osteocyte-derived extracellular vesicles mediate communication with chondrocytes and suggest miR-23b-3p as a potential therapeutic target for osteoarthritis.

### Dysregulation of the NUDT7-PGAM1 axis is responsible for chondrocyte death during osteoarthritis pathogenesis [^1158uVbW]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative joint disease; however, its etiopathogenesis is not completely understood. Here, we show a role for NUDT7 in OA pathogenesis. Knockdown of NUDT7 in normal human chondrocytes results in the disruption of lipid homeostasis. Moreover, Nudt7 -/- mice display significant accumulation of lipids via peroxisomal dysfunction, upregulation of IL-1β expression, and stimulation of apoptotic death of chondrocytes.

Our genome-wide analysis reveals that NUDT7 knockout affects the glycolytic pathway, and we identify Pgam1 as a significantly altered gene. Consistent with the results obtained on the suppression of NUDT7, overexpression of PGAM1 in chondrocytes induces the accumulation of lipids, upregulation of IL-1β expression, and apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, these negative actions of PGAM1 in maintaining cartilage homeostasis are reversed by the co-introduction of NUDT7. Our results suggest that NUDT7 could be a potential therapeutic target for controlling cartilage-degrading disorders.

### Obesity and osteoarthritis, more than just wear and tear: Pivotal roles for inflamed adipose tissue and dyslipidaemia in obesity-induced osteoarthritis [^113D4eMt]. Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by articular cartilage degradation, osteophyte formation, synovitis, and subchondral bone sclerosis. One of OA's main risk factors is obesity. At the time of writing, it is not fully understood how obesity results in OA. Historically, this link was ascribed to excessive joint loading as a result of increased body weight. However, the association between obesity and OA in non-weight-bearing joints suggests a more complex etiology for obesity-induced OA.

In the present review, the link between obesity and OA is discussed:

- **Historical view**: The altered joint loading leading to wear and tear of the joint is first addressed.

- **Metabolic effects**: Subsequently, the effects of disturbed lipid metabolism, low-grade inflammation, and adipokines on joint tissues are discussed and linked to OA. Taken together, inflamed adipose tissue and dyslipidaemia play pivotal roles in obesity-induced OA.

It becomes increasingly clear that the link between obesity and OA transcends excessive loading.

### Biomechanical considerations in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis of the knee [^111hCZ8L]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis is the most common joint disease and a major cause of disability, with the knee being the large joint most affected. While chronological age is the single most important risk factor for osteoarthritis, the pathogenesis of knee osteoarthritis in younger patients is predominantly related to an unfavorable biomechanical environment at the joint. This results in mechanical demand that exceeds the ability of a joint to repair and maintain itself, predisposing the articular cartilage to premature degeneration.

This review examines the available basic science, preclinical, and clinical evidence regarding several such unfavorable biomechanical conditions about the knee:

- **Malalignment**: This occurs when there is a deviation in the normal alignment of the knee joint, which places abnormal stress on the articular cartilage.

- **Loss of meniscal tissue**: The meniscus plays a key role in joint stability and stress distribution, and its loss can accelerate joint damage.

- **Cartilage defects**: Damage or defects in the cartilage increase the mechanical stress and contribute to the degeneration process.

- **Joint instability or laxity**: Instability can lead to increased wear and tear on the knee joint, exacerbating degenerative changes.

Level of evidence: IV.

### Osteocyte-derived extracellular vesicles mediate the bone-to-cartilage crosstalk and promote osteoarthritis progression [^1115TPuq]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis is a common degenerative joint disease in which mechanical overloading disrupts subchondral bone remodeling before cartilage degeneration, and the osteocytes in the subchondral bone are primarily responsible for mechanosensing. However, their functional role in early osteoarthritis is still unclear. Here, we show that mechanical stress induces osteocytes in subchondral bone to secrete extracellular vesicles that accelerate cartilage metabolic dysregulation in patients of both sexes and in male mice. The miR-23b-3p in extracellular vesicles promotes cartilage catabolism and inhibits anabolism by targeting OTUD4, disrupting mitophagy in chondrocytes. Inhibiting miR-23b-3p in osteocytes or chondrocytes reduces cartilage degeneration and osteoarthritis progression in male mice. Together, our findings highlight that osteocyte-derived extracellular vesicles mediate communication with chondrocytes and suggest miR-23b-3p as a potential therapeutic target for osteoarthritis.

### Recent developments in emerging therapeutic targets of osteoarthritis [^113VJntM]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Pathology in surgical animal models of osteoarthritis is similar to the disease progression seen in humans and provides significant insight into the mechanisms involved. This review focuses on a few candidate pathways and molecules that have shown recent promise for further understanding osteoarthritis pathophysiology and developing therapeutics. However, it is clear that the various joint tissues each play a distinct and important role in disease progression and symptom generation. With this in mind, it is important that future studies continue to address the joint as a whole in a physiological context. For these reasons, animal models will continue to be essential in ongoing osteoarthritis research.

### Hand osteoarthritis: Clinical phenotypes, molecular mechanisms and disease management [^113vba6p]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a highly prevalent condition, and the hand is the most commonly affected site. Patients with hand OA frequently report symptoms of pain, functional limitations, and frustration in undertaking everyday activities. The condition presents clinically with changes to the bone, ligaments, cartilage, and synovial tissue, which can be observed using radiography, ultrasonography, or MRI.

Hand OA is a heterogeneous disorder and is considered to be multifactorial in aetiology. This review provides an overview of the epidemiology, presentation, and burden of hand OA, including an update on hand OA imaging — covering the development of novel techniques — disease mechanisms, and management. In particular, areas for which new evidence has substantially changed the way we understand, consider, and treat hand OA are highlighted. For example, genetic studies, clinical trials, and careful prospective imaging studies from the past 5 years are beginning to provide insights into the pathogenesis of hand OA that might uncover new therapeutic targets in the disease.

### Nociceptive sensitizers are regulated in damaged joint tissues, including articular cartilage, when osteoarthritic mice display pain behavior [^115BU3if]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Pain is the most common presenting symptom of osteoarthritis (OA), but when and where pain originates in the arthritic joint is not yet clear. The disease is characterized by significant changes in several joint tissues, including the following: articular cartilage, where degradation of the tissue is seen; the bone, where remodeling occurs, resulting in subchondral bone sclerosis, osteophyte formation, and bony epiphyseal expansion; the synovium, which is subject to thickening and episodic inflammation; and the joint capsule and ligaments, which may become thickened and fibrotic. With the exception of the articular cartilage, joint tissues are highly innervated. During the disease, the cartilage itself can become aberrantly innervated.

Joint replacement surgery is successful for alleviating pain in the majority of patients with end-stage OA, indicating that peripheral drivers of pain are critical for symptomatic disease. Central processes, arising from either spinal or supraspinal pathways, play a large part in pain amplification in chronic disease, leading to chronic pain syndromes. Thus, clinical management can be extremely challenging. In a small minority of patients, chronic pain fails to abate despite joint replacement surgery.

Epidemiologic studies highlight the complexity of pain in OA. The correlation between pain and radiographic changes (osteophyte score, joint space narrowing) is modest, and it is not unusual for patients with advanced radiographic OA to have no joint symptoms. Conversely, patients may present with knee pain with little or no radiographic evidence.

### Is osteoarthritis one disease or a collection of many [^1177KYRa]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a multifaceted and heterogeneous syndrome that may be amenable to tailored treatment. There has been an increasing focus within the OA research community on identifying meaningful OA phenotypes, with potential implications for prognosis and treatment. Experimental and clinical data, combined with sophisticated statistical approaches, have been used to characterize and define phenotypes from symptomatic and structural perspectives. An improved understanding of the existing phenotypes based on underlying disease mechanisms may shed light on the distinct entities that make up the disease. This narrative review provides an updated summary of the most recent advances in this field as well as limitations from previous approaches that can be addressed in future studies.

### Genetics of osteoarthritis [^114EMEh4]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2022). Low credibility.

Comprehensive molecular genetic investigations into multifactorial human diseases have been a scientific highlight of the past decade. Such analyses have garnered insights into fundamental aspects of disease pathophysiology, identifying gene targets and biological pathways for therapeutic intervention. These genetic studies involve the genome-wide association scan (GWAS) of DNA variants, principally mapping alleles at single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in cases and controls. The use of large cohorts, often involving hundreds of thousands of individuals, and high-density SNP genotyping arrays supplemented by statistical imputation has enabled tens of thousands of DNA variants to be associated with a broad range of diseases.

Osteoarthritis (OA) has been subjected to such detailed genetic investigation, and each year new OA susceptibility risk loci are reported, along with subsequent mechanistic investigations that help to clarify how genetic risk impacts the cells and tissues of the articulating joint. In this review, we summarize the status of OA genetics, from the discovery of risk loci and their functional investigation through to epigenetics and the clinical utility of the new knowledge.

### Osteoclast-associated receptor blockade prevents articular cartilage destruction via chondrocyte apoptosis regulation [^117Chpn2]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA), primarily characterized by articular cartilage destruction, is the most common form of age-related degenerative whole-joint disease. No disease-modifying treatments for OA are currently available. Although OA is primarily characterized by cartilage destruction, our understanding of the processes controlling OA progression is poor. Here, we report the association of OA with increased levels of osteoclast-associated receptor (OSCAR), an immunoglobulin-like collagen-recognition receptor. In mice, OSCAR deletion abrogates OA manifestations, such as articular cartilage destruction, subchondral bone sclerosis, and hyaline cartilage loss. These effects are a result of decreased chondrocyte apoptosis, which is caused by the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in induced OA. Treatments with human OSCAR-Fc fusion protein attenuate OA pathogenesis caused by experimental OA. Thus, this work highlights the function of OSCAR as a catabolic regulator of OA pathogenesis, indicating that OSCAR blockade is a potential therapy for OA.

### Pathways to understanding the genomic aetiology of osteoarthritis [^114DfZYc]. Human Molecular Genetics (2017). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent musculoskeletal disease and a leading cause of disability worldwide. The impact of OA across Europe has been described as immense. OA affects 40% of individuals over the age of 70, is a major cause of pain, and is associated with an increased risk of comorbidity and death. Ten million people suffer from OA in the UK alone, with a total indirect cost to the economy of £14.8 billion per annum. The most common OA site is the knee, affecting 1 in 5 people over the age of 45. The health economic burden of OA is rising, commensurate with longevity and obesity rates. There is currently no treatment; disease management targets the main symptoms of pain and loss of function, culminating in joint replacement surgery [1.76 million per year in the EU], with variable patient-reported outcomes. Thus, there is a large unmet need for therapeutic interventions to alter the natural history of the disease. This review will outline established and emerging pathways to improving our understanding of disease aetiopathology through genetics and genomics studies.

### Accelerating functional gene discovery in osteoarthritis [^116Uu12G]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of joint destruction, pain, and disability. Joint replacement for end-stage disease remains the only treatment, leading to an escalating healthcare crisis in our obese and aging society. Osteoarthritis is a complex trait, and the 86 reported genome-wide associated loci explain only a small proportion of its heritability, which is estimated to be between 40% and 70%.

Osteoarthritis is characterized by articular cartilage damage and loss, together with structural abnormalities of subchondral bone and low-grade chronic joint inflammation. It is unknown which of these processes trigger disease or which represent secondary responses to joint destruction. It is also uncertain whether the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis reflects an abnormal response to injury involving defective stem cell recruitment and abnormal cell proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, apoptosis, and senescence.

Chondrocytes in healthy articular cartilage are resistant to terminal differentiation, whereas they revert to a developmental program following injury, in which they proliferate and undergo hypertrophic differentiation with accelerated cartilage mineralization. Osteoarthritis pathogenesis involves cross-talk between the synovium, articular cartilage, and subchondral bone, although the timing of bone remodeling relative to cartilage degradation remains uncertain. Nevertheless, increases in apoptotic and senescent chondrocytes are triggered by processes including endoplasmic reticulum stress. Senescent cells express a secretory phenotype that contributes to the disease progression.

### Cartilage biology in osteoarthritis — lessons from developmental biology [^112NX9dm]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

The cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the initiation and progression of osteoarthritis (OA), particularly cartilage degeneration in OA, are not completely understood. Increasing evidence implicates developmental processes in OA etiology and pathogenesis. Herein, we review this evidence.

We first examine subtle changes in cartilage development and the specification and formation of joints, which predispose to OA development. Second, we review the switch from an articular to a hypertrophic chondrocyte phenotype, which is thought to be part of the OA pathological process ultimately resulting in cartilage degeneration. The latest studies are summarized and we discuss the concepts emerging from these findings in cartilage biology in light of our understanding of the developmental processes involved.
