## Question

Can antibiotics or ibuprofen lower breastmilk supply

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether antibiotics or ibuprofen lower breastmilk supply and how to interpret the evidence and guidelines to answer that question. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanisms that plausibly affect lactation. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines and reviews say about ibuprofen and breastfeeding. Next, I will examine the evidence for antibiotics, distinguishing inflammatory from bacterial mastitis and considering microbiome effects. After that, I should review indirect contributors to low supply that could be conflated with medication effects. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded conclusion and counseling points with references to authoritative sources.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and the strength of evidence I should rely on. I need to ensure I'm prioritizing guidelines from the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and peer-reviewed summaries like American Family Physician, while using LactMed for drug-specific transfer and safety data, because these sources integrate pharmacokinetics, clinical outcomes, and lactation physiology rather than relying on isolated case reports or theoretical concerns [^113brBi4] [^112G4tmg].

> Now, ibuprofen. Wait, let me verify the mechanistic concern: NSAIDs can inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, and prostaglandins are involved in reproductive physiology, so could that suppress milk production? Hold on, I should verify whether this translates into clinically meaningful effects in lactation. The FDA labeling for fixed-dose ibuprofen/acetaminophen explicitly states there are no reports of effects on milk production, and ABM's analgesia protocol considers ibuprofen an ideal, moderately effective analgesic with limited transfer into milk, supporting its routine use during lactation, including for mastitis-related pain and inflammation [^113YXgPa] [^116mwvUG] [^116jffmR]. I should double-check transfer data: multiple sources report low relative infant dose for ibuprofen, consistent with minimal exposure and no signal for reduced milk supply, which aligns with clinical experience and guideline recommendations [^113YXgPa] [^1118AZum].

> But wait, what if someone cites NSAID-related ovulation effects as evidence for lactation suppression? I need to check that nuance. NSAIDs can reversibly delay ovulation via prostaglandin inhibition, which is a fertility consideration, not a lactation-suppression mechanism; this is distinct from milk synthesis regulation and should not be extrapolated to imply reduced milk supply during established lactation, so I should correct that misconception explicitly [^113YXgPa] [^116xPJPQ] [^114sEKiM].

> Next, antibiotics. Let me think about the two relevant scenarios: treating inflammatory versus bacterial mastitis, and non-mastitis antibiotic use. I should confirm that most antibiotics are compatible with breastfeeding and that the main concern is not direct suppression of milk production but rather when antibiotics are used indiscriminately for inflammatory mastitis, which can disrupt the milk microbiome and potentially worsen the inflammatory cascade, thereby indirectly affecting comfort and feeding effectiveness rather than fundamentally lowering supply through pharmacologic means [^1139ekpF] [^111guHpN] [^1118AZum].

> Hold on, I should verify guideline direction on when antibiotics are indicated. ABM 2022 advises reserving antibiotics for confirmed bacterial mastitis, using narrow-spectrum agents targeting common skin flora, and explicitly notes it is safe for infants to consume milk from the affected breast during treatment. Routine hospitalization or IV therapy is not necessary unless there is sepsis, inability to tolerate oral therapy, or resistant organisms, which underscores that antibiotic therapy per se is not a reason to interrupt breastfeeding or a proven cause of reduced supply [^116qvE7H] [^112QBDHp] [^1133TwZA]. I need to ensure I also note infant considerations: while most antibiotics are compatible, some can cause infant GI effects or rare allergic reactions, and a few agents warrant caution in specific infant populations, reinforcing the principle of using the lowest effective dose and shortest duration when antibiotics are truly indicated [^1118AZum] [^113brBi4].

> Let me consider indirect contributors to perceived "low supply" that can accompany illness and antibiotic use. Fever, pain, dehydration, sleep deprivation, and stress can transiently reduce milk removal effectiveness, and suboptimal latch or excessive pumping can worsen edema and inflammation in the mastitis spectrum, temporarily decreasing output; addressing these with NSAIDs, ice, rest, and targeted lactation support usually restores supply as the underlying issue resolves, which can be mistakenly attributed to the antibiotic rather than the disease process itself [^111guHpN] [^111c41tY] [^1138DgR3].

> I should also review the evidence base for antibiotics in mastitis. Cochrane reviews have long highlighted the limited high-quality evidence confirming clear benefit of antibiotics over conservative measures for lactational mastitis, which is why modern guidance emphasizes initial conservative management with ice and NSAIDs, reserving antibiotics for bacterial disease; this uncertainty does not imply that antibiotics suppress milk production, but it does mean we should avoid overtreatment that could disturb the milk microbiome without benefit [^114G9zxW] [^115LMj11] [^1139ekpF].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost concluded that "antibiotics never affect supply", but I should be cautious. While most antibiotics are compatible and not directly suppressive of milk synthesis, indiscriminate antibiotic exposure can alter the milk microbiome and, in the context of mastitis, may worsen inflammation if used for nonbacterial disease; moreover, maternal antibiotic exposure around delivery has been associated with changes in antimicrobial resistance gene carriage in infants, which is a broader public health and microbiome consideration rather than a direct lactation-suppression effect, so I should frame this as indirect and context-dependent rather than a class effect on supply [^115kmHWY] [^113En8V1].

> Synthesis and bottom line: I should confirm that neither ibuprofen nor appropriately selected antibiotics directly lower breastmilk supply. Ibuprofen is preferred for lactation analgesia with low infant exposure and no evidence of reduced production, and antibiotics are compatible with continued breastfeeding, with the key risk being overtreatment of inflammatory mastitis that can disrupt the milk microbiome and delay recovery, not a pharmacologic suppression of milk synthesis [^113YXgPa] [^112G4tmg] [^116qvE7H] [^113En8V1].

> Practical counseling I need to ensure I provide: use ibuprofen as needed for pain and inflammation, continue breastfeeding or milk removal to maintain supply, and reserve antibiotics for suspected bacterial mastitis after a short trial of conservative measures. If antibiotics are needed, use narrow-spectrum agents and keep breastfeeding, monitoring the infant for mild GI symptoms, while prioritizing maternal rest, hydration, and lactation support to address any transient dips in output [^116jffmR] [^116qvE7H] [^1133TwZA] [^113brBi4].

---

In sum, **most antibiotics are compatible with breastfeeding** and do not reduce milk supply [^1118AZum] [^115q8nR7], though rare infant effects (GI upset, rash) can occur; only avoid high-risk agents (e.g. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in jaundiced or G6PD-deficient infants) [^1118AZum]. Ibuprofen is **preferred for lactation pain** because it has low transfer into milk and no known effect on milk production [^113YXgPa] [^112G4tmg] [^116mwvUG]. Persistent low supply is more often due to **infrequent or ineffective milk removal** [^113GvFob] than to these medications.

## Antibiotics and breast milk supply

### General compatibility with breastfeeding

- **Most antibiotics are compatible**: penicillins, cephalosporins, and macrolides are generally safe and do not reduce milk supply [^1118AZum] [^113brBi4].
- **Low transfer into milk**: most antibiotics transfer minimally into breast milk, limiting infant exposure [^113q34Jg].
- **Rare infant effects**: occasional GI upset or rash may occur; monitor for symptoms [^1118AZum].

---

### Antibiotics associated with potential milk supply reduction

Certain antibiotics may theoretically reduce supply via **prolactin suppression** or GI effects that reduce feeding; however, **evidence is limited and inconsistent**:

| **Antibiotic class** | **Examples** | **Potential effect on milk supply** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Tetracyclines | Doxycycline, tetracycline | - Minimal transfer <br/> - Compatible with breastfeeding | Low [^114v21GM] |
| Aminoglycosides | Gentamicin, amikacin | - Minimal transfer <br/> - Compatible with breastfeeding | Low [^notfound] |
| Fluoroquinolones | Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin | - Minimal transfer <br/> - Compatible with breastfeeding | Low [^notfound] |
| Sulfonamides | Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole | Avoid in jaundiced, ill, or premature infants due to bilirubin displacement risk | Moderate [^1118AZum] |

---

### Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidance supports **reserving antibiotics for bacterial mastitis** [^1139ekpF]; they are not indicated for inflammatory mastitis, as indiscriminate use can disrupt the breast microbiome and worsen outcomes [^113En8V1]. The **choice of antibiotic** should be guided by culture results or local antibiograms, and routine hospitalization or IV therapy is not required unless clinically indicated [^112QBDHp] [^116qvE7H].

---

## Ibuprofen and breast milk supply

### Pharmacological properties relevant to breastfeeding

- **Low transfer**: ibuprofen has low milk-to-plasma ratios and minimal infant exposure [^113YXgPa] [^116mwvUG].
- **No prolactin effect**: ibuprofen does not suppress prolactin or directly affect milk production [^113YXgPa].
- **Preferred analgesic**: ibuprofen is recommended for lactation pain due to its safety and low infant exposure [^112G4tmg] [^116mwvUG].

---

### Clinical evidence regarding milk supply

Limited literature reports no adverse effects or **milk-supply reduction** with ibuprofen [^113YXgPa], and it is **commonly used** for lactation pain — including mastitis — without reducing supply [^113YXgPa].

---

## Factors influencing breast milk supply

Milk supply is primarily regulated by **demand and supply**; medications rarely cause sustained reduction when milk removal is frequent and effective. Key modifiable factors include:

- **Infrequent or ineffective milk removal**: the most common cause of low supply [^notfound].
- **Maternal stress and fatigue**: can transiently reduce supply [^notfound].
- **Medical conditions**: thyroid disorders, retained placental fragments, or hormonal imbalances [^notfound].
- **Certain medications**: pseudoephedrine, estrogen-containing contraceptives, and some antidepressants can reduce supply [^111frjpe] [^116WGdZT].

---

## Clinical recommendations and precautions

- **Use the lowest effective dose**: for the shortest duration [^112WR3yV].
- **Monitor infant**: for GI upset, rash, or behavioral changes.
- **Consult lactation support**: if supply concerns persist despite correct management [^1138DgR3].
- **Reserve antibiotics**: for confirmed bacterial infections [^1139ekpF].

---

## Conclusion

Most antibiotics are compatible with breastfeeding and do not reduce milk supply, while ibuprofen is **safe and does not affect milk production**. Persistent low supply is more often due to **infrequent or ineffective milk removal** or other modifiable factors than to these medications.

### ABM clinical protocol # 26: persistent pain with breastfeeding [^117KQ4V7]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #26 — maternal oversupply and persistent breast/nipple pain: Oversupply of milk can cause persistent breast and nipple pain. Mothers will typically complain of sharp breast pain or dull breast aching and breast tenderness when their breasts are quite full. Oversupply is very common in the first few weeks postpartum as the body adapts to the infant's milk supply needs. Milk expression should be minimized because it can lead to continued oversupply issues.

### Medication safety in breastfeeding… [^1118AZum]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

4 Amphetamines may decrease serum prolactin and are found in higher levels in breast milk and infant serum. 15, 16 Clonidine should be used with caution because it passes readily into breast milk. 4 Atomoxetine is not well studied, and safer alternatives are preferred.
4. HYPERTENSION Medications for hypertension are generally acceptable to use during lactation. Calcium channel blockers pass poorly into breast milk. 4 Second-generation anti-histamines such as loratadine are less sedating and unlikely to harm the breastfed infant because of low absorption, but they may decrease milk supply. 4 First-generation antihistamines are less favored because they cause greater reduction in milk supply and maternal and infant sedation. ANALGESICS Ibuprofen and acetaminophen are the preferred agents for pain control during lactation because of their safety when prescribed to infants and low concentration in breast milk.

4 Long-term use of naproxen is discouraged because of its long half-life and reports of bleeding, anemia, and emesis in breastfed infants. 4, 11 Etodolac, meloxicam, piroxicam, and sulindac are not recommended in breastfeeding because of limited data. 11 Topical and local anesthetics may be used safely in breastfeeding.
12. ANTIBIOTICS Many commonly prescribed antibiotics are compatible with breastfeeding. 2, 4, 26 There may be a risk of the infant experiencing an allergic reaction to the antibiotic or developing diarrhea because of changes in enteric flora. Hematochezia in infants exposed to intravenous clindamycin in breast milk has been reported. 4 Because of the risk of bilirubin displacement and kernicterus, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole should be avoided in jaundiced, ill, stressed, or premature infants.

4 Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and nitrofurantoin should not be used while breastfeeding during the first month of life or in infants with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency to prevent the risk of hemolysis. 4 Cephalosporins are a safer alternative. Candida infections and diarrhea may be more common in infants exposed to metronidazole. 4 The calcium in breast milk decreases the oral absorption of fluoroquinolones and doxycycline. Antibiotics may alter the taste of breast milk and cause the infant to decrease intake. 2.

### ABM clinical protocol # 9: use of galactogogues in initiating or augmenting maternal milk production, second revision 2018 [^113JPQVR]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #9 — use of galactogogues in lactation management advises that in the absence of evidence for low milk supply, the mother should be reassured, and when intervention is indicated, modifiable factors such as maternal anxiety and mental health issues, comfort and relaxation for the mother, frequency and effectiveness of milk removal, and any underlying medical conditions should be addressed; medication should never replace evaluation and counseling on modifiable factors. It notes there remain selected indications for the use of galactogogues, but the current data are insufficient to make any definitive recommendations; a number of high-quality studies have found domperidone to be useful in mothers of preterm infants, although there is concern about rare, but significant, adverse effects, and herbal galactogogues are problematic because of lack of regulation of preparations and insufficient evidence of efficacy and safety. Clinicians should prescribe galactogogues with appropriate caution with regard to drug-to-drug (or drug-to-herb) interactions, use an overall risk-to-benefit assessment with complete informed consent, and ensure close follow-up of both mother and infant to monitor lactation status and any adverse effects.

### Determining the exposure of maternal medicines through breastfeeding: the umbrelLACT study protocol-a contribution from the concePTION project [^112QBQ9R]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Breastfeeding is highly recommended by the WHO, more specifically exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months after birth and continued partially, in combination with complementary feeding, until 2 years of age. This is because breastfeeding has a positive impact on the development and general health of children. Breastfed children are less likely to suffer from childhood infections, at least in part due to antibodies in human milk, and have a lower risk of being overweight. According to Castro et al breastfeeding is also related to higher intelligence, with a possible increase up to seven intelligence quotient points and a reduction in child morbidity and mortality. In addition, breastfeeding is also beneficial for maternal health, for example, by reducing the risk of developing breast or ovarian carcinoma.

At least 50% of women need pharmacotherapy in the postpartum period, and this proportion has been rising due to the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and later-age pregnancies. Meanwhile, an immense information gap regarding the safety of medicines during lactation still exists today, complicating evidence-based decisions on the use and selection of medicines during breastfeeding. This often results in unnecessary cessation of breastfeeding or poor adherence to or avoidance of pharmacological treatment. Furthermore, the majority of medicines are used off-label during breastfeeding, which may put the child at risk for unknown side effects.

To assess the transfer of medicines in human milk, the relative infant dose (RID) and the milk-to-plasma (M/P) ratio are commonly used as parameters in clinical lactation studies. M/P ratios reported in the literature are often based on single time point assessments. However, as the concentration profiles in human milk and plasma vary individually over time and may not be exactly the same, the M/P ratio may differ significantly depending on the timing of sampling. Ideally, the M/P ratio should be based on the (24-hour) area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in human milk and plasma. Assuming that only the unbound and unionised medicine fraction will cross the blood–milk barrier, the M/P ratio can be calculated based on the physicochemical properties of a medicine (eg, pH partitioning, protein binding and distribution into milk lipid), for instance, using the non-clinical phase distribution model.

### Breast milk concentrations of acetaminophen and diclofenac-unexpectedly high mammary transfer of the general-purpose drug acetaminophen [^112x8CPv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Breastfeeding is a matter of nutritional concern for infants and has many advantages for both mother and infant. For the infant, it has a protective effect against infections such as upper respiratory tract infections and gastrointestinal diseases after infancy, and for the mother, the delay in the resumption of menstruation due to breastfeeding reduces the risk of breast and ovarian cancer. On the other hand, there are also drawbacks to breastfeeding. Breast milk is less effective than artificial milk in stimulating intestinal growth, and the widespread obsession with breastfeeding supremacy may induce postpartum depression. Furthermore, although breast milk has many positive effects on mother and child, the mammary transfer of drugs administered postpartum is often a concern.

The amount of a drug that is transferred into breast milk is difficult to accurately assess because of the interactive effects of drug liposolubility, molecular size, concentration in the maternal circulation, protein binding capacity, infant and maternal bioavailability, and drug half-life, but its safety is evaluated using indicators such as relative infant dose (RID) and milk-to-plasma drug concentration ratio (M/P ratio). However, all patients have individual differences, for example, abnormalities in renal or hepatic function on the part of the mother are one of the causes of high drug concentrations in breast milk, and there is a wide range of variations in the mammary transfer of drugs. For example, in cases of mastitis, the permeability between the lumen in the mammary gland and the blood is increased due to the disruption of the blood-milk barrier, the "alveolar epithelial tight junctions". Within the first 72 hours postpartum, the alveolar epithelial tight junctions loosen and the amount of drugs, immunoglobulins, maternal cells (lymphocytes, leukocytes, macrophages), and other maternal proteins that pass through the blood-milk barrier increase. This initial secretion is known as colostrum, and by the time 1 week postpartum has passed, prolactin causes the alveolar epithelial cells to enlarge and the blood-milk barrier to tighten, reducing the mother's secretion of drugs, proteins, and other substances. Thus, in addition to individual differences, the transfer of drugs between plasma and breast milk varies with the condition of the mammary gland and the timing of milk secretion.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during pregnancy and the initiation of lactation [^1168THgg]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2013). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and aspirin, which are available as "over-the counter" medications in most countries, are widely used by both pregnant and lactating women. They are popular non-opioid analgesics for the treatment of pain after vaginal and operative delivery. In addition, NSAIDs are used for tocolysis in premature labor, and low-dose aspirin has a role in the prevention of preeclampsia and recurrent miscarriage in antiphospholipid syndrome. NSAIDs and aspirin may affect fertility and increase the risk of early pregnancy loss. In the second trimester their use is considered reasonably safe, but has been associated with fetal cryptorchism. In the third trimester, NSAIDs and aspirin are usually avoided because of significant fetal risks such as renal injury, oligohydramnios, constriction of the ductus arteriosus (with potential for persistent pulmonary hypertension in the newborn), necrotizing enterocolitis, and intracranial hemorrhage. Maternal administration or ingestion of most NSAIDs results in low infant exposure via breastmilk, such that both cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors are generally considered safe, and preferable to aspirin, when breastfeeding.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of reproductive health in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases [^1171DzZr]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Medication use during breastfeeding: The benefits of breastfeeding are numerous; the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months and continued breastfeeding until 1 year. Because women with RMD may experience disease flare post partum and require treatment, it is important to balance benefits of disease control with risk of infant exposure through breast milk, and infant serum levels of drugs ingested by the mother depend on drug concentration in breast milk, quantity of breast milk ingested, and drug absorption through the infant's gastrointestinal tract.

### Antibiotics for mastitis in breastfeeding women [^114G9zxW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Mastitis can be caused by ineffective positioning of the baby at the breast or restricted feeding. Infective mastitis is commonly caused by Staphylococcus Aureus. Incidence of mastitis in breastfeeding women may reach 33%. Effective milk removal, pain medication and antibiotic therapy have been the mainstays of treatment.

Objectives

This review aims to examine the effectiveness of antibiotic therapies in relieving symptoms for breastfeeding women with mastitis with or without laboratory investigation.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (December 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1996 to 2007) and EMBASE (January 1985 to 2007). We contacted investigators and other content experts known to us for unpublished trials and scanned the reference lists of retrieved articles

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of various types of antibiotic therapies or antibiotic therapy versus alternative therapies for the treatment of mastitis were selected.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When in dispute, we consulted a third author.

Main Results

Two trials met the inclusion criteria. One small trial (n = 25) compared amoxicillin with cephradine and found no significant difference between the two antibiotics in terms of symptom relief and abscess formation. Another, older study compared breast emptying alone as "supportive therapy" versus antibiotic therapy plus supportive therapy, and no therapy. The findings of the latter study suggested faster clearance of symptoms for women using antibiotics, although the study design was problematic.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of lactational mastitis. There is an urgent need to conduct high-quality, double-blinded randomized clinical trials to determine whether antibiotics should be used in this common postpartum condition.

### Breast milk concentrations of acetaminophen and diclofenac-unexpectedly high mammary transfer of the general-purpose drug acetaminophen [^1169yzQQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

The amount of acetaminophen transferred to breast milk is 1.3 ~ 4.8% of the mother's oral dose, which is sufficiently low compared with the standard dose of 140 mg/kg for acetaminophen poisoning in children. But there have been reports of skin eruptions in newborns who drank breast milk from women taking acetaminophen and an increase in asthma in infants of nursing women who frequently took acetaminophen. In this way, short-term side effects of unknown mechanism are recognized, even if they are not poisoning, and long-term side effects are not yet well understood. In recent years, fetal exposure to acetaminophen during pregnancy has been associated with a higher probability of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum symptoms. ADHD is one of the most common neurobehavioral disorders, affecting more than 5–10% of the school-age population and is characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. ADHD is most commonly diagnosed and treated between the ages of 7 and 12. It is reported to persist into adolescence and beyond in approximately 80% of cases. The rapid increase in neurodevelopmental disorders in children, including ADHD, which has become a problem in recent years, could of course be due to societal changes, but on the other hand, we as medical professionals have a responsibility to find its cause in the field of medicine.

### Medications in the breast-feeding mother [^1161CZrc]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Prescribing medications for a breast-feeding mother requires weighing the benefits of medication use for the mother against the risk of not breast-feeding the infant or the potential risk of exposing the infant to medications. A drug that is safe for use during pregnancy may not be safe for the nursing infant. The transfer of medications into breast milk depends on a concentration gradient that allows passive diffusion of nonionized, non-protein-bound drugs. The infant's medication exposure can be limited by prescribing medications to the breast-feeding mother that are poorly absorbed orally, by avoiding breast-feeding during times of peak maternal serum drug concentration and by prescribing topical therapy when possible. Mothers of premature or otherwise compromised infants may require altered dosing to avoid drug accumulation and toxicity in these infants. The most accurate and up-to-date sources of information, including Internet resources and telephone consultations, should be used.

### ABM clinical protocol # 35: supporting breastfeeding during maternal or child hospitalization [^1113qFpU]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2021). High credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #35 — lactation support for the surgical adult patient: "Lactating mothers may undergo scheduled or emergency surgical procedures". For scheduled care, "Planned surgical procedures should include attention to maintenance of lactation", including "preoperative identification of lactating mothers; specific attention to infant feeding and/or milk expression in the preoperative holding area, judicious intraoperative fluid management and non-narcotic pain medication when feasible, and reuniting mother and infant in the recovery room when medically safe". "The lactating mother can breastfeed the infant as soon as she is awake and alert from anesthesia, without concerns once she has cleared the central nervous system". "Anesthesiologists should be familiar with the safety of anesthetic agents with breastfeeding, and use analgesics favored for lactation". For complex procedures, "the surgeon should coordinate with the patient's team to create a plan for supporting lactation and minimizing complications", and for intensive medication management "a pharmacist familiar with medication resources in lactation (e.g. LactMed, e-lactancia, InfantRisk Center) should be identified". Medication guidance notes, "Care providers should be familiar with the safety of antibiotics in breastfeeding", and "Other common perioperative drugs, such as anticoagulants, should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. For example, heparin safety is established, but newer novel anticoagulants lack clear data at this time".

### ABM clinical protocol # 9: use of galactogogues in initiating or augmenting maternal milk production, second revision 2018 [^113GvFob]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #9 — practice recommendations for low milk production emphasize initial evaluation and nonpharmacologic management: evaluate the mother for medical causes of low milk supply and treat the condition as indicated, and for many of these women, a galactogogue should not be recommended or prescribed; assess and increase the frequency and effectiveness of milk removal, use nonpharmacologic measures, and when infants are not effective or are unable to feed at the breast regularly expressing by hand and/or breast pump is necessary; ensure that the expressing technique and any breast pumps used are effective, as galactogogues will not increase the milk supply if there is infrequent or inadequate breast drainage, and ABM cannot recommend any specific galactogogue at this time.

### Unexpected drug residuals in human milk in ankara, capital of Turkey [^114RASfz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Veterinary drug residuals and anthropometric evaluations of mother-infant pairs

The BMI of the mother at delivery and on admission did not differ according to the presence of the residues of NSAID, aminoglycoside and polymyxin in her milk (Table 3). However, in multivariate analysis, compared to counterparts, maternal BMI change from birth to delivery was observed significantly lower both in cases with NSAID residuals (− 0.51 ± 0.53, − 2.07 ± 0.35 kg/m 2 respectively; p = 0.017) and in mothers with history of NSAID intake (− 0.57 ± 0.47, − 2.01 ± 0.46 kg/m 2 respectively; p = 0.038) after adjusting confounding factors (Table 5). Similarly, compared to unexposed groups, maternal history of self-use of any antibiotics after delivery decreased maternal BMI improvement after delivery after adjusting control groups (Table 6).

### Medication use during lactation: either a potential contributor to premature weaning or evidence-based support of the mother / child couplet [^116hGsdb]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

It is well established that breastfeeding improves the health of women, children, and populations. According to the 2018 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Report Card, 83% of women initiated breastfeeding, but only 58% maintained breastfeeding at the 6-month mark, and 36% continued to 12 months. Reasons for cessation of breastfeeding are multifactorial and include issues surrounding safe use of medications while breastfeeding for acute or chronic conditions. There are a wide variety of resources that clinicians may consult to help decide if medications are compatible with breastfeeding. The resources have varying data and recommendations, which can make counseling challenging for the clinician. There are some resources that are updated regularly with the most current information about drug safety in lactation, as well as call centers that can answer questions from clinicians and patients. A case scenario is presented to help illustrate the many facets of how medication use can affect breastfeeding. Very few medications are absolutely contraindicated during lactation. Involving the woman and her family in a shared decision-making approach regarding medication use may help women feel more confident in the medication recommendations given and ultimately help women achieve their breastfeeding goals.

### ABM clinical protocol # 22: guidelines for management of jaundice in the breastfeeding infant 35 weeks or more of gestation-revised 2017 [^113iQG2L]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #22 — evidence-based strategies for preventing or ameliorating jaundice in the breastfeeding infant include to initiate breastfeeding as early as possible, preferably in the first hour after birth, with the statement that in the vast majority of births, breastfeeding should be initiated in the first hour; to encourage frequent exclusive breastfeeding, noting that frequent breastfeeding (8–12 times or more in 24 hours) is crucial for establishing milk supply and that there is a positive association between the number of breastfeeds a day and lower TSB; to note that it is unnecessary to give glucose water to test the infant's ability to swallow or avoid aspiration; to use hand expression or pumping of colostrum or breast milk to provide extra milk to support intake in some at-risk infants, while randomized trials have shown that the initiation of pumping may reduce milk transfer and eventual breastfeeding duration for some populations of infants; and to optimize early management by ensuring comfortable positioning, effective latch and adequate milk transfer with a healthcare provider trained in breastfeeding management, supporting skin-to-skin contact starting immediately after birth and throughout the postpartum period as it helps with milk supply and makes mother's milk easily available, and providing education on early feeding cues.

ABM Clinical Protocol #26 — Oversupply identified by "Breast fullness, milk leakage" is managed by reducing stimulation in which patients should "Stop any overstimulation by not pumping or hand expression in lieu of breastfeeding or if breasts are overfull before feeds", consider "Block feeding is a strategy that many lactation consultants endorse, but is controversial with limited evidence. This involves feeding from one breast for a block of time, typically 3 hours. The other breast rests, allowing the fullness to provide feedback to the breast to reduce milk supply", and note that "Medication such as pseudoephedrine and sage extract have been used to reduce milk supply as has the oral contraceptive pill containing estrogen".

### Clinical lactation studies. acting on key recommendations over the last decade [^114UzkGQ]. Npj Women's Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Number of FDA post marketing requirements (PMRs) registered over time focussing on pregnancy, lactation or both.

This includes all PMRs, not only those exploring drug exposure. FDA Food and Drug Administration, PMRs post-marketing requirements.

Furthermore, it needs to be recognized that many lactation studies are being conducted as exploratory studies by academic or clinical research groups, rather than investigational pragmatic trials led by industry. According to the clinical trial website 18 lactation pharmacokinetic studies were conducted between 2010 and 2023. Currently, there are 24 ongoing studies with a focus on determining drug exposures in lactating mothers and/or breastfeeding infants.

This increased focus on lactation studies in more recent years is welcome, as these studies are needed to understand drug disposition in lactating WOCBP and their infants. For lactation, a key concern is significant secondary exposure in neonates and infants through breastfeeding following maternally administered drugs. In the case of anti-infectives, there is a risk of exposure to concentrations sufficient to risk selection for drug resistance should the infant acquire the infection being treated in the mother. The "dose" consumed through breastfeeding is likely to be much lower than the oral dose proposed for drugs administered to neonates (birth to 28 days) and infants (28 days to 23 months), although non dose-dependent adverse drug reactions could still potentially occur, and in the case of anti-infectives, the below-target concentration in the breastfed infant may be sufficient to select for resistant organisms. In May 2023, the FDA paediatric drug development draft guidance indicated that at least one clinical investigation in "paediatric age groups (including neonates in appropriate cases) in which a drug is anticipated to be used" should be conducted. Industry is required to submit an initial paediatric study plan (iPSP) during early clinical development to ensure that paediatric subjects are considered early in the program. These requirements have also been adopted by the recent ICH E11a guideline. The use of modelling and simulation to support dose recommendations in paediatrics is advocated. Frequently, lactation studies focus on maternal pharmacokinetics and breastmilk transfer. However, the breastfed infant remains neglected relative to infants requiring direct treatment with therapeutics. Understanding the quantitative fraction of the dose transferred through breast milk to infants to assess any potential risks or benefits to them as a result of this secondary exposure is important to evaluate ideally during drug development or late phase studies.

### Effect of prenatal antibiotics on breast milk and neonatal IgA and microbiome: a case-control translational study protocol [^112v7EdH]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Early life is a key period for the development of future health. As previously shown by others, perinatal perturbations to the physiological interaction between the new assembling microbiota and the developing neonatal immune system can have devastating short- and long-term consequences. The administration of ABX to neonates is associated with an increased risk for death, NEC, antibiotic resistance, and later obesity. However, ABX are administered to a minority of neonates, especially those born prematurely. Conversely, at least 1 every 4 women receive ABX during pregnancy, but the effects of these therapies on breast milk immune function and on the development of neonatal mucosal immune system, in particular on IgA-producing plasma cells of the mammary gland (in treated women) and of the intestinal mucosa (in breastfed neonates), remain largely unknown. Published research on the effects of prenatal antibiotics on newborn health has been mainly focused on the vertical transmission of microbiota from the mother to her offspring, and how alterations of this process affect neonatal outcomes. Little is known about negative consequences of prenatal antibiotics on the pool of maternal antibodies, mainly IgA, transferred to the infant, and on how these together with an altered inherited microbiota shape the maturation and function of neonatal mucosal IgA-producing plasma cells themselves. On a murine model, we have recently demonstrated that pups born to antibiotic-treated mothers have reduced fecal SIgA and IgA-coated bacteria, making them more susceptible to bacterial translocation from the gut and that a "low breast milk IgA phenotype" has long-lasting negative effect on IgA-producing plasma cells of the neonatal gut. Thus, maternal breast milk IgA and microbiota can shape the later function of small intestine IgA-producing plasma cells themselves. In humans, Gopalakrishna et al. have shown that maternally-derived IgA is key for the protection of preterm neonates against NEC, coating bacterial species of the Enterobacteriaceae family that are associated with the occurrence of NEC. Finally, a preliminary report (not peer-reviewed yet) on two cohorts of women who delivered prematurely and their neonates shows lower concentrations of breast milk IgA in a small sample of women who received antibiotics before delivery. None of these cohorts was followed up longitudinally throughout the first year of life.

### Diclofenac epolamine (Flector) [^111ajUbi]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Data from published literature reports with oral preparations of diclofenac indicate the presence of small amounts of diclofenac in human milk (see Data). There are no data on the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for FLECTOR and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the FLECTOR or from the underlying maternal condition.

Data

One woman treated orally with a diclofenac salt, 150 mg/day, had a milk diclofenac level of 100 mcg/L, equivalent to an infant dose of about 0.03 mg/kg/day. Diclofenac was not detectable in breast milk in 12 women using diclofenac (after either 100 mg/day orally for 7 days or a single 50 mg intramuscular dose administered in the immediate postpartum period). The relative bioavailability for FLECTOR is < 1% of a single 50 mg diclofenac tablet.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility

Females

Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including FLECTOR may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin-mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including FLECTOR, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of FLECTOR have been established in pediatric patients 6 years and older based on evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies with FLECTOR in adults, as well as an open-label study in pediatric patients 6 years and older. The pediatric study enrolled 104 patients, 6 years of age and older with minor soft tissue injuries. One FLECTOR was applied to the injury site twice daily for a maximum of 14 days or until treatment was no longer required for pain management, whichever occurred first. Based on the available data from the pediatric study, the safety profile of FLECTOR topical system in pediatric patients is similar to that in adults. The safety and effectiveness of FLECTOR has not been investigated in pediatric patients less than 6 years old [see Clinical Trials Experience (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Breastfeeding in women with rheumatic diseases [^117XsEh6]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Infant health, coupled with maternal stress of having and caring for a baby, is also an important realm of influencers in the breastfeeding decision. Although other studies show that the breastfeeding initiation rate was comparable between mothers with preterm infants and those with full term infants, continuing breast feeding in the following weeks was higher for term infants. Mothers of preterm infants often fear about their ability to breastfeed considering vulnerable health of their baby. It is important to recognise the difficulty of breast feeding an infant in the hospital for a prolonged period and overly emphasising breast feeding can be perceived as insensitive to an already-stressed new mother. This subset of women experiences the challenges of pumping milk, limited milk supply due to exclusively pumping and the stress of having an ill infant. Additionally, her own health may preclude her from pumping enough milk or she might be administered medications that are either not compatible with breastfeeding or limit her milk supply. One infant in this study received donor milk, highlighting this new option.

Key limitations in this study include the variation in the number of weeks after gestation postpartum visits occurred, that not all women in the entire Duke Autoimmunity in Pregnancy cohort were seen postpartum and that we do not have a control group of healthy pregnant women. We additionally lack data on the long-term health of the infants, so we cannot speculate about the safety of breast feeding on these medications. The levels of medications within breastmilk were not collected in this study. A final limitation is that although we have data on disease activity at the postpartum visits, we do not have longer term data to associate breast feeding with changes in disease activity.

In our study, infant health, as assessed by preterm delivery, was an important predictor of actual breast feeding, echoing prior research. In our cohort, the vast majority of women were on lactation-compatible medications; nonetheless, among women with rheumatic disease, actual and perceived risks of medication impacted a woman's breastfeeding choice. This adds to previously defined determinants for breast feeding including cultural expectations, socioeconomic factors and the mother's capability and feasibility as key predictors of breast feeding. We propose expanding the current breastfeeding determinant framework to include these aspects (figure 1). Finally, SLE diagnosis and lower educational level, the latter modified by race, also contributed to lower breastfeeding rates. Future interventions may increase breast feeding by directly addressing women's concerns about breast feeding while taking antirheumatic medications.

### Disrupting and restoring protection: maternal antibiotic exposure and neonatal IgA transfer via breastfeeding [^114AZsic]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

A Commentary on "Effect of prenatal antibiotics on breast milk and neonatal IgA and microbiome: a case-control translational study protocol"

Breast milk (BM) is a highly dynamic, bioactive fluid that provides continuous transfer of maternal microbiota and other compounds, such as human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), secretory immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, and IgM), leukocytes, antibacterial factors, microRNA, and stem cells. – These compounds indirectly influence microbial colonisation of the infant and contribute to the maturation of the mucosal immune system and systemic immunity.

IgA is the most abundantly produced antibody isotype in humans playing a critical role in mucosal immunity and homeostasis and supports host-microbiome mutualism. The impact of secretory IgA in establishing beneficial microbiota and influencing microbial diversity is significant, with initial exposures via BM and later by endogenous production. Breastfeeding has been linked to reduced infant infection and the risk of chronic disease and allergy in later life, allowing the infant to develop tolerance to antigens. Such activity may be mediated through a transitory supply of the compounds mentioned above, even during the complementary feeding period. These factors, alongside perinatal seeding with maternal microbes, may provide a trajectory for the vertical transmission of protective maternal immunological traits. In mice, longer-lasting immunological adaptations to breastfeeding, mediated through IgA-coated bacteria, have been demonstrated.

### Effect of prenatal antibiotics on breast milk and neonatal IgA and microbiome: a case-control translational study protocol [^114FVzoq]. Pediatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

At the mucosal sites of human body, the relationship between the microbiota and the immune system is mutual: the abundance and diversity of microbiome can affect the function of immune system, while the components of the mucosal immune system, such as secretory IgAs (sIgA), can in turn shape the microbiota composition. – Indeed, it is known that humans deficient in IgA have a unique intestinal microbiota characterized by the expanded of Enterobacteriaceae, akin to IgA-deficient murine strains where Enterobacteriaceae and segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) are predominant. In early life, breast milk microbiota and breast milk immune components, such as lactoferrin and sIgA excreted by the mammary gland plasma cells, play key roles in shaping the assembly of neonatal intestinal microbiota and contribute to the passive protection of neonates against bacterial translocation from the gut.– The positive effects of breast milk on infants' health might not be limited to the gut health or to the breastfeeding period: a growing body of evidence reveals that breastfeeding probably has a positive influence on neurodevelopmental long-term outcomes compared to formula feeding in both term-, and preterm-born children, and on the body composition and growth of children even beyond the breastfeeding window. These effects might be largely contributed by the unique intestinal microbiota induced by breastfeeding, and by the immune components of breast milk themselves.

### Aripiprazole oral (aripiprazole) [^111VACL1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Aripiprazole is present in human breast milk. Based on published case reports and pharmacovigilance reports, aripiprazole exposure during pregnancy and/or the postpartum period can lead to variable effects on milk supply in the post-partum period, including clinically relevant decreases in milk supply which may be reversible with discontinuation of the drug. There are also reports of aripiprazole exposure during pregnancy and no maternal milk supply in the post-partum period. Effects on milk supply are likely mediated through decreases in prolactin levels, which have been observed [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for aripiprazole, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from aripiprazole, or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Monitor infants exposed to aripiprazole through breastmilk for dehydration and lack of appropriate weight gain.

ABM Clinical Protocol #9 — potential indications for galactagogues explains that galactagogues have commonly been used to increase low or perceived low milk supply, with low supply often related to suboptimal milk removal due to infant drainage problems, inappropriate breastfeeding management, maternal or infant illness and hospitalization, and regular mother–infant separation such as work or school. It notes frequent use in the neonatal intensive care setting for mothers with preterm infants to stimulate initial secretory activation or augment declining milk secretion, and describes additional contexts including inducing lactation without pregnancy with the current child, relactation after weaning, and use in transgender women. It reports that many breastfeeding medicine specialists and lactation consultants have recommended various drugs and herbs when other nonpharmacological measures have not increased milk volume, while cautioning that some providers may inappropriately recommend galactogogues before emphasizing frequent and effective milk drainage at regular intervals or evaluating other medical factors.

### Prescription medication use | Breastfeeding special circumstances… [^113brBi4]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know Although many medications pass into breast milk, most have little or no effect on milk supply or infant well-being. A few medications should be avoided while breastfeeding. Mothers should talk with their health care provider about medications or supplements they take and medications to avoid. Prescription medications while breastfeeding It is usually safe for mothers to use prescription medications while breastfeeding. A 2013 clinical report by the American Academy of Pediatrics indicates that most medications and immunizations are safe to use while breastfeeding. According to the AAP, health care providers should weigh the risks and benefits when prescribing medications to breastfeeding mothers. Consider the following:

- Need for the drug by the mother.
- Potential effects of the drug on milk production.
- Amount of the drug excreted into human milk.
- Extent of oral absorption by the breastfeeding infant.
- Possible adverse effects on the breastfeeding infant.
- Age of the infant.
- Proportion of feedings that are breast milk. More information The U. S. National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health maintains LactMed®. LactMed® is a database of information on drugs and other chemicals to which breastfeeding mothers may be exposed. LactMed® includes information on the levels of such substances in breast milk and infant blood and the possible adverse effects in the nursing infant. The database also provides alternatives to those drugs where appropriate. All data come from scientific literature and are referenced. A peer review panel reviews the data for scientific validity and whether it is the most current information.

Risk Summary

No studies have been conducted with the use of ibuprofen and famotidine tablet in lactating women. Limited data from published literature report famotidine is present in human milk in low amounts. Published literature also reports the presence of ibuprofen in human milk in low amounts. No information is available on the effects of famotidine or ibuprofen on milk production or on a breastfed infant. Famotidine is present in the milk of lactating rats (see Data). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ibuprofen and famotidine tablet and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ibuprofen and famotidine tablet or from the underlying maternal condition.

### Enhancing breast milk production with domperidone in mothers of preterm neonates (EMPOWER trial) [^116xhnZN]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale for phase II trial

Mothers of preterm infants are at a higher risk of a decline in milk production. It has been recommended that they should be evaluated no later than two weeks postpartum to determine what intervention may be required to assist them in augmenting and maintaining an adequate supply of milk. Although other measures can and should be considered, the use of a galactogogue often becomes the measure of choice, particularly when the other techniques are unsuccessful. The limited body of research on domperidone suggests that it has potential as a galactogogue in mothers of preterm infants; this has led to widespread use of this medication. However, there is a paucity of research to best guide clinicians as to the optimal dose, timing of administration and duration of treatment and to reaffirm safety. EMPOWER was initiated to firmly establish the safety of domperidone for mothers of preterm infants but also guide clinicians regarding initiation, timing and duration of treatment.

### Safety profile of the most ordered medications for breastfeeding patients in the emergency department [^116Znq25]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Emergency Medicine (EM) physicians routinely treat breastfeeding patients. Physicians frequently recommend pumping and dumping milk for perceived safety risks. We hypothesized that the majority of the most commonly ordered medications in the emergency department (ED) are safe for breastfeeding patients. Accordingly, we performed a comprehensive safety analysis of the commonly ordered medications and provided an algorithm for EM physicians to utilize when treating breastfeeding patient in the ED.

Methods

We investigated the 90 most administered medications to female patients between the ages of 15 to 50 for common ED chief complaints at a tertiary care academic medical center from January 2018 to December 2022. A total of 145,960 doses were analyzed. We subsequently searched LactMed®, InfantRisk Application, and Pubmed® for all safety information on these medications and divided them by categories. Ultimately, we proposed a treatment algorithm for breastfeeding patients in the ED.

Results

Analgesics were the most commonly ordered medications in the ED, and importantly analgesics ranging from ibuprofen to morphine are safe in limited doses in the ED setting. Antibiotics and antifungals pose limited restrictions. All systems-based medications have a variety of safe options available. Lastly, supplements and electrolytes are safe.

Conclusion

The majority of medications utilized in the acute setting are compatible with breastfeeding. There should be limited circumstances to advise pumping and dumping in the ED.

### Breast milk concentrations of acetaminophen and diclofenac-unexpectedly high mammary transfer of the general-purpose drug acetaminophen [^113jDqsV]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Compared to acetaminophen, which transfers through the placenta during pregnancy, the effect of acetaminophen due to breastfeeding is considered low due to bioavailability. However, we do not believe that the effects of acetaminophen in breast milk on the child should be underestimated, just as the careless administration of acetaminophen to the mother during pregnancy, which is suspected to be associated with the risk of ADHD, should be avoided. The data that assure the safety of acetaminophen and diclofenac sodium used postpartum for breastfeeding have not been updated since the 1980s. This study shows that acetaminophen has a very good breast milk transfer. This does not necessarily mean that acetaminophen should be avoided during lactation, but accurate information should be provided to pregnant women.

This study has several limitations. First, we did not obtain a RID, a common measure of breastfeeding safety. We did not calculate RID because of the difficulty of measuring infant feeding volume, which is necessary when calculating RID, and the issue with the reliability of estimating infant feeding volume using infant weight change as an indicator. Second, the data used to determine the M/P ratio from the AUC were obtained in a cross-sectional manner, and it is preferable to use data obtained repeatedly from a single subject. However, we did not choose a highly invasive method and prioritized the quality of life of the subjects. Third, the sample size was small, albeit large compared to the scale of previous studies. Systematic studies of larger populations are needed in the future.

### Medications in the breast-feeding mother | AAFP… [^114v21GM]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Specific Conditions ALLERGIC RHINITIS Pseudoephedrine is excreted in breast milk in small amounts. According to the AAP, its use is compatible with breastfeeding although it may cause decreased milk production. 6, 9 Beta blockers vary widely in the amount excreted into breast milk. Propranolol, metoprolol and labetalol are excreted in small quantities and are compatible with breastfeeding even in compromised infants. Atenolol, nadolol and sotalol are excreted in higher amounts, which can lead to hypotension, bradycardia and tachypnea in the infant.
9. |Case Western Reserve University | Sustained-release nifedipine and verapamil are excreted into breast milk in amounts that are less than the therapeutic dosage for children.

Although diltiazem is rated compatible with breast-feeding by the AAP, the levels found in breast milk are higher than the levels for other calcium channel blockers, so safer alternatives are preferred. The alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, such as acarbose, have low bioavailability, large molecular size and water solubility, so they are unlikely to be excreted into breast milk in clinically significant amounts.
11. Specific Categories of Medications ANTIBIOTICS Penicillins and cephalosporins, which are excreted in milk in trace amounts, are compatible with breast-feeding. 6 A remote possibility exists that the child will experience an allergic reaction to the antibiotic or develop diarrhea caused by changes in gut flora. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is compatible with breast-feeding, 6 but its use should be avoided when nursing infants are younger than two months because of its potential for causing increased bilirubin levels.
3.

Tetracycline is excreted in small amounts in breast milk, but the calcium in breast milk limits its absorption. Although tetracycline is compatible with breast-feeding, other antibiotics are preferred, especially for long-term use.

### Hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen [^114SErNW]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Nursing Mothers

Risk Summary

Hydrocodone is present in human milk. A published lactation study reports variable concentrations of hydrocodone and hydromorphone (an active metabolite) in breast milk with administration of immediate-release hydrocodone to nursing mothers in the early post-partum period. This lactation study did not assess breastfed infants for potential adverse drug reactions.

Limited published literature reports that, following oral administration, ibuprofen is present in human milk at relative infant doses of 0.06% to 0.6% of the maternal weight-adjusted daily dose.

Lactation studies have not been conducted with Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Ibuprofen Tablets, and no information is available on the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets or from the underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Monitor infants exposed to hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets through breast milk for excess sedation and respiratory depression. Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of hydrocodone is stopped, or when breastfeeding is stopped

Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and Ibuprofen tablets in pediatric patients below the age of 16 have not been established.

### Unexpected drug residuals in human milk in ankara, capital of Turkey [^114WuBTE]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our study, although it was not used by the mothers themselves, nearly all mother's milk samples contained some residuals from medicines used in the area of livestock ​​fattening. Only a minority of mothers milk (n = 4) had no drug residues. This is the second article showing the residues of veterinary drugs in human milk.

Remnants of NSAID were found in the milk of 27 of 90 mothers included in our study in Ankara, all containing tolfenamic acid. Tolfenamic acid is for the management of both acute and chronic pain in animals and indicated a long half-life in sheep. Previous studies didn't detect any remnants of tolfenamic acid in 83 studied human milk samples in Eskişehir. However, one or two of samples contained chlormadione, metamizole and meloxicam in both the Ankara and Eskişehir studies.

Most of the drug residues in our study in Ankara were found to be quinolone and beta-lactam antibiotics in our study in Ankara. The Eskişehir study revealed 85.5% of breast milk with beta-lactam residues, however, a lower detection rate for quinolone residues (14.5%). Of the human's milk in our study, 31.1% aminoglycoside residues and 3.3% polymyxin residues were found and no residues in the assays of tetracycline, polypeptide and growth promotor drugs were detected in our study. The Eskişehir study revealed 4.8% polymyxin, and only 2.4% aminoglycoside (tobramycin). This might be explained by different contamination of consumed foods in different cities. A minority of samples had amphenicol, sulphonamide and corticosteroid residues in both cities.

### British Society for Rheumatology guideline on prescribing drugs in pregnancy and breastfeeding: comorbidity medications used in rheumatology practice [^114iZkoU]. Rheumatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives of guideline

To update the previous BSR guidelines on prescribing in pregnancy in rheumatic disease for the following drug categories: pain management; NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin (LDA); anticoagulants; colchicine; dapsone; bisphosphonates; anti-hypertensives; and pulmonary vasodilators. This revised guideline was produced by consensus review of current evidence to answer specific questions in relation to each drug as follows. Should it be stopped pre-conception? Is it compatible with pregnancy? Is it compatible with breastmilk exposure? Where possible, recommendations are made regarding compatibility with paternal exposure.

Target audience

The primary audience consists of health professionals in the UK directly involved in managing patients with rheumatic disease who are (or are planning to become) pregnant and/or breastfeeding, men planning to conceive, and patients who have unintentionally conceived while taking these medications. This audience includes rheumatologists, rheumatology nurses/allied health professionals, rheumatology speciality trainees and pharmacists, as well as the patients themselves. The guideline will also be useful to obstetricians, obstetric physicians, renal physicians, dermatologists and general practitioners who may prescribe these medications to patients in pregnancy.

This guideline uses the terms 'woman', 'maternal' or 'mother' throughout. These should be taken to include people who do not identify as women but are pregnant or have given birth. Where the term 'breastfeeding' is used in this guideline it also refers to infant breastmilk exposure via other methods (e.g. expressed breastmilk, administered via a bottle).

The areas the guideline does not cover

This guideline does not cover the management of infertility or acute pain relief during labour, hence morphine was excluded. Other drug categories: antimalarials; corticosteroids; disease modifying anti-rheumatic and immunosuppressive therapies; and biologic drugs are considered in another guideline. All recommendations in this guideline were formulated by the working group on the basis of published evidence at the time of the systematic literature search, and do not necessarily refer to licensing information or Summary of Product Characteristics for individual medications.

Stakeholder involvement

This guideline was commissioned by the BSR Standards, Audit and Guidelines Working Group. A Guideline Working group (GWG) was created, consisting of a chair (I.G.), alongside representatives from relevant stakeholders (Table 1). In accordance with BSR policy, all members of the GWG made declarations of interest, available on the BSR website.

### Medication safety in breastfeeding [^112G4tmg]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Breastfeeding is universally recognized as the preferred method of infant nutrition, but is sometimes abbreviated because of fear of harm to the infant from maternal medication. The amount of medication that enters breast milk varies based on the maternal serum concentration and the pharmacologic properties of the medication. When prescribing medications for a breastfeeding patient, those with the lowest risk to the infant should be selected, and dosing should be before the infant's longest sleep interval. Prescribers should use current, accurate resources. LactMed is a convenient, government-sponsored, authoritative resource that lists safety information for many medications and is available free online. When mental health conditions occur during lactation, priority should be given to effectively treating the mother, often with medications that were effective during pregnancy. Most antidepressants are compatible with breastfeeding. Stimulant medications may decrease milk supply. Insulin, metformin, and second-generation sulfonylureas are generally preferred to treat diabetes mellitus during breastfeeding, but newer agents require caution because they have not been studied in lactation. Inhaled and nasal treatments for asthma and allergic rhinitis are unlikely to affect breastfed infants. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen are preferred analgesics during lactation. Maternal opioid use can cause infant sedation. Herbal supplements are concerning for risk of impurities and lack of study of effects on breastfed infants. Nonhormonal and progestin-only contraceptives are preferred over combination oral contraceptives. Contrast for computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging is not concerning during lactation, but use of radiopharmaceuticals, such as iodine 131, can accumulate in the lactating breast and increase risk to the infant.

### Can breastfeeding protect against antimicrobial resistance? [^111suD2j]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Breastfeeding has long been recognized for its beneficial impacts on newborn health, including provision of maternal immune cells and antibodies to protect against infection and decreased risk of exposure to diarrheal pathogens from non-breastmilk food-sources. However, to date, few studies have examined how early breastfeeding practices and breastmilk constituents could specifically mitigate young children's colonization with AMR bacteria and ARGs. In general, breastfed children experience fewer diarrhea-related hospitalizations and may consume fewer antibiotics, which helps to prevent exposure to, colonization with, and selection for AMR pathogens and their ARGs. In addition, early and exclusive breastfeeding is increasingly recognized as an integral step in the development of healthy infant microbiomes. While the developing infant gut microbiome is shaped by transmission from multiple maternal body sites, human milk induces intestinal tolerance to the commensal microbiome through the simultaneous provision of nutrition for the infant and the bacteria themselves. Furthermore, human milk contains maternal immune effectors (e.g. antibodies, immune cells, and antimicrobial peptides) that enhance pathogen exclusion and elimination, and food and microbial antigens that promote infant immune development. Healthy microbiomes provide benefits into adulthood and may also be better able to resist colonization with pathogens, including AMR pathogens, a phenomenon known as "colonization resistance". However, the potential links between specific breastfeeding practices or human milk components and children's reduced susceptibility to colonization or infection with AMR bacteria have not been comprehensively explored.

Here, we argue that breastfeeding may be an important strategy for combatting the global antimicrobial resistance crisis. We begin by reviewing how early breastfeeding, exclusivity of breastfeeding, and components of human milk could provide protection against the establishment, proliferation, and/or selection of enteric pathogens in general and AMR bacteria and ARGs, in particular. We describe the findings of recent observational studies and intervention trials that have explored such associations. Finally, we comment on how escalating antimicrobial resistance and changing breastfeeding trends in LMICs make these settings particularly important for exploring breastfeeding as a way to mitigate antimicrobial resistance. Given the scale and scope of the impending antimicrobial resistance crisis, identifying scalable, cost-effective behavioral or nutritional interventions that could decrease children's susceptibility to colonization by enteric AMR pathogens and ARGs will be critical to protecting their health.

### Medications in pregnancy and lactation [^112a3bdK]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Lack of information and misinformation often lead to physicians advising mothers to discontinue breastfeeding because of medication use. Also, many mothers do not adhere to their prescriptions or quit breastfeeding because of medication use. Although in both cases this cessation of breastfeeding is probably based on concern for the infant's safety, the physician may also be influenced by expediency and fear of litigation. The safest course for physicians who are treating nursing mothers is to consult reliable sources before advising discontinuation of breastfeeding. Overwhelming evidence has shown that breastfeeding is the most healthful form of nutrition for babies and should therefore be encouraged by physicians. Physicians should take the following approach to maximize safe maternal medication use for both the mother and the breastfed infant: 1. Determine if medication is necessary. 2. Choose the safest drug available, that is, one that; is safe when administered directly to infants, has a low milk:plasma ratio, has a short half-life, has a high molecular weight, has high protein binding in maternal serum, is ionized in maternal plasma, is less lipophilic. 3. Consultation with the infant's pediatrician is encouraged. 4. Advise the mother to take the medication just after she has breastfed the infant or just before the infant's longest sleep period. 5. If there is a possibility that a drug may risk the health of the infant, arrange for the monitoring of serum drug levels in the infant. Emergency physicians are often faced with the daunting task of treating a large variety of high-acuity patients, including patients who happen to be pregnant or nursing mothers. Priority, of course, needs to be given to life-saving treatment. When physicians are treating pregnant or breastfeeding patients, they need to use reliable resources to evaluate the risks and benefits of the medication for the mother and the infant. Most medications should have no effect on milk supply or on infant well-being. In most cases, treatment plans for patients should include encouragement from the emergency physician that he or she has researched the chosen medicine and that breastfeeding may safely continue.

### Medications in the breast-feeding mother… [^111sHwRE]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Specific Conditions ALLERGIC RHINITIS Pseudoephedrine is excreted in breast milk in small amounts. According to the AAP, its use is compatible with breastfeeding although it may cause decreased milk production. 6, 9 Beta blockers vary widely in the amount excreted into breast milk. Propranolol, metoprolol and labetalol are excreted in small quantities and are compatible with breastfeeding even in compromised infants. Atenolol, nadolol and sotalol are excreted in higher amounts, which can lead to hypotension, bradycardia and tachypnea in the infant.
9. |Case Western Reserve University | Sustained-release nifedipine and verapamil are excreted into breast milk in amounts that are less than the therapeutic dosage for children.

Although diltiazem is rated compatible with breast-feeding by the AAP, the levels found in breast milk are higher than the levels for other calcium channel blockers, so safer alternatives are preferred. DIABETES Insulin is not excreted into breast milk and is considered safe for use during breast-feeding. Tetracycline is excreted in small amounts in breast milk, but the calcium in breast milk limits its absorption. Although tetracycline is compatible with breast-feeding, other antibiotics are preferred, especially for long-term use. ANALGESICS Of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ibuprofen is the preferred choice because it has poor transfer into milk and has been well-studied in children. Long half-life NSAIDs such as naproxen, sulindac and piroxicam can accumulate in the infant with prolonged use.

CONTRACEPTIVE AGENTS Hormones contained in combination oral contraceptive pills are not harmful to infants but, because estrogen diminishes the maternal milk supply, these products should be avoided in breast-feeding mothers whenever possible, especially during the first two months of breast-feeding. Progestin-only contraceptives are preferable, although these also may decrease milk supply.

### Supporting lactation in otolaryngology patients through medication optimization, radiology considerations, and more: a literature review [^1124oV6k]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Importance

The benefits of breastfeeding are well established, with the American Academy of Pediatrics and Canadian guidelines recommending exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life. However, maternal hospitalization, illness, medication use, and poor support can result in early termination of breastfeeding. Caring for breastfeeding patients in otolaryngology is a challenge because of the lack of literature regarding otolaryngology-specific medication safety, patient concerns, and inadequate education among otolaryngologists. This review highlights recent literature regarding lactation in otolaryngology patients, including medication, radiologic imaging, perioperative considerations, and subspecialty-specific considerations for lactating patients.

Observations

The majority of common medications used in general otolaryngology are safe for breastfeeding patients, including antihistamines, mucolytics, antitussives, antifungals, and decongestants. Certain analgesics and anti-inflammatories, such as tramadol, are not preferred in breastfeeding individuals. Some subspeciality-specific medications such as biologics (dupilumab) and methotrexate should be avoided. Lactating patients require special perioperative attention to ensure that optimal patient care is provided, such as managing supply, considering length of surgery, managing postoperative pain, and determining the safe amount of time until an infant can be fed.

Conclusions and Relevance

Most medications can be safely used with lactating patients. If physicians are unsure about a medication's safety, they should consult appropriate resources prior to recommending breastfeeding cessation or to discard pumped milk.

### Xenobiotics and breastfeeding [^111nhaVv]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Breastfeeding provides important benefits to mothers and infants and should be encouraged strongly as the optimal feeding choice for most infants. In assessing the effects of maternal medication on breastfeeding, clinicians must weigh the many benefits of breastfeeding for mothers and infants against the risk for exposing infants to a drug as it is present in breast milk. With regard to most medications, continued breastfeeding despite drug exposure is advantageous to mothers and infants.

### Can breastfeeding protect against antimicrobial resistance? [^111b8JBa]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Exploring breastfeeding as a strategy to combat antimicrobial resistance

The potential benefits outlined here suggest that breastfeeding should be actively explored as a scalable, cost-effective strategy to address antimicrobial resistance, in addition to the many other health benefits that breastfeeding confers. In high-income countries, where less than half of newborns receive any human milk at 6 months, improving optimal breastfeeding practices could reduce early-life antibiotic use and improve gut colonization resistance against AMR pathogens, which are becoming more common in the community. If breastfeeding or human milk constituents are shown to be protective against colonization or infection with AMR bacteria, this would be one of many important reasons to accelerate efforts to promote breastfeeding at the policy level.

Breastfeeding may be an especially important strategy to explore in LMICs. Due to a higher prevalence of bacterial disease, LMICs are expected to be disproportionately burdened by the antimicrobial resistance crisis. Although absolute antibiotic use has historically been higher in high-income settings due to healthcare access, antibiotic consumption is increasing in LMICs and appropriate targeting of antibiotics is limited by widespread informal antibiotic use and restricted resources for identifying, treating, and preventing AMR infections. By 2050, up to 90% of AMR-related mortality is predicted to occur in countries in Asia and Africa, most of which are low- or middle-income. Although systematic investigations are sparse, several studies of healthy children in LMICs report colonization with enteric multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria at rates that far exceed what is observed in the USA and Europe. For example, 82% of 1–2-year-old children in Bangladesh were recently reported to be colonized with third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, compared to 4.5% of similarly aged children in the USA and ~ 14% in Switzerland. Household members' hands, household soil, drinking water, flies, and food have all previously been implicated as sources of both human- and animal-origin fecal bacteria.

### Medications for increasing milk supply in mothers expressing breastmilk for their preterm hospitalised infants [^113xchxz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Breastmilk remains the optimal form of enteral nutrition for term and preterm infants until up to six months postnatal age. Mothers of preterm infants who have not established suck feeds must express their breastmilk and often have difficulty in maintaining sufficient volume for their infants' needs (Donath 2008). In preterm infants, donor breastmilk reduced the occurrence of necrotising enterocolitis, when compared with formula feeds (McGuire 2003). Also, case-control studies have suggested that breastmilk is associated with an improvement in feeding tolerance, a reduction in significant gastrointestinal infective events (Beeby 1992) and a reduction in late-onset sepsis (Schanler 1999) when compared with formula feeds in preterm hospitalised infants.

Objectives

To assess the effect of medication given for at least seven days to mothers of preterm infants whose breastmilk is insufficient for their infants' needs on the outcomes of expressed milk volume and duration of breastfeeding.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 December 2011).

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of breastmilk-augmenting medications (compared with placebo or with other augmenting medications) in mothers with preterm hospitalised infants whose breastmilk volumes failed to meet their infants' requirements. We did not include trials with a cluster-randomised or cross-over design.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. Any differences were resolved by consensus. Data were checked for accuracy.

Main Results

Two trials (involving 59 mothers) that examined the use of domperidone in a total of 59 mother-infant pairs met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of these trials showed a modest increase in expressed breastmilk (EBM) of 99.49 mL/day (95% confidence intervals -1.94 to 200.92; random-effects, T² 3511.62, I² 63%) in mothers given domperidone. Both trials gave the same dose of domperidone (10 mg three times per day) with a duration of seven days in the smaller trial and 14 days in the larger. Neither trial showed significant improvements in longer-term outcomes of breastfeeding in a preterm population and no adverse effects were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Two studies with a total of 59 mothers suggest modest improvements in short-term EBM volumes when a medication is used after insufficient EBM occurs in mothers following preterm delivery. In both studies, the medication was commenced ≧14 days post delivery and following insufficient EBM supply with other lactation supports. Currently, no studies support prophylactic use of a galactagogue medication at any gestation. Use of any galactagogue medication has only been examined at more than 14 days post delivery and after full lactation support has been given. Further trials should examine larger groups of preterm mothers and consider breastfeeding outcomes over a longer period.

### Antibiotics for mastitis in breastfeeding women [^115LMj11]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Mastitis can be caused by ineffective positioning of the baby at the breast or restricted feeding. Infective mastitis is commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The prevalence of mastitis in breastfeeding women may reach 33%. Effective milk removal, pain medication and antibiotic therapy have been the mainstays of treatment.

Objectives

This review aims to examine the effectiveness of antibiotic therapies in relieving symptoms for breastfeeding women with mastitis with or without laboratory investigation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2012), contacted investigators and other content experts known to us for unpublished trials and scanned the reference lists of retrieved articles.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing the effectiveness of various types of antibiotic therapies or antibiotic therapy versus alternative therapies for the treatment of mastitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When in dispute, we consulted a third author.

Main Results

Two trials met the inclusion criteria. One small trial (n = 25) compared amoxicillin with cephradine and found no significant difference between the two antibiotics in terms of symptom relief and abscess formation. Another, older study compared breast emptying alone as 'supportive therapy' versus antibiotic therapy plus supportive therapy, and no therapy. The findings of the latter study suggested faster clearance of symptoms for women using antibiotics, although the study design was problematic.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to confirm or refute the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of lactational mastitis. There is an urgent need to conduct high-quality, double-blinded RCTs to determine whether antibiotics should be used in this common postpartum condition.

### Can breastfeeding protect against antimicrobial resistance? [^114AUAYs]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs)

Human milk contains high levels of HMOs, a family of structurally diverse unconjugated glycans that are uniquely found in human milk and thought to shape the composition of the developing infant gut microbiome. HMO levels vary between mothers and over time, depending on the stage of lactation. A high concentration of HMOs in the early infant gut could reduce children's susceptibility to gut colonization by AMR pathogens and ARGs through multiple mechanisms.

First, HMOs are an ideal substrate for Bifidobacterium species, which can dominate the infant gut and may prevent the establishment and proliferation of AMR bacteria and enteric pathogens. Bifidobacterium species like Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis efficiently consume HMOs, creating acidic by-products which reduce intestinal pH. This lower pH environment is unfavorable for the growth of Enterobacteriaceae, which commonly encode ARGs. Multiple Enterobacteriaceae genera, including all ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and drug-resistant Salmonella and Shigella, are considered critical antibiotic resistance threats by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Bifidobacteria, on the other hand, much less commonly encode transferable ARGs. Bifidobacteria also produce bacteriocins, which exhibit antimicrobial activity against enteric pathogens and bacteria frequently resistant to antibiotics, such as Escherichia coli. In addition to suppressing their growth, specific Bifidobacterium species have been demonstrated to prevent the lateral exchange of ARGs between neighboring Enterobacteriaceae in mouse models. Previous research among a cohort of Bangladeshi children has demonstrated inverse, dose-response relationships between infants' gut levels of Bifidobacteria and concentrations of both ARGs and Enterobacteriaceae species.

Second, HMOs may directly neutralize invading AMR pathogens and reduce gut inflammation, which otherwise causes a favorable environment for Enterobacteriaceae growth and ARG transfer. The structure of HMOs is similar to cell surface glycoconjugates used by enteric pathogens to bind and enter target cells. Thus, HMOs can prevent the adhesion of enteric pathogens to the intestinal mucosa by serving as alternate binding sites. Further, there is some evidence that HMOs can directly inhibit the expression of genes involved in inflammation, although the mechanisms remain unclear. B. infantis, which thrives in gut environments with high HMO levels, has also been shown to suppress the production of proinflammatory cytokines and is associated with lower concentrations of fecal calprotectin — a marker of intestinal inflammation — throughout the first 2 months of life The capacity for HMOs and breastfed gut environments to suppress gut inflammation is critical in preventing growth blooms of harmful AMR pathogens, including AMR Enterobacteriaceae.

### Improving safe and effective use of drugs in pregnancy and lactation: workshop summary [^112h8qxn]. American Journal of Perinatology (2017). Low credibility.

Professional entities including SMFM, ACOG, and AAP strongly advocate that women breast-feed their infants because of its numerous maternal and neonatal health benefits. Breast-feeding rates have increased approximately 2% per year between 1996 and 2001. Stultz et al studied 46 women who provided medication history during their pregnancy and while they breast-fed their infants. In this cohort, there was a significant increase in both prescription and OTC medication use during lactation compared with when they were pregnant. More than 70% of women were taking medications that were potentially unsafe, or had unknown safety profiles. Anderson et al evaluated 100 articles between 1966 and 2002 to examine possible adverse outcomes in neonates due to their exposure to maternal medication(s) during breast-feeding. These authors reported that 47% of adverse outcomes in the neonates as "possibly" linked to medication exposure during breast-feeding; 53% as "probably" linked and no infant-related deaths were associated with medications. However, there is little research focusing on understanding the quantity of medication and their chemical effects on neonates during breast-feeding.

Only 5% of the 213 new pharmaceuticals approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2003 and 2012 contained human data in their pregnancy section; almost one-half did not have any safety information concerning the medication use for lactating women. Because of the lack of studies on specific drugs in pregnancy and lactation, the efficacy and dosing data are generally extrapolated from studies from adult subjects (men and nonpregnant women) and safety data are collated from the FDA-mandated postmarket surveillance. Such data often come from the use of pregnancy-exposure registries that, while useful, are greatly limited by inherent design biases.

During the workshop, the expert panel focused on the "current" state of practice and reviewed available data on select drugs in pregnancy. The group discussed what providers optimally should know about the pharmacokinetics of drugs particularly given the physiologic changes that occur in the course of pregnancy and postpartum, as well as the time of greatest vulnerability in terms of drug effects on the fetus and newborn. There was evidence presented about the interaction of drugs and breast milk, indicating that some assumptions could be made about the efficiency with which certain drugs may cross into breast milk and potentially pose further exposure risks to the neonate. Potential lessons learned from the pediatric experience with enrolling children in drug trials to enhance knowledge in this unique population and the robust safety systems in place to monitor vaccines were reviewed. The presentations and discussions from the 2-day workshop are summarized here.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Limited data from 3 published reports that included a total of 12 breastfeeding women showed low levels of celecoxib in breast milk. The calculated average daily infant dose was 10 to 40 mcg/kg/day, less than 1% of the weight-based therapeutic dose for a two-year old-child. A report of two breastfed infants who were 17 and 22 months of age did not show any adverse events. There is no information available regarding the effects of celecoxib on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ELYXYB and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from the celecoxib or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility

Females

Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin-mediated NSAIDs, including ELYXYB, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAIDs, including ELYXYB, in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.

### Can breastfeeding protect against antimicrobial resistance? [^115kmHWY]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Human milk as a source of antimicrobial resistance

Although breastfeeding likely cultivates a gut environment that is ultimately protective against children's colonization and infection with AMR pathogens, human milk may also be source of AMR bacteria and ARGs to the developing infant. In a recent study of 16 mother-infant pairs by Pärnänen et al. approximately 70% of ARGs and 76% of bacterial species detected in mothers' human milk were also detected in their infants' guts, suggesting vertical transmission. The same study observed that maternal antibiotic prophylaxis during delivery was associated with both a higher number and abundance of ARGs in breastfed infants' guts for up to 6 months, indicating that maternal antibiotic exposures may have lasting impacts on breastfed infants' gut resistomes. AMR Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Acinetobacter, Enterococcus, and Corynebacterium strains have also been cultured from human milk. AMR bacteria and ARGs detected in human milk likely do not originate solely from the mammary glands, as bacteria from mothers' skin and infants' mouths (through retrograde inoculation during suckling) are also thought to contribute to the milk microbiota. Nevertheless, human milk appears to be one of many sources of AMR bacteria and ARGs to the developing infant. This could be consequential if antibiotic use during delivery becomes more common to prevent maternal and neonatal infections, particularly in LMIC settings.

### 2023 HRS expert consensus statement on the management of arrhythmias during pregnancy [^1138Q4JW]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Delivery and lactation — breastfeeding benefits and general guidance: The benefits of breastfeeding cannot be overstated and human milk provides an optimal amount of micro- and macronutrients for the newborn with both immunologic and antibacterial properties; breastfeeding favors maternal–infant bonding and is associated with decreased postpartum weight retention; long term, exclusively breastfed infants commonly have optimal growth and development, decreased incidence of acute and chronic diseases, and fewer developmental and psychological disorders; breastfeeding should be encouraged in the absence of medical contraindications; given the overwhelming evidence on the benefits of breastfeeding (for both the mother and the neonate), in most cases, continuing lactation will outweigh any theoretical risks associated with medication exposure; in all cases, extensive counseling is recommended with a detailed discussion of the risk-benefit ratio for each individual case; the route of delivery, vaginal or cesarean, is generally determined by obstetric considerations rather than the maternal arrhythmia; pain management during labor in patients at risk of arrhythmic complications or receiving antiarrhythmic therapy is important to prevent triggering maternal arrhythmias.

### Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine clinical protocol # 36: the mastitis spectrum, revised 2022 [^111guHpN]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Pathophysiology of mastitis spectrum — mastitis is inflammation of the mammary gland that most often presents in a segmental distribution of ducts, alveoli, and surrounding connective tissue, and ductal lumens can be narrowed by edema and hyperemia associated with hyperlactation as well as mammary dysbiosis. Mammary dysbiosis, or disruption of the milk microbiome, results from a complex interplay of factors including maternal genetics and medical conditions, exposure to antibiotics, use of probiotics, regular use of breast pumps, and Cesarean birth. Basic science research has demonstrated that multiple factors contribute to the development of mastitis and include host factors such as hyperlactation, microbial factors such as diversity of the milk microbiome, and medical factors such as antibiotic and probiotic use. Milk stasis has been postulated to be a potential initiating factor for mastitis, although scientific evidence has not proven a causation, and no evidence exists that specific foods cause mastitis. The lactating breast is a dynamic gland that responds to internal and external hormonal stimulation; the breast requires feedback inhibition to regulate milk production, and although reducing milk removal may transiently increase pain and erythema from alveolar distention and vascular congestion, it ultimately prevents future episodes as feedback inhibitor of lactation and other regulatory hormones decrease milk production. Mothers who experience persistent high milk production despite eliminating iatrogenic causes of excessive milk removal may require additional pharmacological treatment of hyperlactation.

### Breast milk concentrations of acetaminophen and diclofenac-unexpectedly high mammary transfer of the general-purpose drug acetaminophen [^1118exmG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

While diclofenac sodium showed low mammary transfer, acetaminophen showed a relatively high milk-to-plasma drug concentration ratio. Although an association between infant acetaminophen intake via breast milk and long-term outcomes has not yet been shown, an association has been shown between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and risk for developmental outcomes in children. Perinatal health care providers should provide mothers with adequate information about the fact that acetaminophen is readily transferred to breast milk.

### Mastitis: rapid evidence review [^116d529F]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Mastitis represents a spectrum of inflammatory conditions. Lactational mastitis is the most common, with an approximate incidence of 10% in the United States, and it usually occurs in the first 3 months postpartum. Diagnosis is made clinically based on the presence of symptoms such as fever, malaise, focal breast tenderness, and overlying skin erythema or hyperpigmentation without the need for laboratory tests or imaging. However, obtaining milk cultures should be considered to guide antibiotic therapy, and ultrasonography should be performed to identify abscesses in immuno-compromised patients or those with worsening or recurrent symptoms. Because most cases of mastitis are caused by inflammation and not a true infection, a 1- to 2-day trial of conservative measures (i.e., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, ice application, feeding the infant directly from the breast, and minimizing pumping) is often sufficient for treatment. If there is no improvement in symptoms, narrow-spectrum antibiotics may be prescribed to cover common skin flora (e.g. Staphylococcus, Streptococcus). Most patients can be treated as outpatients with oral antibiotics; however, if the condition worsens or there is a concern for sepsis, intravenous antibiotics and hospital admission may be required. Use of probiotics for treatment or prevention is not supported by good evidence. Factors that increase the risk of mastitis include overstimulation of milk production and tissue trauma from aggressive breast massage; therefore, frequent overfeeding, excessive pumping to empty the breast, heat application, and breast massage are no longer recommended because they may worsen the condition. The best prevention is a proper lactation technique, including a good infant latch, and encouraging physiologic breastfeeding rather than pumping, if possible.

### ABM clinical protocol # 28, peripartum analgesia and anesthesia for the breastfeeding mother [^112ng6cc]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Postcesarean delivery analgesia — neuraxial strategies and opioid safety: Most women will have received neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery, allowing single or repeated neuraxial opioid dosing and/or maintenance of epidural local anesthetic infusion; this forms the basis of multimodal analgesia, should provide some pain relief for 18–24 hours, and will reduce systemic opioid consumption. Continuous postcesarean epidural infusion may minimize systemic maternal use and hence opioid exposure, and a randomized study found the continuous group had lower pain scores and a higher volume of milk fed to their infants; this option may be considered when early movement must be limited. Local anesthetics transfer to breast milk is low and they can be safely administered during breastfeeding. Single-dose, long-acting neuraxial opioids (e.g., morphine or hydromorphone) have minimal effects on breastfed infants due to negligible maternal plasma levels, and extremely low doses are effective and may be repeated if epidural or intrathecal catheters remain in place. When systemic opioids are needed, their use should be limited to the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration and a multimodal approach is suggested with acetaminophen/paracetamol and NSAIDs maximized; all opioids are present in human milk, it is recommended that patients be counseled about the risk of sedation for both the mother and the breastfed infant, and if the mother has central nervous system (CNS) depression symptoms, the infant should be evaluated for CNS depression as well.

Breastfeeding-related mastitis — decrease inflammation and pain: Ice and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can reduce edema and inflammation and provide symptomatic relief, and acetaminophen/paracetamol can provide analgesia; practical examples include ice applied every hour or more frequently if desired, ibuprofen 800 mg every 8 hours, and acetaminophen/paracetamol 1,000 mg every 8 hours in the acute setting. Although heat will vasodilate and may worsen symptoms, it also may provide comfort for some patients, and the use of warm showers and antipyretics did not improve mastitis outcomes in a randomized controlled trial. Sunflower or soy lecithin 5–10 g daily by mouth may be taken to reduce inflammation in ducts and emulsify milk. Levels of evidence: 1–3 with strength of recommendation C.

### Disparities in hospital-reported breast milk use in neonatal intensive care units-United States, 2015 [^116inJVY]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that infants receive breast milk. In addition to the nutritional benefits of breast milk, consumption of breast milk by preterm infants is associated with lower rates of sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis, and a number of other improved health outcomes. When mother's own milk is contraindicated or insufficient, pasteurized donor milk is recommended. Black mothers are at increased risk for preterm birth and delivering a low birthweight infant and have lower rates of breastfeeding initiation and duration than do white and Hispanic mothers. Mothers of infants in the NICU often face challenges with breastfeeding because of their infants' health conditions as well as being separated from their infants. The use of donor breast milk for high-risk infants is increasing, but access continues to be limited as hospital demand outpaces milk bank supply. Little is known about disparities in the use of breast milk for infants hospitalized in NICUs.

### Antibiotics and other anti-infective agents in pregnancy and lactation [^113q34Jg]. American Journal of Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Serum levels of many drugs are lower in pregnancy compared with the nonpregnant state. Their renal clearance is higher and the maternal intravascular volume is expanded. Most antibiotics are safe for use in pregnancy and lactation. Tetracyclines cause fetal tooth discoloration and inhibition of bone growth if used in the second and third trimesters. Aminoglycosides carry a small risk of fetal ototoxicity. Quinolones may cause arthropathies in children, and so are currently not recommended for use in pregnancy. Most drugs are secreted into breast milk in very small amounts, not enough to have any therapeutic effect. The only antibiotics which may be of concern in nursing infants are sulfonamides and quinolones, and possibly metronidazole.

Antibiotics

Mothers are often treated with intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis if they present in preterm labour to reduce risk of group B streptococcal infection in the infant. Antibiotics are also frequently started in babies with RDS until sepsis has been excluded, and it is important to have policies in place to narrow the spectrum and minimise duration, as antibiotic overuse is associated with adverse effects such as increased risk of NEC. Guidelines should be in place to only screen for sepsis when there are additional risk factors or signs of sepsis, and it is reasonable to withhold antibiotics in low-risk scenarios such as infants born by elective caesarean section. If antibiotics are started empirically, it should be possible to stop them within 36 h if there is no clinical or laboratory evidence of sepsis.

Early Fluids and Nutritional Support

The smallest infants have very high initial transcutaneous water losses and water and sodium move from the interstitial to the intravascular compartments, making fluid balance challenging. Humidified incubators rather than overhead warmers help reduce insensible losses. Fluids are initiated at about 70–80 mL/kg/day and adjustments individualised according to fluid balance, weight change, and serum electrolyte levels. A modest early postnatal weight loss is normal. Regimens with more restricted fluids have better outcomes with reductions in PDA, NEC, and BPD. Delaying introduction of sodium supplementation until beyond the third day or 5% weight loss will also improve outcome. Parenteral nutrition should be started immediately as enteral feeding is initially limited. Early initiation of higher levels of parenteral amino acids results in less postnatal growth failure and an increase in positive protein balance. At least 1.5 g/kg intravenous protein and 1–2 g/kg lipids should be started from day 1 and increased to a maximum of 3.5 g/kg amino acid. For stable infants, a small amount (0.5–1 mL/kg/h) of breast milk can be started early to initiate enteral feeding. There is no evidence of increased NEC with advancing feeds fairly rapidly up to 30 mL/kg/day in stable VLBW babies. Mother's milk is the preferred option for initiation of feeding but if not available then pasteurised donor breast milk is better than formula for reducing risk of NEC but will result in slower postnatal growth.

### Acetaminophen and ibuprofen (combogesic) [^113YXgPa]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

The components of COMBOGESIC, ibuprofen and acetaminophen, are present in human milk. Limited published literature reports that, orally administered ibuprofen is present in human milk at relative infant doses of 0.06% to 0.6% of the maternal weight-adjusted daily dose. There are no reports of adverse effects of ibuprofen on the breastfed infant and no effects on milk production.

Limited published studies report that orally administered acetaminophen passes rapidly into human milk with similar levels in the milk and plasma. Average and maximum neonatal doses of 1% and 2%, respectively, of the weight-adjusted maternal dose are reported after a single oral administration of 1 gram acetaminophen. There is one well-documented report of a rash in a breast-fed infant that resolved when the mother stopped acetaminophen use and recurred when she resumed acetaminophen use.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for COMBOGESIC and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from COMBOGESIC or from the underlying maternal condition.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility

Ibuprofen

Based on the mechanism of action, the use of prostaglandin mediated NSAID-containing products, including COMBOGESIC, may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles, which has been associated with reversible infertility in some women. Published animal studies have shown that administration of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has the potential to disrupt prostaglandin mediated follicular rupture required for ovulation. Small studies in women treated with NSAIDs have also shown a reversible delay in ovulation. Consider withdrawal of NSAID containing products, including COMBOGESIC in women who have difficulties conceiving or who are undergoing investigation of infertility.

Acetaminophen

Based on animal data, use of acetaminophen may cause reduced fertility in males and females of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible.

Published studies in rodents report that oral acetaminophen treatment of male animals at doses that are approximately 1.2 times the MHDD and greater (based on a body surface area comparison) result in decreased testicular weights, reduced spermatogenesis, and reduced fertility. In female animals given the same doses, reduced implantation sites were reported. Additional published animal studies indicate that acetaminophen exposure in utero adversely impacts reproductive capacity of both male and female offspring at clinically relevant exposures [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of COMBOGESIC in pediatric patients have not been established. COMBOGESIC is not approved for patients under 18 years of age.

ABM Clinical Protocol #15 — postoperative guidance states that mothers with term, healthy children may breastfeed as soon as they are awake in the recovery room, and for mothers who are not allowed in the recovery room, a pump or assistance with hand expression should be available for mothers immediately after surgery. For vulnerable infants who may need a brief interruption from breastfeeding postoperatively, milk should be expressed as soon as the mother is awake; the milk does not necessarily need to be discarded, it can be frozen for use when the child is at lower risk in the future, or used diluted with other breast milk not containing an anesthetic (expressed either before or 1 day after the procedure). The mother should be encouraged to express during the interruption from breastfeeding at least as often as she would normally breastfeed to maintain supply (around every 2–4 hours depending on the child's age). Opioids should be used judiciously, at the lowest dose and for the shortest period of time that provides adequate analgesia, and the breastfed child should be cared for and observed by an adult other than the mother, when opioids are used.

Diclofenac may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Avoid use of NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium external, in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks of gestation. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of diclofenac sodium external in pregnant women.

7.2 Lactation

Based on available data, diclofenac may be present in human milk. Caution should be exercised when XiclofenTMOintment is administered to a nursing woman. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for XiclofenTMOintment and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant.

7.3 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under the age of 12 has not been established.

7.4 Geriatric Use

Elderly patients, compared to younger patients, are at a greater risk of NSAID-associated serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and/or renal adverse reactions. If a risk is present, start dosing at the low end of the dosing range, and monitor patients for adverse effects.

In general, drugs that are taken by a mother during pregnancy or after birth may be transferred to the fetus or the infant (through breast milk). Many factors are involved that determine the amount of drugs that are transferred and their potential effects on the fetus or infant. A careful assessment of the risk versus benefit is necessary and should be individualized. In the breastfed infant, many measures can be undertaken further so that the amount of drug transferred to the infant is minimized.

### Unexpected drug residuals in human milk in ankara, capital of Turkey [^114FtUh4]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Various pharmaceuticals are given to livestock, fish farms, and beekeeping in order to treat infections, ensure efficiency and growth of products. However, metabolites of veterinary medicinal products given in inappropriate time, dosage and indications, can persist in animals' muscle, organs and products, and then contaminate people who consume these animals' products. Remarkably, many drugs' residuals were reported in food products derived from animal husbandry in different parts of the world. The residuals pose a risk of developing some adverse effects including hypersensitivity reaction, antimicrobial resistance, disruption of normal intestinal flora, bone marrow depression and carcinogenicity. Therefore, food safety is now universally recognised as a public health priority. These public health concerns are extremely important for mother-foetus pairs during the gestational and lactational periods. Screening all the nutrients consumed by mothers is impossible. However, breast milk can be used for evaluation of the mother-infant environment. Given the possibility of transfer to infants via milk, pharmaceuticals including antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are carefully prescribed by doctors to mothers during lactation with prescription of doctors. Similarly, we predicted that a small amount of drugs might also pass into the breast milk of mothers who consumed contaminated foods. There is only one study about detectable drug residues in the breastmilk of mothers without any history of usage of residual antibiotics in Eskişehir, Turkey. This study supports our hypothesis. However, the status of Ankara, the capital of Turkey, is not known.

Maternal-infant characteristics according to the status of NSAID in breastmilk

More than half of mothers had reported the intake of NSAID within the first 5 days after delivery. However, maternal age, educational status, occupation, history of drug use and cigarette contact did not affect the presence of NSAID residue (Table 3). High scores for the EPDS frequency did not differ according to the contact of NSAID. The age, gender, birth type, birth order and gestational length did not differ according to the contact with NSAID.

Table 3
Maternal-infant characteristics according to the presence of anti-inflammatory drug residues in breast milk

Values were mean ± SD or %

While the frequency of neonatal jaundice in the first weeks postpartum was 51.9% in infants with NSAID residues in breast milk, it was 31.7% in the no residue detected group (p = 0.071). Detection of NSAID residues slightly increased breastfeeding problems (p = 0.073). The crying and sleep characteristics of the infants were not influenced by the presence of NSAID residue in milk (Table 3).

Maternal-infant characteristics according to the presence of antibiotic residues in breast milk

Nearly half of mothers had reported the intake of antibiotics after delivery within the first 5 days. However, no mother had stated the use of quinolone, aminoglycoside or polymyxin for the previous 1 year. Detection rates of aminoglycoside and polymyxin antibiotic residues were between 10 and 90% and further evaluation was done.

Maternal age, educational status, working status, history of any drug use during lactation, smoke exposure and EPDS ≥ 13 were similar in groups with or without containing aminoglycoside antibiotic residues in breast milk (Table 4). Similarly, the presence or absence of polymyxin drug residue in breast milk did not differ according to maternal and infant baseline characteristics. Neither the detection of aminoglycoside nor polymyxin drug residues in breast milk affect the need for intensive care for the baby, the history of jaundice, breastfeeding problems, sleep and crying problems (Table 4).

### Can breastfeeding protect against antimicrobial resistance? [^1138XYVD]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial factors

In addition to sIgA and HMOs described above (see the " Potential benefits of early breastfeeding " section and previous section, respectively), human milk contains many other factors that directly inhibit AMR pathogens and/or their adhesion to epithelial cell surfaces. These include lactoferrin, an iron-binding protein with antimicrobial properties that is present in high concentrations in human milk, especially colostrum. Lactoferrin can be extremely effective in preventing the proliferation of E. coli, and has also been demonstrated to prevent the growth, impair the virulence, and prevent the epithelial attachment of many other bacterial pathogens via multiple modes of action, including Shigella and Salmonella. Recent randomized control trials among infants in LMICs have suggested that lactoferrin supplementation of children's feeds could reduce risks of neonatal sepsis and reduce the duration of diarrheal illness. In addition, other proteins present in human milk, once they bind to free-floating oligosaccharides, can prevent the adhesion of enteric pathogens and/or their toxins to the intestinal lumen via similar mechanisms to sIgA, HMOs, and lactoferrin. The glycosylated human milk proteins MUC1 and MUC4 are effective against frequently AMR enteric pathogens like Salmonella, for example. β-casein, a common glycosylated human milk protein, has also been shown in mouse models to also stimulate the expression of MUC2 genes and increase the number of mucus-producing goblet cells and Paneth cells in the small intestine. The development of a healthy intestinal mucus layer is critical in preventing the establishment of AMR pathogens, protecting the gut epithelium against pathogen-mediated damage, and promoting pathogen clearance. Lactoferrin and other antimicrobial factors in human milk are present at the highest concentrations directly post-partum.

Other antimicrobial proteins may enhance the effectiveness of antibiotics against AMR pathogens. For example, the human milk factor HAMLET (human α-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells) has been shown to directly target as well as enhance the effectiveness of antibiotics against drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and pathogenic streptococci, which could reduce the duration of antibiotic therapy needed to treat an infection and thereby minimize associated harms to infants' developing microbiomes. Recent experimental studies suggest that other antimicrobial peptides present in human milk, such as β-defensins, may also be able to work in synergy with antibiotics to lower the minimum inhibitory concentrations of intracellular pathogens.

There is great interest in developing human milk glycoconjugate supplements that could help support or reinforce natural mechanisms of protection against neonatal infection. Whether these compounds could also protect children against colonization or infection with AMR bacteria merits further investigation.

### Breast milk concentrations of acetaminophen and diclofenac-unexpectedly high mammary transfer of the general-purpose drug acetaminophen [^1174Y9Q6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

In the postpartum period, pain in the perineum or Cesarean section wound, headaches, infections, postpartum depression, or recurrence of pre-existing illnesses is observed, often requiring analgesics, antibiotics, antidepressants, and other medications. When a nursing mother needs medication, we often consult LactMed database to determine if the drug can be administered during lactation. One of the most common postpartum complaints is pain, and common analgesics such as acetaminophen, diclofenac sodium, and ibuprofen are considered safe drugs. There are several reports on the effects of maternal analgesics on neonates. Asthma and rashes have been reported when infants drink large amounts of acetaminophen in breast milk. It has also been reported that neonates of women who took diclofenac during pregnancy developed renal failure. Therefore, data on the amount of analgesics transferred into breast milk are important, but recent studies are scarce. As far as we could find, there have been only four reports on acetaminophen concentrations in breast milk since 1980. There were also only three reports since 1970 on mammary transfer of diclofenac sodium, which is often administered similarly to acetaminophen. Most of these were case reports.

The last report on mammary transfer was in 1987 for acetaminophen and in 1988 for diclofenac sodium, and despite advances in measuring equipment, there have been no recent reports. For diclofenac, many details remain unknown. We felt that in order to ensure breastfeeding safety of acetaminophen and diclofenac sodium, which are used by many nursing mothers, it would be necessary to reexamine their mammary transfer. In this study, we used a quantitative drug concentration assay using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, to examine the transfer of acetaminophen and diclofenac sodium into breast milk in 20 women after childbirth.

Consequently, many providers will recommend stopping a medication based on theoretical concerns about its safety for the neonate, and this may lead to inadequately treated maternal disease. Information needed to make decisions about medications and breast-feeding includes knowledge of the need for the drug, the excretion of the drug into breast milk, the extent of oral absorption of the drug by the neonate, the potential adverse effects on the neonate, and the potential effect of the drug on lactation. In addition, the infant's age is relevant and should be considered as adverse events are rarer in infants older than 6 months. As in pregnancy, the biochemical properties of a given drug are important elements such as drug ionization, molecular weight, volume of distribution, lipid solubility, and protein binding, and they may influence how much of the drug is excreted into breast milk. Furthermore, the half-life of the drug and its oral bioavailability will influence how much is absorbed by the neonate. One example of these complexities include emerging data demonstrating that there are specific patient genotypes that influence the toxicity of given drugs. Stover and Davis suggest that this area of pharmacogenomics holds promise in understanding how neonates with in utero exposure to opioids may have different withdrawal patterns based on specific polymorphisms.

The main recommendations from the workshop were focused in the following areas: clinical care recommendations, research gaps, and policy-related considerations.

### Drugs in lactation [^114UM8xV]. Seminars in Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Medication management in lactation is a challenging topic for healthcare practitioners around the world. In contrast to traditional advice, very few medications are now thought to be absolutely contraindicated in breastfeeding. As data from case reports, quantitative studies of medication transfer to milk, and lactation physiology accumulate, fact-based guidance for use of medications can be increasingly provided. This review presents the strengths and weaknesses of current scientific knowledge underlying recommendations for use of medications during breastfeeding, describes key pharmacokinetic factors influencing infant drug exposure in breastmilk, and provides a practical algorithm and case study on use of clinical resources as well as pharmacologic data to help in development of a management plan for lactating individuals with various medication needs.

### Mother and child: medication use in pregnancy and lactation [^113dwrQ8]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Pregnancy and breastfeeding pose a unique challenge to drug development and clinical application. In addition to drug toxicity to the fetus in utero and infants through breastfeeding, alterations of pharmacokinetics in those women also need careful attention. How do we turn around the overall lack of drug efficacy and toxicity information for pregnant and breastfeeding women?
