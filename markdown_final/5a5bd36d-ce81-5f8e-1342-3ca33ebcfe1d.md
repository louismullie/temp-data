## Question

Recommended dental prophylaxis for teeth cleaning after hip replacement

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about dental prophylaxis recommendations for teeth cleaning after hip replacement. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the exact procedure in question. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (AAOS/AAHKS, ADA) say about routine dental prophylaxis and whether they distinguish cleaning from more invasive procedures. Next, I will examine the evidence base for or against antibiotic prophylaxis, including meta-analyses and large cohort studies. After that, I need to consider timing after arthroplasty and the biologic rationale for any deferral. Finally, I should identify any exceptions for high-risk patients and synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned recommendation with citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and terminology so I don't conflate procedures. "Teeth cleaning" in routine dental care typically refers to dental prophylaxis using a rubber cup and handpiece without scaling, or periodontal probing without scaling/root planing, which are noninvasive or minimally invasive hygiene procedures rather than invasive dental procedures like scaling, root planing, or extractions [^be65c90a].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidance. The AAOS/AAHKS 2025 guideline advises against routine systemic antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures in patients with hip or knee replacements, concluding that prophylaxis does not reduce periprosthetic joint infection risk and carries potential harms, so antibiotics should be avoided for most patients undergoing dental care, including routine cleanings [^ff49ee9a] [^cda06d9a] [^b89a4c81]. Hold on, I should verify the ADA position as well; the ADA's 2015 guideline similarly concludes that prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended prior to dental procedures to prevent prosthetic joint infection, again reflecting a lack of association between dental procedures and PJI and the risks of unnecessary antibiotics [^05c7fc49] [^06f82d65].

> I will now examine the evidence base supporting these recommendations. A 2025 systematic review and meta-analysis of 157,466 patients found no significant reduction in PJI with dental antibiotic prophylaxis, with a slight, non-significant increase in risk among those receiving antibiotics, reinforcing the recommendation to limit prophylaxis to select high-risk populations rather than routine use [^2a517a2c]. Large cohort studies corroborate this: a Taiwanese cohort of 255,568 patients showed no association between dental procedures and PJI and no benefit from prophylaxis, and a Korean propensity-matched analysis of 591,602 patients likewise found no increased PJI risk from dental procedures and no reduction with prophylaxis, supporting the conclusion that routine antibiotics for dental cleanings are unnecessary [^43a92143] [^3697cf2e]. But wait, what if the signal is hidden in late infections? A 2022 English cohort of 9,427 late PJI admissions found no temporal association between invasive dental procedures and LPJI, further weakening the rationale for prophylaxis in this setting [^a6214e65] [^0da572c1].

> Now, I need to consider timing after hip replacement. Initially, I thought the AAOS recommended delaying all dental procedures for 3 months after arthroplasty, but wait, let me verify the exact wording. The 2025 AAOS/AAHKS guideline provides a consensus option to consider delaying dental procedures up to 3 months after TJA based on procedure invasiveness and early postoperative risk, and it explicitly allows noninvasive procedures like dental examinations without scaling to proceed the same day, while routine cleanings and noninvasive care are generally deferred for about 3 months as a precaution during the early healing phase when transient bacteremia risk may carry relatively higher theoretical consequences [^f6c39041] [^be65c90a] [^74881cf1]. Hold on, I should double-check the biologic rationale: the first 3 months post-arthroplasty show increased periarticular blood flow and susceptibility to hematogenous seeding in animal models, which supports a conservative approach to elective invasive dental work, though this is a consensus recommendation rather than high-certainty evidence [^46779cc9].

> Let me consider exceptions and high-risk scenarios so I don't overgeneralize. For patients with specific high-risk features such as immunocompromise, prior PJI, revision arthroplasty, or other major comorbidities, some clinicians may individualize decisions, but even then, the evidence base for dental prophylaxis preventing PJI is weak and decisions should be made via shared decision-making that weighs potential harms of antibiotics, including C. difficile and resistance, against uncertain benefit [^0dfb7f32] [^b89a4c81]. I should confirm that topical antiseptic rinses like chlorhexidine before dental procedures are also not recommended; the AAOS guideline concludes there is no reliable evidence that preprocedural chlorhexidine reduces bacteremia or PJI risk in this population, so it should not be used routinely [^04cf0a91] [^2ce5a492].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the recommendation is precise. For routine teeth cleaning (dental prophylaxis without scaling or with periodontal probing only), routine systemic antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended after hip replacement. If feasible, consider deferring elective cleanings for about 3 months post-arthroplasty as a conservative approach during the early healing period, while recognizing that noninvasive exams can proceed when needed and that delaying elective care for up to 3 months is generally low risk [^ff49ee9a] [^be65c90a] [^74881cf1]. Emphasize maintaining excellent oral hygiene and coordinating care with the orthopedic team, and reserve antibiotics for select high-risk scenarios after shared decision-making rather than for routine cleanings [^1ccfdabb] [^0dfb7f32].

Routine dental prophylaxis (cleaning) after hip replacement **does not require antibiotic prophylaxis** [^ff49ee9a] because there is no evidence that it reduces periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) [^2a517a2c] and the risk of harm from antibiotics outweighs any theoretical benefit [^b89a4c81]. Current AAOS/AAHKS and ADA guidelines recommend **no antibiotics for routine dental cleanings** in patients with hip replacements [^05c7fc49]. Antibiotics are only considered for high-risk patients (e.g. immunocompromised, prior PJI, revision arthroplasty) undergoing invasive dental procedures, and even then, decisions should be individualized through shared decision-making [^0dfb7f32] [^385902b3]. Maintain good oral hygiene and coordinate care with your dentist and orthopedic surgeon [^1ccfdabb].

---

## Evidence and guidelines

- **AAOS/AAHKS 2025 guidelines**: Routine systemic antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures, including cleanings, is not recommended for patients with hip or knee replacements [^ff49ee9a] [^cda06d9a].

- **ADA 2015 guidelines**: Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended prior to dental procedures, including cleanings, for patients with prosthetic joints [^05c7fc49] [^06f82d65].

- **Systematic review and meta-analysis (2025)**: No significant reduction in PJI risk with antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures; slight, non-significant increase in risk with antibiotics was observed [^2a517a2c].

- **Large cohort studies**: No association between dental procedures, including cleanings, and increased PJI risk, regardless of antibiotic use [^43a92143] [^3697cf2e].

---

## Risks associated with antibiotic prophylaxis

Antibiotic prophylaxis carries **meaningful risks**, including:

- **Allergic reactions**: Ranging from mild to severe anaphylaxis.

- **Antibiotic resistance**: Contributes to broader public health concerns [^56413766].

- **Clostridioides difficile infection**: Potentially severe gastrointestinal infection [^9d8b33e4].

- **Adverse drug reactions**: Gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and other side effects [^notfound].

Given these risks and the lack of proven benefit, **routine antibiotic prophylaxis for dental cleanings is not justified** [^b89a4c81].

---

## Exceptions and special considerations

While routine cleanings do not require antibiotics, **exceptions exist** for high-risk patients undergoing invasive dental procedures (e.g. extractions, implants, periodontal surgery). High-risk patients include those with:

- **Immunosuppression**: HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy, or immunosuppressive medications.

- **Prior periprosthetic joint infection (PJI)**: History of PJI increases risk of recurrence [^0dfb7f32].

- **Revision arthroplasty**: Multiple joint replacements or complex cases [^0dfb7f32].

- **Diabetes with poor glycemic control**: Increased infection risk [^notfound].

In these cases, **individualized decisions** should be made through shared decision-making with the patient, dentist, and orthopedic surgeon [^385902b3].

---

## Timing of dental cleanings after hip replacement

There is **no specific waiting period** for routine dental cleanings after hip replacement. However, general guidance suggests:

- **Early postoperative period**: Consider delaying elective dental procedures for up to 3 months after surgery to minimize infection risk during the initial healing phase [^f6c39041] [^74881cf1].

- **Routine maintenance**: Regular dental cleanings can resume after the initial healing period, typically around 3 months post-surgery, unless otherwise advised by the orthopedic surgeon [^notfound].

---

## Clinical recommendations

Based on current evidence and guidelines, the following **clinical recommendations** are provided:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Routine dental cleaning after hip replacement | No antibiotic prophylaxis required [^ff49ee9a] [^05c7fc49] |
| High-risk patient undergoing invasive dental procedure | Consider antibiotic prophylaxis after shared decision-making [^0dfb7f32] [^385902b3] |
| Early postoperative period (≤ 3 months) | Consider delaying elective dental procedures [^f6c39041] [^74881cf1] |

---

## Conclusion and practical advice

Routine dental prophylaxis (cleaning) after hip replacement **does not require antibiotic prophylaxis** [^ff49ee9a]. Current evidence and guidelines consistently show no reduction in PJI risk with antibiotics for cleanings, and the potential harms outweigh any theoretical benefit [^2a517a2c] [^b89a4c81]. Maintain good oral hygiene, attend regular dental check-ups, and coordinate care with your dentist and orthopedic surgeon. Antibiotics are only considered for high-risk patients undergoing invasive procedures, and decisions should be individualized through shared decision-making [^0dfb7f32] [^385902b3].

The Prevention of Total Hip and Knee Arthroplasty Periprosthetic Joint Infection in Patients Undergoing Dental Procedures Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies examining the influence of dental care and procedures on outcomes after total joint arthroplasty (TJA) as well as strategies to mitigate potential risks associated with dental care and procedures in patients with a TJA. The scope of this guideline includes the role of dental screening, antibiotic prophylaxis, use of antimicrobial mouth rinses, and timing of dental procedures before and after TJA. The population was limited to patients with total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty because of a paucity of data on patients with other orthopaedic implants. Based on the best current available evidence, this guideline contains five options to assist all qualified clinicians, including orthopaedic surgeons and dental providers, considering the prevention of total hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty periprosthetic joint infections in patients undergoing dental procedures. It is also intended to serve as an information resource for professional healthcare practitioners and developers of practice guidelines and recommendations. In addition to providing pragmatic practice recommendations, this guideline also highlights gaps in literature and informs areas for future research and quality measure development.

AAOS Clinical Practice Guideline—Outcome importance, resource utilization, acceptability, feasibility, and future research for dental procedures in total joint arthroplasty (TJA) are outlined as follows: Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is recognized as a devastating complication after TJA associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and this consensus opinion tries to weigh concerns for balancing transient bacteremia from dental procedures and infection risk potential for the planned joint replacement. There is limited evidence to support cost-effectiveness, and this opinion does not accelerate resource utilization but rather considers delay and timing of delay in resource utilization. This consensus opinion aims to give guidance that can be considered by healthcare team members to maximize access to dental healthcare while minimizing any potential risk of transient bacteremia seeding a planned TJA in the perioperative period. After the dissemination of the clinical practice guideline, there should be limited obstacles to widespread adoption, and communication between dentists and orthopedic surgeons is essential for care coordination. As limited research was available, investigations documenting dental treatment and type grouped by hematogenous bacteremia potential at specific time points prior to TJA surgery, then correlated with PJI outcomes, would be of benefit.

AAOS clinical practice guideline summary on prevention of total hip and knee arthroplasty periprosthetic joint infection in patients undergoing dental procedures emphasizes that “Periprosthetic joint infection is recognized as a devastating complication after total joint arthroplasty associated with increased morbidity and mortality,” and that the consensus opinion “tries to weigh concerns for balancing infection in the mouth and infection risk potential for the new joint during the early phase post-arthroplasty.” Regarding cost/resource use, “There is limited evidence to support cost effectiveness; however, this opinion does not accelerate resource utilization but rather considers delay and timing of delay in resource utilization.” On acceptability, “This consensus opinion aims to give guidance that can be considered by the health care team members to maximize access to dental healthcare while minimizing any potential risk of transient bacteremia seeding a new joint replacement in the early prosthetic joint healing phase.” For feasibility, “After dissemination of the clinical practice guideline, there should be limited obstacles to wider spread adoption,” and “Communication between dentists and orthopedic surgeons is essential for care coordination.” Operational considerations note that “For dental management of acute dental infection immediately after TJA while the patient is still in the hospital, this may assume the hospital or surgical facility has access to a dentist/oral and maxillofacial surgeon who will provide care in the hospital setting,” and, after discharge, “this may warrant additional time delay in scheduling definitive dental invasive intervention to resolve dental infection while the patient is maintained on intravenous antibiotics.” Future research needs are identified: “As limited research was available, investigations documenting dental treatment and type (grouped by hematogenous bacteremia potential) undertaken at specific time points after TJA in the early healing phase, then correlated with PJI outcomes, would be of benefit.”

### Dentists: improve patient safety by optimizing antibiotic prescribing (...) [^56413766]. blogs.cdc.gov (2024). Medium credibility.

Dentists: Improve patient safety by optimizing antibiotic prescribingPosted on by Dentists prescribe approximately 10% of all outpatient antibiotics in the United States. 1 Many of these antibiotic prescriptions may not be needed based on existing guidelines. Studies show that patients with total joint replacement commonly receive unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis despite clinical practice guidelines from the American Dental Association and American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons that recommend against using antibiotics to prevent late prosthetic joint infection in most cases.
2. How can a dental procedure impact a prosthetic joint. When you have a dental procedure, bacteria in your mouth can enter your bloodstream. This also happens during normal daily activities, such as brushing and flossing your teeth. For most people, the immune system kills the bacteria and prevents them from causing infection somewhere else in the body.

However, people with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk of infection and may need to take an antibiotic before some dental procedures. Taking an antibiotic to prevent an infection is called antibiotic prophylaxis. In the past, antibiotic prophylaxis was commonly prescribed to patients with prosthetic joints before certain dental procedures to prevent joint infections. However, expert guidelines no longer recommend pre-dental procedure antibiotic prophylaxis for most patients with prosthetic joints. This is because studies have shown that antibiotics given before dental procedures do not prevent prosthetic joint infections and can lead to side effects and the development of antimicrobial resistance. Patients who have other indications for dental antibiotic prophylaxis should continue to receive antibiotics. Talk to a healthcare professional about when antibiotics are needed.

And increasing evidence suggests that dental procedures pose no greater risk for bacteremia for patients with TJR than activities of daily living, such as brushing teeth or eating. 3-6 Thus, the risks of antibiotic prophylaxis, including adverse drug reactions and the threat of antimicrobial resistance, outweigh the potential benefit for most patients.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures following total joint arthroplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^2a517a2c]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a serious complication following total joint arthroplasty (TJA). Hematogenous spread, including from dental procedures, is a proposed mechanism for PJI. While prophylactic antibiotics (PAs) have traditionally been recommended before dental procedures in patients with joint prostheses, recent guidelines question their effectiveness. This study aimed to evaluate the association between dental antibiotic prophylaxis and PJI risk through a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies included adult patients who had TJAs undergoing dental procedures, with and without antibiotic prophylaxis, and reported PJI outcomes. There were four retrospective cohort studies, encompassing 157,466 patients, that met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. A random-effects meta-analysis with Hartung-Knapp adjustment was used to pool odds ratios (OR).

Results

Incidence of PJI ranged from 0.07 to 0.3% across included studies. There were no studies that demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in PJI rates among patients who received prophylactic antibiotics. Meta-analysis showed no significant difference in PJI risk between antibiotic and non-antibiotic groups, with a slight, non-significant increase in risk among patients receiving antibiotics. Several studies identified other PJI risk factors, including revision arthroplasty, obesity, congestive heart failure, and diabetes with end-organ damage.

Conclusion

Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics before dental procedures in patients who have primary total hip or knee arthroplasty does not reduce the risk of PJI. Given the low overall incidence of PJI and the potential harms of unnecessary antibiotic use, including resistance and adverse effects, current evidence supports limiting prophylaxis to select high-risk populations. Updated clinical guidelines should reflect these findings to enhance antibiotic stewardship and reduce healthcare costs.

AAOS Clinical Practice Guideline—antiseptic/antimicrobial treatment before dental procedures in patients with a hip or knee replacement—in the absence of reliable evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that the use of an oral topical antiseptic wash is not necessary before a dental procedure in patients with a hip or knee replacement. Quality of Evidence: Consensus. Strength of Option: Consensus. The literature review did not identify any studies meeting inclusion criteria that evaluated topical antiseptic wash prior to a dental procedure for patients with a hip or knee replacement. The results of these studies indicate that chlorhexidine wash prophylaxis does not significantly reduce the level of bacteremia following dental procedures, and as a result, oral topical antiseptic wash is not recommended before a dental procedure in patients with a hip or knee replacement for the purpose of reducing the risk of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). Periprosthetic joint infection is a devastating complication after total joint arthroplasty associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and rates of PJI are reported as low as 1%. This recommendation does not support the use of chlorhexidine wash, which will improve cost-effectiveness and resource utilization. Because of the lack of demonstrated harm and historical practices of oral, topical antiseptic washes, clinicians might be less willing to accept the guidelines and change practice, but adopting the guidelines is not resource-intensive or reliant on special needs and therefore would be highly feasible to implement with greater clinician acceptance.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with a history of total joint replacement [^f20f8314]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

As the population ages and people remain active into the 7th and 8th decades of life, the frequency of total joint replacement is increasing. Following joint replacement surgery, patients inevitably require various invasive procedures as part of their routine health maintenance, including, but not limited to, dental care, colonoscopy, cystoscopy, and cardiac catheterization. There is scant evidence to support the use of periprocedural prophylactic antibiotics in the prevention of late total joint infection. The guidelines for the usage of periprocedural antibiotics have changed as knowledge of the pathophysiology of joint infection has evolved. We review the current recommendations from subspecialty academic organizations regarding antibiotic prophylaxis for patients undergoing routine urologic, gastrointestinal, dental, and cardiac procedures after total joint replacement.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental procedures after total hip and knee arthroplasty does not decrease the risk of periprosthetic joint infection [^d99b7e5c]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a devastating complication after total hip and total knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA). While some guidelines no longer recommend routine use of prophylactic antibiotics for dental procedures, many surgeons continue to prescribe antibiotics for their THA/TKA patients. In a setting of increasing antibiotic resistance, it is important to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. This study aims to evaluate antibiotics prior to dental procedures and the association between dental procedures and PJI.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent THA/TKA between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2020. The primary outcome was late-presenting PJI, occurring > 90 days after surgery. Patients were designated in the antibiotic group (2,000 mg of amoxicillin) or non-antibiotic group based on their surgeon's prophylaxis protocol. Dental-associated PJIs were considered if the patient had evidence of poor dentition or a recent dental procedure prior to the onset of PJI symptoms.

Results

There were 2,871 (26.4%) patients in the no antibiotics group and 8,023 (73.6%) patients in the antibiotics group. We found 27 (0.3%) late-presenting PJIs and 4 dental-associated PJIs. In the univariate and multivariable analyses, body mass index ≥-30 and revision surgery were the only variables that increased the odds of late-presenting PJI. All 4 dental-associated PJIs occurred in patients prescribed antibiotics.

Conclusions

We found a low rate of late-presenting PJI. Routine antibiotics prior to dental procedures were not shown to affect the risk of late-presenting PJI. These findings suggest that routine antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures is not necessary after THA/TKA.

AAOS clinical practice guideline—prophylactic systemic antibiotics before dental procedures in hip or knee arthroplasty patients states that “Routine use of a systemic prophylactic antibiotic prior to a dental procedure in patients with a hip or knee replacement may not reduce the risk of a subsequent periprosthetic joint infection,” with “Quality of Evidence: Low” and “Strength of Option: Limited.” Evidence cited includes a cohort where “In 255,568 patients… within 2 years after arthroplasty” there was “no difference in PJI risk between those that received antibiotics and those that did not,” a matched analysis where Berbari et al. reported no association “in 339 matched patients” and that “antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental procedures did not decrease the risk of PJI,” and a large “database analysis of over 1,952,917” that “found no association between a dental procedure… and risk of PJI” and that “the rates of PJI and revision were not different between patients who received antibiotic prophylaxis and those who did not.” Benefits and harms note that “rates of PJI are reported as low as 1%,” that “The direct societal cost… is significant,” and that prophylaxis “may promote the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and increase the risk of Clostridioides difficile infection,” while acknowledging practice context that “Antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental procedures after THA and TKA is a widely utilized practice.”

AAOS clinical practice guideline on prevention of total hip and knee arthroplasty periprosthetic joint infection related to dental procedures—scope and intended use—states it is based on a systematic review examining the influence of dental care on outcomes after total joint arthroplasty (TJA) and strategies to mitigate risks, and is intended for appropriately trained physicians and dentists considering prevention in this setting. The guideline is an educational tool for qualified clinicians, and its recommendations are a guide that should not be interpreted as a standard of care; it does not include all possible methods of care, and final decisions must consider patient concerns and locality-specific resources. Intended users include all qualified clinicians, including orthopedic surgeons and dental providers, addressing prevention around total hip and knee arthroplasty.

Defining the strength of recommendation—strength of recommendation expresses the degree of confidence one can have in a recommendation and takes into account the quality, quantity, and the trade-off between the benefits and harms of a treatment, the magnitude of a treatment’s effect, and whether data exists on critical outcomes. Future evidence is very difficult to overturn recommendations based on many high quality randomized controlled trials that show a large effect, whereas it is much more likely to overturn recommendations derived from a few small retrospective comparative studies; consequently, recommendations based on the former are given a “strong” strength of recommendation and statements based on the latter are presented as “Options” with either a “limited” strength or, in the event of no supporting or only conflicting evidence, a “consensus” strength. For any “consensus” strength option, inclusion of a statement in the clinical practice guideline is at the discretion of the guideline development group.

### Is routine antibiotic prophylaxis cost effective for total joint replacement patients? [^be7192e4]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2015). Low credibility.

The routine use of amoxicillin antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental procedures for patients with total joint prostheses in place remains controversial. This analysis shows that the practice may not be cost-effective for patients in whom the risk of infection with dental work is low. However, specific data quantifying the risk and the impact prophylactic antibiotics can have is needed. Patients and physicians will need to continue to consider their use on an individual basis and should consider the risk of infection as well as the risk of adverse drug reaction when making treatment decisions.

Clinical recommendation and rationale—prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures in patients with prosthetic joints: The 2014 Panel judged with moderate certainty that there is no association between dental procedures and the occurrence of PJIs. Consistent with the ADA’s methods, when there is moderate certainty of no association, the strength of the recommendation is against, and against means that evidence suggests not implementing this intervention or discontinuing ineffective practices. On this basis, the Panel states: In general, for patients with prosthetic joint implants, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended prior to dental procedures to prevent prosthetic joint infection. The Panel also made the assumption that the evidence regarding hip and knee joint infections can be extrapolated to all joints because, to our knowledge, no studies have been published addressing the relationship between dental treatment and infections of other types of prosthetic joints.

Management of patients with prosthetic joints undergoing dental procedures—clinical recommendation states that, in general, for patients with prosthetic joint implants, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended prior to dental procedures to prevent prosthetic joint infection. For patients with a history of complications associated with their joint replacement surgery who are undergoing dental procedures that include gingival manipulation or mucosal incision, prophylactic antibiotics should only be considered after consultation with the patient and orthopedic surgeon, and a complete health history is always recommended when making final decisions regarding the need for antibiotic prophylaxis. The clinical reasoning provided is that there is evidence that dental procedures are not associated with prosthetic joint implant infections, that antibiotics provided before dental care do not prevent prosthetic joint implant infections, that there are potential harms of antibiotics including risk for anaphylaxis, antibiotic resistance, and opportunistic infections (e.g., Clostridium difficile), that the benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis may not exceed the harms for most patients, and that the individual patient’s circumstances and preferences should be considered when deciding whether to prescribe prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in orthopedic prosthetic surgery [^ef531b59]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

The problem of prophylaxis in orthopedic implant surgery will become increasingly important and complex as the population ages and requires more arthroplasty procedures, and the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria meanwhile also continues to rise. Energy spent preventing prosthetic joint infection is more effective than that expended in treating the infection of a prosthetic joint, once established. Preventive measures encompass a wide array of variables related to host response, wound environment, and microorganisms. Prophylaxis should address these areas in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative periods. Antimicrobial prophylaxis remains the single most effective method of reducing the prevalence of infection after total joint arthroplasty. In the postoperative period, prophylaxis aims to protect the prosthetic joint against hematogenous seeding from oral, urologic, skin, or gastrointestinal sources. Currently, dental and urologic advisory statements provide recommendations for antimicrobial prophylaxis for high-risk patients with total joint arthroplasty undergoing high-risk procedures. Close collaboration between the orthopedic surgeon, urologist, or dentist and the infectious disease specialist is crucial for providing recommendations regarding prophylaxis in special circumstances. In these particular circumstances, individual decisions should be made based on clinical judgment.

Many patients with artificial joints seek guidance from their dental and orthopaedic surgeons on whether they should take prophylactic antibiotics for routine dental treatment. Advice on this has been conflicting in the past, and other than a joint statement from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and the American Dental Association, there has been little official guidance. In view of the lack of consensus, we have reviewed the relevant literature and have concluded that antibiotic prophylaxis should not be routinely given to all patients undergoing dental treatment but should be reserved for those patients deemed at high risk.

### Metabolic conditions (...) [^c2f2dc95]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Metabolic Conditions DIABETES People with type 1 or 2 diabetes have an increased risk of periodontal disease, increasing their need for preventive dental care. 1 Although people with diabetes have a well-documented increased risk of infection in general, research suggests that this does not extend to tooth extractions, regardless of the level of glycemic control. 24 Thus, diabetes alone is not an indication for using antibiotics in patients undergoing routine extractions. 24 Studies are not as clear about dental implant procedures, and research is ongoing to investigate whether the success of implants is influenced by glycemic control. 42 It may be helpful for physicians to include a recent A1C level in the medical consultation. HEPATIC DISEASE AND CIRRHOSIS Cirrhosis is associated with coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, anemia, ascites, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

A dental assessment and treatment are critical in preparing patients with cirrhosis for liver transplantation by optimizing oral health and minimizing the risk of oral infections. Table 3, details such as drug name, dosage, route of administration, indication, and treatment duration should be communicated to the dentist. 9, 30 Patients should optimize their oral health before initiating bisphosphonates if possible. 30 For those already taking bisphosphonates, current literature has not shown a benefit to discontinuing the treatment perioperatively.
31. RENAL INSUFFICIENCY AND DIALYSIS Patients who have stage I to IV chronic renal failure with or without peritoneal dialysis usually do not need special accommodations for dental procedures other than the avoidance of nephrotoxic medications, such as NSAIDs, and consideration of renal dosage adjustments. Routine dental care should be postponed in patients currently undergoing head and neck radiation therapy.

34 A history of head and neck radiation is associated with numerous oral complications, such as increased dental caries, xerostomia, and osteoradionecrosis of the jaw, and dentists should be provided with a detailed oncology history. This information is important because most cases of osteoradionecrosis of the jaw occur at sites exposed to greater than 60 Gy of radiation, and perioperative hyperbaric oxygen or other precautions may be indicated. 34, 45.

Given the varying guidelines and recommendations occurring over the course of the study period (updated prosthetic joint infection prophylaxis guidelines were published in 2013 and reaffirmed in 2015),, we conducted sensitivity analyses varying the definition of what would qualify as an indication for joint-related prophylaxis (1) defining a 2-year window of appropriate antibiotic prescription after prosthetic joint placement (the highest-risk period for infection)and (2) using prior guidelinesper recommendations by Lockhart.Other sensitivity analyses estimating the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis included varying selection criteria within plausible scenarios of (1) continuous medical plan enrollment throughout the entire study period, (2) stratified years of estimates to reflect changes in practice and guideline recommendations, and (3) stratification of patients with and without a history of prosthetic joint diagnoses or procedures.

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive characteristics of groups with visits identified as having an appropriate use of antibiotic prophylaxis and those that did not were compared using independent-samples t test for continuous variables and χ 2 test for categorical variables. Missing data (55 observations) were included in the analysis and are labeled in the multivariable analysis as unknown. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs with robust standard errors for association between patient-level and visit-level characteristics and appropriate antibiotic use. Also, in analyses that included multiple visits per patient (54.3% in the primary analysis), generalized estimating equations with a first-order autoregressive working matrix were used to estimate corresponding ORs and 95% CIs.Variables significant in unadjusted analyses or identified as factors associated with unnecessary antibiotic prophylaxis were included in the model. The most parsimonious model was selected by only including those final variables significantly associated with prescribing. SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc), was used for all analyses. A priori hypothesis tests were performed with a 2-sided α level of.05.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for prosthetic joint patients undergoing invasive dental procedures: time for a rethink? [^2bf3774a]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In the United States, it has been common practice to recommend that dentists provide antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) before invasive dental procedures (IDPs) to prevent late periprosthetic joint infections (LPJIs) in patients who have prosthetic arthroplasties despite lack of evidence for a causal relationship between IDP and LPJI and a lack of evidence for AP efficacy.

Methods

A recent study quantified the IDP incidence over the 15-month period prior to LPJI hospital admissions in the United Kingdom for which dental records were available. A case-crossover analysis compared IDP incidence in the 3 months before LPJI admission with the preceding 12 months. The English population was used because guidelines do not recommend AP and any relationship between IDPs and LPJI should be fully exposed.

Results

No significant positive association was identified between IDPs and LPJI. Indeed, the incidence of IDPs was lower in the 3 months before LPJI hospital admission than that in the preceding 12 months.

Conclusion

In the absence of a significant positive association between IDPs and LPJI, there is no rationale to administer AP before IDPs in patients with prosthetic joints, particularly given the cost and inconvenience of AP, the risk of adverse drug reactions, and the potential for unnecessary AP use that promotes antibiotic resistance. These results should reassure orthopedic surgeons and their patients that dental care of patients who have prosthetic joints should focus on maintaining good oral hygiene rather than on recommending AP for IDPs. Moreover, it should also reassure those in other countries where AP is not recommended that such guidance is sufficient.

Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) risk factors independent of dental procedures are described from a case-control study, in which postoperative wound drainage after arthroplasty had a strong association (OR = 18.7; 95% CI, 7.4-47.2), with additional postoperative associations for wound hematoma after arthroplasty (OR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.3-9.5) and postoperative urinary tract infection (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.04-7.1). There were no data regarding whether use of prophylactic antibiotics decreased the risk of developing PJIs in patients with these specific postoperative conditions. Preoperative factors had significant ORs (ranging from 1.8 to 2.2), but some epidemiologists maintain that in case-control studies significant ORs of less than 4 may not be large enough to be clinically relevant and the upper limit of the 95% CIs for the preoperative factors did not include values of 4 or greater. Independent of having undergone a dental procedure, postoperative factors such as drainage or infection after undergoing arthroplasty were associated more strongly with PJI than having undergone previous surgery or arthroplasty of the index joint, being immunocompromised, or having a medical condition such as diabetes mellitus.

Regarding preventative measures for prosthetic joint infection, more specifically with respect to prophylaxis before dental procedures, AAHKS/AAOS 2025 guidelines recommend to consider delaying dental procedures after hip or knee replacement surgery based on the risk of transient bacteremia, the occurrence of an invasive surgical procedure, and treatment of an active dental infection:
|Situation|Guidance|
|-|-|
|Dental examination without probing, dental radiography or cone beam CT, denture adjustment procedures, clear orthodontic aligner (invisible braces) adjustment procedures, occlusal guard or bite splint adjustment|- Same day|
|Oral hygiene procedures, including dental cleaning, dental prophylaxis using a rubber cup and handpiece (without scaling) or periodontal probing (without scaling and/or root planing)|- 3 months|
|Orthodontic procedures, including banding or debanding orthodontic fixes or removable appliances, archwire adjustment, orthodontic mini-implant removal, orthodontic separate placement|- 3 months|
|Other noninvasive procedures, including suture removal, anesthetic injection, crown and bridge placement, dental restorative procedures, rubber dam clamp or matrix band wedge between teeth, impression taking, endodontic treatment (root canal therapy)|- 3 months|
|Scaling and/or root planing with manual (hand instruments) or ultrasonic scaler|- 3 months|
|Dental extraction, including single, multiple, impacted third molar|- 3 months|
|Oral surgery, including dental implant surgery, periodontal surgery, cleft palate surgery, piezoelectric surgery, osteosynthesis plate removal|- 3 months|
|Treatment of active dental infection|- Same day.|

### Prevention of orthopaedic implant infection in patients undergoing dental procedures [^2b65de46]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

The Prevention of Orthopaedic Implant Infection in Patients Undergoing Dental Procedures evidence-based clinical practice guideline was codeveloped by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) and the American Dental Association. This guideline replaces the previous AAOS Information Statement, "Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Bacteremia in Patients With Joint Replacement," published in 2009. Based on the best current evidence and a systematic review of published studies, three recommendations have been created to guide clinical practice in the prevention of orthopaedic implant infections in patients undergoing dental procedures. The first recommendation is graded as Limited; this recommendation proposes that the practitioner consider changing the long-standing practice of routinely prescribing prophylactic antibiotic for patients with orthopaedic implants who undergo dental procedures. The second, graded as Inconclusive, addresses the use of oral topical antimicrobials in the prevention of periprosthetic joint infections. The third recommendation, a Consensus statement, addresses the maintenance of good oral hygiene.

### Capturing orthopaedic surgical site infection data and assessing dental recommendations with respect to total joint arthroplasty [^f1b44dc2]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Greater documentation of patient history and clinical course is crucial for identifying factors that can influence surgical outcomes. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have already begun public reporting of hospital data on readmission, complication, and infection rates and will soon launch a website to make physician-specific outcomes data public. The orthopaedic community has the opportunity to lead the way in ensuring that adequate and accurate data is collected to facilitate appropriate comparisons that are based on patients' true risk of complications and the complexity of treatment. Several studies have reported a link between oral pathogens and periprosthetic infection, although it remains unclear whether organisms unique to dental tissues are also present in osteoarthritic joints and tissues affected by periprosthetic joint infection. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and the American Dental Association are aware of these concerns and have created guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis in patients who have undergone total hip or knee arthroplasty and require high-risk dental procedures. Because these guidelines have received considerable criticism, recommendations that are based on scientific and case-controlled clinical studies and provide effective guidance on this important subject are needed.

### The use of prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures in patients with prosthetic joints: evidence-based clinical practice guideline for dental practitioners – a report of the American dental association council on scientific affairs [^23fdef42]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2015). Medium credibility.

2014 Panel case-control studies—associations between dental procedures and prosthetic joint infection (PJI) are summarized from 3 additional case-control studies. In a nested case-control study by Skaar and colleagues, the main results were not significant with HR = 0.78 [95% CI, 0.18-3.39]; OR = 0.56 [95% CI, 0.18-1.74]; P = .45 despite control participants being more likely to have undergone invasive dental procedures. In a study by Swan and colleagues, they identified 17 patients (of 1,641) in whom PJI developed more than 3 months postoperatively and 51 control patients, and calculated the OR as 1.53 (95% CI, 0.13-18.03). In a study by Jacobson and colleagues, there were 30 case participants with late (> 6 months after implant placement) PJI and 101 control patients, and from the published data the OR was 0.07 (95% CI, 0.01-0.56), implying that those undergoing dental procedures were at lower risk of developing PJI; however, these findings were noted as inconsistent with other studies in which investigators failed to show an association between dental procedures and PJI.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary prevention of total hip and knee arthroplasty periprosthetic joint infection in patients undergoing dental procedures [^1342b1a4]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). High credibility.

Association between invasive dental procedures (IDPs) and periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) in the early postoperative period is summarized from two analyses: Thornhilll et al. (2022) evaluated IDPs in a 3-month period prior to 9427 late PJI hospital admissions, noting the incidence of IDPs was significantly lower in the three months prior to PJI admission and that causal organisms were identified in 4338 (46%), with only 9% oral streptococci. Subsequently, Thornhilll et al. (2023) assessed 2,344 PJI hospital admissions and found no significant positive association between IDPs (1,821, of which 18.3% had antibiotic coverage) and subsequent PJI, and these analyses suggest a lack of causal association between IDPs and PJIs. However, neither study examined the association within the first few months after joint replacement; regardless of whether a dental procedure is performed, the first three months after a joint replacement carry the highest risk for developing a PJI, and consequently it is prudent to avoid any procedures, including dental procedures, that could theoretically or actually further elevate the risk during this time.

### Resuming elective hip and knee arthroplasty after the first phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: the European Hip Society and European knee associates recommendations [^68306e77]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

The International Consensus Group (ICM) and the AAHKS Research Committee recommend that if a patient is positive for SARS-CoV-2, as determined by an RT-PCR test after a surgical procedure, all health care workers who came into contact with the patient without using PPE, and are not known to have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, should be tested and quarantined until their test results become available. Decisions regarding the need to quarantine staff should be made in tandem with the hospital infection control team and employee health department. The patient should also be isolated and any contact with the patient should be with the use of full PPE.

The American College of Surgeons mentions guidelines and considerations for post-operative SARS-CoV-2 testing of symptomatic patients or patients under investigation (PUI). Atelectasis, fevers, et cetera, are not uncommon in the post-operative course. Establishing operational guidelines for SARS-CoV-2 testing in these patients and concurrent testing results should be considered.
5 Are special adjustments needed for post-op SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis?

Statement Since SARS-CoV-2-positive is an absolute contra-indication for elective surgery, the standard enhanced recovery protocol and SARS-CoV-2 preventive measures are imperative. Time allowing, all surgical patients should apply social distancing principles for the first 2 weeks after the operation and self-quarantine in their home.

Rationale To date, there is no known SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis advice; the standard enhanced recovery protocols and SARS-CoV-2 preventive actions should prevail.

To prevent infection and slow transmission of SARS-CoV-2, do the following:
Wash your hands regularly with soap and water or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub
Maintain at least a 1.5-m distance between you and people coughing or sneezing
Avoid touching your face
Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing
Stay home if you feel unwell
Refrain from smoking and other activities that weaken the lungs
Practice physical distancing by avoiding unnecessary travel and staying away from large groups of people.

The International Consensus Group (ICM) and the AAHKS Research Committee do not recommend that antibiotic or venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis be altered in patients undergoing elective surgery during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

### The use of prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures in patients with prosthetic joints: evidence-based clinical practice guideline for dental practitioners – a report of the American dental association council on scientific affairs [^56ca4495]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2015). Medium credibility.

Prophylactic antibiotics prior to dental procedures in patients with prosthetic joint implants—clinical recommendation and evidence basis: American Dental Association clinical guidance states that, “In general, for patients with prosthetic joint implants, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended prior to dental procedures to prevent prosthetic joint infection.” The 2014 Panel judged that the current best evidence failed to demonstrate an association between dental procedures and prosthetic joint infection (PJI). The 2014 Panel also presented information about antibiotic resistance, adverse drug reactions, and costs associated with prescribing antibiotics for PJI prophylaxis. The practitioner and patient should consider possible clinical circumstances that may suggest the presence of a significant medical risk in providing dental care without antibiotic prophylaxis, as well as the known risks of frequent or widespread antibiotic use. As part of the evidence-based approach to care, this clinical recommendation should be integrated with the practitioner’s professional judgment and the patient’s needs and preferences.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary prevention of total hip and knee arthroplasty periprosthetic joint infection in patients undergoing dental procedures [^1f3e33e2]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). High credibility.

AAOS clinical practice guideline—Dental screening around total joint arthroplasty (TJA) for periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) notes that overall, dental evaluation was not associated with a decreased risk of PJI, and authors found that patients who required a dental extraction trended towards higher postoperative complications (adjusted hazard ratio 1.24, p=0.57) and were more likely to exhibit features of immune suppression and diabetes. Clinicians should encourage patients to maintain good dental health and can recommend a formal preoperative assessment by a trained dental practitioner when 1) a history of poor dental hygiene is disclosed, 2) patients exhibit comorbidities such as poorly controlled diabetes, malnutrition, smoking, or immunosuppression that could put them at risk of dental pathology, and 3) when both the cost and feasibility of a dental consultation are appropriate to the patient; the final decision to require formal dental consultation should be a shared decision between the provider and the patient. Implementing a mandatory dental screening could add significant costs for the patient beyond the screening, and given individual biases it might be difficult to accomplish widespread acceptance; due to the lack of ample evidence to support mandatory clearance, screening, or evaluation by a dental professional prior to TJA, we do not recommend this practice. Feasibility concerns include limited access to dental insurance—approximately 68.5 million American adults (27% of the population) lack dental insurance—and although rates of PJI are reported as low as 1%, it is unclear whether implementation of dental screening may identify patients at high risk and further mitigate the risk of PJI.

### Compliance with guidelines on antibiotic prophylaxis in total hip replacement surgery: results of a retrospective study of 416 patients in a teaching hospital [^a3f42c3d]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess compliance of anesthesiologist practices in antibiotic prophylaxis during total hip replacement (THR) surgery with the French Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care consensus-based guidelines.

Design

Retrospective review of medical records. Compliance of anesthesiologist practices with the guidelines was assessed according to antibiotic prophylaxis use, antimicrobial agent, dosage of first injection, time from first dose to incision, and total duration of antibiotic prophylaxis.

Setting

Orthopedic surgery wards in a 2,200-bed French teaching hospital.

Patients

A random sample of 416 patients undergoing THR from January 1999 to December 2000.

Results

Three hundred eighty-six (93%) of the sampled medical records were usable. Antibiotic prophylaxis was used for 366 (95%) of the patients. Total duration of prophylaxis did not exceed 48 hours in 98% (359 of 366) of the patients. Drug selection complied with national guidelines in 259 (71%) of the patients. Dosage and timing of the first injection were appropriate in 98% (290 of 296) and 80% (236 of 296) of the patients, respectively, who received one of the recommended antibiotics. Overall, 53% (203 of 386) of the patients met all five criteria. In multivariate analysis, there was a significant anesthesiologist effect on overall compliance with the guidelines (likelihood ratio chi-square with 9 degrees of freedom, 25.7; P < .01). Undergoing surgery during 2000 was the only patient characteristic associated with an increased rate of appropriate practices (adjusted OR, 1.56; CI95 1.02-2.38).

Conclusion

The overall compliance rate should be improved by disseminating the guidelines and the results of this study following audit and feedback.

### Principles of antibiotic prophylaxis in total joint arthroplasty: current concepts [^9666817a]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Infection is a rare, serious complication following total joint arthroplasty and constitutes a considerable emotional and financial burden for patients, surgeons, and healthcare systems. Prevention of surgical site and periprosthetic joint infections is crucial. This requires knowledge of the microorganisms that commonly cause these infections, including Staphylococcus species. Selection of the appropriate antibiotic regimen to treat infection remains controversial, but cefazolin and cefuroxime are the most commonly recommended antibiotics for prophylaxis. Appropriate timing of administration before surgery, with redosing performed as needed, can help to ensure optimal antibiotic concentration during surgery. Given the increasing evidence that S aureus colonization is a risk factor for periprosthetic joint infection, an exploration of the potential benefits of preoperative S aureus carrier screening and decolonization protocols is warranted. The use of antibiotic-loaded bone cement in primary total joint arthroplasty and antibiotic powder at wound closure are other controversial topics that require additional research.

### Surgical technical evidence review for elective total joint replacement conducted for the AHRQ safety program for improving surgical care and recovery [^f294dbe7]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Preoperative VTE prophylaxis

Rationale

Chemical venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is recommended for all patients undergoing elective total joint replacement. Questions remain however about whether VTE prophylaxis should be initiated preoperatively (focus of this section) and for how long prophylaxis should be continued postoperatively (focus of upcoming section titled extended duration VTE prophylaxis). Intraoperative stasis may contribute to the development of VTE; therefore, preoperative prophylaxis may reduce this risk, but potentially at the expense of increased bleeding.

Evidence

The literature search identified 235 articles, of which 7 met the inclusion criteria and were specific to total joint replacement: 2 SRs and 5 RCTs. A 2002 SR showed no difference in major bleeding and VTE rates comparing preoperative and postoperative low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) strategies in patients undergoing THA. Further, while they found that patients started on therapy perioperatively (ie, within 2-4 hours before or after surgery) did have slightly lower VTE rates (10.0% vs 15.3%), they also experienced much higher rates of major bleeding (3.5% vs 0.9%).Subsequent RCTs have randomized patients to preoperative versus postoperative regimens but using different agents, rendering direct comparisons difficult. Finally, a recent large registry study found no difference in bleeding, thromboembolic events, or complications when comparing preoperative and postoperative LMWH regimens.

The American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) guidelines for orthopedic VTE management do not favor preoperative or postoperative initiation but do recommend that therapy be started at least 12 hours before or after surgery as opposed to <4 hours before or after surgery.

Summary and recommendations

While chemical VTE prophylaxis is recommended for all patients undergoing elective joint replacement, there is no convincing evidence favoring preoperative or postoperative initiation. There is evidence that immediate perioperative administration (within 2-4 hours before or after surgery) may increase bleeding disproportionately to the VTE risk reduction. Upcoming section titled extended duration will address extended duration of VTE prophylaxis.

➤ The number of patients with end-stage osteoarthritis is increasing, and treatment with hip and knee arthroplasty is expected to increase over the next several decades. ➤ Dental disease has long been anecdotally associated with increased periprosthetic joint infections, although case-control studies do not support this relationship. ➤ While most recent guidelines for the prevention of endocarditis have favored treatment of fewer patients, the most recent recommendations for prevention of periprosthetic joint infection have increased the number of patients who would receive antibiotics before a dental procedure. ➤ Antibiotics given before a dental procedure decrease the risk of bacteremia from the oral cavity, but this is of uncertain clinical importance. ➤ The number of patients who would require antibiotics before dental procedures to prevent one periprosthetic joint infection greatly outnumbers the number of patients who would experience an adverse event associated with antibiotics given before a dental procedure.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures at risk of causing bacteremia among post-total joint arthroplasty patients: a survey of Canadian orthopaedic surgeons and dental surgeons [^9ccab13a]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2014). Low credibility.

To elicit current practice and attitudes toward use of antibiotic-prophylaxis among TJA patients prior to dental procedures, a cross-sectional survey of practicing Canadian orthopaedic (OS) and dental surgeons (DS) was undertaken. Of respondents, 77% of OS and 71% of DS routinely prescribe antibiotic-prophylaxis, but while 63% of OS advocate lifelong use, only 22% of DS choose to do so (P<0.0001). Both groups nonetheless recognize the importance of treatment within 2-years post-TJA as per AAOS/ADA guidelines. However, greater duration of practice pointed to potential inadequacy of these guidelines based on reported experience with late-hematogenous infection post-TJA. While discrepancies in attitude toward antibiotic-prophylaxis between surgeon groups remain, both groups agreed that the evidence to support decision making regarding antibiotic-prophylaxis for TJA patients undergoing dental procedures remains inadequate.

### Ensuring appropriate timing of antimicrobial prophylaxis [^e52e4600]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Delivery of intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis within one hour prior to surgical incision is considered important in helping to decrease the incidence of surgical site infections, but methods to ensure compliance have not been established.

Methods

All patients at our institution are subjected to a surgical "time-out" protocol to prevent wrong-site surgery. During a seven-week period, all patients undergoing spine surgery, total hip arthroplasty, or total knee arthroplasty had another safety initiative, that of ensuring that prophylactic intravenous antibiotics were administered at least one hour prior to incision, "piggybacked" onto our existing time-out verification checklist. In addition, we compared compliance during the study period with compliance during a three-month period prior to institution of this protocol and compliance for eighteen months after institution of this protocol.

Results

The average time (and standard deviation) between the antibiotic administration and the incision was 26 +/- 12 minutes for all patients. The protocol was effective in ensuring antibiotic administration at the optimal time to 316 (99.1%) of the 319 patients. Analysis of a group of forty patients who had undergone total hip or knee replacement during the three months prior to the beginning of the study demonstrated a compliance rate of 65%. The difference between this baseline compliance rate and the rate during the study period was significant (p < 0.0001). The compliance rate was 97% for 160 patients who underwent similar procedures during the eighteen months after completion of the study. Independent audits demonstrated continuation of the significantly better compliance with timing of antibiotic prophylaxis for patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplasty since the implementation of the protocol in our institution.

Conclusions

Piggybacking of verification of prophylactic antibiotic administration onto the wrong-site-surgery time-out protocol is an effective, cost-free, and easy-to-adopt method to ensure compliance with appropriate timing of prophylactic antibiotics.

### Is prophylactic antibiotic use necessary before dental procedures in primary and revision TKA? A propensity score-matched, large-database study [^3697cf2e]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The question of whether dental procedures increase the risk of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) in patients who have undergone total joint arthroplasty (TJA) remains controversial.

Questions/Purposes

(1) Are dental procedures associated with an increased incidence of PJI in the setting of either primary or revision TKA after controlling for relevant potentially confounding variables? (2) Is the administration of prophylactic antibiotics before dental procedures associated with any differences in this risk? (3) Which factors are associated with increased incidence of PJI after dental procedures?

Methods

This nationwide, retrospective, comparative, large-database study evaluated 591,602 patients who underwent unilateral primary or revision TKA between 2009 and 2019 using the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service data in South Korea, in which all people in South Korea were registered and to which all medical institutions must charge any procedures they performed. The study population was divided into 530,156 patients with dental procedures and 61,446 patients without dental procedures based on whether the patients underwent a dental procedure at least 1 year after the index surgery. After propensity score matching, patients were classified into a dental (n = 182,052) and a nondental cohort (n = 61,422). The dental cohort was then divided into two groups: 66,303 patients with prophylactic antibiotics and 115,749 patients without prophylactic antibiotics based on prophylactic antibiotic use. After propensity score matching, patients were categorized into prophylactic (n = 66,277) and nonprophylactic (n = 66,277) cohorts. Propensity score matching was used to control for covariates including posttraumatic arthritis associated with PJI risk according to the dental procedure and prophylactic antibiotic use among the cohorts. After propensity score matching, the standardized mean difference was confirmed to be less than 0.1 for all variables. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed.

Results

Dental procedures were not associated with an increase in PJI risk after primary (adjusted HR 1.56 [95% CI 0.30 to 8.15]; p = 0.60) or revision TKA (adjusted HR 1.74 [95% CI 0.90 to 3.34]; p = 0.10). Additionally, use of prophylactic antibiotics was not associated with a reduced PJI risk after the index surgery, either for primary (adjusted HR 1.28 [95% CI 0.30 to 5.42]; p = 0.74) or revision TKA (adjusted HR 0.74 [95% CI 0.45 to 1.23]; p = 0.25). Although surgery type and prophylactic antibiotic use exhibited no influence on PJI occurrence after dental procedures, posttraumatic arthritis was associated with PJI. The adjusted HR for posttraumatic arthritis was 4.54 (p = 0.046).

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that dental procedures were not associated with an increased risk of PJI for up to 2 years after the dental procedure in patients who underwent either primary or revision TKA. Based on these findings, there is insufficient rationale for the use of prophylactic antibiotics before dental procedures in patients who have undergone primary or revision TKA.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental or urological procedures following hip or knee replacement [^2693961f]. The Journal of Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

Reports of prosthetic joint infection associated with urological or dental procedures have prompted suggestions that these patients require antibiotic prophylaxis, but no guidelines have been agreed. We have polled orthopaedic surgeons, urologists, and dentists on this issue.

Methods

The questions asked were: could infection of a joint prosthesis result from a dental or urological procedure; does the risk of infection warrant patients informing their dentist or urologist about their joint replacement; should these patients have prophylactic antibiotics for (a) routine procedures and (b) lengthy procedures.

Results

Urologists and orthopaedic surgeons agreed that infection could probably result from urological procedures and that patients should definitely inform their urologist about their prosthesis. Orthopaedic surgeons thought that antibiotics were definitely indicated for routine and lengthy urological procedures while urologists thought antibiotics were probably indicated. Orthopaedic surgeons thought that infection probably could result from dental procedures, while dentists answered "don't know". Both groups agreed that patients should definitely inform their dentist about their prosthesis. Orthopaedic surgeons thought that antibiotics probably were necessary for routine and lengthy dental procedures, whereas dentists answered "probably not" and "don't know", respectively.

Conclusions

These results could provide the basis for a consensus regarding prophylactic antibiotic use in this growing patient population.

Discussion

In this cohort study of 9427 patients with dental records who developed LPJI, time trend and case-crossover analyses found no evidence of a temporal association between IDP and LPJI. In the 1970s and 1980s, the use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis in individuals at high risk of LPJI undergoing IDP became well established and led US orthopedic surgeons to call for dentists to give antibiotic prophylaxis to patients with prosthetic joints., In 1988, the American Dental Association (ADA) sponsored a workshop to address this. Although there was limited evidence to support the use of antibiotic prophylaxis, they recommended its use until further evidence became available,, and antibiotic prophylaxis was widely adopted by dentists.In 1997and 2003the ADA and American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) jointly published advisory statements recommending antibiotic prophylaxis for just 2 years after joint replacement but lifelong for patients with medical conditions that might put them at increased LPJI risk. However, in 2009, the AAOS unilaterally recommended that clinicians consider antibiotic prophylaxis for all patients with joint replacements prior to any invasive procedure that may cause bacteremia.This caused confusion among dentists and their patients.Several subsequent attempts were made by AAOS and ADA, either together or alone, to produce guidance,,, but these efforts only increased uncertainty about whether to provide antibiotic prophylaxis or not. As a result, in 2014, the ADA’s Council on Scientific Affairs assembled an expert panel to conduct a systematic review.They recommended: “In general, for patients with prosthetic joint implants, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended prior to dental procedures.” Unfortunately, this advice lacked AAOS support. Consequently, there is still confusion among dentists and their patients, as well as ongoing pressure from orthopedic surgeons for their patients to receive antibiotic prophylaxis when undergoing IDP, and many dentists continue to give antibiotic prophylaxis for fear of being considered negligent.

### Prosthetic joint infection following invasive dental procedures and antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with hip or knee arthroplasty [^43a92143]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2017). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVES We aimed to clarify whether invasive dental treatment is associated with increased risk of prosthetic joint infection (PJI) and whether prophylactic antibiotics may lower the infection risk remain unclear. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS All Taiwanese residents (N=255,568) who underwent total knee or hip arthroplasty between January 1, 1997, and November 30, 2009, were screened. METHODS The dental cohort consisted of 57,066 patients who received dental treatment and were individually matched 1:1 with the nondental cohort by age, sex, propensity score, and index date. The dental cohort was further divided by the use or nonuse of prophylactic antibiotics. The antibiotic and nonantibiotic subcohorts comprised 6,513 matched pairs. RESULTS PJI occurred in 328 patients (0.57%) in the dental subcohort and 348 patients (0.61%) in the nondental subcohort, with no between-cohort difference in the 1-year cumulative incidence (0.6% in both, P=.3). Multivariate-adjusted Cox regression revealed no association between dental procedures and PJI. Furthermore, PJI occurred in 13 patients (0.2%) in the antibiotic subcohort and 12 patients (0.18%) in the nonantibiotic subcohorts (P=.8). Multivariate-adjusted analyses confirmed that there was no association between the incidence of PJI and prophylactic antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS The risk of PJI is not increased following dental procedure in patients with hip or knee replacement and is unaffected by antibiotic prophylaxis. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol. 2017;38:154-161.

### Preoperative prophylactic antibiotics in total hip and knee arthroplasty: what, when, and how [^2bd5cc6b]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2022). Medium credibility.

Although there are numerous nonpatient-related factors that may help reduce infection risk, the proper use of prophylactic antibiotics is most responsible for reducing infection. The role of prophylactic antibiotics is to reduce early periprosthetic joint replacement, which is accomplished by having adequate antibiotic tissue levels at the time of skin incision. The goal of this section of the symposium is to review current antibiotic recommendations, how to manage patients with a self-reported penicillin allergy, review the use of dual antibiotics, discuss the use of antibiotics in the outpatient total joint setting, as well as very briefly discuss the administration of intraosseous antibiotics in knee arthroplasty.

### Duration of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after surgery [^940c85ee]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis is indicated while in the hospital after major surgery. There is evidence that the prevalence of asymptomatic deep-vein thrombosis, detected by routine venography after major orthopedic surgery, is lower at hospital discharge in patients who have received 10 days rather than 5 days of prophylaxis. This observation supports the current American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) recommendation for a minimum of 7 to 10 days of prophylaxis after hip and knee replacement, even if patients are discharged from the hospital within 7 days of surgery. As risk of VTE persists for up to 3 months after surgery, patients at high risk for postoperative VTE may benefit from extended prophylaxis (eg, an additional 3 weeks after the first 7 to 10 days). Extended prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) reduces the frequency of postdischarge VTE by approximately two thirds after hip replacement; however, the resultant absolute reduction in the frequency of fatal pulmonary embolism is small (ie, estimated at 1 per 2,500 patients). Indirect evidence suggests that, compared with LMWH, efficacy of extended prophylaxis after hip replacement is greater with fondaparinux, similar with warfarin, and less with aspirin. Extended prophylaxis is expected to be of less benefit after knee than after hip replacement. In keeping with current ACCP recommendations, at a minimum, extended prophylaxis should be used after major orthopedic surgery in patients who have additional risk factors for VTE (eg, previous VTE, cancer). If anticoagulant drug therapy is stopped after 7 to 10 days, an additional month of prophylaxis with aspirin should be considered.

### The effect of a quality improvement collaborative to improve antimicrobial prophylaxis in surgical patients: a randomized trial [^0f7f0755]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Quality improvement collaboratives are used to improve health care quality, but their efficacy remains controversial.

Objective

To assess the effects of a quality improvement collaborative on preoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis.

Design

Longitudinal cluster randomized trial, with the quality improvement collaborative as the intervention.

Setting

United States.

Participants

44 acute care hospitals, each of which randomly sampled approximately 100 selected surgical cases (cardiac, hip or knee replacement, and hysterectomy) at both the baseline and remeasurement phases.

Intervention

All hospitals received a comparative feedback report. Hospitals randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 22) participated in a quality improvement collaborative comprising 2 in-person meetings led by experts, monthly teleconferences, and receipt of supplemental materials over 9 months.

Measurements

Change in the proportion of patients receiving at least 1 antibiotic dose within 60 minutes of surgery (primary outcome) and change in the proportions of patients given any antibiotics, given antibiotics for 24 hours or less, given an appropriate drug, and given a single preoperative dose and receipt of any of the 5 measures (secondary outcome).

Results

The groups did not differ in the change in proportion of patients who received a properly timed antimicrobial prophylaxis dose (-3.8 percentage points [95% CI, -13.9 to 6.2 percentage points]) after adjustment for region, hospital size, and surgery type. Similarly, the groups did not differ in individual measures of antibiotic duration; use of appropriate drug; receipt of a single preoperative dose; or an all-or-none measure combining timing, duration, and selection.

Limitations

Hospitals volunteered for the effort, thereby resulting in selection for participants who were motivated to change. Implementation of the surgical infection prevention measure reporting requirements by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and The Joint Commission may have motivated improvement in prophylaxis performance.

Conclusion

At a time of heightened national attention toward measures of antimicrobial prophylaxis performance, the trial did not demonstrate a benefit of participation in a quality improvement collaborative over performance feedback for improvement of these measures.

2.1 Important Dosing Information

Do not mix other medications or solutions with ARIXTRA. Administer ARIXTRA only subcutaneously. Discard unused portion.

Monitor routine complete blood counts (including platelet count), serum creatinine level, and stool occult blood periodically [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] .

2.2 Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis Following Hip Fracture, Hip Replacement, and Knee Replacement Surgery in Adults

In adult patients undergoing hip fracture, hip replacement, or knee replacement surgery, the recommended dose of ARIXTRA is 2.5 mg administered by subcutaneous injection once daily after hemostasis has been established. Administer the initial dose no earlier than 6 hours to 8 hours after surgery. Administration of ARIXTRA earlier than 6 hours after surgery increases the risk of major bleeding. The usual duration of therapy is 5 days to 9 days; up to 11 days of therapy was administered in clinical trials.

In patients undergoing hip fracture surgery, an extended prophylaxis course of up to 24 additional days is recommended. In patients undergoing hip fracture surgery, a total of 32 days (peri-operative and extended prophylaxis) was administered in clinical trials [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Adverse Reactions (6), and Clinical Studies (14)] .

2.3 Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis Following Abdominal Surgery in Adults

In adult patients undergoing abdominal surgery, the recommended dose of ARIXTRA is 2.5 mg administered by subcutaneous injection once daily after hemostasis has been established. Administer the initial dose no earlier than 6 hours to 8 hours after surgery. Administration of ARIXTRA earlier than 6 hours after surgery increases the risk of major bleeding. The usual duration of administration is 5 days to 9 days, and up to 10 days of ARIXTRA was administered in clinical trials.

### Diagnosis and prevention of periprosthetic joint infections [^b666b5e7]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). High credibility.

Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) prophylaxis—In the absence of reliable evidence comparing other antibiotics and antibiotic combinations, including those listed in the guideline, it is the opinion of this work group that perioperative antibiotics should be selected based on principles of responsible stewardship, balancing the risk of PJI and antibiotic resistance. Selection should reflect the antibiogram of the individual institution, the individual risk factors of the patient, and multidisciplinary support of institutional infection control experts; there is no current reliable evidence to support one antibiotic versus the other. Strength of Recommendation: Consensus.

Introduction

Replacing arthritic joints with prosthetic joints is one of the great advances of modern medicine, with 2.9 million joints replaced annually worldwide. Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a leading cause of arthroplasty failure. Early infections, within 3 months of joint replacement, are considered the result of wound contamination at the time of the surgical procedure. Early infection rates in the 1950s were approximately 12%, but antibiotic prophylaxis before joint replacement and lamina airflow operating rooms have reduced this to 1% to 2%,and refocused attention on late PJIs (LPJIs), which occur 3 months or longer after joint replacement operations.

LPJI may result in prosthesis removal, or more rarely, in loss of limb or life.The cost of treating LPJI is 4- to 6-fold that of the original arthroplasty,,, and is projected to have cost $1.62 billion in the US in 2020,without taking account of the personal and societal costs of long-term disability or the impact on patients’ quality of life.Therefore, LPJI is of significant concern for the 28 000 US orthopedic surgeons and more than 7 million individuals with prosthetic joints. Furthermore, the number of individuals with prosthetic joints is increasing rapidly, with approximately 4 million new hip and knee arthroplasties projected annually in the US by 2030.Although LPJI incidence is comparatively low, it remains the most common mode of failure of knee replacement and the second most common of hip replacement, and the incidence is projected to increase with the increasing number of arthroplasties being performed.

### Analysis of prosthetic joint infections following invasive dental procedures in england [^0da572c1]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is there an association between invasive dental procedures (IDP) and late prosthetic joint infections (LPJI) in patients who did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis prior to IDP?

Findings

This cohort study of 9427 LPJI hospital admissions for which dental records were available from 15 months preceding admission found no evidence of a temporal association between IDP and LPJI.

Meaning

These findings refute recommendations to give antibiotic prophylaxis to patients with prosthetic joints prior to IDP, given the cost, adverse drug reaction risk, and potential for promoting antibiotic resistance associated with antibiotic prophylaxis.

Question 11. Which are the principles of antibiotic prophylaxis?

Statement 11.1. Prolonging antibiotic prophylaxis after surgery is generally not associated with better clinical results.

Statement 11.2. There is no universally recognized intervention for improving the appropriateness of antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery. These interventions must be tailored to the type of surgeon and team to which they are addressed.

Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis (PAP) has been demonstrated in multiple randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses to reduce the risk of SSIs across different types of surgical procedures.

Given the evidence, systemic PAP is considered to be a key component of perioperative infection prevention bundles. Although compliance with appropriate timing and spectrum of PAP has improved as a result of quality improvement initiatives, there remain significant deficiencies in compliance with other aspects of PAP such as duration of postoperative antibiotics. Given that approximately 15% of all antibiotics in hospitals are prescribed for surgical prophylaxis, perioperative antibiotic prescribing patterns can be a major driver of some emerging infections (such as C. difficile) and selection of antibiotic resistance, increasing healthcare costs.

Although appropriate PAP plays a pivotal role in reducing the rate of SSIs, other factors that impact SSI rates should not be ignored. PAP should never substitute for good medical practices, such as those of IPC. Perioperative SSI prevention strategies should include attention to basic IPC strategies, surgical technique, hospital and operating room environments, instrument sterilization processes, and perioperative optimization of patient risk factors.

The key elements of appropriate surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis prescribing include the correct antimicrobial indication, drug dose, route, the timing of administration, and duration.

Joint guidelines for PAP in surgery were revised and updated in 2013 by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Infectious Diseases Society of America, Surgical Infection Society, and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. These guidelines focus on the effective and safe use of AP. Therapeutic serum and tissue concentrations of antimicrobial agents should be present during the period of potential contamination. Additional antibiotic doses may need to be administered intraoperatively for prolonged procedures or for agents with short half-lives. In order to be safe, PAP should have no or few adverse effects and should have the narrowest spectrum of activity necessary to prevent postoperative infections.
