## Question

hyperaldosteronism

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about hyperaldosteronism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions and pathophysiology to anchor the clinical reasoning. Then, I should verify epidemiology and why it matters. Next, I will review clinical phenotypes and the differential diagnosis. After that, I need to check screening indications and the aldosterone-to-renin ratio, including thresholds and assay issues. Then, I will examine confirmatory testing and when it can be omitted. Next, I should review subtype differentiation and adrenal vein sampling. Finally, I will consider treatment pathways, special populations, and a practical algorithm, while continuously validating claims against guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology so I don't gloss over fundamentals. Primary aldosteronism is autonomous, renin-independent aldosterone excess from the adrenal zona glomerulosa, classically causing sodium retention, potassium wasting, volume expansion, and hypertension, with suppression of renin and potential metabolic alkalosis; secondary aldosteronism, by contrast, is renin-driven and reflects a compensatory response to hypoperfusion or diuretic use, so I need to keep that distinction front and center [^41bfa5a3] [^6f41d206].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology before I overgeneralize. Contemporary data show PA in roughly 5–14% of hypertensive patients in primary care and up to 20–30% in resistant hypertension, with underdiagnosis remaining profound; only about 2% of eligible patients are actually screened, which underscores a major public health gap and the rationale for broader case finding [^dfa7ff83] [^ec21102f] [^0b91849c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about phenotype. I initially thought hypokalemia was universal, but I should correct that: spontaneous hypokalemia is present in only about 20–50% of PA, and many patients are normokalemic, so relying on potassium alone will miss most cases; PA also carries excess cardiovascular risk beyond blood pressure, including higher rates of stroke, atrial fibrillation, coronary disease, heart failure, and renal impairment, which is why early detection changes outcomes [^a36bfd30] [^d59aa0f9] [^0b91849c].

> Next, I should review the differential diagnosis of low-renin hypertension so I don't anchor prematurely. Low-renin states include PA, but also low-renin essential hypertension, Cushing's syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Liddle's syndrome, and exogenous mineralocorticoids; distinguishing these hinges on aldosterone status and, when needed, genetic testing or dynamic studies, so I need to ensure I interpret the ARR in that context [^4240a923] [^e4bc1dc1].

> I will now examine screening indications and the ARR, since this is where practice often falters. Multiple high-credibility guidelines converge on screening patients with resistant hypertension, spontaneous or diuretic-induced hypokalemia, adrenal incidentaloma, obstructive sleep apnea, early-onset hypertension or stroke, or a first-degree relative with PA; some guidance extends consideration to stage 2 hypertension, but I should frame that as optional rather than mandatory [^52ba2a26] [^5552e84e] [^329ae58f].

> Let me think about the ARR technical execution, because preanalytical factors can mislead. I should confirm that aldosterone and renin are measured in the morning after at least 2 hours ambulation, with the patient seated 5–15 minutes before sampling, potassium corrected to normal, and sodium intake liberalized; interfering medications should be withdrawn when safe, with MRAs and potassium-wasting diuretics held 4–6 weeks, ACE inhibitors and ARBs 2 weeks, and beta-blockers or centrally acting agents 2 weeks if feasible, substituting noninterfering agents like verapamil, hydralazine, or alpha-blockers when needed [^b768dcd8] [^fcc799c5] [^9fccc074].

> I should double-check ARR thresholds and assay dependence so I don't misclassify results. Using immunoassay, a positive screen typically requires renin suppression with PRA ≤ 1 ng/mL/h or DRC ≤ 8.2 mU/L plus aldosterone ≥ 10 ng/dL, and an ARR ≥ 20 (aldosterone ng/dL to PRA ng/mL/h) or ≥ 70 (aldosterone pmol/L to DRC mU/L); with LC–MS/MS, aldosterone thresholds are about 25% lower, so an ARR around 15–20 is more appropriate, and I need to interpret results in light of the assay used [^a097c506] [^9fccc074].

> But wait, what if the screen is negative and suspicion remains high? I should confirm that repeating the ARR after correcting hypokalemia and addressing medications is advised, and that a suppressed renin with aldosterone in the 5–10 ng/dL range by immunoassay warrants repetition because of false negatives; this iterative approach reduces missed diagnoses without overtesting low-risk patients [^77636bd3] [^9fccc074].

> Next, I should review confirmatory testing and when it can be omitted. In patients with resistant hypertension or hypertension with hypokalemia and overt biochemical evidence of renin-independent aldosterone excess (PRA ≤ 0.2 ng/mL/h or DRC ≤ 2 mU/L with aldosterone ≥ 20 ng/dL by immunoassay or ≥ 15 ng/dL by LC–MS/MS), the Endocrine Society recommends bypassing suppression testing due to false-negative risk; conversely, in low-probability phenotypes such as normokalemia with aldosterone < 11 ng/dL by immunoassay or < 8 ng/dL by LC–MS/MS, suppression testing is not recommended, and empiric MRA therapy may be reasonable in those unwilling or unable to pursue AVS [^026c6cb5] [^3a01bf8f] [^6d463845].

> Hold on, I should verify the mechanics and limitations of suppression tests so counseling is accurate. Options include oral sodium loading with 24-hour urinary aldosterone, IV saline infusion with plasma aldosterone at 4 hours, captopril challenge, or fludrocortisone suppression; failure to suppress aldosterone supports PA, but thresholds vary by assay and protocol, and hypokalemia can blunt aldosterone and yield false negatives, so potassium should be normalized beforehand when feasible [^dc3e58ed] [^7fdd63ef].

> I need to ensure subtype differentiation is handled correctly, because treatment hinges on it. Adrenal CT is first-line to exclude malignancy and guide anatomy, but it cannot reliably distinguish unilateral from bilateral disease; adrenal vein sampling remains the gold standard for lateralization in surgical candidates, with cortisol-corrected aldosterone gradients > 2:1 indicating unilateral disease; in patients under 35 with marked PA, hypokalemia, and a unilateral adenoma > 1 cm, some guidelines allow omission of AVS, though I should individualize this decision [^7ec135f8] [^cbc8d47c].

> Let me reconsider treatment pathways so I don't overgeneralize. Unilateral disease is best managed with laparoscopic adrenalectomy, which cures hypokalemia in nearly all and improves or normalizes blood pressure in about 30–60%, reducing medication burden; bilateral disease or nonsurgical candidates should receive lifelong mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, with spironolactone or eplerenone titrated to normalize potassium and blood pressure, recognizing that MRAs do not suppress aldosterone and that biochemical control with renin "desuppression" is associated with better outcomes [^7ec135f8] [^d59aa0f9] [^ebcbd02c].

> I should confirm special populations and nuances so I don't miss actionable scenarios. In chronic kidney disease, renin declines with nephron loss and aldosterone may be relatively elevated, increasing false-positive ARR; interpretation must be cautious, and suppression testing may be less reliable, so clinical judgment and, when needed, empiric MRA trials may be reasonable. In pregnancy, physiologic changes complicate interpretation, and MRAs are contraindicated, so management is individualized. In children and adolescents, young-onset PA warrants genetic testing for familial forms, and AVS is technically challenging, so medical therapy is often first-line unless a clear unilateral lesion is identified [^9fccc074] [^3a01bf8f].

> Next, I should review a practical, stepwise algorithm and sanity-check it against guidelines. Screen high-risk hypertensive patients with ARR using standardized conditions; if positive or suspicion remains high, proceed to confirmatory testing unless the phenotype is overt enough to bypass it; if confirmed, obtain adrenal imaging and, if surgery is contemplated, perform AVS to lateralize; treat unilateral disease surgically and bilateral disease medically with MRAs, monitor for hypokalemia resolution, blood pressure response, and renin recovery as a marker of biochemical control [^7ec135f8] [^fcc799c5] [^d59aa0f9].

> Finally, I need to ensure I address system-level barriers and quality gaps so the plan is realistic. Underdiagnosis persists due to medication interference, assay variability, and limited access to AVS; adopting no-withdrawal or minimal-withdrawal strategies, leveraging LC–MS/MS when available, and integrating decision tools can expand screening without sacrificing accuracy, and health economic analyses support broader case finding given the downstream cardiovascular benefits and potential cost offsets [^ede73464] [^4e1f44cb] [^0b91849c].

Hyperaldosteronism is **excess aldosterone** secretion, causing sodium retention, potassium loss, and hypertension. It is classified as **primary (autonomous adrenal overproduction)** or **secondary (renin-driven)**. Primary aldosteronism is common in resistant hypertension and is diagnosed by an elevated aldosterone-to-renin ratio with confirmatory suppression testing, then subtyped with CT and adrenal vein sampling to guide therapy: unilateral disease is treated with adrenalectomy, while bilateral disease is managed with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Secondary aldosteronism results from renin excess (e.g. renal artery stenosis, heart failure) and is treated by addressing the underlying cause. Early recognition and targeted therapy reduce cardiovascular risk and improve outcomes [^dfa7ff83] [^7ec135f8].

---

## Pathophysiology

Hyperaldosteronism is driven by **excess aldosterone**, which increases renal sodium and water reabsorption, expands plasma volume, and raises blood pressure; it also increases potassium and hydrogen ion excretion, causing hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis [^41bfa5a3].

---

## Classification

Hyperaldosteronism is classified as **primary or secondary**:

| **Type** | **Mechanism** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|-|
| Primary hyperaldosteronism (PA) | Autonomous aldosterone excess with suppressed renin | - Aldosterone-producing adenoma (Conn's syndrome) <br/> - Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia <br/> - Unilateral hyperplasia <br/> - Adrenocortical carcinoma <br/> - Familial hyperaldosteronism [^c42f2d8b] |
| Secondary hyperaldosteronism | Excess renin drives aldosterone | - Renal artery stenosis <br/> - Malignant hypertension <br/> - Heart failure <br/> - Liver cirrhosis <br/> - Nephrotic syndrome [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical features include:

- **Hypertension**: Often resistant or severe [^52ba2a26].
- **Hypokalemia**: Spontaneous or diuretic-induced; may cause muscle weakness, cramping, or arrhythmias [^e6d805e6].
- **Metabolic alkalosis**: Elevated serum bicarbonate [^6336590b].
- **Polyuria and polydipsia**: From renal potassium loss [^49bec6fa].
- **Cardiovascular complications**: Higher risk of stroke, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure than essential hypertension [^d59aa0f9].

---

## Diagnosis

### Screening

Screening is indicated in:

- Resistant hypertension (≥ 3 antihypertensives, including a diuretic) [^52ba2a26].
- Spontaneous or diuretic-induced hypokalemia [^5552e84e].
- Adrenal incidentaloma with hypertension [^5780ed4e].
- Early-onset hypertension or family history of early stroke [^52ba2a26].

The **aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR)** is the first-line screen; an elevated ARR with suppressed renin suggests PA [^a097c506].

---

### Confirmatory testing

Confirmatory tests are used to **confirm autonomous aldosterone secretion** [^7fdd63ef]:

- **Saline infusion test**: Infuse 2 L saline over 4 hours; aldosterone > 10 ng/dL indicates PA [^notfound].
- **Oral salt loading test**: High sodium intake for 3 days; urinary aldosterone > 12 µg/24 h indicates PA [^notfound].
- **Captopril challenge test**: Give 25–50 mg captopril; aldosterone > 15 ng/dL indicates PA [^notfound].

---

### Subtype differentiation

- **Adrenal CT**: Localize adenomas or hyperplasia [^626266d9].
- **Adrenal vein sampling (AVS)**: Gold standard to distinguish unilateral from bilateral disease [^7ea0304e].

---

## Treatment

### Primary hyperaldosteronism

- **Unilateral disease**: Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is first-line and often curative [^7ec135f8].
- **Bilateral disease or surgical ineligibility**: Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (spironolactone or eplerenone) [^7ec135f8].
- **Adjunctive measures**: Sodium restriction and potassium supplementation as needed [^8dacca65].

---

### Secondary hyperaldosteronism

Management focuses on **treating the underlying cause** — such as revascularization for renal artery stenosis, or optimizing therapy for heart failure or liver disease — and using antihypertensives and diuretics as indicated [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

With appropriate therapy, **blood pressure control and hypokalemia correction are achievable**; however, cardiovascular risk remains elevated if aldosterone excess persists, underscoring the importance of timely diagnosis and targeted treatment [^d59aa0f9].

---

Hyperaldosteronism is a **treatable cause of secondary hypertension**; recognizing risk features, using ARR-based screening, and completing confirmatory and subtype testing enable targeted therapy that improves blood pressure, corrects hypokalemia, and reduces cardiovascular risk [^7ec135f8].

### The expanding spectrum of primary aldosteronism: implications for diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment [^41bfa5a3]. Endocrine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Primary aldosteronism is characterized by aldosterone secretion that is independent of renin and angiotensin II and sodium status. The deleterious effects of primary aldosteronism are mediated by excessive activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor that results in the well-known consequences of volume expansion, hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis, but it also increases the risk for cardiovascular and kidney disease, as well as death. For decades, the approaches to defining, diagnosing, and treating primary aldosteronism have been relatively constant and generally focused on detecting and treating the more severe presentations of the disease. However, emerging evidence suggests that the prevalence of primary aldosteronism is much greater than previously recognized, and that milder and nonclassical forms of renin-independent aldosterone secretion that impart heightened cardiovascular risk may be common. Public health efforts to prevent aldosterone-mediated end-organ disease will require improved capabilities to diagnose all forms of primary aldosteronism while optimizing the treatment approaches such that the excess risk for cardiovascular and kidney disease is adequately mitigated. In this review, we present a physiologic approach to considering the diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment of primary aldosteronism. We review evidence suggesting that primary aldosteronism manifests across a wide spectrum of severity, ranging from mild to overt, that correlates with cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, we review emerging evidence from genetic studies that begin to provide a theoretical explanation for the pathogenesis of primary aldosteronism and a link to its phenotypic severity spectrum and prevalence. Finally, we review human studies that provide insights into the optimal approach toward the treatment of primary aldosteronism.

### Primary aldosteronism: an update on screening, diagnosis and treatment [^aa3a0da7]. Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Primary aldosteronism is much more common than previously held; it implies an excessive organ damage to the heart, vessels and kidney, which translates into an excess of cardiovascular events. These two features, along with the fact that the arterial hypertension and the hypokalemia can be corrected with a timely diagnosis and an appropriate therapy, warrant an aggressive diagnostic approach in hypertensive patients.

Objectives

To provide updated information on the screening and exclusion tests for primary aldosteronism and to illustrate the strategy that can be followed for primary aldosteronism subtype differentiation.

Design

Review of the literature and personal experience of the authors.

Results

The available evidence showed that a cost-effective strategy for the screening of patients with primary aldosteronism can be exploited at most centres. At variance, the identification of primary aldosteronism subtypes, for example, the differentiation of patients with an aldosterone-producing adenoma from those with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism should be undertaken at tertiary referral centres.

Conclusion

The identification of a curable form of primary aldosteronism can be much rewarding for the patient and the doctor. Thus, an aggressive diagnostic approach is mandatory at least in some subgroups of hypertensive patients who are at higher prior risk of primary aldosteronism or can benefit more from an accurate diagnosis.

### A physiologic-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with hypokalemia [^e6d805e6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is a common electrolyte disorder. Transient causes of hypokalemia are due to cell shift, whereas sustained hypokalemia is caused by either inadequate intake or excessive potassium loss. Evaluation of the intake, distribution, and excretion of potassium should include the following: (1) a careful history, including use of drugs, medications, and the presence of vomiting or diarrhea; (2) physical examination, including orthostatic changes in blood pressure and heart rate; and (3) measurement of urine and plasma electrolytes. Urinary potassium wasting is caused by pathophysiologic conditions that couple increased distal sodium delivery with increased plasma aldosterone levels or aldosterone-like effects. If urinary potassium loss is identified, the next step is to determine whether the loss is caused by a primary increase in distal delivery of sodium or a primary increase in mineralocorticoid level. A primary increase in distal delivery should be associated with volume depletion, whereas a primary increase in mineralocorticoid level generally is associated with volume expansion and hypertension. In patients with a primary increase in mineralocorticoid activity, it is useful to measure plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone levels. Complications of hypokalemia include muscle weakness, rhabdomyolysis, cardiac arrhythmias, impaired urinary concentrating ability, and glucose intolerance.

### Approach to the patient with hypertension, unexplained hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis [^cc3f93a2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

We present a patient with hypertension and hypokalemia secondary to an aldosterone-producing adenoma that was renin responsive (APARR). We discussed the sequential approach to the diagnosis of the different subtypes of primary aldosteronism and confirmed the presence of an APARR. The most common cause of primary aldosteronism is an aldosteronoma; functionally, these adenomas respond poorly to angiotensin II but show a brisk response to adrenocorticotropin hormone. They have a pattern of aldosterone level that declines in parallel with cortisol levels. Our patient had an APARR, with an increase of aldosterone in the upright posture. The unusual physiologic response, incidence, and clinical characteristics of APARR are reviewed.

### A comprehensive review of the clinical aspects of primary aldosteronism [^1bfe7f03]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

Primary aldosteronism is much more common than previously thought. The high prevalence of primary aldosteronism, the damage this condition does to the heart, blood vessels and kidneys (which causes a high rate of cardiovascular events), along with the notion that a timely diagnosis followed by an appropriate therapy can correct the arterial hypertension and hypokalemia, justify efforts to search for primary aldosteronism in many patients with hypertension. Most centers can use a cost-effective strategy to screen for patients with primary aldosteronism. By contrast, the identification of primary aldosteronism subtypes, which involves adrenal-vein sampling, should only be undertaken at tertiary referral centers that have experience in performing and interpreting this test. The identification of a curable form of primary aldosteronism can be beneficial for the patient. In some subgroups of patients with hypertension who are at high risk of primary aldosteronism or can benefit most from an accurate diagnosis, an aggressive diagnostic approach is necessary.

### Primary aldosteronism [^03d6a51f]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, more specifically with respect to confirmatory testing, AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend to avoid obtaining confirmatory testing in patients with a high probability of PA based on clinical presentation and initial biochemical screening (such as spontaneous hypokalemia with suppressed plasma renin activity and elevated plasma aldosterone concentration).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, more specifically with respect to confirmatory testing, ES 2016 guidelines recommend to avoid obtaining further confirmatory testing in patients with spontaneous hypokalemia, plasma renin below detection levels plus plasma aldosterone > 20 ng/dL (550 pmol/L).

---

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^6f71126e]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, more specifically with respect to plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio, initial testing, ES 2025 guidelines recommend to correct potassium to within the laboratory reference range if screening results are negative and the patient has hypokalemia, then repeat screening.

---

### Diagnosis and management of primary aldosteronism [^590e1170]. World Journal of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Identifying primary aldosteronism within the hypertensive population is an important clinical challenge, as most patients with a unilateral source of excess aldosterone secretion are amenable to surgical cure. At least 20% of patients with primary aldosteronism have normal serum potassium levels. Therefore, screening tests should not be based on recognition of hypokalemia alone. Rather, the diagnosis should depend on identifying renin suppression and measuring the ratio of plasma aldosterone concentration to plasma renin activity. The diagnosis may be confirmed by performing an aldosterone suppression test after oral salt loading. Once primary aldosteronism has been established, it is necessary to exclude glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism and then proceed to localization studies. Detecting a unilateral source of aldosterone, usually due to an adenoma (Conn syndrome), is achieved by postural hormonal testing and confirmed by selective venous sampling (SVS) with measurement of aldosterone concentrations (expressed as the aldosterone/cortisol ratio) in each adrenal vein. SVS is enjoying a revival in many institutions as it is more sensitive and specific than either cross-sectional imaging or scintigraphy and has the potential to influence significantly both the diagnosis and clinical decision-making. Patients with unilateral disease are ideally treated by laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Patients in whom localization is not achieved usually have bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and are treated medically.

### Selective hypoaldosteronism: a review [^c1de2438]. Endocrine Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Selective hypoaldosteronism (SH) is a condition manifested by hyperkalemia due to low aldosterone secretion with normal cortisol. One of the obstacles in diagnosis is the awareness of the condition itself. The objective of this review is to highlight what is known about the epidemiology, pathophysiology, etiology, presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of SH.

Methods

Literature search was performed on PubMed and Ovid Medline for articles which contained hypoaldosteronism as a major topic.

Results

The recent literature on this topic is surprisingly limited. Few recent review articles were found, none of which were in English and less than 5 years old. Case reports and genetic literature were also included in this review, as they contain the most recent reports of SH in the literature.

Conclusion

Awareness about SH will hopefully help physicians to identify patients at risk as well as decide on treatment if any therapy is required.

WHY MANAGING HYPERTENSION WITHOUT CONSIDERING PRIMARY ALDOSTERONISM IS NOT HELPFUL

Various causes of hypertension (i.e. secondary hypertension) have distinct treatments, and indiscriminately treating as essential hypertension could lead to a delay in appropriate diagnosis and treatment. In a survey study of patients with primary aldosteronism, approximately 30% of patients were found to have primary aldosteronism 1–3 years after they were diagnosed with hypertension; over half of patients had a delay of greater than 3 years. A retrospective study found that half of patients with hypokalemic primary aldosteronism experienced delays in diagnosis, with a median delay of 4.5 years. Missed diagnosis and delayed treatment of primary aldosteronism is particularly dangerous, as patients with primary aldosteronism are at higher risk for cardiovascular events and renal dysfunction compared to those with essential hypertension at similar blood pressure levels. This heightened risk is attributed to aldosterone‐mediated end‐organ damage resulting in endothelial dysfunction, vascular remodeling, fibrosis, and oxidative stress. Hundemer et al. found that compared to patients with essential hypertension, those with suppressed renin activity had excess risk for cardiovascular events and mortality with hazard ratio (HR) 2.83. Those who were adequately treated with unsuppressed renin had no significant excess risk.

Effective therapies for primary aldosteronism differ from those of essential hypertension. For example, primary aldosteronism due to bilateral disease is treated with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (e.g. spironolactone or eplerenone), which are not typical first‐line agents for management of essential hypertension. Similarly, primary aldosteronism due to unilateral disease can be effectively managed with adrenalectomy, which would not be appropriate for essential hypertension. Timely diagnosis allows for targeted medical and/or surgical management, which can help patients achieve blood pressure goals, reduce risk for cardiovascular events, reduce left ventricular mass, improve hypokalemia, improve kidney function, and reduce risk for all‐cause mortality.

Screening strategy for PA in hypertension

In the NICE Clinical Knowledge Summaries (CKS), clinical features of PA include hypokalaemia (spontaneous or thiazide-induced), metabolic alkalosis (elevated serum bicarbonate) and plasma sodium level greater than 140 mmol/L. Symptoms are non-specific, but might very rarely include tetany, muscle weakness, nocturia, or polyuria. Although these features undoubtedly help identify patients who are likely to present with PA, their absence should not exclude patients from being investigated, as most patients with PA are asymptomatic. Moreover, hypokalaemia which was considered a cardinal feature of PA occurs only in a minority of patients, and symptoms are even more rare. It is now commonly accepted that PA should not be considered a rare clinical phenotype but a form of hypertension characterized by autonomous aldosterone secretion which can coexist with normokalaemia and morphologically normal adrenal glands.

Table 1 summarizes the clinical scenarios in which the BIHS recommends diagnostic work-up for suspected PA among patients with arterial hypertension. The list includes three clinical situations more frequently associated with PA, and the screening of young subjects with newly diagnosed hypertension. In the latter group, routine screening for PA can be considered to facilitate an early diagnosis followed by a targeted treatment strategy. Despite most expert guidelines recommending screening for PA in these clinical conditions (such as resistant hypertension), in clinical practice only a fraction of the eligible patients are likely to be evaluated. Some practical guidelines also recommend screening patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (although this indication has been questioned), as well as subjects with evidence of hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD) "more severe" than expected from severity and duration of hypertension. There is evidence that aldosterone — in the presence of high salt intake — can contribute to left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis through mechanisms that are at least partly independent of its effects on blood pressure. However, no clinically meaningful reference values are available to define this "inappropriate" remodelling. Finally, in the PAPPHY (Prospective Appraisal of the Prevalence of Primary aldosteronism in HYpertensive patients) study, the prevalence of PA amongst patients with atrial fibrillation was almost four-times higher than in resistant hypertension. However, considering that atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in the general population (as well as in subjects with hypertension) and that conflicting data exist on the prevalence of PA in this group, the cost effectiveness of systematic screening in these patients warrants evaluation.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^72f7c03f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — underdiagnosis, screening, and treatment implications — remains largely underdiagnosed and undertreated, and screening is critically low and often delayed until years after hypertension has been diagnosed. The 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of elevated BP and hypertension suggest screening for PA in all adults with diagnosed hypertension. For treatment, individuals with lateralizing PA can often be cured through unilateral adrenalectomy, whereas those with bilateral PA typically benefit from mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), such as spironolactone or eplerenone, which effectively control BP, alleviate hypokalemia, and mitigate excess cardiovascular risk; however, MRAs are not routinely used as first-line treatments for hypertension, resulting in missed diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities for those with undiagnosed PA.

Introduction

Primary hyperaldosteronism (PA) comprise a heterogeneous group of familial and sporadic disorders characterized by a relatively autonomous renin-independent aldosterone production syndrome. PA can be classified into subtypes, that differ in terms of clinical management, including unilateral forms, which may be treated surgically (such as aldosterone-producing adenomas), and bilateral forms (such as bilateral adrenal hyperplasia/nodules) requiring medical management. The classical description of the disorder firstly made by Conn and colleagues in 1955 (syndrome of hypertension, sodium retention, and hypokalemic alkalosis that could be cured by removal of an adrenal cortical tumour) can be found in approximately one third of subjects, whilst adenoma with normokalaemia is the most common presentation. PA is a well characterized form of secondary hypertension in adults particularly in patients with resistant hypertension. Apart from being a potentially treatable form of hypertension, PA may also be an independent cardiovascular risk factor as affected subjects display an increased cardiovascular risk (including stroke, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, diabetes and metabolic syndrome), which is not fully explained by blood pressure level. However, uncertainty exists regarding the prevalence of the syndrome in the general hypertensive population due to screening bias and non-uniform criteria used to diagnose. In fact, it is commonly accepted that there is a continuum between low-renin primary (essential) hypertension and PA and a diagnosis is only obtained in patients who fulfil the criteria suggested for its diagnosis. Because of this, PA remains an often unrecognized condition particularly in subjects with resistant hypertension. The aim of this document is therefore to raise awareness about PA, guide clinicians in the screening/diagnosis process and support the treatment strategy to mitigate the adverse cardiometabolic effects in otherwise undiagnosed individuals.

### The potential role of primary care in case detection / screening of primary aldosteronism [^d3787dc7]. American Journal of Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Endocrine hypertension, particularly primary aldosteronism (PA), was previously considered to account for less than 1% of all hypertension and was suspected only when patients presented with spontaneous hypokalemia. However, the last 20 years of PA research has now clearly shown that PA is not a rarity, but rather, may account for up to 13% of unselected hypertensive individuals and between 10% and 20% of those with resistant hypertension. Most of these patients do not have spontaneous hypokalemia. The population prevalence of PA likely far exceeds actual detection rates in routine clinical care. As PA represents one of the most common, potentially reversible causes of hypertension, and is associated with significant cardiovascular complications over the long term, it is clear that a pragmatic strategy for targeted case detection in primary care is needed.

### Primary aldosteronism and its various clinical scenarios [^8fd1fae4]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Primary aldosteronism is the most frequent endocrine cause of secondary hypertension. Aldosterone excess damages the cardiovascular system.

Objectives

We compared biochemical; morphological, and cardiovascular risk differences among hypokalemic and normokalemic primary aldosteronism. We evaluated either both presentations correspond to two different entities or a unique disease in different evolutive stage.

Material and Methods

This is a retrospective study including 157 patients with primary aldosteronism divided into two groups: typical presentation (serum potassium < 3.5mmol/l, n = 87) and atypical presentation (serum potassium > 3.5mmol/l, n = 70).

Results

The typical presentation group showed higher family background of ischemic heart disease (P = 0.028), plasmatic aldosterone levels (P = 0.001), and cardiovascular added risk (P = 0.013). Although kalemia was corrected in the hypokalemic group after specific treatment, typical presentation maintained lower levels. Predictors of typical presentation were the highest tertile of aldosterone level, baseline DBP, and a longer evolution of hypertension. Aldosterone serum levels increased along time in primary aldosteronism and it can be considered as the most discriminative factor for the type of presentation.

Conclusion

Primary aldosteronism presentation along with normokalemia or hypokalemia could be the same disease at different evolution stages. Adequate detection of normokalemic primary aldosteronism deserves an early and intentional diagnostic attitude.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) management algorithm — In adults with hypertension in whom PA is likely, care is stratified by the probability of lateralizing PA. Low probability means "pursuing aldosterone suppression testing is not clinically necessary", and features can include "Aldosterone < 11 ng/dL (~305 pmol/L) by immunoassay or < ~8 ng/dL (~222 pmol/L) by LC–MS/MS", with patients who are low probability eligible to be "offered MRA therapy without further testing". High probability allows aldosterone suppression testing to be bypassed and is characterized by severe features such as hypokalemia and "Very low renin (PRC < 2 mIU/L or PRA < 0.2 ng/mL/h) with elevated aldosterone > 20 ng/dL (~554 pmol/L) by immunoassay or > ~15 ng/dL (~416 pmol/L) by LC–MS/MS", after which "cross-sectional imaging with CT or MRI and adrenal venous sampling (AVS) can be pursued". Intermediate probability prompts shared decision-making, where the patient may "prefer an empirical trial of MRA over proceeding to aldosterone suppression testing ± AVS", and lifelong medical therapy with a "mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA)" is "usually offered" for bilateral/unknown lateralization and "to those who are not surgical candidates or who decline the surgical option".

A few simple rules can allow physicians to successfully identify many patients with arterial hypertension caused by PA among the so-called essential hypertensive patients. The hyperaldosteronism and the hypokalemia can be cured with adrenalectomy in practically all of these patients. Moreover, in a substantial proportion of them, the blood pressure can be normalized or markedly lowered if a unilateral cause of PA is discovered. Hence, the screening for PA can be rewarding both for the patient and for the clinician, particularly in those cases where hypertension is severe and/or resistant to treatment, in which the removal of an APA can allow blood pressure to be brought under control despite withdrawal of, or a prominent reduction in, the number and doses of antihypertensive medications.

### Unravelling a mystery of hypokalemic hypertension-a rare case report of a reninoma [^ecd30cad]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Global hypertension prevalence studies in 2010 suggested that it affects 1 in 4 adults, amounting to a daunting total of 1.4 billion hypertensives worldwide. Hypertension is the number one risk factor for deaths globally. In addition to the contribution to morbidity and mortality of the population, there is a significant financial burden related to hypertension-related complications. To further complicate the issue, hypertension typically remains asymptomatic until signs of end-organ damage become apparent.

Depending on the population studied, 5%−10% of hypertensive patients have underlying secondary causes for hypertension, but the exact prevalence is unknown as there is selection bias in most studies. These secondary causes can be successfully treated when identified, curing hypertension. Primary aldosteronism, or renin-independent autonomous aldosterone production, is the most common and curable form of secondary hypertension. Although relatively uncommon, secondary aldosteronism, also known as renin-dependent aldosteronism, does occur. The main reason for secondary aldosteronism is the renovascular causes like renal artery stenosis secondary to atherosclerosis or rare forms like fibromuscular dysplasia or polyarteritis nodosa affecting the renal arteries. Renin-secreting tumours: reninomas/juxtaglomerular cell tumours are the rarest form of secondary aldosteronism.

Reninomas are more frequently reported in females (female to male ratio of 2:1), particularly those of childbearing age, with an average age of 27 years. The most common clinical features are hypertension and hypokalaemia, present in about 80% of cases, and are challenging to manage without renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers.

Biochemical tests typically show elevated plasma renin concentration and activity with elevated aldosterone levels. Further imaging studies are needed to find the cause of excess renin. Renal artery doppler and a CT angiogram are essential to rule out renal artery stenosis. If they are normal, the possibility of a reninoma should be entertained.

Reninomas usually appear as small cortical or corticomedullary lesions on imaging. On CT, they are iso-dense with slight contrast enhancement. On MRI T1 images, the lesion will be isointense, but T2 images can be iso, hypo or hyperintense. Functional imaging techniques like FDG PET or DOTATATE PET have not been effective in diagnosing reninomas.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^026c6cb5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, more specifically with respect to confirmatory testing, ES 2025 guidelines recommend to do not require aldosterone suppression testing before initiating PA-specific therapy in the following situations:

- do not obtain aldosterone suppression testing in patients with resistant hypertension or hypertension with hypokalemia and overt biochemical evidence of renin-independent aldosterone production, defined as plasma renin activity ≤ 0.2 ng/mL/h or direct renin concentration ≤ 2 mU/L and plasma aldosterone concentration ≥ 15 ng/dL (≥ 416 pmol/L) via liquid chromatography0tandem mass spectrometry assay or ≥ 20 ng/dL (≥ 554 pmol/L) via immunoassay, due to the risk of false-negative results, which may exceed the risk of false-positive screening results

- consider empirically treating patients unwilling or unable to pursue adrenal venous sampling and adrenalectomy with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists based on screening results, without aldosterone suppression testing; recognize that aldosterone suppression testing may still provide value in some cases for further documenting the diagnosis

- avoid obtaining aldosterone suppression testing in patients from families with germline mutations associated with familial hyperaldosteronism; obtain genetic screening for all first-degree relatives of patients with familial hyperaldosteronism and for patients with young-onset PA (< 20 years) to enable early diagnosis and treatment

- avoid obtaining aldosterone suppression testing if the likelihood of lateralizing PA is so low that pursuing a formal diagnosis of PA is not justifiable, such as in cases of normokalemia with plasma/serum aldosterone < ∼11 ng/dL (< ∼305 pmol/L) via immunoassay or < ∼8 ng/dL (< ∼222 pmol/L) via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

### Respiratory failure and rhabdomyolysis caused by severe hypokalemia in a young female with hypertension: a rare critical condition in primary aldosteronism [^05b943bc]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Data from the United States and England show the prevalence of hypertension was about 29% in 2007 and 30% in 2006, respectively. Approximately 35% of hypertensive patients in general, and higher rates in patients with drug-resistant hypertension, have secondary hypertension. General characteristics suggestive of secondary hypertension include early onset of hypertension, resistant or severe hypertension, hypertensive emergency, sudden increase in blood pressure, target organ damage, and non-dipping or reverse dipping during 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. These patients should be screened to exclude the most common causes of secondary hypertension, including obstructive sleep apnea, renal parenchymal and vascular diseases, primary aldosteronism, thyroid diseases, Cushing's syndrome, pheochromocytoma, and coarctation of the aorta.

Concomitant hypokalemia and hypertension narrow the differential diagnoses. The most probable causes of hypertension and hypokalemia include primary aldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, renovascular diseases, and other causes of secondary hyperaldosteronism and non-aldosterone mineralocorticoid excess. Hypokalemia in hypertensive patients must be evaluated for secondary hypertension due to hyperaldosteronism. Case detection is recommended in the following patients: sustained blood pressure above 150/100 on each of three measurements obtained on different days, hypertension (blood pressure > 140/90) resistant to three conventional antihypertensive drugs (including a diuretic), controlled blood pressure (blood pressure < 140/90) on four or more antihypertensive drugs, hypertension and spontaneous or diuretic-induced hypokalemia, hypertension and adrenal incidentaloma, hypertension and sleep apnea, hypertension and a family history of early onset hypertension or cerebrovascular accident at an age below 40 years, and all hypertensive first-degree relatives of patients with primary aldosteronism. Acute respiratory failure due to hypokalemia is a rare and life-threatening but treatable presentation of hypokalemia, and acute respiratory failure due to hypokalemia in primary aldosteronism is extremely rare.

### Diagnostic efficacy of aldosterone-to-renin ratio to screen primary aldosteronism in hypertension: a systemic review and meta-analysis [^367f4b96]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is increasingly recognized as the primary etiology of secondary hypertension worldwide. Global epidemiological studies have reported a prevalence of PA ranging from 5.9% to 11.2% in patients with hypertension, and up to 20% in those with resistant hypertension. Elevated blood pressure, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis are the hallmark presentations of PA. Compared with essential hypertension, the poor outcomes associated with PA are not exclusively attributed to high blood pressure, but also to systemic complications of excessive circulating aldosterone. Associations between PA with various conditions including atherosclerosis, myocardial remodeling, cerebrovascular events, and renal insufficiency have been reported, and a prompt diagnosis remains pivotal to facilitating targeted PA treatment and improving the prognosis.

The indications for PA screening are traditionally limited to patients with difficult-to-treat hypertension. The diagnosis of PA is traditionally based on consequential screening and confirmatory tests. Although the methodologies used to evaluate aldosterone suppression to confirm PA are heterogeneous, the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) remains the most widely applied screening tool for PA since its introduction in 1981, due to its ease of use in the outpatient setting. Although race and ethnicity have been addressed as important factors for hypertension and its etiologies, ARR has been endorsed globally by guidelines from the Endocrine Society, Europe, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, and North Americaand widely applied to detect PA in European, Asian, North, and South Americancohort studies with fair consistency. However, the cutoff values used in previous studies and targeted cohorts have varied, leading to discordant diagnostic performance. Therefore, the undetermined efficacy of screening tests remains an unmet clinical need, as it may diminish or amplify the PA confirmation rate.

Previous pooled analyses regarding PA diagnosis are also either out of date or involve pronounced bias. With the increase in the number of observational studies, revisiting the literature related to PA screening and further comprehensive diagnostic meta-analyses are important to elucidate the accuracy of ARR as a screening test for PA. Therefore, the aims of this study were to elucidate the performance of ARR screening in hypertensive patients and investigate the performance of screening tests across different patient phenotypes to validate their applicability.

Primary aldosteronism — screening recommendations — states: In adults with hypertension, screening for primary aldosteronism is recommended in the presence of any of the following conditions to increase rates of detection, diagnosis, and specific targeted therapy: resistant hypertension (regardless of whether hypokalemia is present), hypokalemia (spontaneous or diuretic induced), OSA, incidentally discovered adrenal mass, family history of early-onset hypertension, or stroke at a young age (< 40 years). In adults with stage 2 hypertension, screening for primary aldosteronism may be considered to increase rates of detection, diagnosis, and specific targeted therapy.

### Primary aldosteronism: a common cause of resistant hypertension [^310eaa45]. CMAJ (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on primary aldosteronism:

- **Definition**: Primary hyperaldosteronism is an endocrine disorder characterized by excessive secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal glands.
- **Pathophysiology**: Hypersecretion of aldosterone may be due to neoplasia of the adrenal glands (adrenal adenoma or adrenocortical carcinoma), adrenal hyperplasia (typically bilateral), mutations in genes coding for enzymes involved in aldosterone synthesis (familial hyperaldosteronism), or may be idiopathic. Ectopic aldosterone-producing adenoma or carcinoma accounts for < 0.1% of cases.
- **Epidemiology**: In patients with secondary hypertension, the prevalence of primary hyperaldosteronism is estimated at 5–20%.
- **Disease course**: Increased plasma aldosterone leads to the clinical manifestations of resistant hypertension and hypokalemia. Untreated disease may result in early cardiovascular complications and CKD.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Patients with PA have an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity (including myocardial infarction, stroke, and AF) as compared with patients with matched controls with essential hypertension. The 10-year survival of patients with hyperaldosteronism is similar to that of matched hypertensive controls.

### Case detection, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^626266d9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to develop clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with primary aldosteronism.

Participants

The Task Force comprised a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS) of The Endocrine Society, six additional experts, one methodologist, and a medical writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Evidence

Systematic reviews of available evidence were used to formulate the key treatment and prevention recommendations. We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) group criteria to describe both the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations. We used "recommend" for strong recommendations and "suggest" for weak recommendations.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during one group meeting, several conference calls, and multiple e-mail communications. The drafts prepared by the task force with the help of a medical writer were reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's CGS, Clinical Affairs Core Committee (CACC), and Council. The version approved by the CGS and CACC was placed on The Endocrine Society's Web site for comments by members. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes.

Conclusions

We recommend case detection of primary aldosteronism be sought in higher risk groups of hypertensive patients and those with hypokalemia by determining the aldosterone-renin ratio under standard conditions and that the condition be confirmed/excluded by one of four commonly used confirmatory tests. We recommend that all patients with primary aldosteronism undergo adrenal computed tomography as the initial study in subtype testing and to exclude adrenocortical carcinoma. We recommend the presence of a unilateral form of primary aldosteronism should be established/excluded by bilateral adrenal venous sampling by an experienced radiologist and, where present, optimally treated by laparoscopic adrenalectomy. We recommend that patients with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, or those unsuitable for surgery, optimally be treated medically by mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

### Prolonged hypokalemia and delayed diagnosis of primary aldosteronism: clinical course and risk factors [^e1526d36]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Context

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a common cause of hypertension (HT). However, diagnosis is often delayed, leading to poorer clinical outcomes. Hypokalemia with HT is characteristic of PA, and is an indication for screening.

Objective

We evaluated if patients with PA had prolonged hypokalemia before diagnosis, the subsequent biochemical/clinical control, and factors associated with delayed diagnosis.

Methods

Our study included all PA patients with hypokalemia diagnosed between 2001 and 2022. Delayed diagnosis was defined as duration of hypokalemia of more than 1 year from first occurrence to first evaluation by a PA specialist. Patients were reassessed post adrenalectomy using the Primary Aldosteronism Surgery Outcomes criteria. We performed multivariable analysis to assess for factors associated with delayed diagnosis.

Results

Among 240 patients with PA who presented with hypokalemia, 122 (51%) patients had delayed diagnosis, with prolonged hypokalemia of median duration 4.5 years (range, 2.4–7.5 years). Patients with delayed diagnosis were older, had longer duration of HT, higher pill burden, lower renal function, and more prevalent cardiovascular disease. Factors associated with delayed diagnosis included older age, presence of hyperlipidemia, and less severe hypokalemia (serum potassium > 3.0mmol/L). Compared to patients with early diagnosis, a lower proportion of those with delayed diagnosis underwent adrenal vein sampling (73% vs 58%) (P < .05). Sixty of 118 (50.8%) nondelayed, and 39 of 122 (32.0%) patients with delayed diagnosis, underwent surgery.

Conclusion

Despite manifestation of hypokalemia, many patients with PA fail to be promptly screened. Greater emphasis in HT guidelines, and efforts to improve awareness of PA among primary care physicians, are urgently needed.

### Primary hyperaldosteronism… [^41793f03]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Main Outcome Measures We compared demographic factors, results of biochemical and imaging studies, therapy, and patient outcomes. Results. The mean PAC was 52. 4 ± 15 ng/dL, and the mean PRA was

1. 26 ± 0. 3 pg/mL per hour. The mean aldosterone-renin ratio was 167 ± 61. Patients with APAs had higher serum aldosterone levels and PRA than patients with bilateral aldosterone hypersecretion, respectively). Using the criteria mentioned previously herein, unilateral aldosterone hypersecretion was identified in 29 of 41 patients. Fourteen patients lateralized to the right adrenal gland, and 15 lateralized to the left adrenal gland. Twelve patients had bilateral adrenal hyperaldosteronism.

The A/C ratio in the unilateral hypersecreting adrenal gland was 34 times the ratio in the contralateral side. The mean dominant-nondominant A/C ratio in patients with BH was 1.
9. These findings are similar to those of previous studies, 15, 16 which confirm an important role for AVS in patients with PH. Rossi and colleagues16 found AVS to be highly diagnostic of APA in patients with equivocal CT or magnetic resonance imaging results. Although their results remain important, patients with "unequivocal" imaging studies were excluded, as were those with tumors larger than 1. 8 cm. Doppman et al18, 21 found that after corticotropin infusion, most patients with APA or primary adrenal hyperplasia demonstrated a corrected aldosterone greater than 5: 1 between the dominant and nondominant sides.

However, more recently, Rossi et al16 found that the ratio of corrected aldosterone in the dominant compared with the nondominant adrenal gland provided the best sensitivity, and the threshold of greater than 2 had the best combination of sensitivity and false-positive rates.

### Development of a clinical decision tool to reduce diagnostic testing for primary aldosteronism in patients with difficult-to-control hypertension [^0d99714a]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is one of the most common causes of secondary hypertension. The estimated prevalence ranges from 3–6% in primary care to 5–11% in referred hypertensive patients and is even higher in patients with resistant hypertension (more than 11%). Diagnosing PA is important as targeted therapy may lower the increased risk for cardiovascular events and target organ damage in these patients.

As supported by the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline, diagnosis of PA is generally made by a sequence of blood tests: elevated aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR), followed by confirmation of autonomous aldosterone production by non-suppressible aldosterone levels. Many antihypertensive medications change renin and aldosterone levels, falsely increasing or decreasing the ARR, which leads to false positive or false negative test results. Therefore, aldosterone and renin levels are usually determined after cessation of antihypertensive medications that affect the ARR. However, medication washout raises safety concerns in patients with severe hypertension or individuals with a recent cardiovascular event in which tight blood pressure (BP) control is necessary. In addition, a substantial number of patients experience symptoms during the washout period: i.e. (worsening of) headache, fatigue or palpitations.

Since diagnostic testing is burdensome, potentially harmful and costly, it is necessary to select carefully which patients to further test for PA. The Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline recommends to perform diagnostic testing in all patients with 'an increased risk of having PA', this includes patients with hypertension and either sustained BP above 150/100 mmHg, spontaneous or diuretic-induced hypokalemia, adrenal incidentaloma, obstructive sleep apnea or a family history of early onset hypertension or cerebrovascular accident, patients with resistant hypertension and first-degree relatives of patients with PA. The majority of hypertensive patients referred to hospitals fulfil at least one of these criteria, meaning that most referred patients should be tested for PA. With a prevalence of 4–10% this strategy results in many negative test results and thus to unnecessary testing and costs. This may be one of the reasons that the Clinical Practice Guideline is poorly adopted and that many patients with hypertension are left unscreened for PA. Therefore, we aimed to develop and validate a clinical decision tool to determine which patients with difficult-to-control hypertension have a low probability of PA and do not need to undergo intensive testing. Thereby we aim to limit exposure to invasive testing while at the same time increasing the efficiency of testing in the remaining patients.

### A podcast discussing aldosterone and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in 2021: a paradigm shift [^bcd0c20d]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Could I just ask you to talk a little about primary aldosteronism and its prevalence?

The classic view, dating back 50 years to the seminal work of Jerome Conn at that time, at the University of Michigan, is that primary aldosteronism was manifested by hypertension. This new entity called primary aldosteronism (later named Conn's syndrome), was caused by an adrenal tumor secreting excessive amounts of the adrenal hormone aldosterone, As originally defined, primary aldosteronism was associated with hypokalaemia, present in approximately 40% of patients, and usually there was a lack of oedema in this setting. The reason for that was the mechanism of aldosterone escape, which I will return to later, leading to an increase in natriuresis and diuresis. And, finally, it was believed that the excess of aldosterone resulted in metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesaemia, and mild hypernatraemia. Again, if we were sitting in an office with our patient in 1990, the tell-tale signs we would look for would be hypokalaemia and substantial hypertension and metabolic alkalosis. And we were also taught that primary aldosteronism is a rare and categorical disease.

Recently, there has been a huge paradigm shift, and our current understanding of primary aldosteronism has been completely revised. This was best summarised in a landmark publication by a group of major investigators in the field published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in 2020. Brown et al. showed that the prevalence of primary aldosteronism is high and, importantly for all of us in clinical medicine, remains largely unrecognised. Furthermore, that severe hypertension and hypokalaemia are not prerequisites for the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism; rather, it can frequently be detected not only in normokalaemic hypertensive patients, but, indeed, across a very wide spectrum of blood pressure alterations.

Essentially, these observations have served to radically redefine primary aldosteronism. From a disease that, historically, was identified as a rare, infrequent cause of hypertension to what we now know it as today: a common syndrome that plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of hypertension.

### Primary aldosteronism: current knowledge and controversies in Conn's syndrome [^e60f1f3c]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Medium credibility.

Primary aldosteronism has been recognized as a common cause of secondary hypertension, accounting for approximately 10% of the hypertensive population. Screening should be applied in hypertensive patients presenting with one of the following: hypokalemia, refractory hypertension, suggestive family history, or an incidentally detected adrenal mass. The most advocated screening test at present is the aldosterone-to-renin ratio, which has a high sensitivity but low specificity. The specificity increases if patients with low aldosterone concentrations are excluded. Published cut-off values vary depending on the hormone assay and the investigated population. Before screening, antihypertensive treatment, especially aldosterone antagonists and beta-blockers, should be discontinued. A pathologic result requires additional work up to prove mineralocorticoid excess. Subtype differentiation is performed by adrenal venous sampling combined with imaging (CT or MRI). One-third of cases are due to aldosterone-producing adenomas, for which the preferred treatment is laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (idiopathic aldosteronism) underlies two-thirds of cases and requires treatment with aldosterone antagonists. Treatment is started with low doses of spironolactone (25–50 mg once daily), which often results in substantial improvements in hypertension.

### Primary aldosteronism, a common entity? the myth persists [^79bb1938]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Primary aldosterone excess or hyperaldosteronism is an important cause of hypertension which, when associated with an aldosterone secreting adenoma, is amenable to surgical cure. The biochemical hallmarks of the condition are a relative excess of aldosterone production with suppression of plasma levels of renin (a proxy for angiotensin II, the major trophic substance regulating aldosterone secretion). This combination of a high aldosterone and a low renin is however more commonly associated with 'nodular hyperplasia' of the adrenal glands, a condition not improved by surgery and variably responsive to the effects of the mineralocorticoid antagonist, spironolactone. Until recently the prevalence of either form of secondary hypertension has been thought to be low such that few clinicians 'hunted' for it in the absence of hypokalaemia (the traditional clue for the syndrome). This view has been challenged, firstly by the realisation that no more than 50% of such patients will have a low plasma potassium and secondly by the assumption that a 'normal' plasma aldosterone is in fact inappropriately elevated if the renin level is low. A single measurement of the ratio of aldosterone to renin levels is claimed to be highly predictive of patients who will have primary aldosterone excess. This paper examines the logic behind such claims and presents evidence from the literature that an abnormal ratio is simply a different description of the low renin state and that such patients do not necessarily have mineralocorticoid hypertension. Most patients 'discovered' by this test will have what many call low-renin hypertension, a condition not amenable to specific therapy. Claims that they are peculiarly sensitive to the hypotensive effects of spironolactone have not been tested in controlled trials. The test would however be expected to pick up those individuals with true Conn's syndrome but such patients remain too few in number to justify widespread use of an expensive screening test.

Primary aldosteronism — screening caveats note limited sensitivity of hypokalemia and potential need for sodium loading: Spontaneous hypokalemia is present only in 20% to 50% of patients with primary aldosteronism, and therefore, the decision to perform primary aldosteronism screening should not rely on a history of hypokalemia alone; screening for primary hyperaldosteronism may require sodium loading to induce aldosterone suppression if plasma screening by the aldosterone-to-renin ratio is inconclusive.

### Primary aldosteronism [^ec21102f]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Primary aldosteronism is the underlying cause of hypertension in primary care settings in approximately 6% of cases, and it is even more common in patients with resistant hypertension. However, it is estimated that only about 2% of patients who have risk factors for primary aldosteronism have been formally tested or diagnosed. The first step in the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism is case detection and involves testing patients who are at risk, including individuals with resistant hypertension, as well as those with well-controlled hypertension and a first-degree relative with primary aldosteronism, hypokalemia, an adrenal nodule, atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnea, or a family history of an early stroke (i.e., younger than 40 years). Initial case detection is performed by simultaneously measuring plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin activity; an elevated aldosterone-renin ratio (greater than 30) indicates independent aldosterone secretion (i.e., aldosteronism). After a positive case detection, confirmatory testing should be performed. Confirmatory tests include the captopril challenge, oral or intravenous salt loading, or fludrocortisone suppression. Results are positive if aldosterone levels remain high after interventions that suppress or interrupt physiologic production of aldosterone. If the confirmatory test is positive, adrenal computed tomography and adrenal vein sampling should be performed to differentiate unilateral from bilateral adrenal production of aldosterone. Patients with unilateral primary aldosteronism should undergo adrenalectomy, whereas those with bilateral production should be treated with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, such as spironolactone or eplerenone.

### Aldo is back: recent advances and unresolved controversies in hyperaldosteronism [^076ee40b]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hyperaldosteronism in its various forms is a recognized secondary cause of hypertension, yet the frequency of these disorders and the appropriate evaluation of suspected patients remain controversial. This review will summarize recent literature concerning the frequency of hyperaldosteronism in the hypertensive population, insight from uncommon forms of hyperaldosteronism, and new developments in the diagnosis and treatment of this condition.

Recent Findings

Several series report that around 10% of hypertensive patients have some form of hyperaldosteronism, but aldosterone-producing adenomas are rare. Diagnostic criteria for idiopathic hyperaldosteronism remain controversial, as is the wisdom of widespread screening. Patients with even mild hyperaldosteronism, however, which could be a continuum with low-renin hypertension, may respond exceptionally well to mineralocorticoid antagonism. Eplerenone, a new mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist without antiandrogen side effects, has been an effective antihypertensive in clinical trials and appears to be particularly suitable for low-renin hypertensives. Accumulating evidence suggests that aldosterone excess is cardiotoxic and nephrotoxic, suggesting that mineralocorticoid blockade has specific benefits beyond blood pressure reduction. For patients with severe, confirmed hyperaldosteronism, selective adrenal vein sampling is the only reliable method for determining the source of the aldosterone.

Summary

Hyperaldosteronism, when defined with liberal criteria, could account for a substantial portion of hypertension. Few of these patients will harbor adrenal adenomas, but those with severe hypertension and hypokalemia often require adrenal vein sampling to direct surgery. With more precise diagnostic strategies, better treatments, and evolving evidence of pathological consequences of aldosterone excess, subtle disorders of aldosterone excess demand precise definition and specific treatment.

### Genetics of primary aldosteronism [^6f41d206]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Aldosterone, the main mineralocorticoid hormone, is physiologically produced in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex. By binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor, it activates signaling cascades leading to increased renal salt and water reabsorption, as well as increased potassium and proton secretion. The production of aldosterone is normally tightly regulated. Angiotensin II (the main product of the renin-angiotensin system) and elevated serum potassium levels are the main stimuli of aldosterone production; adrenocorticotropic hormone can also temporarily increase aldosterone levels. In primary aldosteronism (PA), levels of aldosterone are inappropriate for salt, volume, and/or potassium status. This excess production causes variable degrees of hypertension, possible hypokalemia, and disproportionately high levels of cardiovascular disease.PA is considered the most important cause of secondary hypertension. An Italian study of 1672 primary care patients with hypertension, following the Endocrine Society guidelines for diagnosis, reported an overall prevalence of 5.9%, ranging from 3.9 in stage 1 hypertension to 11.8% in stage 3 hypertenson. Recently, using urinary aldosterone for diagnosis, even higher prevalence estimates for biochemically overt PA were reported, from 11.3% in normotension to 22.0% in stage 3 hypertension.

Traditionally, several subforms of PA were distinguished: bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, also known as idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (about 60% of cases), aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs; about 30% of cases), unilateral hyperplasia (less common), malignancy, and familial hyperaldosteronism (FH; both very rare). Recent histological and genetic studies have challenged this concept and will be discussed in this review. The diagnosis of PA is complicated, based upon the aldosterone/renin ratio as screening parameter and subsequent confirmatory testing. Of clinical importance is the distinction between unilateral and bilateral forms because unilateral forms are amenable to potentially curative surgery, whereas bilateral forms are treated with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

Until 2011, the molecular mechanisms underlying autonomous aldosterone production in PA were largely unknown. Discoveries made over the last decade, their potential future impact on clinical PA management and open questions in the field of PA genetics will be covered in this review.

### Primary aldosteronism: renaissance of a syndrome [^f6f55277]. Clinical Endocrinology (2007). Low credibility.

Great strides have been made in our understanding of the pathophysiology of primary aldosteronism syndrome since Conn's description of the clinical presentation of a patient with an aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) more than 50 years ago. It is now recognized that the APA is just one of the seven subtypes of primary aldosteronism. APA and bilateral idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA) are the most common subtypes of primary aldosteronism. Although most clinicians had thought primary aldosteronism to be a rare form of hypertension for more than three decades, it is now recognized to be the most common form of secondary hypertension. Using the plasma aldosterone to plasma renin activity ratio as a case-finding test, followed by aldosterone suppression confirmatory testing, has resulted in much higher prevalence estimates of 5–13% of all patients with hypertension. In addition, there has been a new recognition of the aldosterone-specific cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with aldosterone excess. Although thought to be daunting and complex in the past, the diagnostic approach to primary aldosteronism is straightforward and can be considered in three phases: case-finding tests, confirmatory tests and subtype evaluation tests. Patients with hypertension and hypokalaemia (regardless of presumed cause), treatment-resistant hypertension (three antihypertensive drugs and poor control), severe hypertension (≥ 160 mmHg systolic or ≥ 100 mmHg diastolic), hypertension and an incidental adrenal mass, onset of hypertension at a young age or patients being evaluated for other forms of secondary hypertension should undergo screening for primary aldosteronism. In patients with suspected primary aldosteronism, screening can be accomplished by measuring a morning (preferably between 0800 and 1000 h) ambulatory paired random plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) and plasma renin activity (PRA). An increased PAC:PRA ratio is not diagnostic by itself, and primary aldosteronism must be confirmed by demonstrating inappropriate aldosterone secretion. Aldosterone suppression testing can be performed with orally administered sodium chloride and measurement of urinary aldosterone or with intravenous sodium chloride loading and measurement of PAC. Unilateral adrenalectomy in patients with APA or unilateral adrenal hyperplasia results in normalization of hypokalaemia in all these patients; hypertension is improved in all and is cured in approximately 30–60% of them. In bilateral adrenal forms of primary aldosteronism, unilateral or bilateral adrenalectomy seldom corrects the hypertension and they should be treated medically with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^fcc799c5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Screening for primary aldosteronism in individuals with hypertension — recommendation and technical steps: We recommend primary aldosteronism (PA) screening with serum/plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin (concentration or activity). Screen for PA by measuring serum/plasma aldosterone and plasma renin (concentration or activity) in the morning with individuals seated and avoiding dietary sodium restriction during the few days prior to screening. Potassium should be measured alongside renin and aldosterone — not for screening itself, but to aid in the accurate interpretation of aldosterone — as a low potassium may lead to a falsely low aldosterone; if screening results are negative and the patient has hypokalemia, potassium should be corrected to within the laboratory reference range and screening should be repeated. Manage interfering medications depending on individual safety and feasibility, and the Guideline Development Panel outlined both minimal-withdrawal and no-withdrawal strategies of interfering medications before screening. A positive screen meets both of the following in most circumstances: renin is low/suppressed and aldosterone is inappropriately high relative to renin.

### Treating primary aldosteronism-induced hypertension: novel approaches and future outlooks [^d59aa0f9]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

PA arises from excessive, unregulated secretion of the steroid hormone aldosterone. This is most commonly attributable to an aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA), or other neoplasia/hyperplasia of aldosterone-producing cells within the zona glomerulosa (ZG) of the adrenal cortex, with recent consensus reached for nomenclature to describe the underlying histopathological findings (Table 1).

Table 1.
Summary of the HISTALDO (histopathology of primary aldosteronism) consensus nomenclature

Clinically, PA results in stage/grade I to III hypertension in > 97% of patients, and spontaneous or drug induced hypokalemia in approximately 50% of cases with an apparent APA. PA is associated with higher cardiovascular morbidity than age- and blood pressure (BP)–matched primary hypertension. This has been demonstrated consistently across several observational studies and confirmed in a recent meta-analysis. Individuals with PA demonstrate higher risk of atrial fibrillation (odds ratio 3.52), stroke (2.58), coronary artery disease (1.77), heart failure (2.05), diabetes (1.33), metabolic syndrome (1.53), and left ventricular hypertrophy (2.29) than patients with primary hypertension. Elevated aldosterone levels are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality, especially in cases where aldosterone levels misalign with renin levels and sodium intake. In this regard, Hundemer and colleagues have highlighted that renin de-suppression (to within the reference range) in addition to BP control, either by medical therapy or adrenalectomy, is necessary to reduce excess risk to levels seen in those with primary hypertension. Therefore, it is desirable in PA to target both BP and biochemical outcomes (ie, renin desuppression).

Prevalence of primary hyperaldosteronism

The prevalence of PA in the hypertensive population remains controversial and depends upon the population being examined. Historically, PA has been considered a very rare disease although often only selected populations were considered (such as patients with hypokalaemia). More recent investigations disputed those early findings, although the majority of studies were carried out in specialized referral centres, raising concerns regarding potential selection bias. In fact, the prevalence of PA varies according to the clinical setting and the criteria used for its diagnosis.

In the general hypertensive population, the prevalence of PA has significant uncertainties (from almost 6% to less than 2%), with surgically treatable forms representing half of the cases. Data from primary care are in fact conflicting with a significantly higher prevalence being reported, although many studies were based upon an elevated aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR) without complete diagnostic work up (ARR is related with false positive results in up to 30–50% of patients who then undergo further confirmatory testing and investigations).

The prevalence of PA increases with the severity of hypertension and in specialist referral centres, the proportion of subjects with PA is likely to be substantially higher compared to the primary care setting. Data from European specialist centres suggests an overall prevalence greater than 5%. It is also commonly accepted that the prevalence of PA is higher in subjects with hypokalaemia and increases with the severity of hypertension, thus exceeds 10% in patients with resistant hypertension.

Despite the above-mentioned limitations, a large body of evidence over the last few decades has confirmed that PA is less rare than originally thought, although uncertainties regarding the precise prevalence of the condition in unselected hypertensive populations persist. Finally, the prevalence of PA has not been systematically determined amongst different ethnicities including subjects of African origin background. Many studies, including some performed in the UK, have demonstrated that plasma renin level is lower in hypertensive black individuals compared with white subjects although the evidence that aldosterone-associated hypertension is more common in African origin subjects is lacking.

Summary

Data on PA prevalence, in unselected hypertensive populations, are conflicting.
The prevalence of PA increases with the severity of hypertension and is likely to exceed 10% patients with resistant hypertension or those with hypokalaemia.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^de2a668d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) screening outcomes — after the widespread adoption of the aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR) in hypertension, identification of PA increased 5- to 15-fold. Only between 9% and 37% of individuals had hypokalemia, and across three prospective studies totaling 5797 individuals, only 25% to 30% of those with confirmed PA had hypokalemia. In a study of 95 individuals with lateralizing PA, more than 90% had suppressed renin preoperatively, whereas 62% to 67% had hypokalemia requiring potassium supplementation preoperatively. The ARR was effective at screening for PA, and most cases were ultimately diagnosed with bilateral PA.

Improving the Diagnosis of PA

Overcoming Challenges of the Current Diagnostic Approach

Early diagnosis of PA predicts response to therapy. Ideally screening should be undertaken in primary care or by generalists (ie, at the time when hypertension is first recognized), using laboratory tests which are readily available and easy to interpret. Current screening for PA typically relies on determining the ARR. Measurement of plasma aldosterone and plasma renin, and interpretation of the ARR, is challenged by (1) assay availability, (2) stability of renin at room temperature following venesection, (3) requirement for specific sampling conditions (midmorning, seated for 15 minutes following 2 hours ambulation), (4) assay interpretation in the face of interfering antihypertensive medications, (5) requirement for confirmatory testing to establish the diagnosis due to low specificity of the ARR (approx. 65%), and (6) the intraindividual variability in screening aldosterone concentrations, renin measurements (plasma renin concentration and plasma renin activity), and their corresponding ARRs. Consequently, given these apparent complexities, apprehension among primary care physicians and generalists means that even a 50% screening threshold of "at risk" patients is rarely achieved, let alone the recommendation by some experts that all hypertensive patients should be assessed for PA at the time of diagnosis of hypertension.

The finding of a low serum potassium in a patient with hypertension has traditionally been viewed as a key trigger to screen for PA. However, not only does this overlook the significant proportion of patients with PA who do not exhibit hypokalemia, but even when present low serum potassium might not be evident if there are delays in samples reaching the laboratory as may occur with more rural practices, with resultant sample hemolysis.

A more pragmatic and practical approach is therefore required to (1) improve recognition of patients who should be prioritized for PA screening, (2) facilitate interpretation of ARR or other screening tests in the face of potential medication interference, and (3) increase access to laboratory assays which do not require specialist sample handling within primary care, and which therefore have greater potential to reveal the presence of PA in hypertensive patients. In this regard, the introduction of laboratory assays/methods that can be more easily performed on samples (blood or urine) collected in a nonspecialist setting should offer the prospect of getting many more patients over the first hurdle and onwards toward successful treatment.

### Neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^7ea0304e]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — evaluation and management: When primary aldosteronism is suspected, plasma aldosterone and plasma renin activity should be assessed, and the plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio in patients with primary aldosteronism is usually > 30. Confirmatory testing is recommended if positive results are obtained, and oral or IV salt loading with measurement of urine or plasma aldosterone is recommended to test for adequate suppression. Serum electrolytes should also be measured, because excessive aldosterone production causes both sodium retention and potassium excretion. Benign primary aldosteronism is much more common and can be caused by a unilateral adrenal adenoma or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. Adrenal vein sampling for aldosterone can be considered for distinguishing these two causes of benign primary aldosteronism and should be considered if the patient is a surgical candidate, because CT imaging cannot always differentiate between an adenoma and hyperplasia. It may be reasonable to exclude adrenal vein sampling in patients < 40 years when imaging only shows one affected gland, because bilateral hyperplasia is rare in this population. Cortisol measurement in the catheterization samples is used to confirm proper catheter placement. Minimally invasive adrenalectomy is recommended for adenoma, whereas medical management with spironolactone or eplerenone for hypertension and hypokalemia is recommended for patients with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and for nonsurgical candidates.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary aldosteronism: practical clinical perspectives [^8dacca65]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Primary aldosteronism (PA), the most common form of secondary hypertension, can be either surgically cured or treated with targeted pharmacotherapy. PA is frequently undiagnosed and untreated, leading to aldosterone-specific cardiovascular morbidity and nephrotoxicity. Thus, clinicians should perform case detection testing for PA at least once in all patients with hypertension. Confirmatory testing is indicated in most patients with positive case detection testing results. The next step is to determine whether patients with confirmed PA have a disease that can be cured with surgery or whether it should be treated medically; this step is guided by computed tomography scan of the adrenal glands and adrenal venous sampling. With appropriate surgical expertise, laparoscopic unilateral adrenalectomy is safe, efficient and curative in patients with unilateral adrenal disease. In patients who have bilateral aldosterone hypersecretion, the optimal management is a low-sodium diet and lifelong treatment with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist administered at a dosage to maintain a high-normal serum potassium concentration without the aid of oral potassium supplements.

### Severe hyperkalemia following adrenalectomy for aldosteronoma: prediction, pathogenesis and approach to clinical management-a case series [^805add7c]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is characterized by hypertension, suppressed plasma renin levels, inappropriately high aldosterone secretion and in some cases hypokalemia. PA accounts for about 10% of hypertensive patients who are known to have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease as compared to patients with essential hypertension. For those with an Aldosterone producing adenoma (APA), adrenalectomy offers a high rate of possible cure.

Moderate-to-severe hyperkalemia post adrenalectomy has been described in the literature but the risk factors and outpatient management is not very well delineated. We describe three cases of severe post adrenalectomy hyperkalemia requiring complex and long term therapy and discuss the known risk factors for developing post APA-resection hyperkalemia and suggest an approach to outpatient endocrinology management.

Current challenges in screening

PA is underdiagnosed and undertreated in current clinical practice, where screening and diagnosis are the principal challenges that limit effective management (traditional diagnosis/treatment workflow for PA highlighted in Figs. 1 and Figs. 2). Overall, there is no consensus on recommended screening for PA in hypertensive individuals, within either primary or secondary care settings. The Endocrine Society guidelines for the diagnosis and management of PA recommend screening up to 50% of "at risk" patients for PA. Screening under these recommendations should be carried out using the aldosterone–renin ratio (ARR) with particular attention paid to those with (1) severe hypertension; (2) hypertension with spontaneous or diuretic-induced hypokalemia; (3) an adrenal mass; (4) sleep apnea; (5) a family history of early-onset hypertension; (6) stroke at a young age; or (7) a first-degree relative who has PA. American Heart Association guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hypertension, align with the Endocrine Society guidelines in terms of recognized risk factors which should trigger screening for PA; in contrast, European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidance do not emphasize the need to screen for PA except in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension (approximately 5% of all patients). Some national guidelines for the management of hypertension, such as those of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK, do not specifically reference screening for PA.

### Adrenal mass causing secondary hypertension [^39c8e0c5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Most hypertensive patients have essential (primary) hypertension; only 5% to 10% have a secondary cause. Two clinical characteristics suggestive of secondary hypertension are early onset (< 30 years of age) and severe hypertension (> 180/110 mm Hg). When faced with these findings, clinicians should consider a secondary cause of hypertension.

Case Report

A 22-year-old woman being evaluated for asthma exacerbation in the emergency department was noted to have severe persistent hypertension. Additional evaluation revealed severe hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypernatremia. The patient was admitted to the hospital for blood pressure management, electrolyte replacement, and further evaluation of presumed hyperaldosteronism. Diagnostic imaging revealed a large adrenal mass. Surgical resection was performed, leading to a diagnosis of hyperaldosteronism caused by adrenal carcinoma. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Secondary hypertension is far less common than essential hypertension; however, considering the large volume of patients seen in emergency departments, it is likely that some will have secondary hypertension. Emergency physicians should be aware of the clinical characteristics that suggest secondary hypertension so that the appropriate diagnostic and treatment pathways can be pursued.

Case confirmation

Most guidelines/expert opinions suggest performing one or more confirmatory tests to definitively confirm the diagnosis of PA. These tests are based on the premise that in PA the aldosterone secretion is at least in partially autonomous from renin and therefore angiotensin release. Tests are also justified by the need to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures such as adrenal vein sampling (AVS) or surgery. Commonly performed confirmatory tests comprise the oral sodium loading test, the saline infusion test and the captopril challenge test, and the fludrocortisone salt loading test (Table 4). Tests should be performed according to local expertise and availability and usually require a careful preparation of the patient. In centres where dedicated facilities are not available, oral sodium loading test and captopril challenge tests should be considered since they can be performed in an outpatient setting. Despite the importance usually attributed to confirmatory tests, their use is not evidence-based, as none of the studies supporting their use for diagnosing primary aldosteronism met state-of-the-art criteria for validation of diagnostic tests.

Table 4
Confirmatory tests used for PA diagnosis.

PAC plasma aldosterone concentration, U-Aldo 24-hour urinary aldosterone, ARR aldosterone-renin-ratio, PA primary hyperaldosteronisms, BP blood pressure.

Since 2016 the Endocrine Society Guidelines, recognizing the burden (and perhaps limitations) carried by the confirmatory tests, suggested the possibility of bypassing them in patients with a florid clinical phenotype, e.g. an elevated ARR, high aldosterone concentration (> 20 ng/dL) and spontaneous hypokalaemia. The BIHS also supports the opportunity of considering avoiding confirmatory tests on a case by case basis in subjects unsuitable for washout who have elevated ARR and/or adrenal abnormalities (although this is not evidence based).

For patients who have had ARR measured without pharmacological washout from interfering drugs, it's important to consider clinical features (such as difficulties in controlling hypertension or hypokalemia) alongside biochemical findings.

### Identification of risk loci for primary aldosteronism in genome-wide association studies [^211839f4]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

High blood pressure is the leading global contributor to premature death, accounting for more than 10 million deaths and over 200 million disability-adjusted life years. Remarkably, each increment of 20 mmHg in SBP is associated with about a twofold difference in age-specific mortality rates from stroke, ischemic heart disease, and other vascular causes. Despite this ample evidence, in two thirds of patients, blood pressure is not controlled sufficiently to reach accepted targets. Detection of secondary forms of hypertension is key to targeted management and prevention of cardiovascular complications. PA is the most common form of secondary and curable hypertension, with a prevalence of 5% in primary care and up to 10% in referred patients; its prevalence increases with severity of hypertension and reaches up to 20% in patients with resistant hypertension. PA is due to autonomous and excessive aldosterone production from the adrenal cortex, due to an aldosterone producing adenoma (APA), which can be treated by unilateral adrenalectomy, or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH). Patients are diagnosed based on a clinical case finding with hypertension and an increased aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR), often associated with hypokalemia. PA is associated with a risk of cardiovascular complications, in particular stroke, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure that exceeds that of patients with essential hypertension. Due to the complexity of the work-up, the diagnosis of PA is frequently overlooked and consequently treatment of the condition is either not initiated or delayed by several years after hypertension onset, when cardiovascular complications are established.

Her symptoms and metabolic derangements improved with glucocorticoid replacement to suppress ACTH production and mineralocorticoid excess, although she continues to require antihypertensive therapy. Estrogen replacement was initiated due to sex hormone insufficiency. This rare disorder should be considered when evaluating patients with pubertal delay and hypertension, particularly if there is associated hypokalemia.

Screening, diagnosis, and the spectrum of disease

Current screening for PA relies on simultaneous measurement of plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma (direct) renin concentration or plasma renin activity, which allow calculation of the ARR. In all but a handful of cases (eg, young age, with marked aldosteronism [hypertension and hypokalemia] and complete renin suppression), a positive ARR screen is followed by confirmatory dynamic testing: (1) saline infusion test (SIT), (2) oral salt suppression test, (3) captopril challenge test, or (4) fludrocortisone suppression test (Fig. 1).

Although this approach is generally advocated by specialists in the field, there remains considerable heterogeneity with respect to the diagnostic thresholds employed for each of these tests. Furthermore, in recent years an "expanding spectrum of primary aldosteronism" has been acknowledged such that PA may not be readily diagnosed or distinguished on the basis of rigid diagnostic cut-offs alone. For instance, Vaidya et al, describe a spectrum of disease ranging from clinically overt PA (patients with severe and/or resistant hypertension) that is readily detectable using current thresholds for biochemical confirmation, to unrecognized yet biochemically overt PA (in patients with normotension or mild/moderate hypertension). These findings suggest the existence of "subclinical" or "nonclassical" categories of PA (normotensive patients with autonomous aldosterone secretion) who are likely to go unnoticed because they do not meet current screening indications for PA. Expert consensus on a broader classification of PA has yet to be reached, and defining the full spectrum of disease is challenging given the limitations of current clinical testing (discussed further in "Metabolomics and Machine Learning").

Overall summary of recommendations

Use plasma aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR) as screening test for PA.
Consider discontinuing β-adrenergic blockers and centrally acting drugs before performing ARR.
Withdrawal of all antihypertensive medications for ARR screening is not routinely recommended.
When assessing ARR consider confounding factors such as sodium intake, hypokalaemia and drug treatment.
Interpret the ARR using the cut off values in Table 3, unless subjects are on drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system (RAAS), in which case consider the individual components of the ARR — e.g. a normal ARR but suppressed renin whilst on drugs expected to increase renin does not exclude PA.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^9fccc074]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) screening — aldosterone, renin, and aldosterone–renin ratio (ARR) thresholds and repeat-testing guidance are as follows: plasma renin activity (PRA) is ≤ 1 ng/mL/h or direct renin concentration (DRC) is ≤ 2.8 mU/L and serum/plasma aldosterone concentration is ≥ 10 ng/dL (≥ 277 pmol/L) by immunoassay or ≥ 7.5 ng/dL (≥ 208 pmol/L) by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Elevated ARR is indicative of PA if the aldosterone [ng/dL] to PRA [ng/mL/h] ratio is > 20 or aldosterone [pmol/L] to DRC [mU/L] ratio is > 70 when aldosterone is measured by immunoassay; the ARR indicative of PA is about 25% lower when aldosterone is measured by LC-MS/MS. If the initial screen is negative and factors could have led to a false-negative result, the test should be repeated on a different day after correcting hypokalemia and withdrawing interfering medications for 4 weeks for mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, epithelial sodium-channel inhibitors, and other diuretics, and 2 weeks for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. If the initial screen is negative and the pretest probability of PA is moderate to high, or renin is suppressed with aldosterone of 5 to 10 ng/dL (138 to 277 pmol/L) by immunoassay, the test should be repeated on a different day. If the initial screen is positive but the patient is receiving β-adrenergic blockers or centrally acting α2-agonists that can lower renin and cause false-positive results, the test should be repeated after withdrawing those medications for 2 weeks; consider potential false positives induced by β-adrenergic blockers when aldosterone is 10 to 15 ng/dL (277–416 pmol/L) by immunoassay or 7.5 to 10 ng/dL (208–277 pmol/L) by LC-MS/MS, and if aldosterone is above these concentrations, PA is likely despite β-adrenergic blockers. In chronic kidney disease, renin decreases proportionally to nephron loss while aldosterone can be elevated, leading to overall increases in false-positive testing. If all initial screening is negative, consider rescreening in the future if a patient develops unexplained worsening of hypertension or resistant hypertension, new spontaneous or diuretic-induced hypokalemia, or atrial fibrillation in the absence of structural heart disease or hyperthyroidism.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, more specifically with respect to plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio, initial testing, HC 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain plasma aldosterone and plasma renin activity or renin mass/concentration as follows:

- in the morning after the patient has been ambulatory (sitting, standing, or walking) for at least 2 hours

- patients seated for 5–15 minutes before the blood draw

- with corrected hypokalemia and liberalized sodium intake

- withdraw agents markedly affecting the results (aldosterone antagonists, potassium-sparing and -wasting diuretics) at least 4–6 weeks before testing

- repeat testing 2 weeks after withdrawing medications likely to interfere with test accuracy (β-blockers, centrally acting α-2 agonists, ARBs, ACEis, directly acting renin inhibitors, and dihydropyridine CCBs), if the results are not diagnostic, and if hypertension can be controlled with medications less likely to affect testing (slow-release verapamil, diltiazem, hydralazine, prazosin, doxazosin, and terazosin)

- recognize that false positive results might occur with direct renin mass/concentration if the patient is a female using an oral contraceptives; discontinue oral contraceptives for 1 month before testing if possible, or alternately, measure plasma renin activity instead.

Primary aldosteronism — Recommendation 4 and technical remarks: In individuals who screen positive for primary aldosteronism (PA), we suggest aldosterone suppression testing in situations when screening results suggest an intermediate probability for lateralizing PA and individualized decision making confirms a desire to pursue eligibility for surgical therapy (2 | ⊕⊕○○). Situations in which aldosterone suppression testing is not required prior to initiating PA-specific therapy include those with resistant hypertension or hypertension with hypokalemia and overt biochemical evidence of renin‑independent aldosterone production, defined by plasma renin activity [PRA] < 0.2 ng/mL/h or direct renin concentration [DRC] < 2 mU/L together with plasma aldosterone concentration > 15 ng/dL [> 416 pmol/L] via LC‑MS/MS or > 20 ng/dL [> 554 pmol/L] via immunoassay; in such cases, aldosterone suppression testing is not recommended due to the risk of false‑negative results. Individuals unwilling or unable to pursue adrenal venous sampling (AVS) can be offered medical therapy with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) based on screening results, without aldosterone suppression testing, although aldosterone suppression testing may still provide value in some cases for further documenting the diagnosis. Aldosterone suppression testing is unnecessary in families with germline mutations causing familial hyperaldosteronism; genetic screening is recommended for all first‑degree relatives and for individuals with young‑onset PA (< 20 years). Aldosterone suppression testing can also be avoided when the likelihood of lateralizing PA is very low, such as with normokalemia plus plasma/serum aldosterone < < 11 ng/dL [< < 305 pmol/L] [immunoassay] or < < 8 ng/dL [< < 222 pmol/L] [LC‑MS/MS].

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — diagnostic steps and management: If screening results are negative or borderline in patients in whom there is a high level of suspicion for primary aldosteronism and confirmation of the diagnosis will change management, potentially interfering medications may be temporarily substituted with noninterfering medications (ie, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers [CCBs], vasodilators, peripheral alpha-blockers, and potentially dihydropyridine CCBs) for at least 2 to 4 weeks prior to repeat testing. The diagnosis of primary aldosteronism may require an aldosterone suppression test such as an intravenous (IV) saline suppression test or oral salt-loading test. If the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism is confirmed and the patient agrees that surgery would be desirable, the patient is referred for an adrenal venous sampling procedure to determine whether the increased aldosterone production is unilateral or bilateral in origin; if unilateral excess aldosterone production is documented on adrenal venous sampling, the patient is referred for unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy, whereas if bilaterally increased aldosterone secretion is present or if the patient is not a surgical candidate or is not interested in pursuing surgery, the patient is treated with an MRA (eg, spironolactone or eplerenone). If primary aldosteronism is confirmed, imaging of the adrenal glands should be considered, even if treatment will be with medication, to exclude a large adrenal mass that may require adrenalectomy if features suggestive of malignancy are present (size > 4 cm, imaging characteristics). Treating primary aldosteronism, either with an MRA or unilateral adrenalectomy, if indicated, is associated with resolution of hypokalemia, lower BP, fewer number of antihypertensive medications required, and improved parameters of impaired cardiac and kidney function, and meta-analysis of observational data suggests that adrenalectomy may be associated with lower risk of MACE and all-cause mortality compared with medical therapy.

Conclusion

In a subset of hypertensive patients with spontaneous hypokalemia who had initial screening test results of PAC > 20 ng/dL and PRA < 0.6 ng/ml/hr may be presumably diagnosed as having overt primary aldosteronism and may not need to proceed with dynamic confirmatory testing. Overall, despite the study limitations, a focused effort to validate the existing simplified confirmatory algorithm may lead to diagnostic efficiency towards improving patient outcomes in relation to prompt diagnosis, cost reduction, addressing limited resources, and further support guideline recommendations. For future studies, larger trials that are prospective in design, inclusion of a wider hypertensive population not restricted to PA screened patients, use of a uniform, standardized assay methodology and blinding of assessors are recommended.

### Primary aldosteronism and aldosterone-associated hypertension [^ddc047e8]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

The field of primary aldosteronism (PA) and aldosterone-related hypertension has undergone rapid evolution. From a relatively rare curiosity PA has become a common problem particularly in selected hypertensive populations. Patients with PA and aldosterone-related hypertension appear to be at higher cardiovascular and renal risk than comparable patients with essential hypertension probably due to the pleiotropic effects of aldosterone. Aldosterone is also linked to metabolic syndrome and diabetes. The aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) has allowed the widespread screening for PA, but the exact cut-off values may vary in different population groups. All patients with hypertension and hypokalaemia, and young patients with hypertension, hypertension with an incidental adrenal mass, and severe or resistant hypertension should be screened. The use of the ARR to screen all hypertensives for PA is controversial as the test lacks specificity and many patients with false-positive tests will undergo complex and expensive testing to confirm the diagnosis. The fludrocortisone suppression test, the saline infusion test or 24-hour aldosterone excretion may be used to confirm PA in patients with a positive ARR. Adrenal venous sampling is the most reliable test to detect the presence of an aldosterone-producing adenoma, but spiral CT scan or adrenocortical scintigraphy may be useful in centres without facilities for adrenal venous sampling. Spironolactone is emerging as an important antihypertensive agent in patients with resistant hypertension and aldosterone-related hypertension. The ARR may be a useful guide to drug selection in hypertensives patients, but further research is needed to make more definitive recommendations.

1 INTRODUCTION

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common endocrine cause of secondary hypertension. However, PA is underdiagnosedwith reported prevalence rates among patients with hypertension of 4%–14%, in primary care and 1%–29.8% in referral centres. The disease is characterised by hypertension, hypokalemia/normokalemia and metabolic alkalosis with diffuse clinical features such as muscle weakness, fatigue, polyuria and polydipsia. The cause is autonomous aldosterone production which results in sodium and water retention as well as renal potassium excretion. The excess production of aldosterone may occur in one (unilateral) or both (bilateral) adrenal glands. The unilateral disease is usually caused by a solitary adenoma and represents only one‐third of all PA cases. Bilateral disease is caused by bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia or, rarely, by bilateral adenomas.

Patients with PA have an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Due to the recognised efficiency of PA treatment (surgery and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist treatment) and its positive impact on patient outcomes, including health cost gains, screening of risk populations for PA is important and beneficial.

Even though PA is a common disorder among patients with hypertension, only a relatively small number of patients undergo investigation for PA. For example, recent studies show that only 2.1%–2.7% of patients with hypertension were screened for PA.

The diagnosis of PA requires not only laboratory tests but often also complex confirmatory tests, radiological assessment and adrenal vein sampling for distinguishing between unilateral and bilateral disease. In PA, the increase in aldosterone is independent of renin pathway regulation, causing the suppression of renin secretion and, hence, elevation of the aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR). However, the ARR can be altered by other factors, such as medications interfering with the Renin‐Angiotensin‐Aldosterone System (RAAS), oral contraceptives or chronic kidney disease, why confirmatory tests are most often required to establish the diagnosis of PA.

Primary aldosteronism — saline suppression test: After sitting for 1 hour, blood should be drawn to mark t = 0. Two liters of normal saline are infused over 4 hours (500 mL/h for 4 hours) while maintaining a seated position, after which blood should be drawn; plasma aldosterone and serum potassium are measured at t = 0 and t = 4 hours. Plasma aldosterone < 162 pmol/L (5.8 ng/dL) via LC–MS/MS assay makes PA unlikely, and plasma aldosterone < 217 pmol/L (7.8 ng/dL) via immunoassay makes PA unlikely. Because hypokalemia may cause false-negative interpretations, serum potassium should be normalized before the study protocol; interpretation of results should be considered to be probabilistic as the evidence to support a singular diagnostic threshold is not firm. The protocol requires an in-person visit, space and staff to accommodate the procedures, and intravenous (IV) infusion of saline, and it should not be performed if baseline BP is uncontrolled, or in patients at high risk for pulmonary edema such as heart failure or advanced chronic kidney disease.

### Primary hyperaldosteronism associated with hypertensive emergencies [^7d0a8d28]. American Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

There is growing awareness of primary hyperaldosteronism as a cause of secondary hypertension. Usually, it manifests as hypertension and hypokalemia, or as resistant hypertension. Much less often, primary hyperaldosteronism may be detected after a hypertensive emergency has developed. We highlight this association by reporting on eight patients with a clinical diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism whose course was complicated by a hypertensive crisis. In all patients, an elevated serum aldosterone, was accompanied by a suppressed plasma renin activity despite the presence of a hypertensive crisis. A good outcome was obtained either with laparoscopic adrenalectomy (1 patient) or with an antihypertensive drug regimen that included an antialdosterone agent (7 patients). The differential diagnosis of hypertensive emergencies should include primary hyperaldosteronism.

Discussion

Primary hyperaldosteronism, or Conn's syndrome, is a condition characterized by non-suppressible hypersecretion of aldosterone, which most frequently results in hypertension and hypokalemia. Previously, it was estimated that approximately 1% of hypertensive patients were affected by primary hyperaldosteronism, but recent developments in screening methods, like the more extensive application of plasma aldosterone to renin ratio, have highlighted the actual prevalence to be up to 12%. A low serum potassium concentration can lead to a variety of symptoms, including electrocardiogram abnormalities, fatigue, and muscle weakness, manifesting as constipation, exercise intolerance, and dyspnea. Additionally, acute respiratory failure is a rare but treatable presentation of this disorder. Hypokalemia causing respiratory failure in primary aldosteronism is extremely rare. Herein, we present a 27-year-old woman with high blood pressure and severe hypokalemia, which caused respiratory failure. She finally underwent laparoscopic surgery after being diagnosed with adrenal adenoma as the cause of hypertension, and the patient recovered.

It is of great importance that primary hyperaldosteronism is considered a leading cause of secondary hypertension, with a prevalence of 10% among the general hypertensive population and 20% in patients with resistant hypertension. Therefore, hypokalemia in hypertensive patients, especially young ones, should be assessed for secondary hypertension due to hyperaldosteronism. It is worth mentioning that only 9–37% of patients with primary aldosteronism have hypokalemia. Thus, the recommendation for case detection has been determined beyond only hypokalemia. In a study by Ruhle et al. only 2.7% of patients among 37,000 with hypertension and hypokalemia were screened for primary aldosteronism. This shows how much this condition may be underdiagnosed even in tertiary centers. Therefore, an optimal screening strategy is needed in this regard.

Endocrine Society — aldosterone suppression testing after a positive screen: In individuals who screen positive for primary aldosteronism (PA), we suggest aldosterone suppression testing when screening suggests an intermediate probability for lateralizing PA and individualized decision making supports pursuing surgical eligibility (2 ⊕⊕OO). Testing may be helpful in individuals with an intermediate probability of lateralizing PA who are willing and able to undergo surgical adrenalectomy. It is not required prior to initiating PA-specific therapy for individuals with resistant hypertension or hypertension with hypokalemia and overt biochemical evidence of renin-independent aldosterone production; in the presence of clear evidence of severe autonomous aldosterone production — defined by direct renin concentration (DRC) < 2 mU/L or plasma renin activity (PRA) < 0.2 ng/mL/h with plasma aldosterone concentration > 20 ng/dL by immunoassay or > 15 ng/dL by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry — aldosterone suppression testing is not recommended. Individuals unwilling or unable to pursue adrenal venous sampling (AVS) and adrenalectomy can be empirically treated with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) based on screening results without suppression testing, and testing is unnecessary in families with hyperaldosteronism; genetic screening is recommended for all first-degree relatives and for individuals with apparent onset PA (< 20 years).

Primary aldosteronism (PA) screening selection and implementation emphasize serum/plasma aldosterone and renin over hypokalemia as the global screening tool, noting it is a more sensitive screening tool than hypokalemia, has reasonable accuracy overall with or without interfering medications, and is widely available at low cost; screening with aldosterone and renin in individuals with newly diagnosed hypertension prior to initiation of antihypertensive medication is preferable whenever possible; other approaches such as only screening renin or measuring 24-hour urinary excretion of aldosterone do not have sufficient evidence or cost-effectiveness to justify widespread screening, and to be diagnosed with PA, individuals should have both a suppressed renin and a nonsuppressed aldosterone; health economics support this approach, as Three health economic studies in Japan, Australia, and China demonstrated cost-effectiveness of screening for PA in the general hypertensive population.

Introduction

Aldosterone, the production of which is catalysed by aldosterone synthase in the adrenal gland, promotes sodium retention and potassium excretion in the kidney to regulate blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis as part of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) biofeedback loop. Primary aldosteronism (PA), caused by excessive autonomous aldosterone production relative to sodium, is characterised by hypertension, cardiovascular damage, sodium retention, and frequently by hypokalaemia.

The pathophysiology of PA consists of two separate and distinct pathways. First, hypertension; second, elevated aldosterone levels that are associated with structural damage to blood vessels and kidneys, and tissue fibrosis. Indeed, patients with PA have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular mortality than patients with primary hypertension, suggesting an increased morbidity and mortality in PA that is independent of blood pressure.

PA can present unilaterally or bilaterally. The Endocrine Society guidelines and European Society of Hypertension consensus recommend that the lateralisation subtype is confirmed by adrenal venous sampling. For unilateral disease, surgery is recommended to remove the diseased adrenal gland, whereas in patients with bilateral disease or those who are ineligible for surgery, treatment with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) is recommended.

Although MRAs control hypertension, they do not correct but can, in fact, further elevate aldosterone levels. Patients with PA treated with inadequate MRA doses remain at an increased risk of cardiovascular events compared with those with primary hypertensionor those who undergo an adrenalectomy. However, diagnosing unilateral or bilateral disease by adrenal venous sampling can be costly, invasive for the patient, and requires a centre with the diagnostic expertise. The diagnosis of unilateral PA is, therefore, not always feasible and surgery is not always preferred by patients. Furthermore, expanding the spectrum of PA to patients earlier in the disease course will increase the need for a specific, well-tolerated drug that addresses the underlying cause of disease: excess aldosterone production.

### Respiratory failure and rhabdomyolysis caused by severe hypokalemia in a young female with hypertension: a rare critical condition in primary aldosteronism [^d6181217]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

The new WHO classification supports the terminology of the HISTALDO classification, which employs CYP11B2 immunohistochemistry to pinpoint functional sites of aldosterone production, aiding in predicting the risk of bilateral disease in primary aldosteronism. Aldosterone-producing adrenal cortical carcinoma (APACC) and adenoma (APA) are solitary lesions that are clearly visible with routine H&E and immunohistochemical staining for CYP11B2. Sub-centimeter solitary lesions visible with H&E and immunohistochemical staining are called aldosterone-producing nodules (APNs). Their counterparts, which may be difficult to distinguish with H&E but are always visible with immunohistochemical staining, are known as aldosterone-producing micronodules (APMs). When multifocal, they are termed "multiple APN" (MAPN) and "multiple APM" (MAPM), respectively. Lastly, aldosterone-producing diffuse hyperplasia is characterized by continuous CYP11B2 staining along the zona glomerulosa.

A small lesion (< 40 mm) with a regular shape and well-defined margins along with hypodense and homogenous content suggests an adrenal adenoma. The first choice of treatment is surgical resection. Hence, laparoscopic adrenalectomy is a reasonable option for any individual with an aldosterone-producing adenoma, offering fewer complications and similar blood pressure control and hypokalemia correction compared to open adrenalectomy. Laparoscopic surgery with transperitoneal or retroperitoneal approaches can be utilized. A meta-analysis indicated that the body of evidence for the comparison between these two approaches is limited. In this meta-analysis, evidence of very low quality suggests that for relatively small lesions (under 6–7 cm), the retroperitoneal approach might reduce late morbidity. Additionally, some post-operative parameters, such as the time to oral fluid or food intake and the time to ambulation, might favor the laparoscopic retroperitoneal adrenalectomy technique. However, this subject needs further investigation. Furthermore, comparing total and partial adrenalectomy requires future studies to determine whether partial adrenalectomy avoids adrenal insufficiency without increasing the risk of persistent or recurrent aldosteronism. Regarding the clinical outcome, based on a retrospective study of 168 cases diagnosed with primary aldosteronism who underwent adrenalectomy, 77% of patients with a unilateral adenoma had their hypertension resolved or under control. When unilateral disease is clearly confirmed, adrenalectomy corrects hypokalemia, if it was present before surgery, in nearly all patients. Hypertension is cured in approximately 30–60% of cases, and in the remaining patients, a significant improvement in blood pressure is observed.

Primary aldosteronism — screening interpretation, medication substitutions, confirmatory testing, treatment pathways, imaging criteria, and outcomes: Initial screening can generally be interpreted despite most medications; if suspicion remains high with negative or borderline results, potentially interfering drugs may be temporarily substituted with noninterfering agents for at least 2 to 4 weeks prior to repeat testing. Diagnosis may require an aldosterone suppression test such as an intravenous saline suppression test or oral salt-loading test. If confirmed and surgery is contemplated, referral for adrenal venous sampling determines whether aldosterone excess is unilateral or bilateral; unilateral excess is referred for unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy, whereas bilateral secretion or non-surgical candidates are treated with an MRA (eg, spironolactone or eplerenone). If primary aldosteronism is confirmed, adrenal imaging should be considered to exclude a large mass when features suggestive of malignancy are present (size > 4 cm). Treating primary aldosteronism with an MRA or unilateral adrenalectomy is associated with resolution of hypokalemia, lower BP, fewer antihypertensive medications, and improved cardiac and kidney function, and a meta-analysis of observational data suggests adrenalectomy may be associated with lower risk of MACE and all-cause mortality compared with medical therapy.

### Diagnostic approach to low-renin hypertension [^4240a923]. Clinical Endocrinology (2018). Low credibility.

Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a crucial role in maintaining water and electrolytes homoeostasis, and its deregulation contributes to the development of arterial hypertension. Since the historical description of the "classical" RAAS, a dramatic increase in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of both essential and secondary hypertension has occurred. Approximatively 25% of the patients affected by arterial hypertension display low-renin levels, a definition that is largely arbitrary and depends on the investigated population and the specific characteristics of the assay. Most often, low-renin levels are expression of a physiological response to sodium-volume overload, but also a significant number of secondary hereditary or acquired conditions falls within this category. In a context of suppressed renin status, the concomitant examination of plasma aldosterone levels (which can be inappropriately elevated, within the normal range or suppressed) and plasma potassium are essential to formulate a differential diagnosis. To distinguish between the different forms of low-renin hypertension is of fundamental importance to address the patient to the proper clinical management, as each subtype requires a specific and targeted therapy. The present review will discuss the differential diagnosis of the most common medical conditions manifesting with a clinical phenotype of low-renin hypertension, enlightening the novelties in genetics of the familial forms.

### Primary aldosteronism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^a097c506]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Primary aldosteronism — Recommendation 3 (screening tests and thresholds) states that in individuals with hypertension, we suggest primary aldosteronism (PA) screening with serum/plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin (concentration or activity) (2 | ⊕⊕OO). Technical remarks specify to screen for PA by measuring serum/plasma aldosterone and plasma renin (concentration or activity) in the morning with individuals seated and avoiding dietary sodium restriction during the few days prior to screening, to measure potassium alongside renin and aldosterone — not for screening itself but to aid in the accurate interpretation of aldosterone — as low potassium may lead to a falsely low aldosterone, and to manage the timing and withdrawal of interfering medications before screening depending on individual safety and feasibility. A positive screen meets both of the following conditions in most circumstances: renin is low/suppressed with plasma renin activity (PRA) ≤ 1 ng/mL/h or direct renin concentration (DRC) ≤ 8.2 mU/L AND serum/plasma aldosterone concentration ≥ 10 ng/dL (≥ 277 pmol/L) when measured by immunoassay or ≥ 7.5 ng/dL (≥ 208 pmol/L) when measured by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS); and the aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR) is elevated, indicative of PA if the aldosterone [ng/dL] to PRA [ng/mL/h] ratio is ≥ 20 or aldosterone [pmol/L] to DRC [mU/L] ratio is ≥ 70 when aldosterone is measured by immunoassay, with the ARR indicative of PA about 25% lower when aldosterone is measured by LC-MS/MS; if screening results are negative and the patient has hypokalemia, potassium should be corrected to the laboratory reference range and screening repeated.

### Temporal trends in clinical features of patients with primary aldosteronism over 20 years [^3b0f8f60]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) accounts for approximately 5–10% of hypertension cases. Over the past 20 years, the reported incidence of PA has increased due to widespread screening for secondary hypertension and imaging studies. We aimed to evaluate the temporal trends in the clinical characteristics and subtypes of PA. A total of 1064 patients with PA in two tertiary hospitals between 2000 and 2021 were categorized into three groups according to the year of diagnosis: 2000–2009, 2010–2015, and 2016–2021. The clinical characteristics of the patients over the three time periods were compared using a trend analysis. The age at diagnosis and sex of patients with PA did not change over 20 years. The proportion of patients with bilateral hyperaldosteronism (BHA) increased (11%, 25%, and 40%, P for trend < 0.001). The proportion of hypokalemia (87%, 61%, and 40%) and plasma aldosterone concentration (36.0, 30.8, and 26.6ng/dL) decreased (all P for trend < 0.001). There was a trend toward an increased proportion of incidentally detected patients compared to clinically symptomatic patients (36%, 55%, and 61%, P for trend < 0.001). The concordance rate of imaging and adrenal venous sampling results decreased (91%, 70%, and 57% P for trend < 0.001). However, the proportion of patients with resistant hypertension and comorbidities did not differ. In conclusion, among patients with PA, patients with BHA and incidental detection have increased over 20 years, and more patients are likely to present with milder clinical symptoms and biochemical profiles.

Clinical Presentation

ACC has a variable clinical presentation. Around 30% have nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain and/or fullness, flank pain, and early satiety. Diagnoses made following work up of adrenal mass incidentally found on imaging account for 20%-30% of cases. Hormonal excess is the most common presenting feature in approximately 40%-60% of patients which could be due to hypercortisolism or hyperandrogenism. ACC that secretes cortisol may cause patients to present with diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, facial plethora, muscle atrophy, secondary hypertension, and/or hypokalemia. Conversely, aldosterone over-secretion that is manifested by hypertension and hypokalemia is rare in ACC. Patients may present with virilization, hirsutism, male pattern hair loss, and menstrual abnormalities. A few patients can present with clinical symptoms correlated to estrogen overproduction such as testicular atrophy and gynecomastia.

Introduction

Within a year of the discovery of aldosterone in 1953, a description of the first patient with primary aldosteronism (PA) signalled a dual trajectory for clinical and research interest in the hormone. Over the next 70 years, many of its intertwined physiological and pathological roles have become clear (Fig. 1). For much of this period, the clinical syndrome of PA has held the status of an endocrine curiosity. Perhaps because of the dramatic clinical features of the index case described by Jerome Conn (sustained, severe hypertension, marked hypokalaemia and an adrenal tumour large enough to be seen by adrenal venography), PA was for many decades after Conn's death considered a rare, relatively benign form of hypertension only to be suspected if the patient was profoundly hypokalaemic –. However, the characterization of PA as a rare, benign disease with a requirement for hypokalaemia is now acknowledged to be incorrect.

Over the past decade, clinical and molecular studies have catapulted PA onto the centre stage of cardiometabolic research. First, several rigorous clinical studies that used plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR), rather than absolute thresholds of plasma aldosterone itself, indicated prevalence rates for PA of 5–11% in unselected hypertensive populations – a range that is uncannily similar to Conn's prediction of 10% –. On top of these prevalence figures, the observation that the cardiometabolic consequences of PA (including stroke, atrial fibrillation, renal impairment and ischaemic heart disease) exceeded that of essential hypertension by a ratio of at least 2:1, provides an impetus to advance screening strategies and targeted therapies for PA. We and others have estimated that fewer than 1% of cases of PA are detected and treated; this underdiagnosis combined with the excess morbidity attributed to PA makes it difficult to exaggerate the public health consequences of this shortfall in clinical care.

### Genetic causes of primary aldosteronism [^c42f2d8b]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In 1955, Conn reported a patient with hypertension, muscular weakness, paralysis, polydipsia, polyuria, and hypokalemic alkalosis who was cured after removal of a 4 cm adrenocortical adenoma (benign tumor of the adrenal cortex). He described this as a new syndrome of "primary aldosteronism" (PA). Currently, PA is recognized as the most common cause of secondary hypertension, accounting for up to 6% of hypertensive patients in primary care and up to 11% of patients in specialized referral centers; its prevalence increases with the severity of hypertension. PA is characterized by at least partially autonomous aldosterone production (despite low renin levels), hypertension and low or normal serum potassium levels. Common causes, include idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA; approximately 60% of the cases) and aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA; approximately 30%), and rare subforms include unilateral hyperplasia, adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), or familial hyperaldosteronism (FH). PA is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as stroke, myocardial infarction, or atrial fibrillation compared with primary hypertension –. In patients with hypertension, an elevated aldosterone–renin ratio (ARR) is used as a screening parameter, followed by confirmatory testing (salt loading, fludrocortisone or captopril administration, which all fail to sufficiently lower aldosterone levels in PA). Imaging, such as computed tomography, serves to exclude malignancy, whereas so-called adrenal venous sampling, an invasive procedure, is typically required to distinguish unilateral (mostly APA) from bilateral (usually IHA) aldosterone production. However, adrenal venous sampling remains challenging, and hence, many patients are not diagnosed or treated optimally. While APAs can potentially be cured by surgery, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists remain the treatment of choice for IHA.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Secondary hypertension — history, drug-related contributors, and aldosteronism testing — emphasizes that a careful history should be taken with close attention to prescription medications, over-the-counter substances, illicit drugs, and herbal products; that a change in BP may result from drug-drug or drug-food interactions and, when feasible, drugs associated with increased BP should be reduced or discontinued; and that spontaneous hypokalemia is present only in 20% to 50% of patients with primary aldosteronism, so screening should not rely on hypokalemia alone and may require sodium loading to induce aldosterone suppression if plasma screening by the aldosterone-to-renin ratio is inconclusive.
