## Question

diagnostics?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diagnostics. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining diagnostics and their clinical purpose. Then, I should verify the core performance metrics and how to interpret them. Next, I will examine study designs and evidence hierarchies for diagnostic test evaluation. After that, I need to consider pretest probability and Bayesian reasoning. I will then review special contexts like COVID-19, screening versus diagnosis, and point-of-care testing. Finally, I should appraise limitations, overuse, and synthesize practical principles for test selection and interpretation, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the definition and purpose of diagnostics. Diagnostics are tests or procedures used to determine whether a patient has a disease or condition, guide treatment decisions, monitor response, and inform prognosis; they include laboratory assays, imaging, endoscopy, and biopsies, and they must be interpreted in the context of the patient's presentation and the clinical question at hand [^e9a7784f] [^b16370a3] [^77c46e59].

> I need to check the core performance metrics. Sensitivity is the proportion of true positives correctly identified, specificity is the proportion of true negatives correctly identified, and likelihood ratios convert pretest probability into posttest probability; positive and negative predictive values depend on prevalence and should not be mistaken as fixed test properties, which is a common pitfall in practice [^260aba93] [^3b7dccfb] [^afbb78e8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a test's clinical value from accuracy alone. I should confirm the evidence hierarchy. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) sit at the top, followed by prospective cohort accuracy studies, case-control studies, and cross-sectional studies; randomized trials of testing strategies are often needed to demonstrate improvements in patient-centered outcomes, and many DTA studies suffer from methodological limitations such as spectrum bias, imperfect reference standards, and lack of blinding [^e6ded443] [^397aca2d] [^4f53d4c3].

> Wait, let me verify how to interpret results in real patients. Pretest probability, shaped by prevalence and clinical context, drives the predictive value of a test; Bayes' theorem shows that even with high sensitivity and specificity, posttest probability varies widely with pretest probability, and likelihood ratios offer a more stable way to update disease probability than sensitivity/specificity alone; I should double-check that I'm not applying PPV/NPV from one population to another with different prevalence [^aa53c8a5] [^3b7dccfb] [^476946e7].

> Next, I should review a concrete example to anchor this. For COVID-19, molecular NAATs have high sensitivity and near-perfect specificity in symptomatic patients, but antigen tests have lower sensitivity and performance varies with timing and symptom status; IDSA recommends NAAT for symptomatic individuals and advises against routine repeat testing after a negative NAAT unless clinical suspicion remains high, while antigen tests can be used when molecular testing is unavailable or delayed, with negative antigen results confirmed by NAAT if suspicion persists [^56468237] [^19c58e57] [^453f20bb] [^5aa6fddd].

> I will now examine screening versus diagnosis. Screening targets asymptomatic populations to detect early disease, whereas diagnostic testing evaluates symptomatic patients; screening requires higher sensitivity to avoid false negatives, and positive screens typically need confirmatory diagnostic tests, whereas diagnostic tests prioritize specificity to avoid false positives; I should confirm that screening programs also weigh benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness before implementation [^cba7419b] [^8639e95e].

> Let me consider point-of-care testing. POC tests can shorten time-to-result and enable timely decisions, but their clinical utility depends on accuracy, operational feasibility, and linkage to action; frameworks emphasize test efficacy — the ability to support a clinical decision in context — rather than accuracy alone, and evaluations should incorporate outcomes, workflow, and cost in resource-limited settings [^1a171597] [^92418bc7].

> But wait, what if there is no perfect reference standard. Many conditions lack a gold standard, complicating accuracy estimates; in such cases, latent class models, composite reference standards, or longitudinal validation may be needed, and clinicians should interpret accuracy cautiously and consider the test's role within a broader diagnostic strategy rather than in isolation [^4f53d4c3] [^cdb22821].

> I should double-check the problem of overuse. Substantial overuse of diagnostic testing persists across settings, including preoperative testing and imaging for non-specific low back pain; Choosing Wisely and stewardship initiatives aim to reduce low-value testing, and clinicians should order tests only when results are likely to change management or improve outcomes, balancing the harms of false positives and unnecessary procedures against missed diagnoses [^0cabd0fc] [^b9db8503].

> Let me synthesize practical principles. First, define the clinical question and pretest probability before choosing a test. Second, prefer tests with likelihood ratios that meaningfully shift probability in the direction you need (rule-in versus rule-out). Third, appraise the evidence base for the test in a population similar to your patient. Fourth, integrate results into a diagnostic strategy rather than relying on a single test. Fifth, reassess and adjust as new information arrives, recognizing that diagnostic uncertainty is common and should be managed explicitly [^aa53c8a5] [^7388fe8f] [^4452cf30].

> Finally, I need to ensure I'm not overlooking emerging paradigms. Integrated diagnostics, biomarker-guided disease definition, and AI-augmented interpretation are reshaping how we select and sequence tests; for example, Alzheimer's disease is now defined biologically by core biomarkers, and radiology is moving toward appropriateness-driven, data-integrated algorithms to optimize yield and reduce waste [^5ac1def2] [^cb3f0f40] [^893add67].

Diagnostics are the **tests and procedures** used to identify diseases or conditions, guide treatment, and monitor outcomes [^e9a7784f]. Key performance metrics are **sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios**, which inform how much a test shifts disease probability [^3b7dccfb] [^7388fe8f]. Pretest probability strongly influences **posttest probability**, so results must be interpreted in clinical context [^aa53c8a5] [^476946e7]. No test is perfect; false positives/negatives occur, and accuracy varies by population and method [^260aba93] [^4f53d4c3]. Clinicians should select tests based on clinical question, patient factors, and evidence of accuracy and impact on outcomes [^f7c448f9] [^369b7465].

---

## Types of diagnostic tests

Diagnostic tests include **laboratory tests** (blood, urine, genetic) [^e9a7784f], **imaging** (X-ray, CT, MRI, ultrasound) [^5ac1def2], **endoscopy** (visualizing internal organs) [^b16370a3], and **biopsy** (tissue sampling) [^e9a7784f]. Emerging tools such as molecular diagnostics, biomarkers, and AI are expanding precision and speed [^893add67] [^aad284a6].

---

## Key performance metrics

- **Sensitivity**: proportion of true positives correctly identified [^3b7dccfb].
- **Specificity**: proportion of true negatives correctly identified [^ce91322a].
- **Positive predictive value (PPV)**: probability disease is present when test is positive [^476946e7].
- **Negative predictive value (NPV)**: probability disease is absent when test is negative [^476946e7].
- **Likelihood ratios**: quantify how much a test result changes disease probability [^7388fe8f].

---

## Clinical utility and limitations

Diagnostic tests inform diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring, but **no test is perfect** [^260aba93]. False positives/negatives occur, and accuracy varies by disease prevalence, population, and method [^4f53d4c3]. Clinicians must interpret results in context and consider pretest probability [^aa53c8a5].

---

## Factors influencing diagnostic accuracy

- **Pretest probability**: prevalence and clinical suspicion shape posttest probability [^aa53c8a5].
- **Test characteristics**: sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios determine performance [^3b7dccfb].
- **Population and setting**: accuracy varies by patient mix and environment [^4f53d4c3].
- **Reference standard**: imperfect gold standards can bias accuracy estimates [^cdb22821].

---

## Ethical considerations

Ethical issues include **informed consent**, **patient autonomy**, **confidentiality**, and **equitable access**. Overdiagnosis and overtreatment can cause harm, and clinicians should balance benefits and risks [^b9db8503].

---

## Emerging trends and future directions

- **Personalized medicine**: genomics and biomarkers enable tailored diagnostics [^893add67].
- **Artificial intelligence**: AI enhances imaging and pattern recognition [^893add67].
- **Point-of-care testing**: rapid, decentralized tests improve access and timeliness [^1a171597].
- **Integrated diagnostics**: multimodal data fusion improves accuracy and efficiency [^5ac1def2].

---

Diagnostics are essential to modern medicine, but **results must be interpreted in clinical context** given inherent limitations [^f7c448f9]. Clinicians should apply evidence-based principles and consider patient-specific factors to optimize diagnostic value [^369b7465].

### Diagnostic methods I: sensitivity, specificity, and other measures of accuracy [^260aba93]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

For most physicians, use of diagnostic tests is part of daily routine. This paper focuses on their usefulness by explaining the different measures of accuracy, the interpretation of test results, and the implementation of a diagnostic strategy. Measures of accuracy include sensitivity and specificity. Although these measures are often considered fixed properties of a diagnostic test, in reality they are subject to multiple sources of variation such as the population case mix and the severity of the disease under study. Furthermore, when evaluating a new diagnostic test, it must be compared to a reference standard, although the latter is usually not perfect. In daily practice diagnostic tests are not used in isolation. Several issues will influence the interpretation of their results. First, clinicians have a prior assumption about the patient's chances of having the disease under investigation, based on the patient's characteristics, symptoms, and the disease prevalence in similar populations. Second, diagnostic tests are usually part of a diagnostic strategy. Therefore, it is not sufficient to determine the accuracy of a single test; one also needs to determine its additional value to the patient's diagnosis, treatment, or outcome as part of a diagnostic strategy.

### Diagnosis: making the best use of medical data [^aa53c8a5]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

To take the best possible care of patients, physicians must understand the basic principles of diagnostic test interpretation. Pretest probability is an important factor in interpreting test results. Some tests are useful for ruling in disease when positive or ruling out disease when negative, but not necessarily both. Many tests are of little value for diagnosing disease, and tests should be ordered only when the results are likely to lead to improved patient-oriented outcomes.

### Interpreting SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests: common questions and answers [^1d927257]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The spectrum of asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission presents challenges for evaluating SARS-CoV-2 test performance for diagnostic or screening purposes and for interpreting test results. Molecular and antigen tests can detect current SARS-CoV-2 infection and are used to diagnose COVID-19. Clinicians should consider a test's characteristics, test timing in relation to symptom onset, and the pretest probability of disease when interpreting results. Molecular and antigen SARS-CoV-2 tests both have high specificity. However, antigen tests generally have lower sensitivity and thus greater potential for false-negative results. Pretest probability of disease should be based on a patient's exposure to someone with a confirmed or probable case, signs or symptoms of COVID-19, local or population-specific COVID-19 prevalence, and presence of an alternative diagnosis. Using a leaf plot is an efficient way to visualize posttest probability of disease based on estimated pretest probability and the test's sensitivity and specificity. A negative molecular or antigen test result might not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection when pretest probability is high, depending on the test's sensitivity. A symptom-based approach is preferred over a test-based approach for discontinuing isolation precautions for most patients with COVID-19 because prolonged shedding of viral RNA does not necessarily correlate with infectivity. Antibody tests might help identify past SARS-CoV-2 infection if performed two to four weeks after symptom onset; however, because of uncertainty about the extent and durability of postinfection or vaccine-induced immunity, they should not yet be used to infer immunity or guide discontinuation of personal protective measures.

diagnostic testListen to pronunciationA test used to help figure out what disease or condition a person has based on their signs and symptoms. Diagnostic tests may also be used to help plan treatment, find out how well treatment is working, and make a prognosis. There are many different types of diagnostic tests. Examples include laboratory tests, imaging tests, endoscopy, and biopsy. Also called diagnostic procedure.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^8172686c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale

It is essential to understand the accuracy of diagnostic tests including signs and symptoms to identify the best way they can be used in different settings to develop effective diagnostic and management pathways. We are producing a suite of Cochrane 'living systematic reviews', which will summarise evidence on the clinical accuracy of different tests and diagnostic features, grouped according to present research questions and settings, in the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease. Summary estimates of accuracy from these reviews will help inform diagnostic, screening, isolation, and patient management decisions.

New tests are being developed and evidence is emerging at an unprecedented rate during the COVID‐19 pandemic. We will aim to update these reviews as often as is feasible to ensure that they provide the most up‐to‐date evidence about test accuracy.

These reviews are being produced rapidly to assist in providing a central resource of evidence to assist in the COVID‐19 pandemic, summarising available evidence on the accuracy of the tests and presenting characteristics.

### When is measuring sensitivity and specificity sufficient to evaluate a diagnostic test, and when do we need randomized trials? [^369b7465]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The clinical value of using a new diagnostic test depends on whether it improves patient outcomes beyond the outcomes achieved using an old diagnostic test. When can studies of diagnostic test accuracy provide sufficient information to infer clinical value, and when do clinicians need to wait for results from randomized trials? The authors argue that accuracy studies suffice if a new diagnostic test is safer or more specific than, but of similar sensitivity to, an old test. However, if a new test is more sensitive than an old test, it leads to the detection of extra cases of disease. Results from treatment trials that enrolled only patients detected by the old test may not apply to these extra cases. Clinicians need to wait for results from randomized trials assessing treatment efficacy in cases detected by the new diagnostic test, unless they can be satisfied that the new test detects the same spectrum and subtype of disease as the old test or that treatment response is similar across the spectrum of disease.

### How to appraise a diagnostic test [^7388fe8f]. World Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Clinicians frequently confront challenges when using diagnostic tests to help them decide whether the patient before them suffers from a particular target condition or diagnosis. The primary issues to consider when determining the validity of a diagnostic test study are how the authors assembled the patients and whether they used an appropriate reference standard in all patients to determine whether the patients did or did not have the target condition. Surgeons should be interested in the characteristics of the test that indicates the direction and magnitude of change in the probability of the target condition associated with a particular test result. The likelihood ratio best captures the link between the pretest probability of the target condition and the probability after the test results are obtained (also called the posttest probability). Many studies, however, present the properties of diagnostic tests in less clinically useful terms: sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity denotes the proportion of people with the disorder in whom the test result is positive. Specificity denotes the proportion of people without the disorder in whom the test result is negative. Application of the guides presented in this article can allow surgeons to assess critically studies regarding a diagnostic test.

### Principles of screening [^cba7419b]. Seminars in Perinatology (2005). Low credibility.

Screening and diagnostic testing are sequentially-oriented procedures for progressively analyzing risk. Screening is broadly based and aimed at identifying those at high risk of a disease or condition. Diagnostic testing is designed to more definitively answer the question of whether or not a person has a disease or condition. Understanding the differences among four key measures of evaluation for tests (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value) are necessary for proper utilization of screening tests.

### A guide for diagnostic evaluations [^d42e92b9]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Accurate diagnostic tests have a key role in patient management and the control of most infectious diseases. Unfortunately, in many developing countries, clinical care is often critically compromised by the lack of regulatory controls on the quality of these tests. The information available on the performance of a diagnostic test can be biased or flawed because of failings in the design of the studies which assessed the performance characteristics of the test. As a result, diagnostic tests are sold and used in much of the developing world without evidence of effectiveness. Misdiagnosis leading to failure to treat a serious infection or wasting expensive treatment on people who are not infected remains a serious obstacle to health.

### Small fiber neuropathy: a disabling and underrecognized syndrome [^bf160ee2]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To discuss cause, clinical manifestations, diagnostics, and treatment of small fiber neuropathy (SFN). The diagnosis is difficult and can be easily missed.

Recent Findings

SFN causes high morbidity with disabling symptoms and impact on quality of life. Patients may benefit from being diagnosed with SFN, even if no underlying cause is identified and no specific treatment is yet available. Recently, genetic mutations as a possible cause of SFN were identified. Clinical diagnostic criteria have been proposed, but no gold standard exists, and each test has its limitations. The diagnosis requires a combination of typical symptoms, abnormal neurologic findings, and absence of large fiber involvement. Clinicians should be aware of overlapping symptoms of SFN and fibromyalgia. Treatment is often difficult, even when the underlying cause is identified and appropriately treated. Usually, only symptomatic relief of complaints is available.

Summary

Awareness of SFN and related symptoms is of great clinical relevance. Guidelines for appropriate diagnostic workup using a stepwise approach involving a combination of tests are warranted. Even if no treatment is available, patients may benefit from timely recognition of SFN.

### How to use an article about a diagnostic test [^15ba9bd2]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Urologists frequently confront diagnostic dilemmas, prompting them to select, perform and interpret additional diagnostic tests. Before applying a given diagnostic test the user should ascertain that the chosen test would indeed help decide whether the patient has a particular target condition. In this article in the Users' Guide to the Urological Literature series we illustrate the guiding principles of how to critically appraise a diagnostic test, interpret its results and apply its findings to the care of an individual patient.

Materials and Methods

The guiding principles of how to evaluate a diagnostic test are introduced in the setting of a clinical scenario. We propose a stepwise approach that addresses the question of whether the study results are likely to be valid, what the results are and whether these results would help urologists with the treatment of their individual patients.

Results

Some of the issues urologists should consider when assessing the validity of a diagnostic test study are how the authors assembled the study population, whether they used blinding to minimize bias and whether they used an appropriate reference standard in all patients to determine the presence or absence of the target disorder. Urologists should next evaluate the properties of the diagnostic test that indicate the direction and magnitude of change in the probability of disease for a particular test result. Finally, urologists should ask a series of questions to understand how the diagnostic test may impact the care of their patients.

Conclusions

Application of the guides presented in this article will allow urologists to critically appraise studies of diagnostic tests. Determining the study validity, understanding the study results and assessing the applicability to patient care are 3 fundamental steps toward an evidence-based approach to choosing and interpreting diagnostic tests.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute diarrhea, more specifically with respect to indications for diagnostic testing, ACG 2016 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining stool testing, if available, in patients with dysentery, moderate-severe disease, and symptoms lasting > 7 days, in order to clarify the etiology of the patient's illness and enable specific directed therapy.

### Diagnostic accuracy studies [^397aca2d]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The medical community often assumes that the tests we use to diagnose various diseases are accurate, safe, and effective. However, the study designs traditionally used to determine whether such a diagnostic test is indeed accurate, safe, and effective are often at a higher risk of bias and are of lower methodological quality than those evaluating efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Several designs can be used to study diagnostic tests such as diagnostic accuracy cross-sectional studies, diagnostic accuracy case-control studies, and diagnostic accuracy comparative studies. Clinicians, researchers, and policy-makers may wish to consider moving toward higher quality study designs when studying new diagnostic modalities prior to their implementation in routine practice and diagnostic randomized trials are one such alternative.

### Simple statistical measures for diagnostic accuracy assessment [^ce91322a]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of diagnostic medicine research is to estimate and compare the accuracy of diagnostic tests to provide reliable information about a patient's disease status and thereby influencing patient care. When developing screening tools, researchers evaluate the discriminating power of the screening test by using simple measures such as the sensitivity and specificity of the test, as well as the positive and negative predictive values. In this brief report, we discuss these simple statistical measures that are used to quantify the diagnostic ability of a test.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^51e47540]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular testing — conclusions and research needs state coordination and priority settings for asymptomatic exposed individuals, specifying that "Testing in asymptomatic subjects with known or suspected exposures should be coordinated with local public health officials," and this is "especially important in situations where knowledge of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infection is essential for determining medical follow-up, defining risks for other vulnerable individuals in a household, congregate setting or hospital"; it further notes "Special consideration should also be given to healthcare personnel exposed without appropriate PPE in healthcare settings," and calls for "Comparative studies (preferably randomized controlled trials) along with cost-effectiveness analyses of testing strategies in asymptomatic populations," "Studies on the ideal time and collection method," and clarification of "what constitutes an exposure that would justify testing"; it adds that whether early diagnosis changes outcomes "is unknown," though "the opportunity for therapeutic intervention might justify screening exposed individuals," with benefits that "might vary depending on underlying diseases, immune status, age, and vaccination status… and their prior history of COVID-19 infection."

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 disease [^bec96a48]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Index test(s)

Signs and symptoms

Signs and symptoms are used in the initial diagnosis of suspected COVID‐19 disease, and to identify people with COVID‐19 pneumonia. Symptoms are what is experienced by patients, for example cough or nausea. Signs are what can be evaluated by clinical assessment, for example lung auscultation findings, blood pressure or heart rate.

Key symptoms that have been associated with mild to moderate COVID‐19 disease include: troublesome dry cough (for example, coughing more than usual over a one‐hour period, or three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours), fever greater than 37.8 °C, diarrhoea, headache, breathlessness on light exertion, muscle pain, fatigue, and loss of sense of smell and taste. Red flags indicating possible pneumonia include breathlessness at rest, loss of appetite, confusion, pain or pressure in the chest, and temperature above 38 °C.

Clinical pathway

Important in the context of COVID‐19 is that the pathway is multifaceted because it is designed to care for the diseased individual and to protect the community from further spread. Decisions about patient and isolation pathways for COVID‐19 vary according to health services and settings, available resources, and stages of the epidemic. They will change over time, if and when effective treatments and vaccines are identified. The decision points between these pathways vary, but all include points at which knowledge of the accuracy of diagnostic information is needed to be able to inform rational decision making.

Prior test(s)

In this review on signs and symptoms, no prior tests are required because signs and symptoms are used in the initial diagnosis of suspected COVID‐19 disease. Patients can, however, self‐assess before presenting to healthcare services based on their symptoms. This is in contrast to contact tracing, in which patients or participants are tested based on a documented contact with a SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive person and may themselves be asymptomatic.

Role of index test(s)

Signs and symptoms are used as triage tests, that is, to rule out COVID‐19 disease, but also to identify patients with possible COVID‐19 who may require further testing, care escalation or isolation.

Alternative test(s)

Chest X‐ray, ultrasound, and computed tomography (CT) are widely used diagnostic imaging tests to diagnose COVID‐19 pneumonia. Availability and usage varies between settings. We address these radiological tests in a separate review.

### Understanding and improving diagnostic tests: the clinician perspective [^aad284a6]. Neonatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Recent advances in molecular and mass screening technologies have paved the way for discovery of novel diagnostic tests and/or biomarkers for accurate identification of specific diseases and organ injuries. However, new diagnostic tests/biomarkers should be subjected to thorough evaluation before introduction into routine clinical practice. This review focuses on the up-to-date methodology in designing and evaluating diagnostic tests/biomarkers, and assessing their clinical utilities for improving health care efficiency, cost-effectiveness and outcomes. In addition to improved diagnostic utilities, future diagnostic tests should be developed in collaboration with our industrial partners and be applicable at the bedside for disease surveillance.

### Evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of the head-impulse test: a scoping review [^77a7ebd6]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Vestibular symptoms rank among the most common complaints in medicine worldwide. Underlying disorders manifested by these symptoms are generally associated with an impairment of the vestibular-ocular reflex and can be assessed with different diagnostic procedures. In recent years, an increasing number of diagnostic test accuracy studies comparing various head-impulse test (HIT) methods with other diagnostic procedures have been published but not systematically reviewed.

Objective

To conduct a scoping review and describe key characteristics of the growing number of diagnostic studies in patients presenting with vestibular symptoms.

Evidence Review

In April 2017, published studies were identified through searches of 4 bibliographic databases: Medline, Science Citation Index Expanded, the Cochrane Library, and ScienceDirect. Studies were included if they provided diagnostic accuracy data (sensitivity and specificity) for any HIT method with reference to any other vestibular test or clinical diagnosis in patients with vestibular symptoms. Study key characteristics were extracted, and the current literature was described narratively. All analysis took place between June 2017 and July 2018.

Findings

We identified a total of 27 diagnostic studies (including 3821 participants). There were disagreements between diagnostic test accuracy data both within and between studies when different HIT methods were compared with other diagnostic procedures. The proportion of correctly identified people having the disease (sensitivity) ranged between 0% and 100% (median, 41%), whereas the proportion of correctly identified people without the disease (specificity) was higher and ranged between 56% and 100% (median, 94%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Based on the studies included in this review, sensitivity, specificity, and, more importantly, the risk of misdiagnosis and associated undertreatment or overtreatment cannot be reliably estimated by HIT methods for patients with vestibular symptoms. We recommend that further diagnostic studies consider (1) multiple possible underlying causes of vestibular symptoms and multiple test thresholds, (2) a representative sample of patients with and without the disease, and (3) reporting guidelines for diagnostic test accuracy studies.

### Challenges in systematic reviews of diagnostic technologies [^9aa231dd]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Diagnostic tests are critical components of effective health care. They help determine treatments that are most beneficial for a given patient. Their assessment is a complex process that includes such challenges as a dearth of studies that evaluate clinical outcomes and lack of data on use of the test in realistic clinical settings. The methodologic quality of studies of diagnostic tests also lags behind the quality of studies of therapeutic interventions. Statistical methods to combine diagnostic accuracy data are more complex and not as well developed, leading to difficulties in the interpretation of results. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Technology Assessment Program has adopted a 6-level framework for evaluating diagnostic technologies. The model emphasizes the need for systematic reviews of diagnostic test studies to go beyond the assessment of technical feasibility and accuracy to examine the impact of the test on health outcomes. In this paper, we use examples from 3 Evidence-based Practice Center reports to illustrate 3 challenges reviewers may face when reviewing diagnostic test literature: finding relevant studies, assessing methodologic quality of diagnostic accuracy studies, and synthesizing studies that evaluate tests in different patient populations or use different outcomes.

### Evaluation of delayed puberty: what diagnostic tests should be performed in the seemingly otherwise well adolescent? [^e403b26e]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Delayed puberty (DP) is defined as the lack of pubertal development by an age that is 2–2.5 SDs beyond the population mean. Although it generally represents a normal variant in pubertal timing, concern that DP could be the initial presentation of a serious underlying disorder has led to a diagnostic approach that is variable and may include tests that are unnecessary and costly. In this review, we examine available literature regarding the recommended diagnostic tests and aetiologies identified during the evaluation of youth with DP. We view this literature through the prism of the seemingly otherwise well adolescent. To provide further clinical context, we also evaluate the clinical and laboratory data from patients seen with DP in our centre over a 2-year period. The literature and our data reveal wide variability in the number of tests performed and raise the question of whether tests, other than gonadotropins, obtained in the absence of signs or symptoms of an underlying disorder are routinely warranted. Together this information provides a pragmatic rationale for revisiting recommendations calling for broad testing during the initial diagnostic evaluation of an otherwise healthy adolescent with DP. We highlight the need for further research comparing the utility of broader screening with a more streamlined approach, such as limiting initial testing to gonadotropins and a bone age, which, while not diagnostic, is often useful for height prediction, followed by close clinical monitoring. If future research supports a more streamlined approach to DP, then much unnecessary testing could be eliminated.

### Correctly using sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values in clinical practice: how to avoid three common pitfalls [^afbb78e8]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Radiology is the specialty of imaging-based diagnostic tests. Understanding the science behind evaluating diagnostic test performance is essential for radiologists because we provide care to patients and interact with our colleagues.

Conclusion

Here, we review the key terminology used and common pitfalls encountered in the literature and in day-to-day discussions of diagnostic test performance.

### Defining and measuring diagnostic uncertainty in medicine: a systematic review [^4452cf30]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

Diagnostic uncertainty, while prevalent, has not been comprehensively evaluated in current literature and medical practice. Although various methods have been used to study diagnostic uncertainty in clinical practice, evidence is limited as to which of these is the most useful or relevant, and no comprehensive measurement framework exists. On the basis of this review, we propose that diagnostic uncertainty be defined as " subjective perception of an inability to provide an accurate explanation of the patient's health problem." As next steps, we need to adopt a uniform definition of diagnostic uncertainty and work toward methodological advances in measuring diagnostic uncertainty in medical practice. The scientific foundation created in this review can inform future interventions aimed at improving the management of diagnostic uncertainty, thereby helping to reduce both under-diagnosis and overuse of health care resources.

### Gastrointestinal symptoms after pelvic radiotherapy: a new understanding to improve management of symptomatic patients [^d4fe85eb]. The Lancet: Oncology (2007). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal symptoms after pelvic radiotherapy, which affect quality of life, are substantially more common than generally recognised and are frequently poorly managed. These symptoms develop because radiation can induce change in one or more specific physiological functions in widely separated parts of the gastrointestinal tract that lie in the path of the radiotherapy beam. Radiation-induced changes are not confined by normal anatomical boundaries. Furthermore, pre-existing subclinical disease might be destabilised because of minor gastrointestinal changes induced by radiotherapy. New diseases might manifest after radiotherapy and be confused with symptoms induced by radiotherapy. Different functional deficits might cause the same symptoms. Many patients have more than one cause for their symptoms, which sometimes need very different treatments. Simple diagnostic tests that are used in other contexts, if applied appropriately to patients with new gastrointestinal symptoms after radiotherapy, can identify the underlying causes of new-onset symptoms. Starting treatment without knowing the cause of the symptom is commonly ineffective because prediction of the combination of treatments needed is difficult. Evidence suggests that many patients have unusual but highly treatable malfunctions of gastrointestinal physiology, which if correctly diagnosed may enable a patient with difficult symptoms to be helped.

### Research methods: diagnostic test characteristics [^3b7dccfb]. Hospital Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

The goal of a diagnostic test is to provide information on the probability of disease. In this article, we review the principles of diagnostic test characteristics, including sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, receiver operating characteristics curves, likelihood ratios, and interval likelihood ratios. We illustrate how interval likelihood ratios optimize the information that can be obtained from test results that can take on > 2 values, how they are reflected in the slope of the receiver operating characteristics curve, and how they can be easily calculated from published data.

### Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of diagnostic test accuracy [^e6ded443]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy summarize the accuracy, e.g. the sensitivity and specificity, of diagnostic tests in a systematic and transparent way. The aim of such a review is to investigate whether a test is sufficiently specific or sensitive to fit its role in practice, to compare the accuracy of two or more diagnostic tests, or to investigate where existing variation in results comes from. The search strategy should be broad and preferably fully reported, to enable readers to assess the completeness of it. Included studies usually have a cross-sectional design in which the tests of interest, ideally both the index test and its comparator, are evaluated against the reference standard. They should be a reflection of the situation that the review question refers to. The quality of included studies is assessed with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 checklist, containing items such as a consecutive and all-inclusive patient selection process, blinding of index test and reference standard assessment, a valid reference standard, and complete verification of all included participants. Studies recruiting cases separately from (healthy) controls are regarded as bearing a high risk of bias. For meta-analysis, the bivariate model or the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic model is used. These models take into account potential threshold effects and the correlation between sensitivity and specificity. They also allow addition of covariates for investigatation of potential sources of heterogeneity. Finally, the results from the meta-analyses should be explained and interpreted for the reader, to be well understood.

### Pivotal evaluation of the accuracy of a biomarker used for classification or prediction: standards for study design [^8639e95e]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2008). Low credibility.

Biomarkers are developed for many different purposes, including for classification and prediction, as surrogate outcomes in clinical trials, as measures of toxic or preventive exposures, or as a guide to individual treatment choice. In this commentary, we consider only the first category, which includes diagnostic, screening, and prognostic markers. A diagnostic marker is used in people with signs or symptoms to aid in assessing whether they have a condition. A screening marker is used in asymptomatic people to detect a disease or condition at an early stage. A prognostic marker is used in subjects diagnosed with a condition to predict subsequent outcomes, such as disease recurrence or progression. The PRoBE design is intended for all of these applications.

Development of a biomarker is a process that begins with biomarker discovery, is followed by rigorous evaluation of classification accuracy, and then terminates with the evaluation of the impact of the biomarker on clinical outcomes. Multiple studies may be involved in each stage. For example, in the discovery stage, a sequence of studies may be performed to identify biomarkers from among a large pool of candidates, to validate these individual markers in independent samples, and to optimally combine markers from a panel. We focus on the intermediate stage, after all discovery work is completed. We assume that a well-defined biomarker, or marker combination, is to be definitively evaluated for its classification accuracy in a specific clinical application. If it can be shown that the marker has acceptable classification accuracy, the marker should move to the final stage of evaluation, in which the net benefit to patients is assessed by incorporating effects of clinical interventions recommended for patients on the basis of their biomarker results. Clearly, before biomarker results are used in making medical decisions for individuals, it is crucial to know how accurately the marker classifies or predicts their outcomes.

### The generalized rash: part I. differential diagnosis [^36efc081]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Physicians often have difficulty diagnosing a generalized rash because many different conditions produce similar rashes, and a single condition can result in different rashes with varied appearances. A rapid and accurate diagnosis is critically important to make treatment decisions, especially when mortality or significant morbidity can occur without prompt intervention. When a specific diagnosis is not immediately apparent, it is important to generate an inclusive differential diagnosis to guide diagnostic strategy and initial treatment. In part I of this two-part article, tables listing common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rash are presented to help generate an inclusive differential diagnosis. The tables describe the key clinical features and recommended tests to help accurately diagnose generalized rashes. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the primary care physician must decide whether to observe and treat empirically, perform further diagnostic testing, or refer the patient to a dermatologist. This decision depends on the likelihood of a serious disorder and the patient's response to treatment.

### Extraesophageal symptoms and diseases attributed to GERD: where is the pendulum swinging now? [^111f3076]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Ambulatory reflux testing on versus off therapy — Testing off antisecretory therapy allows documentation of baseline reflux, and a negative pH or pH-impedance study off therapy in patients not responding to PPIs significantly reduces the likelihood that reflux is a contributing cause, whereas on therapy gives evidence that symptoms are not induced by reflux. There is no consensus regarding the definition of abnormal pH-impedance testing on therapy. In clinical practice, off therapy testing may be considered in patients without previously documented or suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), whereas on therapy testing may be a better option in patients with pathologic reflux; even if pathologic reflux is demonstrated, no single testing methodology can definitively identify reflux as the cause of suspected extraesophageal symptoms. Overall, ambulatory pH/impedance and pharyngeal pH monitoring have limited ability to establish GERD as the cause of an extraesophageal symptom, the main role of testing is to document the absence of GERD, and testing on or off PPI therapy may be dependent on the pretest probability that underlying GERD is present.

### Quantifying how tests reduce diagnostic uncertainty [^476946e7]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnostic tests are commonly evaluated from sensitivity and specificity, which are robust and independent of prevalence, but clinically not intuitive. Many clinicians prefer to use positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV), but they are frequently applied as if they are independent of prevalence, whereas this may make an important difference.

Methods and Results

We present graphs that allow easy reference to appropriate values and demonstrate that PPV and NPV are not independent of prevalence. PPV and NPV figures reflect the prior probability of the case having a positive diagnosis, estimated clinically from the history, examination and other results, as well as the impact of the test result. To avoid the common error of allowing for prior probability twice, and to interpret the impact of the test result alone, we present graphs of the proportionate reduction in uncertainty score (PRU), calculated from sensitivity, specificity and prevalence. These plots show the extent to which either a positive or negative test result affects the remaining degree of uncertainty about a diagnosis in either direction, according to likely clinical prevalence.

Conclusions

PRU plots demonstrate the discriminatory value of tests more clearly than sensitivity and specificity from which they are derived, and should be published alongside them.

### How to: evaluate a diagnostic test [^f7c448f9]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The development of an in vitro diagnostic test from a good idea to a clinically relevant tool takes several steps, with more stringent requirements at every step.

Objectives

This article aims to summarize the necessary questions to be asked about a test and to illustrate study designs answering these questions. We also aim to relate Regulation (EU) 2017/746 to the needs of evidence-based diagnostic testing, where applicable.

Sources

We used literature on evidence-based diagnostics, a text book on clinical trials in the development and marketing of medical devices and the English version of Regulation 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council on in vitro diagnostic medical devices.

Content

The combination of different test uses and different stages of development determine the required test characteristics and suitability of study designs. In an earlier stage of test development it may be crucial to know whether a test can differentiate diseased persons from healthy controls, although this tells us little about how a test will perform in practice. Later stages focus on the diagnostic accuracy of a test in a clinically relevant situation. However, a test that perfectly distinguishes between patients with and without a certain condition may still have little effect on patient outcomes. Therefore, randomized controlled trials of testing may be needed, as well as post-marketing monitoring.

Implications

Both researchers and users of tests need to be aware of the limitations of diagnostic test accuracy and realize that accuracy is only indirectly linked to people's health status.

### An overview of meta-analyses of diagnostic tests in infectious diseases [^2c3a9106]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

This review summarizes meta-analyses evaluating the accuracy of diagnostic tests for infectious diseases. Systematic searches identified 55 meta-analyses that satisfied inclusion criteria of reporting diagnostic accuracy of an index test compared with a reference test. All reviews were assessed for methods and reporting. The overall assessment underlined problems in several key steps: reporting detailed information from primary studies about the study design and patient characteristics, reference and index tests characteristics, and review methods. The execution and reporting of systematic reviews of diagnostic tests need to be improved.

### Interpreting COVID-19 test results in clinical settings: It depends! [^9bf139f5]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Tests for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are intended for a disparate and shifting range of purposes: (1) diagnosing patients who present with symptoms to inform individual treatment decisions; (2) organizational uses such as "cohorting" potentially infected patients and staff to protect others; and (3) contact tracing, surveillance, and other public health purposes. Often lost when testing is encouraged is that testing does not by itself confer health benefits. Rather, testing is useful to the extent it forms a critical link to subsequent medical or public health interventions. Such interventions might be individual level, like better diagnosis, treatment, isolation, or quarantine of contacts. They might aid surveillance to understand levels and trends of disease within a defined population that enables informed decisions to implement or relax social distancing measures. In this article, we describe the range of available COVID-19 tests; their accuracy and timing considerations; and the specific clinical, organizational, and public health considerations that warrant different testing strategies. Three representative clinical scenarios illustrate the importance of appropriate test use and interpretation. The reason a patient seeks testing is often a strong indicator of the pretest probability of infection, and thus how to interpret test results. In addition, the level of population spread of the virus and the timing of testing play critical roles in the positive or negative predictive value of the test. We conclude with practical recommendations regarding the need for testing in various contexts, appropriate tests and testing methods, and the interpretation of test results.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^69127a11]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus and resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present important diagnostic evaluation challenges. These range from, on the one hand, understanding the value of signs and symptoms in predicting possible infection, assessing whether existing biochemical and imaging tests can identify infection and recognise patients needing critical care, and on the other hand, evaluating whether new diagnostic tests can allow accurate rapid and point‐of‐care testing. Also, the diagnostic aims are diverse, including identifying current infection, ruling out infection, identifying people in need of care escalation, or testing for past infection and immunity.

This review is part of a suite of reviews on the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease, and deals solely with the diagnostic accuracy of presenting clinical signs and symptoms.

Target condition being diagnosed

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. The key target conditions for this suite of reviews are current SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, current COVID‐19, and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

For current infection, the severity of the disease is important. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate (symptoms such as fever, cough, aches, lethargy but without difficulty breathing at rest); severe (symptoms with breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia and oxygen need); or critical (requiring intensive support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock or other organ dysfunction). People with severe or critical disease require different patient management, which makes it important to distinguish between them.

Thus, there are three target conditions for current infection:

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (asymptomatic or symptomatic of any severity);
mild or moderate COVID‐19;
severe or critical COVID‐19.

In planning review updates, we will consider the potential addition of another grouping (which is a subset of the above):

whether tests exist that identify people requiring respiratory support (SARS or ARDS) or intensive care.

Here we summarise the evidence on signs and symptoms; as a result asymptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are out of scope for this review.

### Studies of medical tests: design and analytical considerations [^4f53d4c3]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Medical tests are procedures intended to detect, diagnose, characterize, or monitor a specific medical condition. Understanding the accuracy of a medical test is a critical part of informed decision-making in patient management, as it allows clinicians to appreciate the types of errors a medical test might be prone to making and how often it makes them. Designing a study to assess the performance of a medical test, however, presents unique challenges, from acquiring a reference standard to dealing with the complexities that arise when the test involves an interpretation by a human reader. This article provides an overview of design considerations in this context, including common biases and how to avoid them, statistical considerations, and reporting guidelines. A short list of questions is also provided, which can serve as a quick reference for anyone designing, implementing, or reviewing a study that intends to assess the performance of a medical test.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^cc21ff65]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Alternative test(s)

We are producing a suite of Cochrane 'living systematic reviews', which will summarise evidence on the clinical accuracy of different tests and diagnostic features, grouped according to the present research questions and settings in the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19. Summary estimates of accuracy from these reviews will help inform diagnostic, screening, isolation, and patient‐management decisions.

New tests are being developed and evidence is emerging at an unprecedented rate during the COVID‐19 pandemic. We will aim to update these reviews as often as is feasible to ensure that they provide the most up‐to‐date evidence about test accuracy.

These reviews are being produced rapidly to assist in providing a central resource of evidence to assist in the COVID‐19 pandemic, summarising available evidence on the accuracy of the tests and presenting characteristics.

Other Cochrane diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) reviews in the suite of reviews are addressing the following tests.

Chest imaging (computed tomography (CT), chest X‐ray and ultrasound (Islam 2021)
Routine laboratory testing, such as for C‐reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) (Stegeman 2020)
Antibody tests (Deeks 2020a)
Laboratory‐independent point‐of‐care and near‐patient molecular and antigen tests (Dinnes 2021)
Molecular laboratory tests (in preparation)

Rationale

It is essential to understand the accuracy of diagnostic features and tests to identify the best way they can be used in different settings to develop effective diagnostic and management pathways. For example, the absence of a highly sensitive sign or symptom is good for ruling out COVID‐19, while the presence of a sign or symptom with high specificity is good for ruling in COVID‐19 ('red flag').

### Extraesophageal symptoms and diseases attributed to GERD: where is the pendulum swinging now? [^388beef5]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Extraesophageal symptoms attributed to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) provides the following diagnostic guidance: Best Practice Advice 1: The role of a gastroenterologist in patients referred for evaluation of suspected extra esophageal symptom is to assess for gastroesophageal etiologies that could contribute to the presenting symptoms. Best Practice Advice 2: Non-GI evaluations by ENT, pulmonary and/or allergy are essential and often should be performed initially in most patients as the cause of the symptoms are more likely explained by these other entities than reflux. Best Practice Advice 3: Empiric therapy with aggressive acid suppression for 6–8 weeks with special focus on response of the extraesophageal symptoms can help in assessing association between reflux and extraesophageal symptoms. Best Practice Advice 4: No single testing methodology exists to definitively identify reflux as the etiology for the suspected extra esophageal symptoms. Best Practice Advice 5: Constellation of patient presentation, diagnostic test results and response to therapy should be employed in the determination of reflux as a possible etiology in extra esophageal symptoms. Best Practice Advice 6: Testing may need to be off or on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy depending on patients' presenting demographics and symptoms in assessing the likelihood of abnormal gastroesophageal reflux. A. On therapy testing may be considered in those with high probability of baseline reflux. B. Off therapy testing may be considered in those with low probability of baseline reflux with the goal of identifying moderate to severe reflux at baseline.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 disease [^e9cb10b1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present important diagnostic evaluation challenges. These range from, on the one hand, understanding the value of signs and symptoms in predicting possible infection, assessing whether existing biochemical and imaging tests can identify infection and recognise patients needing critical care, and on the other hand, evaluating whether new diagnostic tests can allow accurate rapid and point‐of‐care testing. Also, the diagnostic aims are diverse, including identifying current infection, ruling out infection, identifying people in need of care escalation, or testing for past infection.

This review is part of a cluster of reviews on the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease, and deals solely with the diagnostic accuracy of presenting clinical signs and symptoms for diagnosing COVID‐19 disease.

Target condition being diagnosed

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is diagnosed with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), which is a test that detects the virus' genetic material, with imaging to identify lung abnormalities and with clinical signs and symptoms.

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate; severe (causing breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia and oxygen need); or critical (requiring intensive support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock or other organ dysfunction). People with COVID‐19 pneumonia (severe or critical disease), require different patient management, which makes it important to distinguish between mild or moderate COVID‐19 disease and COVID‐19 pneumonia.

In this review, we will examine the diagnostic value of signs and symptoms for symptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, which includes mild or moderate COVID‐19 disease and COVID‐19 pneumonia.

In planning review updates, we will consider the potential addition of another grouping, which is a subset of the above:

whether tests exist that identify people requiring respiratory support (SARS or ARDS) or intensive care.

Rapid molecular diagnostic testing — benefits and harms include that, when ideally completed while the patient is physically present, it allows management decisions related to treatment and isolation to be made and enacted quickly, may reduce the period of patient anxiety while test results are pending, and decreases concerns about losing patients to follow-up while simplifying follow-up; however, despite very high specificities, potential harms of false positive results include unnecessary isolation, anxiety, delays in investigating the true cause of symptoms, unnecessary therapy for COVID-19, increased days away from work or school, and unnecessary contact tracing.

VA/DoD clinical practice guideline (CPG) for low back pain — 2017 recommendations: For patients with low back pain, we recommend that clinicians conduct a history and physical examination, that should include identifying and evaluating neurologic deficits (e.g., radiculopathy, neurogenic claudication), red flag symptoms associated with serious underlying pathology (e.g., malignancy, fracture, infection), and psychosocial factors. For patients with low back pain, we suggest performing a mental health screening as part of the low back pain evaluation and taking results into consideration during selection of treatment. For patients with acute axial low back pain (i.e., localized, non-radiating), we recommend against routinely obtaining imaging studies or invasive diagnostic tests. For patients with low back pain, we recommend diagnostic imaging and appropriate laboratory testing when neurologic deficits are serious or progressive or when red flag symptoms are present.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular testing — Recommendation 5 states: The IDSA panel suggests performing a single NAAT and not repeating testing routinely in symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19 whose initial NAAT result is negative (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). The panel considered symptomatic patients to have at least one of the most common symptoms compatible with COVID-19 (Table 1). While the yield of repeat testing is low and therefore repeat testing is not suggested routinely, there may be situations where repeat testing might be considered, such as development of new or worsening symptoms in the absence of alternative explanations, timing of symptom onset that might drive a need for repeat testing, or a poorly collected specimen that could yield a falsely negative result. If performed, repeat testing should generally occur 24–48 hours after initial testing and once the initial NAAT result has returned as negative, and another specimen type, preferably a lower respiratory tract specimen if the patient has signs/symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection, should be considered for repeat testing.

### Meta-analysis of clinical studies of diagnostic tests: developments in how the receiver operating characteristic "works" [^e34d5566]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Meta-analytic summaries are needed on clinical studies of diagnostic tests. Meta-analyses on clinical studies of diagnostic tests commonly use the receiver operating characteristic method, which differs conceptually and computationally from the more widely known meta-analytic methods applicable in other contexts, such as in studies of randomized controlled trials. Important conceptual differences for clinical studies of diagnostic tests versus randomized controlled trials are that the study subpopulations are not defined by random allocation and the test threshold typically varies across studies to accommodate "rule in" versus "rule out" testing strategies. The receiver operating characteristic method has evolved substantially in the past decade, and the most recent approaches use multilevel regression methods that require iterative computational solutions to estimate the influence of the study-level variables. Using current methodology, a meta-analysis on clinical studies of diagnostic tests can address questions relevant to the clinical application of a diagnostic test that cannot be answered at the level of the individual study.

### Antibody tests for identification of current and past infection with SARS-CoV-2 [^6a1ae9df]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus and resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present important diagnostic evaluation challenges. These range from understanding the value of signs and symptoms in predicting possible infection, assessing whether existing biochemical and imaging tests can identify infection and people needing critical care, and evaluating whether new diagnostic tests can allow accurate rapid and point‐of‐care testing, either to identify current infection, rule out infection, identify people in need of care escalation, or to test for past infection and immunity.

We are creating and maintaining a suite of living systematic reviews to cover the roles of tests and characteristics in the diagnosis of COVID‐19. This review summarises evidence of the accuracy of COVID‐19 antibody tests; both laboratory‐based tests and point‐of‐care tests.

Target condition being diagnosed

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. The key target conditions for this suite of reviews are current SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, current COVID‐19 disease, and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

Antibody tests are being considered and evaluated for both:

identification of past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and
current infection.

For current infection the severity of the disease is of importance. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate (symptoms such as fever, cough, aches, lethargy but without difficulty breathing at rest); severe (symptoms with breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia); or critical (requiring respiratory support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). People with COVID‐19 pneumonia (severe or critical disease) require different patient management, and it is important to be able to identify them. There is no consideration that antibody tests are able to distinguish severity of disease, thus, in this review, we consider their role for detecting SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of any severity (asymptomatic or symptomatic).

### Laboratory diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 infection [^68006fb6]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The optimal diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 infection should be selected based on a patient's clinical syndrome and presentation in relation to symptom onset. Molecular testing, most often reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, offers the highest sensitivity and specificity during acute infection, whereas antigen testing can also be useful for acute diagnosis when rapid turnaround of results is necessary or if molecular testing is unavailable. Serologic testing is often reserved for identifying individuals with prior or late COVID-19 infection.

### Ophthalmic statistics note 5: diagnostic tests-sensitivity and specificity [^98e5ea3e]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Lessons learned

Sensitivity and specificity are useful summary measures for describing the diagnostic utility of a testing method. Test utility measures should be summarised using CIs.
As a condition will usually have a low prevalence in the population, a positive test result is likely to require independent confirmation even when using a highly sensitive test, while a negative finding is more likely to be truly negative.
The cut-off used to define a positive test can be selected to obtain an optimal compromise between sensitivity and specificity. A useful strategy for comparing diagnostic test performance is to compare sensitivities at equivalent specificities.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing guideline — question generation and search strategy are described as follows: Clinical questions were developed in Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes (PICO) format, with panel members prioritizing patient-oriented outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2 testing and considering the impact of results on infection prevention and public health practices. In this update, the panel retired questions on testing specimens from the upper versus lower respiratory tract in patients with lower respiratory tract disease and on testing of immunocompromised individuals due to absence of relevant data. The evidence search used a highly sensitive search from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), added the term COVID, and queried Ovid Medline, Embase, and Cochrane for studies from 2019 through July 1, 2022, with horizon scans, consultation with field experts, and review of reference lists and panelist-suggested literature; preprints were followed for final publication but were not included unless published.

### Are point-of-care (POC) virological tests what is needed? [^92418bc7]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Point-of-care (POC) tests are becoming more available, although the way in which they should be used is currently undecided. Any 'laboratory'-based diagnosis of respiratory infections has three components: the specimen taken, the test used, and the interpretation of the results. Each of these components needs to be carefully addressed when using POC tests for the diagnosis of respiratory tract infections. Given the enthusiasm with which POC tests are being developed, it is likely that they will be used more and more widely. If so, the advantages and limitations of their use should be fully discussed and the implications recognised.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^8dae511d]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) diagnostic testing — For patients with otherwise unremarkable history and examination, skin or in vitro testing for IgE to inhalants or foods and/or extensive laboratory testing are not recommended. Targeted laboratory testing based on clinical suspicion is appropriate, and limited routine laboratory testing can be performed to exclude underlying causes. Limited laboratory testing includes a CBC with differential, sedimentation rate, and/or C-reactive protein, liver enzyme, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement, and in such patients limited laboratory testing might be appropriate to identify infrequent or rare causes or provide "reassurance value." Serology to diagnose underlying autoimmune diseases is not warranted in the initial evaluation without additional suggestive features, and routine testing for thyroid autoantibodies is not recommended. Evidence does not support testing for Helicobacter pylori infection or celiac disease in otherwise unremarkable patients, and there are no convincing data that treatment based on such abnormal test results leads to improvement or change in the course of CU. Routine laboratory testing in typical CU rarely yields clinically significant findings, screening for thyroid disease is of low yield without symptoms or history, and increased anti-thyroglobulin or antithyroid antibodies in euthyroid subjects are commonly detected although the clinical implications are unclear.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

When the natural exposure to elevated aeroallergens produces symptoms as described under Clinical Pharmacology, specific diagnosis and therapeutic procedures are indicated. Clearly, important clues to the cause of a person's allergic condition can be gleaned from a thorough history and careful physical examination. Diagnostic tests - in vitro or in vivo - serve only to confirm the physician's suspicions or to improve investigative skills. Specific diagnosis is especially indicated when the patient's symptoms are not controlled by medication. When immunotherapy is contemplated demonstration of sensitivity to a specific allergenic extract is necessary. An orderly approach to the use of diagnostic tests usually begins with direct skin testing.5,6,11

### Diagnostic evaluation for myositis and their pitfalls [^975155d8]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Myositis is a systemic autoimmune disorder that affects multiple organ systems, including the skeletal muscles, lungs, skin, and joints. The clinical presentation can vary significantly, and physicians must tailor the diagnostic evaluation for each patient, reflecting a personalized approach rather than relying on a standardized routine order set. Each diagnostic test has its own advantages, limitations, and pitfalls, requiring careful interpretation of results to make appropriate clinical decisions. In this article, we discuss the clinical applications of laboratory tests, myositis antibodies, imaging, electromyography, and muscle histopathology with key points to consider when interpreting the results.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^56468237]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing — symptomatic patients summarizes that no direct patient- or population-centered outcome evidence comparing testing versus no testing was found, so the panel relied on diagnostic accuracy from five studies with 349 positive and 530 negative patients using standard nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) reference standards defined as a composite of more than two standard NAATs using nasopharyngeal or nasal swabs. Pooled performance showed sensitivity 97% (95% CI: 93 to 99) and specificity 100% (95% CI: 96 to 100). For symptomatic patients, the panel considered prevalences of 5%, 20% and 50%; across this range there were 1–15 predicted false-negative results and no predicted false-positive results per 1,000 individuals. Certainty was rated moderate due to indirectness from lack of direct comparisons of tested versus untested individuals and from studies including mixed or unspecified symptom status. Diagnostic testing for symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is stated as needed because clinical assessment alone is not accurate, and harms noted include that false-negative results could cause symptomatic individuals to spread SARS-CoV-2 and deny such patients appropriate therapy, while false-positive results can isolate individuals who do not have COVID-19, causing unnecessary anxiety and delaying additional evaluation.

### The influence of rapid influenza diagnostic testing on clinician decision-making for patients with acute respiratory infection in urgent care [^0a47fd01]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The results of our primary analysis identified differences in clinical decision-making regardless of the RIDT result, suggesting the mere presence of the RIDT may have altered diagnostic and treatment behavior by putting the clinician in the frame of mind that the patient's symptoms could be caused by a viral pathogen rather than a bacterial infection, especially considering the RIDT was deployed during the influenza season. Additional research is needed to explore the underlying cause driving these results.

Consistent with previous research, we found a decrease in laboratory testing ordered for RIDT(+) patients, but to a different extent. Previous studies found reductions in CBC panels, blood cultures, urinalyses, and urine cultures ordered for patients with ARI symptoms in the presence of positive RIDT results. Our study identified reductions in rapid streptococcal screening and RT-PCR. However, no significant reduction was identified for already very low rates of RT-PCR in the secondary analysis. The difference in results may be driven by the clinical setting, age of participants, or changes in clinical practices in the 15 years between studies. A reduction of diagnostic testing due to RIDT use would likely lead to a lower cost of care and shorter treatment duration as identified in previous studies.

### Considerations for diagnostic COVID-19 tests [^ba3baee9]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2021). High credibility.

During the early phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, design, development, validation, verification and implementation of diagnostic tests were actively addressed by a large number of diagnostic test manufacturers. Hundreds of molecular tests and immunoassays were rapidly developed, albeit many still await clinical validation and formal approval. In this Review, we summarize the crucial role of diagnostic tests during the first global wave of COVID-19. We explore the technical and implementation problems encountered during this early phase in the pandemic, and try to define future directions for the progressive and better use of (syndromic) diagnostics during a possible resurgence of COVID-19 in future global waves or regional outbreaks. Continuous global improvement in diagnostic test preparedness is essential for more rapid detection of patients, possibly at the point of care, and for optimized prevention and treatment, in both industrialized countries and low-resource settings.

### Revised criteria for diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer's disease: Alzheimer's association workgroup [^cb3f0f40]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). High credibility.

Alzheimer's disease diagnostic framework — fundamental principles states that it is necessary to separate syndrome (clinically identified impairment) from biology (etiology), that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined by its biology and by its unique neuropathologic findings so detection of AD neuropathologic change by biomarkers is equivalent to diagnosing the disease, that AD exists on a continuum with the appearance of disease-specific Core biomarkers while people are asymptomatic, that symptoms are a result of the disease process and are not necessary to diagnose AD, that unimpaired individuals with abnormal biomarker test results are at risk for symptoms due to AD and are not at risk for a disease they already have, that clinical syndromes commonly seen with AD may also be caused by disorders other than AD so clinical presentation alone is not diagnostic of AD, and that the same AD biology may result in different phenotypic presentations.

### Effectiveness of tests to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus, and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, to inform COVID-19 diagnosis: a rapid systematic review [^3ab1da44]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Objectives

We undertook a rapid systematic review with the aim of identifying evidence that could be used to answer the following research questions: (1) What is the clinical effectiveness of tests that detect the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to inform COVID-19 diagnosis? (2) What is the clinical effectiveness of tests that detect the presence of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus to inform COVID-19 diagnosis?

Design and Setting

Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of diagnostic test accuracy. We systematically searched for all published evidence on the effectiveness of tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus, or antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, up to 4 May 2020, and assessed relevant studies for risks of bias using the QUADAS-2 framework.

Main Outcome Measures

Measures of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value) were the main outcomes of interest. We also included studies that reported influence of testing on subsequent patient management, and that reported virus/antibody detection rates where these facilitated comparisons of testing in different settings, different populations or using different sampling methods.

Results

38 studies on SARS-CoV-2 virus testing and 25 studies on SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing were identified. We identified high or unclear risks of bias in the majority of studies, most commonly as a result of unclear methods of patient selection and test conduct, or because of the use of a reference standard that may not definitively diagnose COVID-19. The majority were in hospital settings, in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. Pooled analysis of 16 studies (3818 patients) estimated a sensitivity of 87.8% (95% CI 81.5% to 92.2%) for an initial reverse-transcriptase PCR test. For antibody tests, 10 studies reported diagnostic accuracy outcomes: sensitivity ranged from 18.4% to 96.1% and specificity 88.9% to 100%. However, the lack of a true reference standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis makes it challenging to assess the true diagnostic accuracy of these tests. Eighteen studies reporting different sampling methods suggest that for virus tests, the type of sample obtained/type of tissue sampled could influence test accuracy. Finally, we searched for, but did not identify, any evidence on how any test influences subsequent patient management.

Conclusions

Evidence is rapidly emerging on the effectiveness of tests for COVID-19 diagnosis and management, but important uncertainties about their effectiveness and most appropriate application remain. Estimates of diagnostic accuracy should be interpreted bearing in mind the absence of a definitive reference standard to diagnose or rule out COVID-19 infection. More evidence is needed about the effectiveness of testing outside of hospital settings and in mild or asymptomatic cases. Implementation of public health strategies centred on COVID-19 testing provides opportunities to explore these important areas of research.

### Overuse of diagnostic testing in healthcare: a systematic review [^0cabd0fc]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2022). High credibility.

Conclusion

This study shows that there is substantial overuse of diagnostic testing present across all healthcare settings, with much variation among similar diagnostic services. Preoperative testing and imaging for non-specific low back pain are the most frequently assessed and overused low-value diagnostic tests. Effective strategies to tackle the overuse of diagnostic testing must be developed and implemented by health systems, providers, policymakers and others. Additionally, more uniform definitions and assessments of low-value diagnostic tests are required in order to obtain a better understanding of the magnitude of diagnostic testing overuse.

Evidence notes that "most patients with lumbar disc herniation and radiculopathy will improve with noninvasive management within four weeks," and that imaging "did not significantly improve outcomes in patients for whom there was no pretest concern for serious underlying conditions"; red flags analyzed "included suspicion or history of cancer, IV drug use, indwelling vascular catheter, and other infection sites." The Work Group observed that "the laboratory and imaging tests in question posed relatively little harm; however, there is enormous harm caused by failure to diagnose a serious pathology," and despite "very low quality evidence," "the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low," yet it "concluded this recommendation continued to merit a Strong for rating considering the high likelihood of catastrophic harms from a failure to identify a serious underlying condition that is causing LBP."

### Diagnostic testing and decision-making: beauty is not just in the eye of the beholder [^cdb22821]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

DESIGN OF A DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY STUDY

Rigorous study design is essential for a diagnostic accuracy study. First, the study objective must be clearly stated. Because the chosen population greatly influences the diagnostic accuracy results, as well as their meaning and applicability, researchers must describe the exact patient population about which they want to make inference.

Questions to consider include the following: Which patients are targeted? Those who already have had a positive result on a certain prescreening test? Those with a certain background predisposing them to have or not have the disease or outcome of interest? Is the goal one of estimation of diagnostic accuracy, comparison between biomarkers, or comparison between populations? Is the biomarker or modality of interest new or well-established?

Choice of the gold standard method used to define diseased versus nondiseased patients should be carefully considered. Many times there is no perfect gold standard — a clear study limitation. An imperfect gold standard raises important questions of how the data will be analyzed and how the results can be interpreted. Nevertheless, statistical methods can attempt to account for an imperfect gold standard. Reliability of the biomarker or medical test being evaluated should also be assessed and reported.

Calculation of the appropriate sample size depends on the goal of the study being either estimation of diagnostic accuracy or comparing biomarkers or groups on diagnostic accuracy. When estimating diagnostic accuracy, the goal is typically to estimate the parameter of interest with a desired precision, measured by the expected width of the CI. When comparing biomarkers or groups on diagnostic accuracy, the difference to detect between the biomarkers or populations needs to be specified, and the sample size determined accordingly.

Of note, if the prevalence of the disease is expected to be low in the study sample (< 50%), then estimation of or detecting differences in sensitivity would drive the sample size because the truly diseased would have a smaller overall sample size compared to the nondiseased, and sufficient power or precision for the smaller sample (the diseased) would guarantee it for the larger sample (the nondiseased). Likewise, specificity would drive the calculations if prevalence was expected to be > 50%.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: antigen testing (January 2023) [^5aa6fddd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 antigen testing guidelines — overview of diagnostic role and evidence: Immunoassays detecting SARS-CoV-2 protein antigens are commonly used, with lateral flow assays generating results in approximately 15 minutes at the point of care. US Food and Drug Administration SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests with Emergency Use Authorization have high specificity and low to moderate sensitivity compared with nucleic acid amplification testing, and sensitivity depends on symptom status and, in symptomatic patients, on timing after symptom onset. In most cases, positive results can be acted upon without confirmation. Results of point-of-care testing are comparable to laboratory-based testing, and observed or unobserved self-collection yields similar results. Modeling suggests repeat antigen testing increases sensitivity compared with testing once, but no empirical data were available. Based on these observations, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT remain the testing methods of choice for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection; when timely molecular testing is not readily available or is logistically infeasible, antigen testing helps identify individuals with infection. The panel used GRADE, reviewed literature through 1 April 2022, and graded the overall quality of evidence as very low to moderate.

### Rapid, point-of-care antigen and molecular-based tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^cf72b4ce]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of rapid point‐of‐care antigen and molecular‐based tests to determine if a person presenting in the community or in primary or secondary care has current SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and to consider accuracy separately in symptomatic and asymptomatic population groups.

We estimated accuracy overall and separately according to symptom status (symptomatic and asymptomatic). Although we might expect to see differences in accuracy for testing of asymptomatic individuals with an epidemiological exposure to SARS‐CoV‐2 (targeted screening) compared to testing of asymptomatic individuals in a population screening setting, we did not anticipate finding sufficient numbers of studies for each testing application to allow any such difference to be explored. We will revisit this decision in subsequent iterations of this review.

Secondary objectives

Where data are available, we will investigate potential sources of heterogeneity that may influence diagnostic accuracy (either by stratified analysis or meta‐regression) according to test method and index test, participant or sample characteristics (duration of symptoms and viral load), study setting, study design and reference standard used.

We investigated adherence to manufacturers' IFUs in sensitivity analyses.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^cb62255d]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline on Overactive Bladder — shared decision‑making approach emphasizes that diagnosis and management are complex because research has not identified a unifying pathophysiology and diagnostic testing has not led to reliable patterns that can guide treatment; nascent research has focused on phenotyping OAB and identifying predictors of treatment outcomes, and incorporating these into shared decision‑making can help clinicians and patients select the best treatment modality and improve outcomes. The text states that we should strive for upfront and clear communication with patients regarding OAB as a poorly understood and chronic syndrome, with interventions designed to mitigate symptoms rather than to treat or resolve an underlying condition, and that shared decision‑making should include a plan of care with emphasis on multiple modalities acceptable to the patient to optimize response.

### Routine laboratory testing to determine if a patient has COVID-19 [^d378188d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Alternative test(s)

The test that is believed to be most accurate in detecting SARS‐CoV‐2 is reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR). In many settings, this test will be available, but the results take time before they become available. Although rapid antigen and molecular‐based tests are also available, the value of these rapid tests is still not clear. Antibody tests provide insights into the antibody response, but may also take a few days before the response is detectable and therefore the results are available.

Alternatives to routine laboratory tests may depend on the setting and situation where the tests are done. For example, in primary care, alternatives may consist of signs and symptoms and rapid and point‐of‐care tests. Similarly, point‐of‐care ultrasound may be used, if resources allow. The benefit of routine laboratory tests (and of signs and symptoms) may be as an indication of the severity of a disease: a value further from the reference values may indicate more severe infections.

In emergency departments, chest X‐ray, ultrasound, and computed tomography (CT) are widely used diagnostic imaging tests to identify COVID‐19 pneumonia. Which imaging test is available may depend on the type of hospital and available resources: a tertiary care hospital in a high‐income country may have a mobile CT scan available, while in smaller hospitals only X‐ray and ultrasound are accessible. These imaging tests have the advantage that the condition of the lungs can be assessed visually.

These other tests are all addressed in the other Cochrane DTA reviews in this suite of reviews (Deeks 2020a; Dinnes 2020; McInnes 2020; Struyf 2020).

Rationale

It is essential to understand the accuracy of tests and diagnostic features to identify how they can be used optimally in different settings to develop effective diagnostic and management pathways. New evidence about routine laboratory testing is becoming available quickly. Therefore, we have produced a Cochrane 'living systematic review' (a systematic review that is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available) that will summarize new and existing evidence on the clinical accuracy of routine laboratory markers. Estimates of accuracy from this review will help inform diagnostic, screening, and patient management decisions.

### Medical imaging and diagnostics program: research on… [^eaceb42f]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

The Medical Imaging and Diagnostics Program in the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health conducts regulatory science research to help ensure patient access to innovative, safe, and effective imaging and diagnostic medical devices. This is one of 20 research programs in CDRH's Office of Science and Engineering Laboratories. Medical Imaging and Diagnostics and Medical Devices Advances in medical imaging and diagnostics are resulting in new minimally invasive procedures and applications for medical devices in areas such as early breast cancer detection, brain imaging, retinal imaging, skin wound evaluation, modern endoscopy, diagnostic ultrasound imaging, and photoacoustic imaging. The FDA has seen substantial growth in the number of submissions and technical consults related to medical imaging and diagnostics over the last few years; for example, OSEL has conducted about 600 consults on novel endoscopes for seven review branches in CDRH since 2013.

However, because emerging devices are different from a functional standpoint than traditional imaging and diagnostic technologies, the technological and regulatory considerations are unique to these emerging platforms. Despite its increased use, currently there are few or no regulatory tools specific for evaluating common risks associated with novel medical imaging and diagnostics devices. Regulatory Science Gaps and Challenges Major regulatory science gaps and challenges that drive the Medical Imaging and Diagnostics Program are:

- Lack of simple imaging phantoms that work with new images and complex tissues.
- Lack of fully validated, standardized, hydrophone-spatial-averaging correction methods that work with most common diagnostic ultrasound applications.
- Lack of standardized performance test methods for emerging photoacoustic imaging.

The Medical Imaging and Diagnostics Program is intended to fill these knowledge gaps by fostering the development of predictable methods to evaluate existing and emerging technologies, least burdensome alternatives, and complements to clinical studies such as modeling and simulation, bench-top testing methods, and phantom development. Medical Imaging and Diagnostics Program Activities The Medical Imaging and Diagnostics Program focuses on regulatory science research in these areas:

- Advanced X-ray Imaging Methods
- Magnetic Resonance Imaging
- Optical Spectroscopy and Spectral Imaging
- Endoscopy
- Ultrasound Imaging
- Ultrasound Imaging Safety
- Photoacoustic Imaging
- Remote Vital Signs Detection
- Statistical Assessment For more information, email OSEL_imaging_diagnostics@fda. hhs. gov.

### Characterizing pediatric aspiration pneumonia: diagnostic gaps and stewardship opportunities [^1b72e7ec]. Hospital Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Aspiration pneumonia is a common cause for hospitalization, especially in children with medical complexity, yet there are no standard definition or clinical practice guidelines for the condition. Our objectives were to assess the validity of the aspiration pneumonia billing code and to describe the demographics, presenting symptoms, diagnostic results, and outcomes of children hospitalized with this condition.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 200 patients hospitalized with an International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10) diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia from 2016 to 2021. We conducted a standardized medical record review to identify children with a clinician diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia and collected data on patient and hospitalization characteristics across 4 subgroups defined by a combination of clinical and radiographic features.

Results

Among 200 patients identified by ICD-10 code, 138 (69%) also had a clinician diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia. For these 138 patients, the mean age was 8.4 years (SD, 7), and most had an underlying medical complexity. Diagnostic testing, antibiotic selection, and hospitalization outcomes were similar across definition subgroups. Only 18 patients (13%) had aspiration risk factors, fever, and a probable focal opacity on chest imaging at diagnosis.

Conclusions

We observed significant variability in presenting symptoms and diagnostic testing results among patients assigned a clinician diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia. Our study underscores the need for a standardized clinical definition, improved diagnostic criteria, and evidence-based treatment guidelines to optimize clinical care for this patient population.

### Integrated diagnostics: proceedings from the 9th biennial symposium of the international society for strategic studies in radiology [^5ac1def2]. European Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

The role of radiologists

Integrated diagnostics presents an opportunity for radiology to evolve as a profession and deepen the impact of the radiologist on healthcare. Imaging plays a central role in diagnostics because of its ability to visualize disease in vivo, to measure its extent and severity anatomically, and to characterize it functionally and metabolically both in the context of initial work-up and in response to therapy. As the practice of medicine moves away from an intuitive, experience-based model to empirical, evidence-based and to personalised medicine, diagnostic precision becomes paramount in order to select the particular treatment that will best help each individual patient.

Diagnoses depend on multiple components that include not only imaging, but also clinical observation, pathology, laboratory, and genomic tests. To date, there is too little coordination between the medical specialties responsible for ordering and performing these tests, nor is there enough consideration as to the optimal order of tests. This will change in a world of integrated diagnostics, where, instead of relying on individual provider bias in the selection of tests, data from diverse sources will be used to determine the most efficient diagnostic algorithms. Imaging will be incorporated judiciously into these integrated diagnostic algorithms, complementing other diagnostic techniques in order to maximise efficiency and minimise waste. This may satisfy payers who currently perceive radiology as a major contributor to cost escalation. The American College of Radiology (ACR) has taken some initial steps towards the development of integrated diagnostics in its Appropriateness Criteria®, which are developed by panels of radiologists and other specialists, by including clinical symptoms and the results of laboratory tests in determining imaging appropriateness. Other guidelines have been prepared in other countries, notably in the UK by the Royal College of Radiologists and France by the Société Française de Radiologie; the European Commission is currently revising their guidelines in conjunction with the European Society of Radiology.

### Research areas: cancer diagnosis-NCI… [^893add67]. NCI (2015). Low credibility.

The Importance of Cancer Diagnosis Research Advances in the diagnosis of cancer have the potential to improve outcomes for many patients with the disease. Doctors and patients depend on accurate information from diagnostic tools, such as laboratory tests, imaging studies, and genomic analyses, to make decisions at all stages of cancer care. Diagnostic tools can:

- provide information about a cancer's site of origin
- help determine the extent of cancer within the body, called staging
- show whether a cancer is likely to have been caused by an inherited genetic change
- indicate whether a tumor is a specific subtype based on genetic alterations in the cancer
- inform decisions about treatment, such as identifying the treatment that is most likely to be effective for a patient. Diagnostic tools that identify specific molecular alterations in tumors are also important in the context of precision medicine.

With this information, doctors can determine whether a patient will likely benefit, or likely not benefit, from a particular targeted therapy. In recent years, when the Food and Drug Administration has approved a new targeted treatment, it has often approved tests called companion diagnostics that can be used to determine if a patient's tumor has the target for that therapy. This approach can spare patients from the costs and side effects of a treatment that is unlikely to work for their cancer. Cancer diagnosis research is critical to address these challenges, and advancements are on the horizon. For example, researchers are developing technologies to diagnose cancers based on molecules that cancer cells shed into the blood and other body fluids. Also, innovative imaging technologies, coupled with artificial intelligence, may be able to identify the presence, type, stage, and major genetic features of a cancer without the need for an invasive biopsy.

NCI supports a broad portfolio of research aimed at improving the diagnosis of cancer. This work includes research on novel tools and methods for diagnosing cancer as well as the development of tests and imaging technologies that can provide specific information about a person's disease. Other priorities include the development of diagnostic tools that can be used in low-resource settings and laboratory research.
- The Consortium for Imaging and Biomarkers integrates imaging strategies with biomarkers into complementary screening and diagnosis approaches. The consortium aims to identify early-stage aggressive cancers and distinguish lesions that are life-threatening from those that are not.
- NCI supports research on the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to make sense of large amounts of tumor data, including detailed molecular characteristics and physical features of single cancer cells, tumor images, and other spatial data, that can be leveraged for more accurate cancer diagnoses.

### Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves: the basics and beyond [^65266ad3]. Hospital Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic tests and clinical prediction rules are frequently used to help estimate the probability of a disease or outcome. How well a test or rule distinguishes between disease or no disease (discrimination) can be measured by plotting a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calculating the area under it (AUROC). In this paper, we review the features of ROC curves and interpretation of ROC curves and AUROC values. We highlight 5 underappreciated features of ROC curves: (1) the slope of the ROC curve over a test result interval is the likelihood ratio for that interval; (2) the optimal cutoff for calling a test positive depends not only on the shape of the ROC curve, but also on the pretest probability of disease and relative harms of false-positive and false-negative results; (3) the AUROC measures discrimination only, not the accuracy of the predicted probabilities; (4) the AUROC is not a good measure of discrimination if the slope of the ROC curve is not consistently decreasing; and (5) the AUROC can be increased by including a large number of people correctly identified as being at very low risk for the outcome of interest. We illustrate this last concept using 3 published studies.

### Heterogeneity in systematic reviews of medical imaging diagnostic test accuracy studies: a systematic review [^53a94648]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

A rigorous systematic review provides a meticulous summary of available primary research on a given topic, and is underpinned by features such as clear objectives, definition of reproducible methodology a priori and systematic presentation of findings. These characteristics serve to minimize bias and thereby enhance the credibility of conclusions drawn from the review findings. Systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) studies aim to provide a complete interpretation of existing data regarding diagnostic test performance in a clear and concise way that has obvious relevance to clinical practice.

The component primary studies brought together for systematic review or meta-analysis typically inherently differ. Although the results of component primary studies will always differ to some degree, heterogeneity or between-study variability describe differences in underlying study parametersand can be further classified into 3 main subtypes. Clinical heterogeneity refers to differences in the study population, intervention, diagnostic test applied, or outcomes assessed. Methodological heterogeneity refers to heterogeneity in study design and risk of bias. Statistical heterogeneity refers to differences in the measured effect size of an intervention or accuracy of a diagnostic test beyond what would be expected to be attributable to random, within-study variability alone. Statistical heterogeneity is the product of clinical and methodological variability and randomly occurring effect-size modifiers and only becomes apparent after analysis of the results.DTA reviews are more likely to be affected by high levels of heterogeneity than reviews of interventions. Reasons for this difference include the common presence of threshold effects in DTA studies, the tendency for there to be greater differences in clinical parameters (eg, study design, patient population, and test protocol,) between DTA studies, as well as there being few randomized clinical trials in DTA evaluation despite the ability of randomized clinical trials to confer more thorough control of other variables compared with the observational study designs that are more commonly adopted in DTA studies. Additionally, diagnostic performance is often expressed as a pair of accuracy measures (eg, sensitivity and specificity), whose inherent negative correlation should be accounted for in analyses.

### Rapid, point-of-care antigen and molecular-based tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^072806cc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Target condition being diagnosed

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. The key target conditions for this suite of reviews are current SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, current COVID‐19 disease, and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The tests included in this review concern the identification of current infection.

For current infection, the severity of the disease is of importance. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate (symptoms such as fever, cough, aches, lethargy but without difficulty breathing at rest); severe (symptoms with breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia); or critical (requiring respiratory support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). People with COVID‐19 pneumonia (severe or critical disease) require different patient management, and it is important to be able to identify them. Viral load may also be an indicator of disease severity (Zheng 2020), and whilst the accuracy of antigen and molecular tests have the potential to be affected by participant viral load, the main aim of rapid testing is not to establish viral load. In this review, we therefore consider the role of point‐of‐care tests for detecting SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of any severity.

Index test(s)

The primary consideration for the eligibility of tests for inclusion in this review is that they should detect current infection and should have the capacity to be performed at the 'point of care' or in a 'near‐patient' testing role. There is an ongoing debate around the specific use and definitions of these terms, therefore for the purposes of this review, we consider 'point‐of‐care' and 'near patient' to be synonymous, but for consistency and avoidance of confusion, we use the term 'point‐of‐care' throughout.

We have adapted a definition of point‐of‐care testing, namely that it "refers to decentralized testing that is performed by a minimally trained healthcare professional near a patient and outside of central laboratory testing" (WHO 2018), with the additional caveat that test results must be available within a single clinical encounter (Pai 2012). The key criteria for test inclusion are therefore:

### How much diagnostic safety can we afford, and how should we decide? A health economics perspective [^b9db8503]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2013). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Controlling the costs of healthcare, which now exceed US$2.7 trillion, is an economic imperative. – Costs of diagnostic testing probably account for more than 10% of all healthcare costs, and that fraction is rising rapidly over time, with advanced diagnostic imaging leading the way and diagnostic laboratory testing a close second. Molecular diagnostic testing for 'personalised medicine' may fuel disproportionate rises. Some diagnostic tests are misused or overused, with waste from diagnostic imaging alone estimated at more than US$25 billion.

At the same time, diagnostic errors are frequent and often result in death or disability, with recent estimates suggesting more than a million a year harmed by diagnostic error in the USA. For those harmed, direct costs accrue from failure to treat the true condition, inappropriate testing and treatments for the incorrectly diagnosed one, and any medicolegal costs or payments. Indirect costs also arise from defensive medicine, increased medical liability premiums, and downstream effects. The annual costs of 'defensive medicine' alone — mostly unnecessary diagnostic tests obtained to guard against malpractice law suits — are at least US$45–60 billionand perhaps hundreds of billions.

Given these facts, public awareness campaigns (eg, 'Choosing Wisely') have sought to foster dialogue between doctors and patients about potential ways to improve the safety and efficiency of diagnosis. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to determine whether diagnostic tests are being overused or underused and when 'more' diagnosis is not 'better' diagnosis. In this article, we leverage a case study example (box 1) to explore complex inter-relationships between diagnostic test characteristics, appropriate use, actual use, diagnostic safety and cost effectiveness. We frame our discussion around the question, 'How much diagnostic safety can we afford?' to assess the role of economic analysis and suggest areas for future research related to the public health imperative of better value and safety in diagnosis.

### Rapid, point-of-care antigen and molecular-based tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^7dd81a4f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and the resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present important diagnostic evaluation challenges. These range from: understanding the value of signs and symptoms in predicting possible infection; assessing whether existing biochemical and imaging tests can identify infection or people needing critical care; and evaluating whether new biomarker tests can accurately identify current infection, rule out infection, identify people in need of care escalation, or test for past infection and immunity.

We are creating and maintaining a suite of living systematic reviews to cover the roles of tests and patient characteristics in the diagnosis of COVID‐19. This review summarises evidence for the accuracy of rapid antigen and molecular tests, suitable for use at the point of care, as alternatives to standard laboratory‐based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), that are relied on for identifying current infection. If sufficiently accurate, point‐of‐care tests may have a greater impact on public health than RT‐PCR as they do not require the same technical expertise and laboratory capacity. These tests can be undertaken locally, avoiding the need for centralised testing facilities that rarely meet the needs of patients, caregivers, health workers and society as a whole, especially in low‐ and middle‐income countries. As these are rapid tests, their results can be returned within the same clinical encounter, facilitating timely decisions concerning the need for isolation.

### Diagnostic indicators of non-cardiovascular chest pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9f95d081]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

The included studies showed that most studies investigated tests for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as the underlying disease in non-cardiovascular chest pain (NCCP). Few studies investigated diagnostic tests for other illnesses. The diagnostic value of a PPI treatment test was confirmed, with a ≥ 50% symptom reduction under PPI treatment showing posterior sensitivity and specificity of almost 90%. Together with the favorable adverse effect profile of PPIs, a high dose (double reference dose, twice daily) can quickly provide important diagnostic information in patients with unexplained chest pain. History or presence of typical GERD-associated symptoms increases the likelihood of GERD.

Only limited evidence was available for other prevalent illnesses manifesting with chest pain. Screening tools for panic and anxiety disorders are valuable for identifying patients requiring further diagnostic evaluation. The likelihood for musculoskeletal chest pain increased when the pain was reproducible or relieved by pain medication. Among studies investigating musculoskeletal disease, the major limitation was the lack of a reference test ('gold standard').

### Diagnostic point-of-care tests in resource-limited settings [^1a171597]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

The aim of diagnostic point-of-care testing is to minimise the time to obtain a test result, thereby allowing clinicians and patients to make a quick clinical decision. Because point-of-care tests are used in resource-limited settings, the benefits need to outweigh the costs. To optimise point-of-care testing in resource-limited settings, diagnostic tests need rigorous assessments focused on relevant clinical outcomes and operational costs, which differ from assessments of conventional diagnostic tests. We reviewed published studies on point-of-care testing in resource-limited settings, and found no clearly defined metric for the clinical usefulness of point-of-care testing. Therefore, we propose a framework for the assessment of point-of-care tests, and suggest and define the term test efficacy to describe the ability of a diagnostic test to support a clinical decision within its operational context. We also propose revised criteria for an ideal diagnostic point-of-care test in resource-limited settings. Through systematic assessments, comparisons between centralised testing and novel point-of-care technologies can be more formalised, and health officials can better establish which point-of-care technologies represent valuable additions to their clinical programmes.

### Classic bedside diagnostic techniques [^90e47bee]. Clinics in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Correctly performing bedside diagnostic tests is an important fundamental skill for practicing dermatologists. Even with new technologies, bedside diagnostic tests have been useful in contemporary practice. When properly implemented, bedside diagnostic techniques can efficiently and economically aid in diagnosis and treatment. We have reviewed the most commonly used diagnostic procedures while considering them in their historical context, outlined the procedures for performing the tests, and discussed the relevance and regulatory requirements of the tests.

### Contribution of four common pulmonary function tests to diagnosis of patients with respiratory symptoms: a prospective cohort study [^de530c7d]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

Few studies of the diagnostic value of pulmonary function testing are available. We assessed the diagnostic contribution of four basic pulmonary function tests: spirometry, lung volume, airway resistance, and diffusing capacity.

Methods

In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled patients presenting to a pulmonologist with respiratory symptoms but no clear diagnosis from 33 hospitals in Belgium. Each patient had spirometry, lung volume, airway resistance, and diffusing capacity testing and all other tests necessary for a definitive diagnosis. Clinical history and pulmonary function data were presented to local focus groups, who established differential diagnoses and a preferred diagnosis after each test-the focus groups were masked to additional investigations. The final diagnosis was established by the attending physician on the basis of all the investigations done, and validated as the gold standard diagnosis by the local focus group. The primary outcome was a score calculated by 1/number of differential diagnoses, corrected for the accuracy of the diagnosis. Secondary outcomes were the number of differential diagnoses for patients with a correct preferred diagnosis and the proportion of preferred diagnoses that were correct. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01297881.

Findings

We screened 1285 people, of whom 1023 were enrolled and 979 analysed. The primary outcome score was 0·226 after spirometry, increasing to 0·296 after measurement of lung volume, 0·373 after airway resistance test, and 0·540 after measurement of diffusing capacity (p < 0·0001 for each step). The number of differential diagnoses decreased after each step (4·2, 3·4, 3·0, and 2·4; p < 0·0001 for each step) and the proportion of correct preferred diagnoses increased (61%, 65%, 70%, and 77%; p < 0·0001 for each step).

Interpretation

The increase in scores shows a progressive reduction of the number of differential diagnoses and an increased accuracy of the preferred diagnosis. Each of the four classic pulmonary function tests contributes significantly and independently to the final diagnosis in new patients with respiratory symptoms seen by pulmonologists. Thus, funding of these tests is justified in that setting.

### Noncardiac chest pain: diagnosis and management [^359b85f4]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Noncardiac chest pain (NCCP) has been defined as recurrent chest pain that is indistinguishable from ischemic heart pain after excluding a cardiac cause. NCCP is a common and highly challenging clinical problem in Gastrointestinal practice that requires targeted diagnostic assessment to identify the underlying cause of the symptoms. Treatment is tailored according to the cause of NCCP: gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), esophageal dysmotility or functional chest pain. The purpose of this review is to discuss the current diagnosis and treatment of NCCP.

Recent Findings

Utilization of new diagnostic techniques such as pH-impedance and high-resolution esophageal manometry, and the introduction of a new definition for functional chest pain have helped to better diagnose the underlying mechanisms of NCCP. A better therapeutic approach toward GERD-related NCCP, the introduction of new interventions for symptoms due to esophageal spastic motor disorders and the expansion of the neuromodulator armamentarium for functional chest pain have changed the treatment landscape of NCCP.

Summary

GERD is the most common esophageal cause of NCCP, followed by functional chest pain and esophageal dysmotility. The proton pump inhibitor test, upper endoscopy, wireless pH capsule and pH-impedance are used to identify GERD-induced NCCP. High-resolution esophageal manometry is the main tool to identify esophageal motor disorder in non-GERD-related NCCP. Negative diagnostic assessment suggests functional chest pain. Potent antireflux treatment is offered to patients with GERD-related NCCP; medical, endoscopic or surgical interventions are considered in esophageal dysmotility; and neuromodulators are prescribed for functional chest pain. Assessment and treatment of psychological comorbidity should be considered in all NCCP patients.

### Clinical bioinformatician body of knowledge-molecular diagnostics core: a report of the Association for Molecular Pathology [^58ff3370]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2025). High credibility.

Germline testing — diagnostic utility and approach — Germline (constitutional) testing encompasses a variety of tests that analyze an individual's germline DNA sequence and may be prompted for diagnostic testing; the purpose of diagnostic testing is to identify an underlying genetic condition that explains a patient's clinical presentation, and genetic testing is ordered by a clinician to confirm or rule out such disorders, aiding in accurate diagnosis and management; each testing option carries its own risks, as targeted tests may have a higher likelihood of false negatives whereas broader genomic tests may uncover secondary findings, so the choice of testing is made in consultation with the clinician with the patient's preference playing a central role; a common, theoretically cost-effective approach begins with a targeted gene panel based on the clinician's differential diagnosis, and if this test is inconclusive or negative, more expansive testing may be pursued to identify clinically significant genomic alterations.

### Systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy [^2602e76f]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

More and more systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy studies are being published, but they can be methodologically challenging. In this paper, the authors present some of the recent developments in the methodology for conducting systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy studies. Restrictive electronic search filters are discouraged, as is the use of summary quality scores. Methods for meta-analysis should take into account the paired nature of the estimates and their dependence on threshold. Authors of these reviews are advised to use the hierarchical summary receiver-operating characteristic or the bivariate model for the data analysis. Challenges that remain are the poor reporting of original diagnostic test accuracy studies and difficulties with the interpretation of the results of diagnostic test accuracy research.

### Diagnostic steps in the evaluation of patients with erectile dysfunction [^3be4e516]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

The necessity for a thorough diagnostic evaluation for erectile dysfunction has been questioned after the availability of effective oral therapies. We determined the impact of the different diagnostic steps on the management strategy for erectile dysfunction.

Materials and Methods

The study included all patients who presented at an andrology outpatient clinic during a 4-year period. Baseline evaluation included medical and sexual history, blood tests, physical examination and intracavernous injection test. Patients with normal initial screening were evaluated with specific diagnostic procedures. The results were analyzed to identify the diagnostic potential of each screening step separately.

Results

Overall 1,644 patients presented at the clinic during the study period, of whom 368 (22.4%) were excluded from study due to severe psychiatric (5.2%) or cardiovascular (2.7%) disease, or to a history of erectile dysfunction less than 3 months in duration (14.5%). In the remaining 1,276 patients with a mean age plus or minus standard deviation of 56 ± 14 years, and a mean duration of erectile dysfunction of 4.9 ± 3.4 years medical history revealed erectile dysfunction associated medical conditions in 57%, blood tests identified previously undiagnosed medical conditions in 6.2%, and physical examination and the intracavernous injection test were diagnostic in 13.9% and 2.6%, respectively. Initial screening was negative in 259 cases (20.3%), in which specific diagnostic procedures identified an underlying vascular pathology in 165 (12.9%) and unfavorable penile geometry in 16 (1.3%). The remaining 78 men (6.1%) had no evidence of organic disease.

Conclusions

Baseline diagnostic evaluation for erectile dysfunction can identify the underlying pathological condition or erectile dysfunction associated risk factors in 80% of patients. Such screening may diagnose reversible causes of erectile dysfunction and also unmask medical conditions that manifest with erectile dysfunction as the first symptom. Specific diagnostic procedures may be limited in patients with primary erectile dysfunction or those without risk factors. Such clinical data support previously published guidelines for erectile dysfunction management.

### Biomarkers and Parkinson's disease [^a53355df]. Brain (2004). Low credibility.

Biomarkers are characteristics that can be measured as an indicator of a normal biological process, and they have special relevance in Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that is difficult to study, given the site of pathology and because the resultant clinical phenotype fluctuates over time. We currently have no definitive diagnostic test, and thus for the clinician there is hope that biomarkers will help diagnose symptomatic and presymptomatic disease or provide surrogate end-points to demonstrate clinical efficacy of new treatments, such as neuroprotective therapies, and help stratify this heterogeneous disease. No biomarker is likely to fulfil all these functions, so we need to know how each has been validated in order to understand their uses and limitations, and be aware of potential pitfalls. In this review we discuss the current potential biomarkers for Parkinson's disease, highlight the problems with their use, and conclude with a discussion of future alternatives.

### Diagnostic options for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [^776ed5e3]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor — The COVID-19 pandemic is posing a great challenge to global health and economy. Early accurate diagnosis plays a key role in fighting the disease. However, the diagnosis might be missed because of false-negative tests due to the insufficient sensitivity of the only test that detects SARS-CoV-2 or coinfection with other viruses. These false-negative results will affect clinical management decisions as well as control of the epidemic. Therefore, broader viral tests should be given to patients suspected to have COVID-19. Here, we discuss the existing methods of diagnosing COVID-19.

### Clinical use of biomarkers in the era of Alzheimer's disease treatments [^51d640ae]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

With the advent of treatments that specifically target Alzheimer's disease brain pathology, biomarker tests will become an increasingly important part of the routine clinical evaluation of cognitive impairment and guide clinical decision making. Clinicians must ensure they are using accurate and well‐validated biomarker tests and select the most appropriate testing modality for each patient based on individual and practical considerations. The interpretation of test results may be complex and depends on the pre‐test probability and test‐specific factors. Biomarker results must be presented and discussed with patients in a process that is sensitive to the major implications of the results and is carefully connected to diagnosis, prognosis, and management. Advances in treatments for Alzheimer's disease will likely require non‐dementia specialists to use biomarkers, necessitating major educational efforts. In the new era of Alzheimer's disease treatments, biomarkers are essential tools that will be integrated into all aspects of dementia diagnosis and care.

### Comparison of international guidelines for assessment of suspected Stable angina: insights from the PROMISE and SCOT-HEART [^e2641e77]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Recently, in part prompted by rapid advances in coronary CT, extensive research has been undertaken to clarify the relative merits of noninvasive imaging modalities in the assessment of suspected stable angina. Indeed, both PROMISE and SCOT-HEART were designed to test the hypothesis that CCTA might improve clinical outcomes compared with established, usual care approaches. In this context, CCTA increases diagnostic certainty and may reduce cardiovascular events.

In practice however, it is well appreciated that many patients undergoing assessment for possible stable angina are at low risk of both underlying CAD and future ischemic events, at least in the short to medium term. In the primary care setting, < 10% of such patients are ultimately identified as having a coronary cause for their symptoms. Recognizing this, substantial work has been done to update, refine, and extend risk models for estimating the PTP CAD, albeit often in highly selected populations referred for invasive angiography. In stark contrast, there is a dearth of trial evidence to support the clinical efficacy of the risk thresholds recommended within the guidelines and it seems plausible that although symptom characterization has recognized value in all these guidelines, its importance continues to be undervalued. Temporal trends described in patients undergoing nuclear testing offer valuable insight in this regard. In a report of nearly 40,000 patients covering the period 1991 to 2009, the proportion of patients referred for myocardial perfusion imaging with inducible ischemia fell from 30% to 5%. This occurred despite increasing prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and a corresponding increase in the calculated PTP of CAD within this cohort. Similar declining rates of positive ischemia tests have been described elsewhere. Interestingly, over the same time period, the proportion of these patients with typical angina symptoms fell from 13% to 2%, whereas those reporting only dyspnea in the absence of chest discomfort, increased from 5% to 11%. This association places further emphasis on the need for accurate symptom characterization to lie at the center of decision making and is entirely consistent with our analysis, wherein we identified a substantial increase in diagnostic specificity when applying the symptom-focused NICE guideline compared with either of the alternative approaches.

### Diagnostic indicators of non-cardiovascular chest pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a074d1e6]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Research implications

Further research should investigate the combined value of symptoms, clinical findings, and diagnostic tests, including multidisciplinary research aimed at increasing our knowledge about diagnostic processes and making recommendations for diagnostic tests and treatments in patients with NCCP. Most patients with chest pain consult primary care physicians, but few studies are performed in this setting. Further research is needed to strengthen the evidence in a primary care setting. The value of screening questionnaires for panic and anxiety disorders should be further evaluated and investigated in clinical practice. The use of a flag system, as successfully applied in back and neck pain, could facilitate the diagnostic process allowing systematic assessment of first red flags (acute disease requiring immediate diagnosis and care), then green flags (identifiable diseases), and yellow flags (psychological diseases).

Implication for practice

Patients with NCCP incur high healthcare costs due to the extensive and often invasive diagnostic testing, and NCCP's impact on quality of life. Early identification of underlying diseases is essential to avoid delayed treatment and chronicity of complaints. Symptoms and clinical findings may provide important information to guide treatment of an underlying illness. In patients with typical GERD symptoms, twice-daily high-dose PPI treatment is the most efficient diagnostic approach. GERD is very likely if a positive treatment response occurs after 1 week, while GERD is unlikely if there is no response after 4 weeks of PPI treatment. In patients not responding to PPI, if an endoscopy shows no pathological findings, other illnesses should be considered before initiating further gastrointestinal testing.

Panic and anxiety disorders are often missed in clinical practice. Symptoms such as expressing 'fear of dying', 'light headedness, dizziness, faintness', 'diaphoresis' and 'chills or hot flushes' are associated with anxiety disorders. Screening tests are valuable to rule out panic or anxiety disorders, and positive finding should lead to further investigation.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: antigen testing (January 2023) [^a3dc006a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 antigen testing in symptomatic individuals is addressed with the recommendation: test over no test. (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence) Symptomatic individuals were defined as those with at least 1 of the common symptoms of COVID-19. For optimal performance, Ag tests should be used within 5 days of symptom onset; the panel identified no studies that reported Ag test performance on the first or second day of symptoms. If clinical suspicion for COVID-19 remains high, a negative Ag result should be confirmed by standard NAAT (ie, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT). A single Ag test has high specificity; a positive result can be used to help guide treatment and isolation decisions without confirmation. There were limited data regarding the analytical performance of Ag tests in children, immunocompromised or vaccinated individuals, or in those who had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. The panel was unable to identify studies that compared the risk of transmission among patients recovering from COVID-19 who were released from isolation based on results of Ag testing versus no testing. We found no direct evidence that assessed patient- or population-centered outcomes of testing versus no testing in symptomatic patients. The reference standard in the included studies was standard NAAT (ie, rapid RT-PCR or laboratory-based NAAT). We identified 65 studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of Ag testing as compared with NAAT as a reference test in symptomatic individuals. The studies included 20 272 individuals for sensitivity.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^3ff43b6f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 illness is highly variable, ranging from infection with no symptoms through to pneumonia and life-threatening consequences. Symptoms such as fever, cough, or loss of sense of smell (anosmia) or taste (ageusia), can help flag early on if the disease is present. Such information could be used either to rule out COVID-19 disease, or to identify people who need to go for COVID-19 diagnostic tests. This is the second update of this review, which was first published in 2020.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms to determine if a person presenting in primary care or to hospital outpatient settings, such as the emergency department or dedicated COVID-19 clinics, has COVID-19.

Search Methods

We undertook electronic searches up to 10 June 2021 in the University of Bern living search database. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We used artificial intelligence text analysis to conduct an initial classification of documents. We did not apply any language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Studies were eligible if they included people with clinically suspected COVID-19, or recruited known cases with COVID-19 and also controls without COVID-19 from a single-gate cohort. Studies were eligible when they recruited people presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings. Studies that included people who contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection while admitted to hospital were not eligible. The minimum eligible sample size of studies was 10 participants. All signs and symptoms were eligible for this review, including individual signs and symptoms or combinations. We accepted a range of reference standards.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of review authors independently selected all studies, at both title and abstract, and full-text stage. They resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using the QUADAS-2 checklist, and resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Analyses were restricted to prospective studies only. We presented sensitivity and specificity in paired forest plots, in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space and in dumbbell plots. We estimated summary parameters using a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis whenever five or more primary prospective studies were available, and whenever heterogeneity across studies was deemed acceptable.

Main Results

We identified 90 studies; for this update we focused on the results of 42 prospective studies with 52,608 participants. Prevalence of COVID-19 disease varied from 3.7% to 60.6% with a median of 27.4%. Thirty-five studies were set in emergency departments or outpatient test centres (46,878 participants), three in primary care settings (1230 participants), two in a mixed population of in- and outpatients in a paediatric hospital setting (493 participants), and two overlapping studies in nursing homes (4007 participants). The studies did not clearly distinguish mild COVID-19 disease from COVID-19 pneumonia, so we present the results for both conditions together. Twelve studies had a high risk of bias for selection of participants because they used a high level of preselection to decide whether reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was needed, or because they enrolled a non-consecutive sample, or because they excluded individuals while they were part of the study base. We rated 36 of the 42 studies as high risk of bias for the index tests because there was little or no detail on how, by whom and when, the symptoms were measured. For most studies, eligibility for testing was dependent on the local case definition and testing criteria that were in effect at the time of the study, meaning most people who were included in studies had already been referred to health services based on the symptoms that we are evaluating in this review. The applicability of the results of this review iteration improved in comparison with the previous reviews. This version has more studies of people presenting to ambulatory settings, which is where the majority of assessments for COVID-19 take place. Only three studies presented any data on children separately, and only one focused specifically on older adults. We found data on 96 symptoms or combinations of signs and symptoms. Evidence on individual signs as diagnostic tests was rarely reported, so this review reports mainly on the diagnostic value of symptoms. Results were highly variable across studies. Most had very low sensitivity and high specificity. RT-PCR was the most often used reference standard (40/42 studies). Only cough (11 studies) had a summary sensitivity above 50% (62.4%, 95% CI 50.6% to 72.9%)); its specificity was low (45.4%, 95% CI 33.5% to 57.9%)). Presence of fever had a sensitivity of 37.6% (95% CI 23.4% to 54.3%) and a specificity of 75.2% (95% CI 56.3% to 87.8%). The summary positive likelihood ratio of cough was 1.14 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.25) and that of fever 1.52 (95% CI 1.10 to 2.10). Sore throat had a summary positive likelihood ratio of 0.814 (95% CI 0.714 to 0.929), which means that its presence increases the probability of having an infectious disease other than COVID-19. Dyspnoea (12 studies) and fatigue (8 studies) had a sensitivity of 23.3% (95% CI 16.4% to 31.9%) and 40.2% (95% CI 19.4% to 65.1%) respectively. Their specificity was 75.7% (95% CI 65.2% to 83.9%) and 73.6% (95% CI 48.4% to 89.3%). The summary positive likelihood ratio of dyspnoea was 0.96 (95% CI 0.83 to 1.11) and that of fatigue 1.52 (95% CI 1.21 to 1.91), which means that the presence of fatigue slightly increases the probability of having COVID-19. Anosmia alone (7 studies), ageusia alone (5 studies), and anosmia or ageusia (6 studies) had summary sensitivities below 50% but summary specificities over 90%. Anosmia had a summary sensitivity of 26.4% (95% CI 13.8% to 44.6%) and a specificity of 94.2% (95% CI 90.6% to 96.5%). Ageusia had a summary sensitivity of 23.2% (95% CI 10.6% to 43.3%) and a specificity of 92.6% (95% CI 83.1% to 97.0%). Anosmia or ageusia had a summary sensitivity of 39.2% (95% CI 26.5% to 53.6%) and a specificity of 92.1% (95% CI 84.5% to 96.2%). The summary positive likelihood ratios of anosmia alone and anosmia or ageusia were 4.55 (95% CI 3.46 to 5.97) and 4.99 (95% CI 3.22 to 7.75) respectively, which is just below our arbitrary definition of a 'red flag', that is, a positive likelihood ratio of at least 5. The summary positive likelihood ratio of ageusia alone was 3.14 (95% CI 1.79 to 5.51). Twenty-four studies assessed combinations of different signs and symptoms, mostly combining olfactory symptoms. By combining symptoms with other information such as contact or travel history, age, gender, and a local recent case detection rate, some multivariable prediction scores reached a sensitivity as high as 90%.

Authors' Conclusions

Most individual symptoms included in this review have poor diagnostic accuracy. Neither absence nor presence of symptoms are accurate enough to rule in or rule out the disease. The presence of anosmia or ageusia may be useful as a red flag for the presence of COVID-19. The presence of cough also supports further testing. There is currently no evidence to support further testing with PCR in any individuals presenting only with upper respiratory symptoms such as sore throat, coryza or rhinorrhoea. Combinations of symptoms with other readily available information such as contact or travel history, or the local recent case detection rate may prove more useful and should be further investigated in an unselected population presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings. The diagnostic accuracy of symptoms for COVID-19 is moderate to low and any testing strategy using symptoms as selection mechanism will result in both large numbers of missed cases and large numbers of people requiring testing. Which one of these is minimised, is determined by the goal of COVID-19 testing strategies, that is, controlling the epidemic by isolating every possible case versus identifying those with clinically important disease so that they can be monitored or treated to optimise their prognosis. The former will require a testing strategy that uses very few symptoms as entry criterion for testing, the latter could focus on more specific symptoms such as fever and anosmia.

### Nonimaging diagnostic tests for pneumonia [^3a3ca1f4]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

This article reviews the various nonimaging diagnostic tests available for the diagnosis of pneumonia including the methods by which specimens are obtained and the speed at which certain tests are available. Because tests results may be available at the time of radiologic image interpretation, it is important for the radiologist to be aware of the type of specimens and diagnostic tests to search for in the electronic medical record in order to provide a more refined imaging report. Diagnostic tests for the most common bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic infections are discussed.

### Four overlooked errors in ROC analysis: how to prevent and avoid [^ee9a61f3]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic tests are frequently applied within clinical practice to assist with disease diagnosis, differential diagnosis, disease grading and prognosis evaluation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis is one common approach for analysing discriminative performance of a diagnostic test, where it can determine the optimal cut-off value with the best diagnostic performance. However, as a majority of clinicians are non-statisticians, several errors have been observed in clinical research when applying ROC curves. These errors may be misleading in the selection of diagnostic tests and disease diagnosis, thus adding to patient burden. To address these errors, clinicians do not need a deep understanding of the intricate mathematical formulas of ROC analysis, but should develop basic knowledge and skills to prevent or avoid commonly overlooked mistakes. This article aims to guide clinicians to avoid common pitfalls in ROC analysis.

### Imaging and laboratory testing in acute abdominal pain [^46e72c1a]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

When discussing which laboratory tests or imaging to order in the setting of acute abdominal pain, it is practical to organize information by disease process (eg, acute appendicitis, cholecystitis). Because studies on the accuracy of diagnostic tests are of necessity related to the presence or absence of specific diagnoses, and because clinicians frequently look to tests to help them rule in or rule out specific conditions, this article is organized by region of pain and common abdominal diagnoses. It focuses on the contributions that laboratory testing and imaging make in the emergency management of abdominal complaints.
