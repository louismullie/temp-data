## Question

A 66-year-old biopsy-naïve man with PSA 7.2 ng/mL can get a micro-ultrasound–guided biopsy this week or wait six weeks for an MRI/US fusion biopsy. Based on OPTIMUM, what would you recommend and why?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 66-year-old biopsy-naïve man with PSA 7.2 ng/mL should proceed with a micro-ultrasound-guided biopsy this week or wait six weeks for an MRI/US fusion biopsy, and what the OPTIMUM trial tells us about that choice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the patient fits the OPTIMUM population. Then, I should verify the trial design and primary endpoint. Next, I will examine the noninferiority results and their clinical meaning. After that, I need to consider secondary outcomes, safety, and practical trade-offs like time, cost, and access. Finally, I will align the recommendation with guideline positions and outline a clear, actionable plan with caveats and follow-up considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and whether this patient matches the OPTIMUM cohort. The patient is biopsy-naïve, age 66, with PSA 7.2 ng/mL, which sits squarely within the trial's median PSA of about 6.9 ng/mL and inclusion criteria of biopsy-naïve men with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer, so the external validity looks strong for applying OPTIMUM to this case.

> I need to check the trial design and what exactly was compared. OPTIMUM was a multicenter, international, randomized, open-label, noninferiority trial that assigned men to micro-ultrasound-guided biopsy, MRI/conventional ultrasound fusion-guided biopsy, or a combined micro-ultrasound/MRI approach, with all participants receiving synchronous systematic biopsy; the primary outcome was detection of Gleason Grade Group 2 or higher cancer, and the prespecified noninferiority margin was 10%.

> Now, let me verify the key results. Micro-ultrasound-guided biopsy was noninferior to MRI/conventional ultrasound fusion-guided biopsy for detecting GG2+ disease, with 47.1% vs 42.6% detection and an absolute difference of 3.52% with a 95% CI of −3.95% to 10.92%, meeting the noninferiority criterion with P < .001; importantly, the combined micro-ultrasound/MRI arm was also noninferior, and there were no significant differences in targeted-only detection or higher-grade disease, and adverse events were similar across arms [^70f42372].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should interpret what "noninferior" means clinically. Noninferiority here indicates that micro-ultrasound is not worse than MRI fusion by more than the 10% margin, and in fact the point estimate slightly favors micro-ultrasound, though the confidence interval crosses zero, so equivalence is plausible; practically, this means diagnostic yield for clinically significant cancer is comparable between strategies in this setting [^70f42372] [^ebe366e2].

> Next, I should review practical advantages of proceeding now with micro-ultrasound versus waiting for MRI. Micro-ultrasound provides real-time, high-resolution visualization without the need for a separate MRI, contrast, or software fusion, enabling a one-session diagnostic pathway that can shorten time to diagnosis, reduce costs, and lessen patient anxiety; OPTIMUM's commentary also notes potential reductions in wait times and resource use when micro-ultrasound is used upfront, which is relevant when MRI access involves a six-week delay [^32257a9a] [^ecb07d1c].

> Wait, let me verify guideline alignment so I don't overstate this. Contemporary AUA/SUO guidance supports MRI prior to initial biopsy to improve detection of GG2+ disease, but it also emphasizes shared decision-making and acknowledges that emerging technologies may offer alternatives; OPTIMUM now provides randomized evidence that micro-ultrasound is a reasonable alternative when MRI is delayed or unavailable, which fits within a patient-centered, context-sensitive approach rather than replacing MRI outright [^7be1e752] [^70f42372].

> I should double-check safety and procedural considerations. OPTIMUM reported no significant differences in adverse events across arms, and micro-ultrasound is performed in real time with transrectal or transperineal approaches, allowing urologists to obtain targeted and systematic cores in a single session; this operational simplicity can be advantageous in systems with MRI bottlenecks or when patients prefer to avoid MRI [^70f42372] [^ecb07d1c].

> But wait, what if MRI could still add value that micro-ultrasound might miss? Let me reconsider the role of MRI. MRI remains valuable for staging, anterior and transition zone lesion detection, and risk stratification, and some data suggest complementary roles; however, in OPTIMUM, adding MRI to micro-ultrasound did not clearly outperform MRI/conventional ultrasound, reinforcing that micro-ultrasound alone achieves comparable detection of GG2+ disease in biopsy-naïve men, so delaying for MRI is not necessary to preserve diagnostic yield in this context [^70f42372] [^ec1b32c8].

> I will now examine the downside of waiting six weeks. A six-week delay can prolong anxiety, postpone treatment planning if cancer is present, and may not improve diagnostic yield given the noninferior performance of micro-ultrasound; moreover, MRI can be negative or equivocal, in which case systematic biopsy is still recommended, so waiting does not guarantee a superior pathway and may simply defer care without benefit [^70f42372] [^d2509782].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is to proceed with the micro-ultrasound-guided biopsy this week. The rationale is that OPTIMUM demonstrates noninferior detection of clinically significant cancer with micro-ultrasound compared with MRI fusion, avoids the six-week delay, reduces logistical burden, and maintains safety, while still allowing MRI to be used later if staging or problem-solving is needed; this aligns with a shared decision-making framework that weighs timeliness, access, and comparable oncologic yield [^70f42372] [^32257a9a] [^7be1e752].

> Next, I should review a few caveats and follow-up steps. If the micro-ultrasound is negative but clinical suspicion remains high, MRI can still be obtained subsequently to evaluate for anterior or transition zone disease or for staging; conversely, if micro-ultrasound reveals a high-grade lesion, standard staging with MRI and appropriate risk stratification should follow, ensuring that the diagnostic pathway remains comprehensive and guideline-concordant [^7be1e752] [^ebe366e2].

---

Proceed with **micro-ultrasound-guided biopsy now** because OPTIMUM shows it is **noninferior to MRI/US fusion** for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason Grade Group ≥ 2) in biopsy-naïve men, with a median PSA similar to this patient's 7.2 ng/mL [^70f42372] [^ec1b32c8]. Waiting 6 weeks for MRI/US fusion offers no diagnostic advantage and may delay treatment; micro-ultrasound provides real-time, high-resolution imaging and can be performed immediately, reducing anxiety and time to diagnosis [^32257a9a] [^ecb07d1c]. If micro-ultrasound is unavailable or inconclusive, MRI/US fusion remains a valid alternative, but **OPTIMUM supports choosing micro-ultrasound now** [^70f42372].

---

## Clinical evidence from the OPTIMUM trial

- **Design**: multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial comparing micro-ultrasound-guided biopsy versus MRI/US fusion-guided biopsy in biopsy-naïve men with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer [^70f42372].

- **Population**: median age 65 years, median PSA 6.9 ng/mL (IQR 5.2–9.8), 83% White [^70f42372].

- **Primary outcome**: detection of Gleason Grade Group 2 or higher prostate cancer; micro-ultrasound was noninferior to MRI/US fusion (47.1% vs 42.6%; difference 3.52% [95% CI −3.95 to 10.92]; noninferiority P < .001) [^70f42372].

- **Secondary outcomes**: no significant differences in detection of Grade Group 3 or higher, benign diagnoses, or adverse events [^ec1b32c8].

- **Conclusion**: micro-ultrasound-guided biopsy is noninferior to MRI/US fusion for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer in biopsy-naïve men [^70f42372].

---

## Clinical implications for the patient

- **Diagnostic accuracy**: micro-ultrasound is noninferior to MRI/US fusion for clinically significant cancer detection, so waiting for MRI is unlikely to improve diagnostic yield [^70f42372].

- **Time to diagnosis**: immediate micro-ultrasound avoids a 6-week delay, reducing anxiety and enabling faster treatment if cancer is found [^32257a9a].

- **Procedure considerations**: micro-ultrasound offers real-time, high-resolution imaging and can be performed in a single session without MRI logistics [^ecb07d1c].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Generalizability**: OPTIMUM enrolled predominantly White men; performance in other races/ethnicities needs confirmation [^70f42372].

- **Local expertise**: micro-ultrasound availability and operator experience vary; MRI/US fusion remains appropriate if micro-ultrasound is unavailable or inconclusive [^32257a9a].

- **Patient preferences**: shared decision-making is essential, especially if the patient prioritizes MRI-based staging or has specific risk factors [^51b79441].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Based on OPTIMUM, **proceed with micro-ultrasound-guided biopsy now** because it is noninferior to MRI/US fusion for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer and avoids unnecessary delay. If micro-ultrasound is unavailable or results are inconclusive, MRI/US fusion is a reasonable alternative, but **OPTIMUM supports choosing micro-ultrasound now** [^70f42372].

### Microultrasonography-guided vs MRI-guided biopsy for prostate cancer diagnosis: the OPTIMUM randomized clinical trial [^70f42372]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

High-resolution microultrasonography-guided biopsy is an alternative to MRI fusion-guided biopsy for prostate cancer diagnosis.

Objective

To compare microultrasonography-guided and MRI fusion-guided biopsy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A multicenter, international, open-label, randomized, noninferiority trial of biopsy-naive men from 20 centers (8 countries) with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer (elevated prostate-specific antigen [PSA] and/or abnormal digital rectal examination findings) from December 2021 to September 2024.

Interventions

Participants were assigned to receive either microultrasonography-guided biopsy (n = 121), microultrasonography/MRI fusion-guided biopsy (microultrasonography/MRI; n = 226, in which microultrasonography biopsies were performed prior to unblinding the MRI), or MRI/conventional US fusion-guided biopsy (MRI/conventional ultrasonography; n = 331). All participants received synchronous systematic biopsy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the difference in detection of Gleason Grade Group 2 or higher cancers using microultrasonography plus systematic biopsy vs MRI/conventional ultrasonography plus systematic biopsy. The secondary outcome was the difference in detection of Gleason Grade Group 2 or higher cancers found using microultrasonography/MRI plus systematic biopsy vs MRI/conventional ultrasonography plus systematic biopsy. The noninferiority margin was set at 10%.

Results

A total of 802 men underwent randomization and 678 underwent biopsy. Median (IQR) age was 65 (59–70) years and prostate-specific antigen level was 6.9 (5.2–9.8) ng/mL; 83% self-identified as White. Gleason Grade Group 2 or higher cancer was detected in 57 participants (47.1%) in the microultrasonography group, in 141 (42.6%) in the MRI/conventional ultrasonography group, and in 106 (46.9%) in the microultrasonography/MRI group. Microultrasonography-guided biopsy was noninferior to MRI fusion-guided biopsy (difference, 3.52% [95% CI, -3.95% to 10.92%]; noninferiority P < .001). Combined biopsy with microultrasonography/MRI was also noninferior to MRI/conventional ultrasonography software-assisted MRI fusion biopsy using conventional ultrasonography devices (difference, 4.29% [95% CI, -4.06% to 12.63%]; noninferiority P < .001). The rate of Gleason Grade Group 2 or higher cancer diagnosed by targeted biopsy only was 38.0% in the microultrasonography group, 34.1% in the MRI/conventional ultrasonography group, and 40.3% in the microultrasonography/MRI group; these differences were not significant.

Conclusions and Relevance

The use of microultrasonography-guided biopsy was noninferior to MRI/conventional ultrasonography fusion-guided biopsy for the detection of Gleason Grade Group 2 or higher prostate cancer in biopsy-naive men. Microultrasonography may provide an alternative to MRI for image-guided prostate biopsy.

### Early detection of prostate cancer: AUA / SUO guideline part I: prostate cancer screening [^51b79441]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

AUA/SUO early detection of prostate cancer — biopsy-naïve patients with a suspicious lesion on MRI: For biopsy-naïve patients who have a suspicious lesion on MRI, clinicians should perform targeted biopsies of the suspicious lesion and may also perform a systematic template biopsy (Moderate Recommendation [targeted biopsies]/Conditional Recommendation [systematic template biopsy]; Evidence Level: Grade C). In a study of 300 patients with either a PSA ≥ 4 ng/mL or an abnormal DRE, fusion biopsy detected 69%, systematic 12-core biopsy detected 80%, and the combination yielded 87% of all GG2+ tumors; in over 230 biopsy-naïve patients, combination biopsies resulted in 9.9% greater detection than either approach alone and the lowest rate of surgical upgrading (3.5%). Systematic biopsy alone detected 1.9% high-grade cancers missed by MRI-targeted biopsy, with registration targeting error accounting for 51% of the misses. Adding a systematic biopsy increases GG1 detection, reported between 1.2% and 5% GG1. In patients with PI-RADS 3 to 5 findings, a randomized trial of targeted alone versus targeted plus systematic showed a 50% reduction in GG1 detection (absolute reduction from 1.2% to 0.6%) and a 27% reduction in GG2+ detection (absolute reduction from 1.1% to 0.8%) in the target-only arm, with the decreased GG2+ detection not statistically significant; as in the PSA screening setting, use of SDM is highly recommended given the uncertainty involved.

### Microultrasonography-guided vs MRI-guided biopsy for prostate cancer diagnosis: the OPTIMUM randomized clinical trial [^ec1b32c8]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study OPTIMUM (micro-US vs. MRI/US) was published by Adam Kinnaird and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Prostate cancer. In the OPTIMUM (micro-US vs. MRI/US) study, the trial question was: is micro-ultrasound-guided biopsy noninferior to MRI/conventional ultrasonography fusion-guided biopsy in biopsy-naïve men with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer? In the OPTIMUM (micro-US vs. MRI/US) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the OPTIMUM (micro-US vs. MRI/US) study, the population was: 452 male patients. The inclusion criteria were biopsy-naïve men with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer. The key exclusion criteria were prior prostate biopsy; genitourinary cancer, including prostate cancer; contraindications to biopsy; contraindications to multiparametric MRI. In the OPTIMUM (micro-US vs. MRI/US) study, the interventions were: n = 121 micro-ultrasound (subjects will undergo biopsy using micro-ultrasound only) n = 331 MRI/conventional ultrasound (subjects will undergo biopsy using MRI fused with regular ultrasound). In the OPTIMUM (micro-US vs. MRI/US) study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in detection of Gleason Grade Group ≥ 2 prostate cancer (46.1% vs. 42.6%; AD 3.52%, 95% CI -3.95 to 10.92). In the OPTIMUM (micro-US vs. MRI/US) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in targeted biopsy-only detection rate of grade group ≥ 2 cancer (38% vs. 34%; AD 3.88%, 95% CI -6.12 to 13.89) No significant difference in detection of Gleason Grade Group ≥ 3 prostate cancer (23% vs. 27%; ARD -3, 95% CI -10 to 3) No significant difference in detection of benign cancer (39% vs. 42%; ARD -3, 95% CI -11 to 4). In the OPTIMUM (micro-US vs. MRI/US) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the OPTIMUM (micro-US vs. MRI/US) study, the conclusion was: in biopsy-naïve men with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer, micro-ultrasound was noninferior to MRI/conventional ultrasound with respect to detection of Gleason Grade Group ≥ 2 prostate cancer.

### Multiparametric MRI fusion-guided biopsy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer [^479740a8]. Current Opinion in Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To discuss the timing, benefits, limitations and current controversies of multiparametric magnet resonance imaging (mpMRI) combined with fusion-guided biopsy and consider how additional incorporation of multivariable risk stratification might further improve prostate cancer diagnosis.

Recent Findings

MpMRI has been proven advantageous over standard practice for biopsy-naïve men and men with previous biopsy in large prospective studies providing level 1b evidence. Upfront multivariable risk stratification followed by or combined with mpMRI further improves diagnostic accuracy. Regarding active surveillance, mpMRI in combination with fusion biopsy can support initial candidate selection and may help to monitor disease progression. mpMRI and fusion biopsy, however, do not spare failure and conflicting data exists to what extend (systematic) biopsies can be omitted.

Summary

Integration of mpMRI into the diagnostic pathway for prostate cancer is beneficial; yet more prospective and randomized data is needed to establish reliable procedure standards after mpMRI acquisition.

Discussion

Improvement of the PCa diagnostic pathway is necessary, and will likely depend on the advances in PCa imaging. Multiparametric MRI has a recognized value before a second biopsy in case of a persistent clinical suspicion for PCa. The value in biopsy - naïve patients and the possibility to omit systematic biopsies is debated. Contrast -enhanced ultrasound has shown promising results, but should currently be viewed as experimental. This trial will provide data on both these techniques, allowing comparison and assessment of complementarity. The study design chosen is in line with recommendations formulated by the Standards of reporting for MRI-targeted biopsy studies (START) Working Group and by van Hove et al. To validate imaging - targeted prostate biopsy protocols van Hove et al. recommend using either one of two study designs: randomize patients to undergo either systematic biopsies alone or systematic biopsies and targeted biopsies. In the other option every patient undergoes both targeted biopsies and systematic biopsies by separate blinded observers. In our study design all patients undergo both imaging procedures and both targeted and systematic biopsies. The targeted biopsies and systematic biopsies are performed by separate observers. The targeted biopsy locations are predetermined by blinded readers and targeted through a fusion device. To prevent potential bias by post-biopsy haemorrhage seen on ultrasound the targeted biopsies are performed after the systematic biopsies. This way we prevent information gathered from one imaging technique to influence biopsy targeting for the other imaging technique. In both study designs the (significant) PCa detection rates are compared. An advantage of using these study designs is that there is no spectrum bias, i.e. the relevant biopsy population is being studied. Also, there is no observer bias, the investigator reading the images does not already know that there must be a tumor. Both spectrum bias and observer bias occur when translating results obtained from the correlation of imaging and radical prostatectomy specimens towards the primary diagnostic setting. Furthermore, the endpoint in this study design, (significant) PCa detection, is the most relevant endpoint in the clinic. We therefore believe that our trial will provide important and necessary data on one of the most relevant topics in PCa care. This data is gathered in a recommended, standardized fashion to minimize bias and allow data pooling.

### A noninferiority within-person study comparing the accuracy of transperineal to transrectal MRI-US fusion biopsy for prostate-cancer detection [^44a85ae8]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US) fusion prostate-biopsies can be performed in a transrectal (TR-fusion) or transperineal (TP-fusion) approach. Prospective comparative evidence is limited. In this study we compared the detection rate of clinically-significant prostate-cancer (csPCa) within an index lesion between TR and TP-fusion.

Patients and methods

This was a prospective, noninferiority, and within-person trial. Men scheduled for MRI–US-fusion with a discrete MRI PI-RRAD ≥ 3 lesion were included. A dominant index lesion was determined for each subject and sampled by TR and TP-fusion during the same session. The order of biopsies was randomized and equipment was reset to avoid chronological and incorporation bias. For each subject, the index lesion was sampled 4–6 times in each approach. All biopsies were performed using Navigo fusion software (UC-Care, Yokneam, Israel). csPCa was defined as: Grade Group ≥ 2 or cancer-core length ≥ 6 mm. We used a noninferiority margin of 10% and a one-sided alpha level of 5%.

Results

Seventy-seven patients completed the protocol. Median age was 68.2 years (IQR:64.2–72.2), median PSA was 8.9 ng/ml (IQR:6.18–12.2). Ten patients (13%) were biopsy naive, others (87%) had a previous biopsy. csPCa was detected in 32 patients (42%). All of these cases were detected by TP-fusion, while only 20 (26%) by TR-fusion. Absolute difference for csPCa diagnosis was 15.6 (CI 90% 27.9–3.2%) in favor of TP-fusion (p = 0.029). TP-fusion was noninferior to TR-fusion. The lower boundary of the 90% confidence-interval between TP-fusion and TR-fusion was greater than zero, therefore TP-fusion was also found to be superior. Exploratory subgroup analyses showed TP-fusion was consistently associated with higher detection rates of csPCa compared with TR-fusion in patient and index-lesion derived subgroups (size, location, PI-RADS, PSA, and biopsy history).

Conclusions

In this study, TP-fusion biopsies were found to be noninferior and superior to TR-fusion biopsies in detecting csPCa within MRI-visible index lesion. Centers experienced in both TP and TR-fusion should consider these results when choosing biopsy method.

### Screening for prostate cancer: evidence, ongoing trials, policies and knowledge gaps [^59b57cec]. BMJ Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Gothenburg-2 trial (Sweden)

Gothenburg-2 is a population-based, randomised screening trial evaluating three main research questions:

Does a screening algorithm with a pre-biopsy MRI in men with PSA ≥ 3.0 ng/mL and lesion-targeted biopsies reduce detection of clinically insignificant cancer while maintaining sufficient detection of clinically significant cancer, compared with a systematic biopsy in all men with PSA ≥ 3.0 ng/mL?
Does a PSA cut-off of 1.8 ng/mL detect more clinically significant cancer without increasing overdiagnosis?
Does screening with PSA, pre-biopsy MRI and lesion-targeted biopsies reduce prostate cancer mortality compared with a non-invited control group?

In 2015–2020, 58 225 men aged 50–60 years without a prostate cancer diagnosis were identified from the population register and randomly allocated 2:1 to a screening group or a control group without prior consent (Zelen design). Of 38 775 men in the screening group invited to the first round 17 980 (46%) participated and were further randomly allocated to one of three screening algorithms (figure 1). The men are re-invited with 2–8 years' interval until age 63–76 years. Screening intervals and stop age depend on the PSA value.

Figure 1
Gothenburg-2 screening trial flow chart. PSA, prostate-specific antigen.

Diagnostic outcomes of the first screening round for men with PSA ≥ 3.0 ng/mL were recently published. In arms 2 and 3 combined (MRI-targeted biopsies only), 2.8% of the invited men had a biopsy, compared with 6.8% in arm 1 (systematic biopsy). Clinically insignificant (Gleason score 3+3 = 6) cancer was detected in 66 men in arms 2 and 3, and in 72 men in arm 1: relative risk 0.46 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.64), absolute risk difference 0.7%). Gleason score ≥ 7 cancer was detected in 110 men in arms 2 and 3, and in 68 men in arm 1: relative risk 0.81 (95% CI 0.6 to 1.1), absolute risk difference 0.2%. Of 10 Gleason score 3+4 = 7 cancers detected on systematic biopsy cores only, 7 were stage T1c and 6 had < 5% Gleason pattern 4; none had Gleason score ≥ 4+3 = 7. Results from repeated screening rounds are planned for publication in 2023–2024 and prostate cancer mortality data in 2027.

### Identifying the best candidate for focal therapy: a comprehensive review [^058959fb]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Lesion characterization

The first step in assessing the eligibility of a patient who might be eligible for FT is to characterize the PCa lesion(s). FT initially relied on the cancer characteristics of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsies. The introduction of mpMRI has revolutionized cancer detection and consequently improved the process of patient selection for FT. The use of mpMRI in FT candidates was first presented in a consensus statement by the experts in this field in 2010. Subsequently, panels of experts re-emphasized the importance of mpMRI as the preferred approach for accomplishing the necessary objectives in FT. Recent consensus panels on patient selection for FT have consensually concurred that mpMRI stands as the preferred imaging modality for preoperative evaluation. mpMRI has a high sensitivity in detecting clinically significant PCa. In a Cochrane meta-analysis comparing MRI to template biopsies in biopsy-naïve and repeat-biopsy settings, MRI had a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.91 and 0.37 for the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade > 2 cancers, respectively. For grade > 3 cancers, the pooled sensitivity of MRI was 0.95, and the specificity was 0.35.

MRI-TRUS fusion is the recommended technique to perform biopsies following mpMRI. The findings of PRECISION trial (PRostate Evaluation for Clinically Important Disease: Sampling Using Image-guidance Or Not?) demonstrated that an mpMRI-guided biopsy leads to higher detection of clinically significant PCa while avoiding detection of insignificant disease. According to an International Delphi Consensus, in the presence of an mpMRI-suspicious lesion (i.e. Prostate Imaging Reporting & Data System: PIRADS 4 or 5), histological confirmation using MRI-TRUS-fusion biopsy is necessary prior to treatment with FT. Systematic biopsy is still required in this setting to assess mpMRI-negative areas prior to treating a histologically confirmed mpMRI lesion. However, minimum standard for the extent of systematic biopsy outside of the mpMRI lesion (i.e. number of cores/approach) remains indeterminate. When mpMRI is unavailable, three-dimensional (3D) mapping biopsies are recommended. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) scan, an effective imaging modality in patients with PCa, may be used more frequently in the future as experience increases with its use in the field of FT.

### Comparison of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and targeted biopsy with systematic biopsy alone for the diagnosis of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a5efe246]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is prebiopsy magnetic resonance imaging combined with targeted biopsy associated with improved detection of clinically significant prostate cancer compared with transrectal ultrasonography–guided systematic prostate biopsy alone?

Findings

This systematic review and meta-analysis of 7 randomized clinical trials (2582 patients) demonstrates that prebiopsy magnetic resonance imaging combined with targeted biopsy is associated with improved detection of clinically significant prostate cancer and reduced numbers of biopsy cores per procedure, while potentially avoiding unnecessary biopsies.

Meaning

These findings support the introduction of prebiopsy magnetic resonance imaging into the diagnostic pathway for biopsy-naive men with suspected prostate cancer.

### Tailoring biopsy strategy in the MRI-fusion prostate biopsy era: systematic, targeted or neither? [^453287b8]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The addition of systematic biopsies when performing targeted biopsies in men with significant MRI lesions increases the detection of significant cancer and should thus be considered in clinical practice. Systematic biopsies might, however, be omitted when performing targeted biopsies in men with equivocal MRI lesions due to an increased risk of overdiagnosis. Men with equivocal MRI lesions and a low PSA density or low Stockholm 3 score have a low risk of clinically significant prostate cancer.

### The prostate cancer detection rates of CEUS-targeted versus MRI-targeted versus systematic TRUS-guided biopsies in biopsy-naïve men: a prospective, comparative clinical trial using the same patients [^bb40c3a6]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The current standard for Prostate Cancer (PCa) detection in biopsy-naïve men consists of 10–12 systematic biopsies under ultrasound guidance. This approach leads to underdiagnosis and undergrading of significant PCa while insignificant PCa may be overdiagnosed. The recent developments in MRI and Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) imaging have sparked an increasing interest in PCa imaging with the ultimate goal of replacing these "blind" systematic biopsies with reliable imaging-based targeted biopsies.

Methods/design

In this trial, we evaluate and compare the PCa detection rates of multiparametric (mp)MRI-targeted biopsies, CEUS-targeted biopsies and systematic biopsies under ultrasound guidance in the same patients. After informed consent, 299 biopsy-naïve men will undergo mpMRI scanning and CEUS imaging 1 week prior to the prostate biopsy procedure. During the biopsy procedure, a systematic transrectal 12-core biopsy will be performed by one operator blinded for the imaging results and targeted biopsy procedure. Subsequently a maximum of 4 CEUS-targeted biopsies and/or 4 mpMRI-targeted biopsies of predefined locations determined by an expert CEUS reader using quantification techniques and an expert radiologist, respectively, will be taken by a second operator using an MRI-US fusion device. The primary outcome is the detection rate of PCa (all grades) and clinically significant PCa (defined as Gleason score ≥ 7) compared between the three biopsy protocols.

Discussion

This trial compares the detection rate of (clinically significant) PCa, between both traditional systematic biopsies and targeted biopsies based on predefined regions of interest identified by two promising imaging technologies. It follows published recommendations on study design for the evaluation of imaging guided prostate biopsy techniques, minimizing bias and allowing data pooling. It is the first trial to combine mpMRI imaging and advanced CEUS imaging with quantification.

### The prostate cancer detection rates of CEUS-targeted versus MRI-targeted versus systematic TRUS-guided biopsies in biopsy-naïve men: a prospective, comparative clinical trial using the same patients [^a9417942]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The current standard for Prostate Cancer (PCa) detection in biopsy-naïve men consists of 10–12 systematic biopsies under ultrasound guidance. This approach leads to underdiagnosis and undergrading of significant PCa while insignificant PCa may be overdiagnosed. The recent developments in MRI and Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) imaging have sparked an increasing interest in PCa imaging with the ultimate goal of replacing these "blind" systematic biopsies with reliable imaging-based targeted biopsies.

Methods/Design

In this trial, we evaluate and compare the PCa detection rates of multiparametric (mp)MRI-targeted biopsies, CEUS-targeted biopsies and systematic biopsies under ultrasound guidance in the same patients. After informed consent, 299 biopsy-naïve men will undergo mpMRI scanning and CEUS imaging 1 week prior to the prostate biopsy procedure. During the biopsy procedure, a systematic transrectal 12-core biopsy will be performed by one operator blinded for the imaging results and targeted biopsy procedure. Subsequently a maximum of 4 CEUS-targeted biopsies and/or 4 mpMRI-targeted biopsies of predefined locations determined by an expert CEUS reader using quantification techniques and an expert radiologist, respectively, will be taken by a second operator using an MRI-US fusion device. The primary outcome is the detection rate of PCa (all grades) and clinically significant PCa (defined as Gleason score ≥ 7) compared between the three biopsy protocols.

Discussion

This trial compares the detection rate of (clinically significant) PCa, between both traditional systematic biopsies and targeted biopsies based on predefined regions of interest identified by two promising imaging technologies. It follows published recommendations on study design for the evaluation of imaging guided prostate biopsy techniques, minimizing bias and allowing data pooling. It is the first trial to combine mpMRI imaging and advanced CEUS imaging with quantification.

### Prostate cancer diagnosis with micro-ultrasound: what we know now and new horizons [^ecb07d1c]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common non-cutaneous cancer diagnosed in males. Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) with targeted biopsy can detect PCa and is currently the recommended initial test in men at risk for PCa. Micro-Ultrasound (MicroUS) is a novel high-resolution 29-MHz ultrasound with ∼three times greater resolution of conventional transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) resolution. Preliminary data suggest improved accuracy of ultrasound for targeted prostate biopsy. A growing body of evidence has become available supporting MicroUS as a potentially time and cost saving modality for PCa detection, with early results suggesting comparable accuracy to mpMRI. Additionally, microUS allows real-time visualization for accurate targeted biopsy. It is not yet clear whether MicroUS should be used on its own or in combination with mpMRI for prostate cancer detection. The ongoing OPTIMUM randomized controlled trial will help to establish the role of MicroUS in the diagnostic algorithm for the detection of clinically significant (cs)-PCa. Early data also indicate this imaging modality may have a role in local staging (eg, extracapsular extension prediction) and active surveillance of PCa. MicroUS has also the potential to add value to biparametric (bp) MRI, and may represent a promising tool for guidance of focal therapy in the near future.

### Prebiopsy multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for prostate cancer diagnosis in biopsy-naive men with suspected prostate cancer based on elevated prostate-specific antigen values: results from a randomized prospective blinded controlled trial [^ac43e8b4]. European Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRI) may improve the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (PCa).

Objective

To compare MP-MRI transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-fusion targeted biopsy with routine TRUS-guided random biopsy for overall and clinically significant PCa detection among patients with suspected PCa based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This institutional review board-approved, single-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial (April 2011 to December 2014) included 130 biopsy-naive patients referred for prostate biopsy based on PSA values (PSA < 20 ng/ml or free-to-total PSA ratio ≤ 0.15 and PSA < 10 ng/ml). Patients were randomized 1:1 to the MP-MRI or control group. Patients in the MP-MRI group underwent prebiopsy MP-MRI followed by 10- to 12-core TRUS-guided random biopsy and cognitive MRI/TRUS fusion targeted biopsy. The control group underwent TRUS-guided random biopsy alone.

Intervention

MP-MRI 3-T phased-array surface coil.

Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis

The primary outcome was the number of patients with biopsy-proven PCa in the MP-MRI and control groups. Secondary outcome measures included the number of positive prostate biopsies and the proportion of clinically significant PCa in the MP-MRI and control groups. Between-group analyses were performed.

Results and Limitations

Overall, 53 and 60 patients were evaluable in the MP-MRI and control groups, respectively. The overall PCa detection rate and the clinically significant cancer detection rate were similar between the MP-MRI and control groups, respectively (64% [34 of 53] vs 57% [34 of 60]; 7.5% difference [95% confidence interval (CI), -10 to 25], p = 0.5, and 55% [29 of 53] vs 45% [27 of 60]; 9.7% difference [95% CI, -8.5 to 27], p = 0.8). The PCa detection rate was higher than assumed during the planning of this single-center trial.

Conclusions

MP-MRI/TRUS-fusion targeted biopsy did not improve PCa detection rate compared with TRUS-guided biopsy alone in patients with suspected PCa based on PSA values.

Patient Summary

In this randomized clinical trial, additional prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before prostate biopsy appeared to offer similar diagnostic accuracy compared with routine transrectal ultrasound-guided random biopsy in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Similar numbers of cancers were detected with and without MRI.

Trial Registration

ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01357512.

### Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test: a clinical practice guideline [^fdb13c1f]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Costs and resources

Results from a recent cost-effectiveness study modelled for the US suggested that screening between the ages of 55 and 69 years combined with active surveillance for low risk men could only be cost-effective at a $100 000 threshold if the screening frequency remains low (every four years) and active surveillance is offered to all men with low risk prostate cancer (that is, Gleason score ≤ 6 and stage ≤ T2a). Strategies with shorter screening intervals or in which immediate treatment is offered to all men were not cost-effective. Although the Rapid Recommendations panel focused on the patients' priorities rather than those of society, our recommendation is compatible with these findings.

Uncertainties for future research

Recent evidence suggests that incorporating MRI in the investigation of those with a positive PSA test result decreases the false positive rate, and thus the number of patients undergoing unnecessary biopsies, and may also increase the accuracy of biopsies in those who do have prostate cancer. The Rapid Recommendations panel considered addressing this issue in the guideline, but the impact of MRI on long term outcomes of prostate cancer incidence, mortality, and complications of treatment remains uncertain. Sophisticated decision modelling might shed light on this issue, but the panel decided not to conduct such an analysis because of logistic and feasibility considerations, and because the panel's review of the evidence suggests that modelling would introduce further uncertainties regarding the impact of MRI on patient-important outcomes.

Key research question to inform decision makers and future guidelines include

Could new screening and diagnostic techniques reduce the harms and burden of the diagnostic procedure by better identifying non-progressive and slowly progressive cancer from cancer that is likely to become symptomatic and affect quality or length of life? These strategies may include genetic markers or biomarkers, risk stratification tools, or MRI guided biopsy. For example, two recent high quality studies on MRI guided biopsy have shown encouraging results of MRI to reduce overdiagnosis, but the impact of this strategy on long term, patient-important outcomes (such as prostate cancer incidence, mortality, and complications of treatment) remains uncertain.
For men opting for screening, what would be the ideal age range and screening interval? Randomised trials varied in their offer of a one-off or repeated PSA testing and it remains uncertain which strategy is more suitable.
What is the impact of screening on men at higher baseline risk (men with a family history of cancer, of African descent, and of lower socioeconomic status)? Are their values and preferences different from those of men in the general population?

### The prostate cancer detection rates of CEUS-targeted versus MRI-targeted versus systematic TRUS-guided biopsies in biopsy-naïve men: a prospective, comparative clinical trial using the same patients [^f0435fe7]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence of PCa has increased in the 1990's, due to increased awareness and prolific Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) screening. Although in the United States this trend has partly reversed, PCa is still the most common cancer in men representing 21% of cancer cases and it is estimated that 180,890 men will be diagnosed with PCa in United States in 2016. In Europe the incidence has increased, with 417,00 new PCa diagnoses in 2012. According to current standards, patients with a clinical suspicion of PCa based on elevated serum PSA and/or digital rectal examination should undergo 10–12 systematic transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsies to confirm the diagnosis. These systematic "blind" prostate biopsies lead to a considerable rate of overdiagnosis of clinically insignificant PCa as well as underdiagnosis and undergrading of significant PCa. Image - guided targeted biopsy approaches have been proposed to address these problems. Prostate cancer imaging has thus far developed on two platforms: MRI and Ultrasound. On the MRI platform, multiparametric MRI(mpMRI) in which diffusion - weighted MRI and dynamic contrast- enhanced MRI sequences are added to anatomical T2-weighted imaging has become the standard for PCa imaging. A 2015 systematic review on the accuracy of mpMRI for the detection of prostate cancer found 12 studies and reported a negative predictive value for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer between 63 and 98% and positive predictive values of 34–68%. However, these results should be interpreted with caution since several used biopsy pathology as the reference standard to calculate sensitivity and specificity. Several meta-analyses have addressed the value of mpMRI - targeted biopsy cores and these show an improved per-core detection rate and a beneficial increased per-patient detection rate in patients with a persistent clinical suspicion after prior negative biopsies. The 2016 update of the EAU (European Association of Urology) guidelines on PCa now recommends performing mpMRI in these patients. However, at this point, the value of using mpMRI and MRI-targeted biopsies at initial biopsy in biopsy-naïve patient is debated. Even though high negative predictive values for detecting significant prostate cancer have been reported, significant disease can still be missed by MRI - targeted biopsy. Furthermore, considerable heterogeneity and risk of selection bias of published results exists. The EAU guidelines therefore recommend combining systematic and targeted biopsies. The review by Van Hove et al. shows a 1–43% absolute and 2–430% relative increase in per-patient detection rate can be achieved by adding mpMRI - targeted cores to systematic cores. Several methods of using the information obtained by mpMRI to target the region of interest with prostate biopsies exist: in cognitive targeting, the operator makes a visual estimation of where the MRI lesion is located during a TRUS-guided biopsy procedure. Taking in-bore biopsies during MRI scanning reduces the risk of targeting error but due to its magnet time consuming and therefore costly nature, it is not used often. Fusion devices have been developed that register the MRI images and US together, guiding the observer towards the MRI lesion during the TRUS procedure.

### Microultrasonography-guided vs MRI-guided biopsy for prostate cancer diagnosis… [^32257a9a]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Interventions Participants were assigned to receive either microultrasonography-guided biopsy, microultrasonography/MRI fusion-guided biopsy, or MRI/conventional US fusion-guided biopsy. All participants received synchronous systematic biopsy. The 70-micron resolution is equivalent to the diameter of a typical prostate duct, permitting visualization of prostate cancer as malignancy alters the ductal architecture. In this international, multicenter, randomized clinical trial, microultrasonography-guided biopsy was shown to be noninferior to MRI/conventional ultrasonography fusion-guided biopsy for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer in biopsy-naive men. Furthermore, combined microultrasonography/MRI fusion-guided biopsy was also noninferior to MRI/conventional ultrasonography fusion-guided biopsy.

These findings have significant clinical implications. For patients and physicians, microultrasonography is a novel method of imaging and biopsy with potential greater accessibility for patients considering prostate biopsy, particularly for patients with contraindications to MRI. From a resource perspective, the requirement for 2 procedures becomes a single encounter using microultrasonography with no contrast requirement, thereby reducing wait times, cost, contrast-related morbidity, and patient anxiety. If a staged screening approach with initial microUS followed by MRI when PRI-MUS was ≤ 3 were followed, 89/226 MRIs and 54/226 biopsies for double-negative cases would have been avoided. In turn 3 cases of clinically significant prostate cancer, all of which were Gleason Grade 2, would have been missed. Microultrasonography is a comparatively new modality that has not been studied or implemented as widely as MRI.

This study was intended to draw conclusions on overall biopsy efficacy; however, there may be important differences between the technologies in implementation, potential for further advancement, and user variability that should be addressed in future work. This large international, randomized clinical trial demonstrated that microultrasonography-guided biopsy is noninferior to MRI-guided fusion biopsy for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer in biopsy-naive men. Microultrasonography represents an alternative to MRI for image-guided prostate biopsy.

### Are magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound guided Targeted biopsies noninferior to transrectal ultrasound guided systematic biopsies for the detection of prostate cancer? [^76464328]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

In men with suspicion of prostate cancer the standard of cancer detection is transrectal ultrasound guided 10 to 12-core systematic biopsy. The targeted biopsy only strategy using magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound image registration is gaining in popularity. We assessed the noninferiority of targeted vs systematic biopsy.

Materials and Methods

Between June and October 2014 a total of 108 biopsy naïve patients with prostate specific antigen between 4 and 20 ng/ml, normal rectal examination and a single suspicious image on magnetic resonance imaging were included in study at 7 centers. Patients underwent systematic biopsy by a first operator blinded to magnetic resonance imaging, immediately followed by 3 targeted biopsies within the suspicious image by a second operator. The primary end point was the cancer detection rate. The noninferiority margin was set at -5%. The secondary end points were the detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer (maximum cancer core length 5 mm or greater for Gleason 6 or any Gleason 7 or greater disease) and procedure duration.

Results

Systematic and targeted biopsies detected cancer in 66 (61.1%) and 61 patients (56.5%), respectively. The mean difference was -4.5% with a 95% CI lower bound of -11.8%. A total of 13 patients with protocol violations were excluded from the per protocol analysis, which showed a mean difference of -5.2% with a 95% CI lower bound of -13.1%. Clinically significant prostate cancer was detected in 50 (46.2%) and 52 patients (48.1%) with systematic and targeted biopsies, respectively (p = 0.69). The mean ± SD duration of image fusion plus targeted biopsy was 16.7 ± 7 minutes vs 7.4 ± 3 for systematic biopsy (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Targeted biopsy seemed to be inferior to systematic biopsy for overall cancer detection. Detection of clinically significant prostate cancer did not differ between targeted and systematic biopsies.

### Comparison of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and targeted biopsy with systematic biopsy alone for the diagnosis of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8aa7ed6d]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Methods

This review followed recommended methods for systematic reviews, and is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline. We expanded the data extraction and analysis, as described elsewhere, to differentiate between the 2 prebiopsy MRI pathways and to include the secondary outcome of PCa missed by MRI.

Data Sources and Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials including biopsy-naive men with clinical suspicion for PCa that compared a 2-step MRI pathway (prebiopsy MRI group) with TRUS-guided systematic biopsy (systematic biopsy alone group) were eligible for inclusion. Eligible MRI pathways consisted of prebiopsy MRI using 2 or more parameters, followed by a targeted biopsy with or without systematic sampling based on the MRI results (MRI plus targeted biopsy or MRI plus targeted and systematic biopsy). MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science were searched through December 2018 using the terms "prostate cancer" and "MRI" and an RCT filter. Trial registries and reference lists of recent reviews were also searched. Abstracts and full texts were independently screened by 2 reviewers using Rayyan. Any discrepancies between the reviewers were resolved through discussion or referral to a third reviewer.

### Cost-effectiveness of annual prostate MRI and potential MRI-guided biopsy after prostate-specific antigen test results [^ff42234a]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and potential MRI-guided biopsy enable enhanced identification of clinically significant prostate cancer. Despite proven efficacy, MRI and potential MRI-guided biopsy remain costly, and there is limited evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of this approach in general and for different prostate-specific antigen (PSA) strata.

Objective

To examine the cost-effectiveness of integrating annual MRI and potential MRI-guided biopsy as part of clinical decision-making for men after being screened for prostate cancer compared with standard biopsy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Using a decision analytic Markov cohort model, an economic evaluation was conducted projecting outcomes over 10 years for a hypothetical cohort of 65-year-old men in the US with 4 different PSA strata (< 2.5 ng/mL, 2.5–4.0 ng/mL, 4.1–10.0 ng/mL, > 10 ng/mL) identified by screening through Monte Carlo microsimulation with 10 000 trials. Model inputs for probabilities, costs in 2020 US dollars, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were from the literature and expert consultation. The model was specifically designed to reflect the US health care system, adopting a federal payer perspective (ie, Medicare).

Exposures

Magnetic resonance imaging with potential MRI-guided biopsy and standard biopsy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY was estimated. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.

Results

For the 3 PSA strata of 2.5 ng/mL or greater, the MRI and potential MRI-guided biopsy strategy was cost-effective compared with standard biopsy (PSA 2.5–4.0 ng/mL: base-case ICER, $21 131/QALY; PSA 4.1–10.0 ng/mL: base-case ICER, $12 336/QALY; PSA > 10.0 ng/mL: base-case ICER, $6000/QALY). Results varied depending on the diagnostic accuracy of MRI and potential MRI-guided biopsy. Results of probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that the MRI and potential MRI-guided biopsy strategy was cost-effective at the willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY in a range between 76% and 81% of simulations for each of the 3 PSA strata of 2.5 ng/mL or more.

Conclusions and Relevance

This economic evaluation of a hypothetical cohort suggests that an annual MRI and potential MRI-guided biopsy was a cost-effective option from a US federal payer perspective compared with standard biopsy for newly eligible male Medicare beneficiaries with a serum PSA level of 2.5 ng/mL or more.

### Optimum imaging strategies for advanced prostate cancer: ASCO guideline [^3921d039]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Metastatic CRPC and PSA progression — As recommended by the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 consensus statements, PSA progression alone for men on treatment of metastatic CRPC should not be the sole reason to change therapy, and conventional imaging can be used for initial evaluation of PSA progression and should be continued to facilitate changes/comparisons and serially to assess for development of radiographic progression; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong. In this cohort, the use of NGI is unclear with a paucity of prospective data, and when a change in clinical care is contemplated with high clinical suspicion of subclinical metastasis despite negative conventional imaging, the use of NGI could be contemplated, especially in the setting of a clinical trial; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of recommendation: weak.

### Image-guided prostate biopsy using magnetic resonance imaging-derived targets: a systematic review [^a3c9ae4b]. European Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Technical improvements in prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have resulted in the use of MRI to target prostate biopsies.

Objective

To systematically review the literature to compare the accuracy of MRI-targeted biopsy with standard transrectal biopsy in the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer.

Evidence Acquisition

The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched from inception until December 3, 2011, using the search criteria 'prostate OR prostate cancer' AND 'magnetic resonance imaging OR MRI' AND 'biopsy OR target'. Four reviewers independently assessed 4222 records; 222 records required full review. Fifty unique records (corresponding to 16 discrete patient populations) directly compared an MRI-targeted with a standard transrectal approach.

Evidence Synthesis

Evidence synthesis was used to address specific questions. Where MRI was applied to all biopsy-naive men, 62% (374 of 599) had MRI abnormalities. When subjected to a targeted biopsy, 66% (248 of 374) had prostate cancer detected. Both targeted and standard biopsy detected clinically significant cancer in 43% (236 or 237 of 555, respectively). Missed clinically significant cancers occurred in 13 men using targeted biopsy and 12 using a standard approach. Targeted biopsy was more efficient. A third fewer men were biopsied overall. Those who had biopsy required a mean of 3.8 targeted cores compared with 12 standard cores. A targeted approach avoided the diagnosis of clinically insignificant cancer in 53 of 555 (10%) of the presenting population.

Conclusions

MRI-guided biopsy detects clinically significant prostate cancer in an equivalent number of men versus standard biopsy. This is achieved using fewer biopsies in fewer men, with a reduction in the diagnosis of clinically insignificant cancer. Variability in study methodology limits the strength of recommendation that can be made. There is a need for a robust multicentre trial of targeted biopsies.

### Rationale… [^54ede6ef]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Approximately 1% of prostate biopsies result in complications requiring hospitalization. The false-positive and complication rates from biopsy are higher in older men. 3 Adequate evidence suggests that the harms of screening and diagnostic procedures are at least small. PSA-based screening for prostate cancer leads to the diagnosis of prostate cancer in some men whose cancer would never have become symptomatic during their lifetime. Treatment of these men results in harms and provides them with no benefit. This is known as overdiagnosis, and follow-up of large randomized trials suggests that 20% to 50% of men diagnosed with prostate cancer through screening may be overdiagnosed. These trials used varying screening intervals and PSA thresholds for diagnostic biopsy. 3 The PLCO trial may be viewed as a trial of organized vs.

opportunistic screening for prostate cancer because of the substantial screening rate in the control group and the high screening rate among men in both the control and intervention groups prior to study enrollment. The USPSTF considered whether there are screening and follow-up approaches that increase the potential for benefit while reducing the potential for harms. Variation across sites in randomized trials of screening suggests there may be greater mortality benefit from screening every other year compared with longer intervals and from using lower PSA thresholds for diagnostic biopsy. Although these approaches may have increased the potential benefit reported in studies, they also resulted in substantially more harms — more false-positive results, more prostate biopsies, and more cases of overdiagnosis. This trade-off was also observed in a review of decision analysis models; screening protocols using lower PSA thresholds for biopsy and more frequent screening intervals offered greater potential reductions in prostate cancer mortality but higher rates of overdiagnosis and other harms. 14 The frequency of screening in the ERSPC sites ranged from every 2 to 7 years. No ERSPC trial site offered screening more often than every 2 years, and many sites screened every 4 years. The PSA threshold for biopsy in the ERSPC sites ranged from 2. 5 to 4 ng/mL. In the Göteborg, Sweden, site, which reported the largest benefit, the frequency of screening was every 2 years, and the threshold for biopsy was 2. 5 ng/mL.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^aeb79a62]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Active surveillance — biopsy, imaging, and observation guidance — states that literature suggests that as many as 7% of patients undergoing prostate biopsy will suffer an adverse event; therefore many clinicians choose to wait 2 years for a biopsy if there are no signs of progression. If the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level increases and systematic prostate biopsy remains negative, multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) may be considered to exclude anterior cancer, and in patients with a suspicious lesion on mpMRI, MRI-US fusion biopsy improves the detection of higher grade (Grade Group ≥ 2) cancers, although more recent studies have shown that a significant proportion of high-grade cancers are detected with systematic biopsy and not targeted biopsy in patients on active surveillance. Patients should be transitioned to observation when life expectancy is less than 10 years.

Objectives

To evaluate the ability of high-frequency (29 MHz) transrectal micro-ultrasound (microUS) as a second-look examination after biparametric MRI (bp-MRI) and to reidentify focal lesions seen on diagnostic MRI and to detect new ones METHODS: A total of 118 consecutive men (mean age, 66 ± 13 [SD] years; range, 49–93 years) with a mean prostate-specific antigen level of 11 ± 19 (SD) ng/mL (range, 2–200 ng/mL) and at least one focal lesion (MRI+) with a score > 2 on bp-MRI were included. Of these, 79/118 (66.9%) were biopsy-naïve and 102/118 (86.5%) had non-suspicious rectal examination. All patients had MRI-directed microUS-guided biopsy using a 29-MHz transducer. All lesions visible on micro-ultrasound (microUS+) were targeted without image fusion, which was only used for MRI+/microUS- lesions. Significant prostate cancer (sPCa) was defined by a Gleason score ≥ 7 or a maximum cancer core length > 3 mm.

Results

A total of 144 focal prostatic lesions were analyzed, including 114 (114/144, 79.2%) MRI+/microUS+ lesions, 13 MRI+/microUS- lesions (13/144, 9%), and 17 MRI-/microUS+ lesions (17/144, 11.8%). Significant PCa was detected in 70 MRI+/microUS+ lesions (70/114, 61.4%), in no MRI+/microUS- lesion (0/13, 0%), and in 4 MRI-/microUS+ lesions (4/17, 23.5%). The sensitivity and specificity of microUS on a per-patient and a per-lesion basis were 100% (95% CI, 84.9–100%) and 22.8% (95% CI, 12.5–35.8%) and 100% (95% CI, 85.1–100%) and 22.6% (95% CI, 12.3–36.2%), respectively.

Conclusion

MicroUS, as a second-look examination, may show promise to localize targets detected on bp-MRI.

Key Points

- Used as a second-look examination, microUS-guided biopsies have a 100% detection rate of sCa originating in the PZ or lower third of the TZ, without microUS-MRI image fusion.
- MicroUS results may provide additional information about lesions visible on MRI.
- MicroUS may provide the ability to detect small PZ lesions undetected by bp-MRI.

3 Results

3.1 Baseline Characteristics

A total of 425 patients with a clinical suspicion of PCa were included in our study. The median age of our population was 66 years (IQR: 59–72), PSA levels were 5.7 ng/mL (IQR: 4.0–7.9), and prostate volume was 44 mL (IQR: 31.5–62.1). Overall, all 425 (100%) patients underwent DRE, of whom 51 (12%) resulted to be positive. Among our population, 294 (69.2%) men were biopsy‐naïve, while the remaining 131 (30.8%) were subjected to a previous prostate biopsy with a negative finding before the mUS investigation. The median time from mUS evaluation to last follow‐up was 39 months (IQR: 27–53). Further population baseline characteristics categorized according to the mUS findings are listed in Table 1.

Active surveillance — imaging-directed biopsy and observation indicate that if the PSA level increases and systematic prostate biopsy remains negative, mpMRI may be considered to exclude the presence of anterior cancer. In patients with a suspicious lesion on mpMRI, MRI-US fusion biopsy improves the detection of higher grade (Grade Group ≥ 2) cancers, although more recent studies have shown that a significant proportion of high-grade cancers are detected with systematic biopsy and not targeted biopsy in patients on active surveillance.

### Prospective randomized trial comparing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided in-bore biopsy to MRI-ultrasound fusion and transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy in patients with prior negative biopsies [^5cc2d5d9]. European Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

A significant proportion of prostate cancers (PCas) are missed by conventional transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUS-GB). It remains unclear whether the combined approach using targeted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-ultrasound fusion-guided biopsy (FUS-GB) and systematic TRUS-GB is superior to targeted MRI-guided in-bore biopsy (IB-GB) for PCa detection.

Objective

To compare PCa detection between IB-GB alone and FUS-GB + TRUS-GB in patients with at least one negative TRUS-GB and prostate-specific antigen ≥ 4 ng/ml.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Patients were prospectively randomized after multiparametric prostate MRI to IB-GB (arm A) or FUS-GB + TRUS-GB (arm B) from November 2011 to July 2014.

Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis

The study was powered at 80% to demonstrate an overall PCa detection rate of ≥ 60% in arm B compared to 40% in arm A. Secondary endpoints were the distribution of highest Gleason scores, the rate of detection of significant PCa (Gleason ≥ 7), the number of biopsy cores to detect one (significant) PCa, the positivity rate for biopsy cores, and tumor involvement per biopsy core.

Results and Limitations

The study was halted after interim analysis because the primary endpoint was not met. The trial enrolled 267 patients, of whom 210 were analyzed (106 randomized to arm A and 104 to arm B). PCa detection was 37% in arm A and 39% in arm B (95% confidence interval for difference, -16% to 11%; p = 0.7). Detection rates for significant PCa (29% vs 32%; p = 0.7) and the highest percentage tumor involvement per biopsy core (48% vs 42%; p = 0.4) were similar between the arms. The mean number of cores was 5.6 versus 17 (p < 0.001). A limitation is the limited number of patients because of early cessation of accrual.

Conclusions

This trial failed to identify an important improvement in detection rate for the combined biopsy approach over MRI-targeted biopsy alone. A prospective comparison between MRI-targeted biopsy alone and systematic TRUS-GB is justified.

Patient Summary

Our randomized study showed similar prostate cancer detection rates between targeted prostate biopsy guided by magnetic resonance imaging and the combination of targeted biopsy and systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. An important improvement in detection rates using the combined biopsy approach can be excluded.

### Early detection of prostate cancer: AUA / SUO guideline part I: prostate cancer screening [^d0481496]. The Journal of Urology (2023). High credibility.

Imaging and biopsy approaches in early detection — there is a lack of data for non-binary patients or transgender women on screening preferences, initiation timing, biomarker accuracy, psychological consequences, impact of gender-affirming hormonal therapy, and management priorities, and considerably more effort and research are required. Although many serum, urine, tissue, and imaging biomarkers exist to assess risk of high-grade disease, there is little knowledge on comparative effectiveness, complementarity, and performance of stepwise algorithms, warranting considerable research toward approaches that are highly effective, practical, scalable, and widely available. Use of transperineal versus transrectal biopsy varies widely; the transperineal approach may lower infection risk without compromising diagnostic capabilities, yet the value of prophylactic antibiotics is unknown and widespread implementation requires adequate training and resources, with randomized comparative-effectiveness trials ongoing. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate, while commonly utilized, has not been shown to impact meaningful long-term outcomes such as cancer-specific mortality. Even with growing experience with mpMRI and fusion biopsies, some GG2+ cases have targeted biopsies that either do not detect cancer or detect only GG1 disease, which may reflect false positive mpMRI readings or lesion under-sampling; optimal management strategies and evolving MRI protocols, including biparametric MRI and artificial intelligence, require further study.

### A noninferiority within-person study comparing the accuracy of transperineal to transrectal MRI-US fusion biopsy for prostate-cancer detection [^a351914a]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prostate-cancer diagnosis is undergoing a paradigm shift. Data from the PROMIS study demonstrated that multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), before prostate biopsy, could identify men who might safely avoid biopsy and improve detection of clinically-significant cancer. The PRECISION trial demonstrated that MRI–ultrasound (US)-fusion biopsies are superior to systematic transrectal US-guided (TRUS) biopsies for prostate-cancer detection among biopsy-naive patients.

MRI–US fusion biopsies, like systematic biopsies, can be performed transrectally or transperineally. The transrectal (TR) approach is typically performed under local anesthesia, and is associated with about 3% of septic complications. The transperineal (TP) approach is usually performed under general anesthesia, thus is more time and resource consuming. However, septic complications are extremely rare.

In systematic biopsies, there are conflicting results as to whether the biopsy approach affect prostate-cancer detection rate. While several studies found that TP is preferable, others suggest that there are no significant differences.

As MRI–US fusion biopsies are becoming standard of care, the TP versus TR dilemma becomes topical. To date, no study has prospectively compared the two methods in the fusion era. Here we present the results of noninferiority, within subject, study comparing TR-fusion and TP-fusion for diagnosis of clinically-significant prostate-cancer (csPCa).

### Targeted prostate biopsy in the era of active surveillance [^2a82fce9]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Targeted prostate biopsy using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance is improving the accuracy of prostate cancer (CaP) diagnosis. This new biopsy technology is especially important for men undergoing active surveillance, improving patient selection for enrollment and enabling precise longitudinal monitoring. Magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion biopsy allows for 3 functions not previously possible with US-guided biopsy: targeting of suspicious regions, template-mapping for systematic sampling, and tracking of cancer foci over time. This article reviews the evolving role of the new biopsy methods in active surveillance, including the UCLA Active Surveillance pathway, which has incorporated magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound fusion biopsy from program inception as a possible model.

### Prospective evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging guided in-bore prostate biopsy versus systematic transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy in biopsy naïve men with elevated prostate specific antigen [^28ab90de]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Magnetic resonance imaging guided biopsy is increasingly performed to diagnose prostate cancer. However, there is a lack of well controlled, prospective trials to support this treatment method. We prospectively compared magnetic resonance imaging guided in-bore biopsy with standard systematic transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy in biopsy naïve men with increased prostate specific antigen.

Materials and Methods

We performed a prospective study in 132 biopsy naïve men with increased prostate specific antigen (greater than 4 ng/ml). After 3 Tesla functional multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging patients were referred for magnetic resonance imaging guided in-bore biopsy of prostate lesions (maximum 3) followed by standard systematic transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy (12 cores). We analyzed the detection rates of prostate cancer and significant prostate cancer (greater than 5 mm total cancer length or any Gleason pattern greater than 3).

Results

A total of 128 patients with a mean ± SD age of 66.1 ± 8.1 years met all study requirements. Median prostate specific antigen was 6.7 ng/ml (IQR 5.1–9.0). Transrectal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging guided biopsies provided the same 53.1% detection rate, including 79.4% and 85.3%, respectively, for significant prostate cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging and transrectal ultrasound guided biopsies missed 7.8% and 9.4% of clinically significant prostate cancers, respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging biopsy required significantly fewer cores and revealed a higher percent of cancer involvement per biopsy core (each p < 0.01). Combining the 2 methods provided a 60.9% detection rate with an 82.1% rate for significant prostate cancer.

Conclusions

Magnetic resonance imaging guided in-bore and systematic transrectal ultrasound guided biopsies achieved equally high detection rates in biopsy naïve patients with increased prostate specific antigen. Magnetic resonance imaging guided in-bore biopsies required significantly fewer cores and revealed a significantly higher percent of cancer involvement per biopsy core.

### Screening for prostate cancer: evidence, ongoing trials, policies and knowledge gaps [^9265e1ec]. BMJ Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Scientific knowledge gaps

Important knowledge gaps remain about many aspects related to screening for prostate cancer (Box 1). The PSA test effectively identifies a large proportion of men at very low risk of clinically significant prostate cancer and will most likely remain the primary screening test. However, the optimal PSA threshold for further diagnostic evaluation is not known. Gleason score ≥ 7 prostate cancer may be detected also in men with PSA below the commonly used biopsy threshold, that is, ≥ 3.0 or ≥ 4.0 ng/mL. Delaying detection of these cancers in a structured screening programme may, however, not significantly affect prostate cancer mortality. The ongoing Gothenburg-2 trial is evaluating cancer detection in men with PSA 1.8–2.9 ng/mL.

### Optimizing prostate cancer diagnostic work-up through micro-ultrasound: minimizing unnecessary procedures and reducing overdiagnoses [^4df94be6]. The Prostate (2025). Medium credibility.

In this context, there is a pressing need to elevate public consciousness about the disease and its genetic predispositions, particularly for individuals with familial risk. The current underappreciation of genetic risk factors underscores the urgent clinical imperative to develop personalized health promotion and targeted screening strategies. Following precision medicine principles, the scientific community supports incorporating genetic testing into PCa diagnostics to enhance risk stratification and establish tailored pathways, ensuring timely and appropriate interventions for those at greatest risk.

In addition to developing specific PCa screening and diagnostic pathways based on risk stratification and molecular as well as genetic testing, the integration of novel imaging technologies can further refine these processes. Incorporating mUS into PCa screening and diagnostic pathways may represent a significant advancement. In this regard, mUS not only streamlines the diagnostic process but also enhances the precision in identifying patients who eventually require more invasive diagnostic or radiological investigations. This technique not only saves time and resources but also enhances the role of urologists, who can perform mUS assessments repeatedly at short intervals. This capability allows for immediate adjustments based on any new uncertainties or changes in a patient's condition, ensuring a more efficient and responsive approach to PCa management. Given this consideration, although our study lacks a control group, the potential to utilize this urologist‐friendly tool in an opportunistic screening setting or within a randomized study is highly appealing. The ongoing OPTIMUM trial partially addresses this approach, underscoring the attractiveness of mUS as a versatile and effective diagnostic tool.

### Cost-effectiveness of annual prostate MRI and potential MRI-guided biopsy after prostate-specific antigen test results [^31b48dae]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Developing a model necessitates making choices that may affect results and limit generalizability. We chose to use the cost for in-bore MRI-targeted biopsy instead of systematic TRUS fusion biopsy, as the former would detect the higher-risk grade PCa sooner, resulting in an expected increase in short-term costs and potentially decreasing the likelihood of cost-effectiveness. However, these costs may be offset by potential long-term cost reductions due to greater efficacy of treatment when PCa is detected at an early stage, which may be of particular interest to policy makers. Future studies can address the difference in the estimated economic value of these different techniques once reliable longitudinal data are available. In addition, our outcomes may vary for other reimbursement settings and perspectives. A societal perspective, for example, could result in higher time costs for the patient or other costs not covered by Medicare that may differ between the strategies. Furthermore, our study assumes that men will stay in their original PSA stratum, which may not occur naturally with aging. However, because our results provide economic and effectiveness outcomes for each PSA category, concerns regarding dynamic changes in PSA can be addressed by weighting the results of PSA categories to calculate expected values for a model that incorporated those possible variations. We expect that including changes in PSA strata over time would not result in a qualitatively different conclusion because in our analysis the MRI and potential MRI-guided biopsy strategy are optimal in all groups with a PSA level of 2.5 ng/mL or more.

PSA thresholds for prompting biopsy — no universal cutoff: In considering whether a biopsy should be performed based on overall or high-grade cancer risk, "no absolute PSA level exists that is applicable to all men". Instead, "the risk level at which a biopsy should be considered should be based on factors related to a man's life expectancy (age, comorbidities) as well as a man's concern regarding his risk", and because detection and treatments can entail harms, "the level of risk at which a biopsy should be undertaken should be based on a man's integration of these considerations into his decision making".

### Detection of clinically significant prostate cancer using micro-ultrasound versus MRI / ultrasound fusion biopsy: a propensity-weighted comparative study [^65664d08]. The Journal of Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare the detection rates of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) between cognitively targeted micro-ultrasound-guided biopsy (MB) and MRI/ultrasound fusion-guided biopsy (PFB) in men with MRI-visible lesions.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed 1,119 men who underwent MB (n = 767) or PFB (n = 352) between 2019 and 2022. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) based on a logistic regression propensity score was applied to balance baseline characteristics between groups. Weighted logistic regression models were used to compare csPCa detection in the overall cohort and in subgroups of biopsy-naïve men and those with anterior lesions. A separate multivariable logistic regression was performed in the full cohort to identify independent predictors of csPCa. Concordance between biopsy and radical prostatectomy Gleason scores was also evaluated.

Results

After IPTW adjustment, csPCa detection with MB was higher than with PFB in combined sampling (45% vs. 34%; OR 1.61; 95% CI 1.23–2.11; p < 0.01). However, no significant difference was observed between techniques for targeted biopsies alone, both in the overall cohort and among biopsy-naïve men. In patients with anterior lesions, csPCa detection rates were also similar. In the full cohort multivariable model, MB and PIRADS 5 lesions were independently associated with csPCa. Gleason upgrading at prostatectomy was more frequent in the PFB group (38% vs. 17%; p = 0.01).

Conclusion

While MB demonstrated higher csPCa detection in adjusted analyses, the benefit was not consistent across all settings. Further studies are warranted to determine whether this reflects a methodological advantage or context-dependent factors.

### Tailoring biopsy strategy in the MRI-fusion prostate biopsy era: systematic, targeted or neither? [^91621f27]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Identification of men at low risk of finding clinically significant cancer on biopsy

Based on a priori decided and previously suggested cut-offs, we assessed the risk of significant cancer in men stratified according to PSA level, PSA density or Stockholm 3 risk score. Among men with any significant MRI lesion (PIRADS score 3–5), none of the cut-offs used, identified a group of men with < 11% risk of ISUP GG ≥ 2 cancer (resembling the risk among men with PSA ≤ 3 ng/ml in a screening population). However, the presuggested cut-off values were associated with delaying the detection of significant cancer. Therefore, exploratory cut-offs for men with equivocal lesions (PI-RADS 3) are illustrated in Table 3. We found that a PSA density < 0.1 ng/ml² is a reasonable alternative for identifying men with a PI-RADS 3 at low risk of cancer while saving one-third of biopsy procedures in these men and delaying diagnosis for 11% of patients with ISUP GG ≥ 2 cancer. Similarly, men with a Stockholm 3 < 0.11 and a PI-RADS 3 had a 5% risk of ISUP GG ≥ 2 cancer. Excluding biopsy procedures in these men would spare 52% of biopsy procedures, decreasing ISUP 1 detection by 46% and delaying diagnosis for 14% of the ISUP ≥ 2 cancers otherwise detected (Table 3). Alternative cut-offs for men with a PI-RADS 3 lesion, either a PSA density < 0.15 ng/ml², a prostate volume ≥ 50 cc or a Stockholm 3 score < 15%, could be used for identifying men with a low risk of clinically significant cancer via combined biopsy (10.3%, 7.2%, and 6.8%, respectively). Omitting biopsy in these men saved 16–19% (69–83/429) of the biopsy procedures in this study (Supplementary Table 4).

### Race and prostate imaging: implications for targeted biopsy and image-based prostate cancer interventions [^0116974e]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

There is strong evidence supporting the use of prostate MRI for men with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to diagnose and guide treatment of prostate cancer. Prostate MRI is assessed using the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) which grades the likelihood of clinically significant cancer on a 1–5 scale. Men with prostate MRI assigned PI-RADS scores 3–5 are recommended for biopsy. This scoring system was developed in men of European descent. In addition to risk stratification, prostate MRI aids in directing ultrasound-guided transrectal biopsy through the use of MRI-ultrasound fusion software. Recent prospective randomized trials demonstrate better detection of clinically significant prostate cancer with MRI-targeted biopsy as compared with standard transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy. Neither the PRECISION (Prostate Evaluation for Clinically Important Disease: Sampling Using Image Guidance or Not?) nor the MRI-FIRST randomized trials report patient race, but given the predominantly European study sites, non-white patient representation is likely very low. This may have significant implications as MRI and targeted biopsy are disseminated worldwide.

Following the Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, Long-term monitoring (IDEAL) framework, which seeks to improve the quality of research in surgery and devices through staged development and analysis of procedures, we consider targeted biopsy evidence development in the long-term monitoring surveillance phase. Real-world evidence, audits and risk adjustments are required to further investigate current practices, especially in understudied populations. In this context the US Preventive Services Task Force and other professional societies have emphasized a need for research to bridge the significant evidence gap in disparities regarding prostate cancer presentation and outcomes in under-represented populations. The relationship between MRI findings and biopsy outcomes has not been thoroughly explored in Asian-Americans. The Asian-American population is the fastest growing racial group in the USA and many Western countries. The Asian-American population is projected to double from 18.3 to 36.8 million by 2060, at which time Asian-Americans will comprise the largest immigrant group. Racial disparities in prostate cancer incidence have been reported, with Asian-Americans having a prostate cancer incidence rate of 67.8 per 100 000 men as compared with 123.0 in non-Hispanic whites.

Key Points

Question

Are an annual prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and potential MRI-guided biopsy cost-effective compared with a transrectal ultrasonographic (standard) biopsy for men with a positive prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test result?

Findings

In this economic evaluation, annual MRI and potential MRI-guided biopsy for prostate cancer found improved economic value compared with standard biopsy for men with a serum PSA level of 2.5 ng/mL or more beginning at 65 years of age.

Meaning

This study suggests that an annual MRI and potential MRI-guided biopsy are a cost-effective option from the federal payer perspective compared with standard biopsy for men beginning at 65 years of age for a serum PSA level of 2.5 ng/mL or more.

### MR imaging-transrectal US fusion for targeted prostate biopsies: implications for diagnosis and clinical management [^07c8b0e5]. Radiographics (2015). Low credibility.

Cancer of the prostate gland is a common but heterogeneous disease requiring individualized risk stratification for optimal clinical management. However, transrectal ultrasonography (US)-guided biopsy-the standard of care for diagnosis of prostate cancer-frequently fails to detect aggressive tumors or provide reliable parameters for pretreatment risk stratification. Multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the most accurate imaging technique for prostate cancer detection and local staging. Recently, different approaches have been developed to allow targeted biopsies of areas that are suspicious for cancer at MR imaging, including direct MR imaging guidance and MR imaging-transrectal US fusion, which can be achieved with cognitive fusion or software assistance. Regardless of the technique used, targeted prostate biopsies have the potential to increase detection of clinically relevant prostate cancer and provide more reliable risk stratification in patients with known cancer. The authors discuss the shortcomings of traditional diagnostic workup for prostate cancer, the rationale for targeted prostate biopsies, the different techniques available for targeting suspicious areas seen at MR imaging, and the clinical contexts in which targeted prostate biopsies might be useful. In addition, they discuss opportunities and challenges associated with MR imaging-transrectal US fusion biopsy, as well as questions that need to be addressed before formal incorporation of this technique into practice guidelines.

### Diagnostic performance ofGa-PSMA-11 PET / MRI-guided biopsy in patients with suspected prostate cancer: a prospective single-center study [^2e3e336e]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

The definition of sigPCa is not standardized among centers; therefore, we chose the definition used in the PROMIS trial to allow a direct comparison of our results. We recognize that other definitions can be found in the literature and that more recent guidelines of the EAU suggest considering any ISUP grade group 2 biopsy as sigPCa. Incorporating this cutoff, we would have had only one false-positive PET in our cohort on per-patient analysis, but four false-negative PET scans. Therefore, we also give the results using this other definition of sigPCa in Tables S2 and S3 (Online Resource 1).

There is sparse literature on PSMA-PET/CT-guided biopsy. Recently, PSMA-PET/CT was compared, for biopsy purposes, to micro-ultrasound, a novel imaging technique with promising results when added to mpMRI. PSMA-PET/CT yielded an accuracy of 83% versus 61% of micro-ultrasound. No study so far compared PSMA-PET/CT to PET/MRI for biopsy guidance. In our limited experience (anecdotal data not included in present study), delineating the prostate and PSMA-positive lesions on non-contrast-enhanced CT using US-fusion-software is feasible but cumbersome. In a study with 31 patients, sensitivity and specificity for sigPCa of PSMA-PET/CT-guided biopsy was 100% and 68%. The higher sensitivity and lower specificity compared to our study may be explained by the approach to biopsy the prostate area with highest PSMA uptake if no suspicious lesion was reported. This probably led to false-positives, which could be ruled out by MRI but not by CT, such as activity in the central zone. Another study found a region-based sensitivity of PET/CT for sigPCa of 61%, lower than our lesion-based sensitivity (83%). However, patients did not undergo mpMRI so no insights on PET/CT limitations compared to PET/MRI could be drawn. A prospective study showed higher detection rate of sigPCa for PET/CT compared to 12-core TRUS biopsy; however, biopsies were performed within the CT scanner, and again mpMRI was not performed routinely. In a study with 97 patients that compared PSMA-PET/CT with mpMRI, PSMA-PET/CT identified 25% of patients with Gleason 7 tumors missed by mpMRI. Due to their inclusion criteria, around half of the patients that were biopsied had contra-indications to mpMRI or PIRADS 1 or 2; what makes it difficult to compare their results to ours but rather offers nice complementary data. Interestingly, these results are similar to the results found by the same group in a smaller cohort using 11C-Choline PET/CT, with 26% of patients with Gleason 7 tumors detected by PET in patients with negative or contra-indication to mpMRI. Advantages of PET/MRI over PET/CT are that surgeons are already used to delineate prostate and target lesions based on MRI and that they can target lesions by both PSMA-PET and MRI in case of discordance. That a combination of these both methods could further improve the sensitivity for detecting PCa was already shown by Eiber et al. While PET/MRI profits from the higher soft tissue contrast, studies performing head-to-head comparisons are needed to investigate whether this offsets the higher general availability and lower cost of PET/CT. Moreover, post hoc image fusion of MRI and PSMA-PET (from PET/CT) may be a viable option for centers without a dedicated PET/MRI device.

### Comparison of targeted vs systematic prostate biopsy in men who are biopsy naive: the prospective assessment of image registration in the diagnosis of prostate cancer (PAIREDCAP) study [^c396c3ff]. JAMA Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance improves the accuracy of prostate biopsy for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer, but the optimal use of such guidance is not yet clear.

Objective

To determine the cancer detection rate (CDR) of targeting MRI-visible lesions vs systematic prostate sampling in the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer in men who were biopsy naive.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This paired cohort trial, known as the Prospective Assessment of Image Registration in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer (PAIREDCAP) study, was conducted in an academic medical center from January 2015 to April 2018. Men undergoing first-time prostate biopsy were enrolled. Paired-cohort participants were a consecutive series of men with MRI-visible lesions (defined by a Prostate Imaging Reporting & Data System version 2 score ≥ 3), who each underwent 3 biopsy methods at the same sitting: first, a systematic biopsy; second, an MRI-lesion biopsy targeted by cognitive fusion; and third, an MRI-lesion targeted by software fusion. Another consecutive series of men without MRI-visible lesions underwent systematic biopsies to help determine the false-negative rate of MRI during the trial period.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was the detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason grade group ≥ 2) overall and by each biopsy method separately. The secondary end points were the effects of the Prostate Imaging Reporting & Data System version 2 grade, prostate-specific antigen density, and prostate volume on the primary end point. Tertiary end points were the false-negative rate of MRI and concordance of biopsy-method results by location of detected cancers within the prostate.

Results

A total of 300 men participated; 248 had MRI-visible lesions (mean [SD] age, 65.5 [7.7] years; 197 were white [79.4%]), and 52 were control participants (mean [SD] age, 63.6 [5.9] years; 39 were white [75%]). The overall CDR was 70% in the paired cohort group, achieved by combining systematic and targeted biopsy results. The CDR by systematic sampling was 15% in the group without MRI-visible lesions. In the paired-cohort group, CDRs varied from 47% (116 of 248 men) when using cognitive fusion biopsy alone, to approximately 60% when using systematic biopsy (149 of 248 men) or either fusion method alone (154 of 248 men), to 70% (174 of 248 men) when combining systematic and targeted biopsy. Discordance of tumor locations suggests that the different biopsy methods detect different tumors. Thus, combining targeting and systematic sampling provide greatest sensitivity for detection of clinically significant prostate cancer. For all biopsy methods, the Prostate Imaging Reporting & Data System version 2 grade and prostate-specific antigen density were directly associated with CDRs, and prostate volume was inversely associated.

Conclusions and Relevance

An MRI-visible lesion in men undergoing first-time prostate biopsy identifies those with a heightened risk of clinically significant prostate cancer. Combining targeted and systematic biopsy offers the best chances of detecting the cancer.

What are the future research needs?

The past few years have provided important new information on prostate cancer prevention, detection, and treatment. Several key research endeavors are needed to close important knowledge gaps.

Firstly, we need to develop and evaluate novel research methods that can be used to obtain comparative effectiveness data in a timely and cost efficient manner but are adaptive to the incremental technological changes that occur over the lifetime of a study. Such studies may include designs that feature point of care enrolment and use of cohort multiple RCT methods. Recent findings show that RCTs are vital for accurately assessing the benefits and harms of prevention, detection, and treatment strategies.

Secondly, we need better methods for population screening and diagnostic strategies that avoid diagnosing men with clinically insignificant prostate cancer but still identify those with clinically important disease. Few, if any, biomarkers have been identified that could replace or complement PSA. One strategy that could be readily evaluated is the impact of using higher PSA thresholds (such as 6–10 ng/mL) to define abnormality, trigger prostate biopsy, and recommend early treatment. The current strategy of using transrectal biopsy or histologic outcomes from surgery as a means to validate new biomarkers is probably flawed because of the inherent spectrum and selection biases that result. Biomarkers require validation against a reference standard that can be applied to all men at risk. The target condition for detection should focus on clinically significant cancers. Imaging research that allows the targeting (for biopsy or treatment) of clinically significant lesions has shown promise and requires additional study.

### MRI-targeted biopsy cores from prostate index lesions: assessment and prediction of the number needed [^68caff60]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In Europe and North America, prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer in men. Despite advances in PCa imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET), histopathologic verification remains the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis of PCa. Thus, in Europe and North America alone, over 2 million prostate biopsies are performed every year.

Obtaining a prostate biopsy is considered if prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is elevated (≥ 4 ng/ml), an abnormal increase in PSA levels compared to baseline is observed in serial examinations, and if there are pathologic findings in the digital rectal examination. However, to reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment, international guidelines advocate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) in biopsy-naïve men with suspected PCa before prostate biopsy. Even though severe complications are rare, infection, hematospermia, hematuria, and rectal bleeding may occur. Combined MRI-targeted and systematic prostate biopsy detects up to 70% of clinically significant (cs)PCa with a Gleason grade group ≥ 2. The 2019 European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines, which are endorsed by the PI-RADS steering committee, suggest the use of combined systematic and targeted biopsies in biopsy-naive men with intermediate- or high-likelihood MRI findings and recommend omitting systematic sampling in those with prior negative biopsy results. In patients with low-likelihood MRI findings, re-biopsy should only be performed based on shared decision making with the patient. Nonetheless, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines suggest considering whole-prostate mapping biopsies in high-risk patients with negative findings at prior biopsy even if MRI findings indicate low likelihood of csPCa.

### Consensus on screening, diagnosis, and staging tools for prostate cancer in developing countries: a report from the first prostate cancer consensus conference for developing countries (PCCCDC) [^9ecce478]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

When asked how frequently to recommend image tests for all patients with PSA alterations and/or abnormalities in DRE before biopsy, as it can avoid unnecessary biopsy and/or guide a targeted biopsy, the panel reached consensus (79.07%) in voting to always recommend image tests for all these patients. However, when considering the same recommendation in an area of limited resources, only about one fifth (21.18%) of the panel voted to always make that recommendation, whereas most of the panel (69.41%) would make the recommendation just for selected cases (eg, re-biopsy).

Despite not reaching a consensus, most of the panel (70.73%) voted to use prostate MP-MRI (3T) as the imaging method that is indicated for the detection of PCa in patients with PSA alterations and/or abnormalities in DRE before biopsy. When considering an area with limited resources and with no prostate 3T MRI available, the panel split, with more (40.00%) selecting no imaging method and to proceed to biopsy, some (24.71%) selecting prostate mpMRI (1.5T without rectal coil), and others (22.35%) selecting prostate TR-US.

When all complementary investigations are available, the panel reached consensus in selecting prostate MRI (75.00%) as the strategy to be offered to avoid unnecessary biopsies for patients with a PSA level of 2–10 ng/mL. However, if no specific imaging or additional serum or urine-based markers are available, to avoid unnecessary biopsies for patients with more than one altered PSA (PSA, 2–10 ng/mL), with an upward trend, and no clinical symptoms of urinary tract infection, the panel split in recommending biopsy immediately (48.44%) and repeat PSA in 3 months (35.94%).

When asked how the baseline prostate biopsy should ideally be performed, a consensus was nearly reached by the panel (74.42%) in voting for fusion ultrasound-MRI–guided biopsy with ≥ 8 random cores (for a prostate volume of 30–40 mL) and 10–12 random cores for high-volume prostates and 2–3 target cores. However, almost one fifth of the panel (19.77%) voted for transrectal ultrasound–guided biopsy with ≥ 8 random cores (for a prostate volume of 30–40 mL) and 10–12 random cores for high-volume prostates.

### Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging can exclude prostate cancer progression in patients on active surveillance: a retrospective cohort study [^2d184d5c]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Active surveillance (AS) is an increasingly applied therapy option for patients with low-risk prostate cancer (PCa) to avoid overtreatment and thus spare men with presumably indolent disease potential complications and long-term effects. According to current urological guidelines, monitoring of patients on AS is mainly based on serial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and regular re-biopsies which might reveal histopathological tumor progression and induce definitive therapy, if needed. However, a large proportion of patients discontinue AS due to histological reclassification and noncompliance. The reason for histological reclassification in repeat biopsies is mainly the high rate of falsely too low Gleason score (GS) results in up to 50% of the cases in initial extended systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies (TRUS-GB), which used to be the standard method for selection of men eligible for AS and for monitoring. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI) and targeted MRI/US fusion-guided biopsy (FUS-GB) have been shown to substantially improve inclusion of patients in AS as they reduce the number of men with incorrectly diagnosed low-risk cancer that actually harbor clinically significant disease. Results from the ASIST trial revealed that baseline mp-MRI before confirmatory biopsy can significantly decrease the number of AS failures and of tumor progression to higher-grade cancer after a 2-year follow-up episode.

### Screening for prostate cancer: evidence, ongoing trials, policies and knowledge gaps [^5df221ca]. BMJ Oncology (2023). High credibility.

MRI and lesion-targeting biopsy

Use of MRI and lesion-targeting biopsies substantially reduce the detection of Gleason score 6 prostate cancer and somewhat increase the detection of Gleason score ≥ 7 cancer, compared with a systematic prostate biopsy. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 5831 patients from 26 clinical practice studies compared MRI and lesion-targeting biopsies with systematic biopsies and showed a relative detection rate of 0.65 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.77) for Gleason score 6 and 1.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.4) for Gleason score ≥ 7 cancer.

Recently, also data from screening settings have been reported. The population-based Stockholm-3-MRI study randomly allocated 1532 men aged 50–75 years with PSA ≥ 3 ng/mL to either a systematic biopsy only or an MRI and targeted plus systematic biopsies. Gleason score ≥ 7 cancer detection was similar in both groups. Gleason score 6 cancer was detected in 4% of the MRI group in 12% of the systematic biopsy group (8% difference, 95% CI 5% to 11%). Fifty-six per cent of the men with PSA ≥ 3 ng/mL had an unsuspicious MRI and avoided biopsy. Results from the Gothenburg-2 trial are reported below.

MRI has also been evaluated as the primary screening test: the IP-Prostagram study screened 403 men aged 50–69 years with PSA, transrectal ultrasound and an MRI. All men with at least one positive screening test had a systematic biopsy; men with an MRI or ultrasound lesion also had a targeted biopsy. The diagnostic pathway with an MRI threshold of ≥ 4 on the 5-tier Prostate Imaging — Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score resulted in 10.6% positive tests, 2.7% detection of Gleason score ≥ 7 cancer and 1.2% Gleason score 6 cancer. A PSA threshold of ≥ 3 ng/mL resulted in 23.7% positive tests and the detection of Gleason score ≥ 7 cancer in 1.7% and Gleason score 6 cancer in 1.6% of the men. Similar results were recently reported from the MRI Versus PSA in Prostate Cancer Screening (MVP) study.

### Oncological safety of MRI-informed biopsy decision-making in men with suspected prostate cancer… [^395089a4]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, men with negative mpMRI results avoiding biopsy were not at elevated risk of csPCa. The study confirms the oncological safety of the prebiopsy MRI strategy of avoiding an immediate PB after negative MRI results when a programmatic safety net is in place. The same monitoring protocol was applied to men with positive MRI results but cancer-negative immediate PB. Three-year monitoring was considered complete if the last visit was more than 33 months and/or last serum PSA test was obtained more than 30 months after baseline MRI. Men with positive MRI results underwent TRUS-guided targeted and systematic PB using real-time ultrasonographic guidance. Biopsies were performed by the urologist enrolling the participant in the study using a previously reported 10- to 12-core sampling pattern following standard of care.

10, 12 MRI-targeted PB was performed either cognitively or software assisted, based on the urologist's discretion. In men with a PI-RADS score of 4 or higher at baseline MRI and a cancer-negative cognitive biopsy, software-assisted fusion rebiopsy was advised. Among the 41 men who completed the monitoring phase, clinical examination and PSA testing were performed a median of every 6 months and every 4 months, respectively. In terms of clinical examinations, DRE was performed in 38 men at regular intervals, with abnormal findings in 3. Specifically, the MRI pathway prevented PB in 41% of all men and 86% of men with negative MRI results over 3 years, while csPCa was detected in only 4% of men with negative MRI results. Thus, prebiopsy MRI may not only improve cancer detection at biopsy, but also identify men who can safely omit biopsy.

Additionally, both patients and urologists showed a high adherence to the safety net, providing initial evidence for the feasibility of a post-MRI safety net strategy in an everyday setting. Moreover, the high detection accuracy achieved by office-based urologists using cognitive PBs highlights the necessity of expert-level MRI analysis. Second, in most men a cognitive biopsy approach was chosen by the urologists, whereas software-assisted fusion biopsy was rarely performed.

### Screening and detection advances in magnetic resonance image-guided prostate biopsy [^6120e911]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has provided a method for visualizing prostate cancer. MRI-ultrasonography fusion allows prostate biopsy to be performed quickly, on an outpatient basis, using the transrectal technique. Targeted biopsies are more sensitive for detection of prostate cancer than nontargeted, systematic biopsies and detect more significant prostate cancers and fewer insignificant cancers than conventional biopsies. A negative MRI scan should not defer biopsy. Two groups who will especially benefit from targeted prostate biopsy are men with low-risk lesions in active surveillance and men with increased prostate-specific antigen levels and previous negative conventional biopsies.

### Improving detection of clinically significant prostate cancer: magnetic resonance imaging / transrectal ultrasound fusion guided prostate biopsy [^a602ce54]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Given the limitations of prostate specific antigen and standard biopsies for detecting prostate cancer, we evaluated the cancer detection rate and external validity of a magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasound fusion guided prostate biopsy system used at the National Institutes of Health.

Materials and Methods

We performed a phase III trial of a magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasound fusion guided prostate biopsy system with participants enrolled between 2012 and 2013. A total of 153 men consented to the study and underwent 3 Tesla multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging with an endorectal coil for clinical suspicion of prostate cancer. Lesions were classified as low or moderate/high risk for prostate cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasound fusion guided biopsy and standard 12-core prostate biopsy were performed and 105 men were eligible for analysis.

Results

Mean patient age was 65.8 years and mean prostate specific antigen was 9.5 ng/ml. The overall cancer detection rate was 62.9% (66 of 105 patients). The cancer detection rate in those with moderate/high risk on imaging was 72.3% (47 of 65) vs 47.5% (19 of 40) in those classified as low risk for prostate cancer (p < 0.05). Mean tumor core length was 4.6 and 3.7 mm for fusion biopsy and standard 12-core biopsy, respectively (p < 0.05). Magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasound fusion guided biopsy detected prostate cancer that was missed by standard 12-core biopsy in 14.3% of cases (15 of 105), of which 86.7% (13 of 15) were clinically significant. This biopsy upgraded 23.5% of cancers (4 of 17) deemed clinically insignificant on 12-core biopsy to clinically significant prostate cancer necessitating treatment.

Conclusions

Magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasound fusion guided biopsy can improve prostate cancer detection. The results of this trial support the external validity of this platform and may be the next step in the evolution of prostate cancer management.

### A prospective study of magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography (MRI / US)-fusion targeted biopsy and concurrent systematic transperineal biopsy with the average of 18-cores to detect clinically significant prostate cancer [^f599d4ad]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

PSA has been used for PC screening for over 20 years and TRUS-guided 10–12-core biopsy is still a standard diagnostic method as the number of biopsy cores is associated with improved PC detection rates. However, this approach can also detect indolent cancers. The US Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against PSA screening for PC to avoid over-diagnosis and over-treatment, which led to a decrease in the American use of the prostate biopsy. Recent studies have revealed that MRI/US-fusion TB provides higher detection rates of CSPC and is less invasive than PSA-based SB. However, it is unclear whether MRI/US-fusion TB can replace SB. In this study, we compared the detection rates of PC between MRI/US-fusion TB and concurrent extended SB with the transperineal technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to compare MRI/US-fusion TB and extended SB with an average of 18 cores.

### Comparison of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy with systematic transrectal ultrasonography biopsy for biopsy-naive men at risk for prostate cancer: a phase 3 randomized clinical trial [^4c9740dc]. JAMA Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with targeted biopsy is an appealing alternative to systematic 12-core transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) biopsy for prostate cancer diagnosis, but has yet to be widely adopted.

Objective

To determine whether MRI with only targeted biopsy was noninferior to systematic TRUS biopsies in the detection of International Society of Urological Pathology grade group (GG) 2 or greater prostate cancer.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This multicenter, prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted in 5 Canadian academic health sciences centers between January 2017 and November 2019, and data were analyzed between January and March 2020. Participants included biopsy-naive men with a clinical suspicion of prostate cancer who were advised to undergo a prostate biopsy. Clinical suspicion was defined as a 5% or greater chance of GG2 or greater prostate cancer using the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator, version 2. Additional criteria were serum prostate-specific antigen levels of 20 ng/mL or less (to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1) and no contraindication to MRI.

Interventions

Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy (MRI-TB) only if a lesion with a Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS), v 2.0, score of 3 or greater was identified vs 12-core systematic TRUS biopsy.

Main Outcome and Measures

The proportion of men with a diagnosis of GG2 or greater cancer. Secondary outcomes included the proportion who received a diagnosis of GG1 prostate cancer; GG3 or greater cancer; no significant cancer but subsequent positive MRI results and/or GG2 or greater cancer detected on a repeated biopsy by 2 years; and adverse events.

Results

The intention-to-treat population comprised 453 patients (367 [81.0%] White, 19 [4.2%] African Canadian, 32 [7.1%] Asian, and 10 [2.2%] Hispanic) who were randomized to undergo TRUS biopsy (226 [49.9%]) or MRI-TB (227 [51.1%]), of which 421 (93.0%) were evaluable per protocol. A lesion with a PI-RADS score of 3 or greater was detected in 138 of 221 men (62.4%) who underwent MRI, with 26 (12.1%), 82 (38.1%), and 30 (14.0%) having maximum PI-RADS scores of 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Eighty-three of 221 men who underwent MRI-TB (37%) had a negative MRI result and avoided biopsy. Cancers GG2 and greater were identified in 67 of 225 men (30%) who underwent TRUS biopsy vs 79 of 227 (35%) allocated to MRI-TB (absolute difference, 5%, 97.5% 1-sided CI, -3.4% to ∞; noninferiority margin, -5%). Adverse events were less common in the MRI-TB arm. Grade group 1 cancer detection was reduced by more than half in the MRI arm (from 22% to 10%; risk difference, -11.6%; 95% CI, -18.2% to -4.9%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Magnetic resonance imaging followed by selected targeted biopsy is noninferior to initial systematic biopsy in men at risk for prostate cancer in detecting GG2 or greater cancers.

### Prostate cancer screening with PSA and MRI followed by targeted biopsy only [^bb7df34a]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Screening for prostate cancer is burdened by a high rate of overdiagnosis. The most appropriate algorithm for population-based screening is unknown.

Methods

We invited 37,887 men who were 50 to 60 years of age to undergo regular prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening. Participants with a PSA level of 3 ng per milliliter or higher underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate; one third of the participants were randomly assigned to a reference group that underwent systematic biopsy as well as targeted biopsy of suspicious lesions shown on MRI. The remaining participants were assigned to the experimental group and underwent MRI-targeted biopsy only. The primary outcome was clinically insignificant prostate cancer, defined as a Gleason score of 3+3. The secondary outcome was clinically significant prostate cancer, defined as a Gleason score of at least 3+4. Safety was also assessed.

Results

Of the men who were invited to undergo screening, 17,980 (47%) participated in the trial. A total of 66 of the 11,986 participants in the experimental group (0.6%) received a diagnosis of clinically insignificant prostate cancer, as compared with 72 of 5994 participants (1.2%) in the reference group, a difference of -0.7 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.0 to -0.4; relative risk, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.64; P < 0.001). The relative risk of clinically significant prostate cancer in the experimental group as compared with the reference group was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.60 to 1.1). Clinically significant cancer that was detected only by systematic biopsy was diagnosed in 10 participants in the reference group; all cases were of intermediate risk and involved mainly low-volume disease that was managed with active surveillance. Serious adverse events were rare (< 0.1%) in the two groups.

Conclusions

The avoidance of systematic biopsy in favor of MRI-directed targeted biopsy for screening and early detection in persons with elevated PSA levels reduced the risk of overdiagnosis by half at the cost of delaying detection of intermediate-risk tumors in a small proportion of patients.

### Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test-NCI… [^90ddbdfb]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

The current recommendation of the United States Preventive Serves Task Force, which applies both to the general population and to those at increased risk due to race/ethnicity or family history, is as follows:

- For individuals aged 55 to 69 years, the decision to undergo periodic PSA-based screening for prostate cancer should be an individual one. Before making the decision, a person should discuss the potential benefits and harms of screening with their clinician and consider these in the context of their own values and preferences.
- PSA-based screening for prostate cancer is not recommended for individuals 70 years and older. What is done if a screening test shows an elevated PSA level. If someone who has no symptoms of prostate cancer chooses to undergo prostate cancer screening and is found to have an abnormal PSA level, the doctor may recommend another PSA test in 6 to 8 weeks to confirm the original finding.

If the PSA level is still elevated, the doctor may recommend continued observation with repeat PSA tests along with digital rectal exams to watch for any changes over time. If the PSA level continues to rise — especially if it rises quickly — or if a lump is detected during a DRE, the doctor may recommend additional tests. These may include additional blood- or urine-based tests, or imaging tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging or high-resolution micro-ultrasound. Alternatively, the doctor may recommend a prostate biopsy without further testing. During this procedure, multiple samples of prostate tissue are collected by inserting hollow needles into the prostate and then withdrawing them. The biopsy needle may be inserted through the wall of the rectum or through the perineum. A pathologist then examines the collected tissue under a microscope.

Although both biopsy techniques are guided by ultrasound imaging so the doctor can view the prostate during the biopsy procedure, ultrasound cannot be used alone to diagnose prostate cancer. An MRI-guided biopsy may be performed for patients with suspicious areas seen on MRI.
- prevent an unnecessary biopsy among people with an elevated blood PSA
- screen for prostate cancer.

### The smartTarget biopsy trial: a prospective, within-person randomised, blinded trial comparing the accuracy of visual-registration and magnetic resonance imaging / ultrasound image-fusion targeted biopsies for prostate cancer risk stratification [^3ec6a9e1]. European Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

This study, which directly compared transperineal image-fusion and visual-registration biopsy strategies, found no statistically significant difference in overall detection rates of clinically significant PC. Both strategies missed clinically significant cancers detected by the other strategy and so should be used in combination to optimise cancer detection.

The recent publication of the PROMIS trialwill increase demand from patients and policymakers to implement an mpMRI-based pathway given the degree of diagnostic superiority that was shown for this method compared with the standard of care. Moreover, the number of studies that have demonstrated increased detection of clinically significant PC using mpMRI targeting (of whatever kind) compared with TRUS-guided biopsy continues to grow. The recent PRECISION randomised controlled trial demonstrated the superiority of MRI-targeted biopsies over systematic biopsies. Omitting the systematic template biopsy and performing only targeted biopsies may have maintained high diagnostic yield for clinically significant cancer in this trial, and reduced patient and healthcare resource burden. However, the optimal method for targeting biopsies has yet to be defined.

The SmartTarget Biopsy study design had a number of important strengths. First, the paired cohort design (both strategies conducted in each patient) allowed both a comparison of detection rates between them and an evaluation of the benefits and risks of combining the two strategies. To minimise potential incorporation bias sources, we randomised the order of the two biopsy strategies for each patient and reset the equipment to a default setting before each biopsy strategy. A double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial would provide confirmation of detection rate similarity afforded for the two strategies, but a design that also assessed the additive value might be more challenging. Second, biopsy conducted by 14 urologists who were considered experienced by our senior assessors in visual-registration biopsy performance meant that the visual-registration strategy was as optimised as possible, providing a robust comparator to image fusion. However, this factor might have provided a comparison level that may, in fact, not represent performance of MRI-targeted biopsies elsewhere by urologists with less experience. Last, the careful prespecified sample size calculation and subsequent increase assured a sample size that minimised type II error, that is, with sufficient power to detect a true difference in PC detection rates between the two biopsy strategies.

Biopsy procedure and histopathology

All patients enrolled underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided 8–12 cores freehand SB followed by 2–5 TB. The TB was conducted using cognitive MRI/US fusion. All biopsies were undertaken by three urologists with > 10 years of experience. All biopsy specimens were evaluated by a dedicated genitourinary pathologist with > 10 years of experience. The specimens were reported according to the recommendations of the International Society of Urological Pathology. The csPCa was defined as International Society of Urological Pathology grade ≥ 2. Figure 2 shows the examination results of one patient, including mpMRI, biopsy procedure, and histopathology.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^ebe366e2]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Prostate cancer — magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indications and use include that MRI can be performed with and without the administration of IV contrast material, and pelvic resolution can be augmented using a phased array/endorectal coil. Standard MRI techniques can be used for examination of the pelvis and/or abdomen for initial evaluation and as part of workup for recurrence or progression. MRI may be considered in patients after RP when PSA does not fall to undetectable levels or when an undetectable PSA becomes detectable and increases on ≥ 2 subsequent determinations, or after RT for increasing PSA or positive DRE if the patient is a candidate for additional local therapy; MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy may improve the detection of higher grade (Grade Group ≥ 2) cancers. Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) can be used in the staging and characterization of prostate cancer and is defined as images acquired with at least one sequence in addition to anatomical T2-weighted images, such as DWI or dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) images. mpMRI may be used to better risk stratify patients considering active surveillance, may detect large and poorly differentiated prostate cancer (Grade Group ≥ 2) and extracapsular extension (T staging), and is preferred over CT for abdomen/pelvis staging; mpMRI has been shown to be equivalent to CT scan for pelvic lymph node evaluation. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Prostate magnetic resonance imaging, with or without magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy, and systematic biopsy for detecting prostate cancer: a cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [^16885b9a]. European Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with or without MRI-targeted biopsy (MRI pathway), is an alternative test to systematic transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy in men suspected of having prostate cancer. At present, evidence on which test to use is insufficient to inform detailed evidence-based decision making.

Objective

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the index tests MRI only, MRI-targeted biopsy, MRI pathway, and systematic biopsy, as compared with template-guided biopsy (reference standard), in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer, defined as International Society of Urological Pathology grade 2 or higher, in biopsy-naive men or those with a prior-negative biopsy (or mix of both).

Evidence Acquisition

We systematically searched the literature and considered for inclusion any cross-sectional study if it investigated (1) one or more index tests verified by the reference standard, and (2) paired testing of the MRI pathway with systematic biopsy. Quality and certainty of evidence were assessed by the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation, respectively.

Evidence Synthesis

Accuracy analyses: Using a baseline cancer prevalence of 30%, MRI pathway (sensitivity 0.72 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.60–0.82]; specificity 0.96 [0.94–0.98]; eight studies) may result in 216 (180–246) true positives, 28 (14–42) false positives, 672 (658–686) true negatives, and 84 (54–120) false negatives per 1000 men. Systematic biopsy (sensitivity 0.63 [0.19–0.93]; specificity 1.00 [0.91–1.00]; four studies) may result in 189 (57–279) true positives, 0 (0–63) false positives, 700 (637–700) true negatives, and 111 (21–243) false negatives per 1000 men. Agreement analyses: With a direct comparison of the MRI pathway with systematic biopsy concerning significant disease, we found pooled detection ratios of 1.05 (95% CI: 0.95–1.16; 20 studies) in biopsy-naive men and 1.44 (1.19–1.75; 10 studies) in men with a prior-negative biopsy. Concerning insignificant disease, we found detection ratios of 0.63 (95% CI: 0.54–0.74), and 0.62 (95% CI: 0.44–0.88), respectively.

Conclusions

MRI pathway had the most favourable outcome in significant and insignificant prostate cancer detection compared with systematic biopsy. The certainty in our findings was reduced by study limitations.

Patient Summary

We reviewed recent advances in prostate biopsy by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance and targeting for prostate cancer detection in comparison with standard diagnosis by systematic biopsies. The findings of this Cochrane review suggest that MRI pathway is better than systematic biopsies in making a correct diagnosis of clinically important prostate cancer and reducing redundant biopsies and the detection of unimportant cancers substantially. However, MRI pathway still misses some men with important prostate cancer. Therefore, further research in this area is important.

### Prostate MRI, with or without MRI-targeted biopsy, and systematic biopsy for detecting prostate cancer [^67437f65]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with or without MRI-targeted biopsy, is an alternative test to systematic transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy in men suspected of having prostate cancer. At present, evidence on which test to use is insufficient to inform detailed evidence-based decision-making.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the index tests MRI only, MRI-targeted biopsy, the MRI pathway (MRI with or without MRI-targeted biopsy) and systematic biopsy as compared to template-guided biopsy as the reference standard in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer as the target condition, defined as International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade 2 or higher. Secondary target conditions were the detection of grade 1 and grade 3 or higher-grade prostate cancer, and a potential change in the number of biopsy procedures.

Search Methods

We performed a comprehensive systematic literature search up to 31 July 2018. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, eight other databases and one trials register.

Selection Criteria

We considered for inclusion any cross-sectional study if it investigated one or more index tests verified by the reference standard, or if it investigated the agreement between the MRI pathway and systematic biopsy, both performed in the same men. We included only studies on men who were biopsy naïve or who previously had a negative biopsy (or a mix of both). Studies involving MRI had to report on both MRI-positive and MRI-negative men. All studies had to report on the primary target condition.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias using the QUADAS-2 tool. To estimate test accuracy, we calculated sensitivity and specificity using the bivariate model. To estimate agreement between the MRI pathway and systematic biopsy, we synthesised detection ratios by performing random-effects meta-analyses. To estimate the proportions of participants with prostate cancer detected by only one of the index tests, we used random-effects multinomial or binary logistic regression models. For the main comparisions, we assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

The test accuracy analyses included 18 studies overall.MRI compared to template-guided biopsy: Based on a pooled sensitivity of 0.91 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.83 to 0.95; 12 studies; low certainty of evidence) and a pooled specificity of 0.37 (95% CI: 0.29 to 0.46; 12 studies; low certainty of evidence) using a baseline prevalence of 30%, MRI may result in 273 (95% CI: 249 to 285) true positives, 441 false positives (95% CI: 378 to 497), 259 true negatives (95% CI: 203 to 322) and 27 (95% CI: 15 to 51) false negatives per 1000 men. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and inconsistency.MRI-targeted biopsy compared to template-guided biopsy: Based on a pooled sensitivity of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.69 to 0.87; 8 studies; low certainty of evidence) and a pooled specificity of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.90 to 0.97; 8 studies; low certainty of evidence) using a baseline prevalence of 30%, MRI-targeted biopsy may result in 240 (95% CI: 207 to 261) true positives, 42 (95% CI: 21 to 70) false positives, 658 (95% CI: 630 to 679) true negatives and 60 (95% CI: 39 to 93) false negatives per 1000 men. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and inconsistency. The MRI pathway compared to template-guided biopsy: Based on a pooled sensitivity of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.60 to 0.82; 8 studies; low certainty of evidence) and a pooled specificity of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94 to 0.98; 8 studies; low certainty of evidence) using a baseline prevalence of 30%, the MRI pathway may result in 216 (95% CI: 180 to 246) true positives, 28 (95% CI: 14 to 42) false positives, 672 (95% CI: 658 to 686) true negatives and 84 (95% CI: 54 to 120) false negatives per 1000 men. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations, inconsistency and imprecision. Systemic biopsy compared to template-guided biopsy: Based on a pooled sensitivity of 0.63 (95% CI: 0.19 to 0.93; 4 studies; low certainty of evidence) and a pooled specificity of 1.00 (95% CI: 0.91 to 1.00; 4 studies; low certainty of evidence) using a baseline prevalence of 30%, systematic biopsy may result in 189 (95% CI: 57 to 279) true positives, 0 (95% CI: 0 to 63) false positives, 700 (95% CI: 637 to 700) true negatives and 111 (95% CI: 21 to 243) false negatives per 1000 men. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and inconsistency. Agreement analyses: In a mixed population of both biopsy-naïve and prior-negative biopsy men comparing the MRI pathway to systematic biopsy, we found a pooled detection ratio of 1.12 (95% CI: 1.02 to 1.23; 25 studies). We found pooled detection ratios of 1.44 (95% CI 1.19 to 1.75; 10 studies) in prior-negative biopsy men and 1.05 (95% CI: 0.95 to 1.16; 20 studies) in biopsy-naïve men.

Authors' Conclusions

Among the diagnostic strategies considered, the MRI pathway has the most favourable diagnostic accuracy in clinically significant prostate cancer detection. Compared to systematic biopsy, it increases the number of significant cancer detected while reducing the number of insignificant cancer diagnosed. The certainty in our findings was reduced by study limitations, specifically issues surrounding selection bias, as well as inconsistency. Based on these findings, further improvement of prostate cancer diagnostic pathways should be pursued.

### Outcomes and toxicity from a prospective study of moderately hypofractionated radiation therapy for prostate cancer [^ca9828ab]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Methods and materials

This trial was approved by our institution's institutional review board. Patients were eligible if they had biopsy-proven prostate adenocarcinoma. Patients were recruited prospectively into 2 groups on the basis of risk factors. Patients in group 1 had stage T1-T2b, a Gleason score (GS) of 2 to 6 or 7 (3 + 4) with only 1 lobe involved, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels ≤ 10 ng/mL. Group 2 patients had stage T2c, GS 7 (4 + 3), GS 7 (3 + 4) involving both lobes, or PSA levels > 10 ng/mL and ≤ 30 ng/mL. Patients needed to be able to undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan during the initial simulation process to generate a computed tomography (CT)-MRI fusion for optimal target delineation. Short term (≤ 6 months) androgen deprivation therapy was allowed at the physician's discretion.

### Identification of threshold prostate specific antigen levels to optimize the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer by magnetic resonance imaging / ultrasound fusion guided biopsy [^765b9aeb]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Prostate specific antigen sensitivity increases with lower threshold values but with a corresponding decrease in specificity. Magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound targeted biopsy detects prostate cancer more efficiently and of higher grade than standard 12-core transrectal ultrasound biopsy but the optimal population for its use is not well defined. We evaluated the performance of magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound targeted biopsy vs 12-core biopsy across a prostate specific antigen continuum.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed the records of all patients enrolled in a prospective trial who underwent 12-core transrectal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasound targeted biopsies from August 2007 through February 2014. Patients were stratified by each of 4 prostate specific antigen cutoffs. The greatest Gleason score using either biopsy method was compared in and across groups as well as across the population prostate specific antigen range. Clinically significant prostate cancer was defined as Gleason 7 (4 + 3) or greater. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.

Results

A total of 1,003 targeted and 12-core transrectal ultrasound biopsies were performed, of which 564 diagnosed prostate cancer for a 56.2% detection rate. Targeted biopsy led to significantly more upgrading to clinically significant disease compared to 12-core biopsy. This trend increased more with increasing prostate specific antigen, specifically in patients with prostate specific antigen 4 to 10 and greater than 10 ng/ml. Prostate specific antigen 5.2 ng/ml or greater captured 90% of upgrading by targeted biopsy, corresponding to 64% of patients who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and subsequent fusion biopsy. Conversely a greater proportion of clinically insignificant disease was detected by 12-core vs targeted biopsy overall. These differences persisted when controlling for potential confounders on multivariate analysis.

Conclusions

Prostate cancer upgrading with targeted biopsy increases with an increasing prostate specific antigen cutoff. Above a prostate specific antigen threshold of 5.2 ng/ml most upgrading to clinically significant disease was achieved by targeted biopsy. In our population this corresponded to potentially sparing biopsy in 36% of patients who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging. Below this value 12-core biopsy detected more clinically insignificant cancer. Thus, the diagnostic usefulness of targeted biopsy is optimized in patients with prostate specific antigen 5.2 ng/ml or greater.

### The smartTarget biopsy trial: a prospective, within-person randomised, blinded trial comparing the accuracy of visual-registration and magnetic resonance imaging / ultrasound image-fusion targeted biopsies for prostate cancer risk stratification [^8d763cb0]. European Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Key limitation of this study included capping the biopsy sample number to three per strategy, which may have reduced detection rates for both visual registration and image fusion. This limit may also potentially confound an effect of increasing sample number with the apparent additive effect of the two strategies — the increase in detection rate for the combination of the two strategies. A parallel-group trial, which could maximise the number of needle deployments in an ethically acceptable fashion, could further distinguish the role played by each factor. Furthermore, evaluation of only transperineal biopsy may have limited applicability to transrectal biopsy.

Although our study was conducted in a different population and using different methods, our results are consistent with those of others. Wegelin and colleaguespublished a systematic review comparing MRI in-bore targeting with a targeted biopsy utilising both visual registration and image fusion. They showed that each method had similar overall cancer detection rates. However, both MRI in bore and image fusion proved to be superior to visual registration for clinically significant cancer detection, although the confidence that we can attribute to the data was limited by the wide variability in detection rates. Among comparative studies performed in expert centres where skill-based biopsy strategies (visual registration) will be an optimal control, most reports suggest that a biopsy using some form of image registration will approximate expert performance. Wysock et al.demonstrated some benefit associated with an image-fusion system for anterior tumours, but that study was conducted using a transrectal approach, which might have made the sampling of these tumours that were furthest away from the needle deployment subject to some systematic error. In contrast, work by Lee and colleaguesfound that the sampling of transition zone lesions (with the exception of basal lesions) yielded higher cancer detection rates when image-fusion software was used. This difference was attributed to limited registration contouring to the base or difficulty targeting the base on axial views. We found no baseline or imaging parameter that might explain the discordant cases in our study.

Cost is an important consideration but may vary widely depending on both the capital cost of the system and patient volume. A cost-benefit analysis is a complex question beyond this study's scope. However, our results suggest potential benefits of a faster learning curve and higher repeatability that may enable less experienced centres to increase throughput and achieve cancer detection rates equivalent to those of highly experienced centres.

### Comparison of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and targeted biopsy with systematic biopsy alone for the diagnosis of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^456dc9d9]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

The current diagnostic pathway for patients with suspected prostate cancer (PCa) includes prostate biopsy. A large proportion of individuals who undergo biopsy have either no PCa or low-risk disease that does not require treatment. Unnecessary biopsies may potentially be avoided with prebiopsy imaging.

Objective

To compare the performance of systematic transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy vs prebiopsy biparametric or multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) followed by targeted biopsy with or without systematic biopsy.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, clinical trial registries, and reference lists of recent reviews were searched through December 2018 for randomized clinical trials using the terms "prostate cancer" and "MRI".

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials comparing diagnostic pathways including prebiopsy MRI vs systematic transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy in biopsy-naive men with a clinical suspicion of PCa.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Risk of bias was assessed using the revised Cochrane tool. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. All review stages were conducted by 2 reviewers.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Detection rate of clinically significant and insignificant PCa, number of biopsy procedures, number of biopsy cores taken, and complications.

Results

Seven high-quality trials (2582 patients) were included. Compared with systematic transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy alone, MRI with or without targeted biopsy was associated with a 57% (95% CI, 2%-141%) improvement in the detection of clinically significant PCa, a 33% (95% CI, 23%-45%) potential reduction in the number of biopsy procedures, and a 77% (95% CI, 60%-93%) reduction in the number of cores taken per procedure. One trial showed reduced pain and bleeding adverse effects. Systematic sampling of the prostate in addition to the acquisition of targeted cores did not significantly improve the detection of clinically significant PCa compared with systematic biopsy alone.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this meta-analysis, prebiopsy MRI combined with targeted biopsy vs systematic transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy alone was associated with improved detection of clinically significant PCa, despite substantial heterogeneity among trials. Prebiopsy MRI was associated with a reduced number of individual biopsy cores taken per procedure and with reduced adverse effects, and it potentially prevented unnecessary biopsies in some individuals. This evidence supports implementation of prebiopsy MRI into diagnostic pathways for suspected PCa.

### Developments in MRI-targeted prostate biopsy [^443ff327]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

MRI-targeted prostate biopsy may be an attractive alternative to systematic biopsy for diagnosing clinically significant prostate cancer. In this narrative review, we discuss the new developments that have occurred in the advancement of MRI-targeted prostate biopsy, over the past 24 months.

Recent Findings

MRI-targeted biopsy offers enhanced diagnostic accuracy, when compared with the current standard of care of systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS) biopsy, by decreasing the overall number of biopsies needed, maintaining or improving significant prostate cancer detection, and reducing the detection of clinically insignificant prostate cancer. The necessity of combining systematic prostate biopsy with MRI-targeted biopsy is still debated. The use of MRI — ultrasound fusion systems for lesion-targeting is promising for optimizing significant cancer detection, but recent evidence suggests that additional cognitive biopsy cores are still useful in detecting additional cancers.

Summary

MRI-targeted biopsy in selected men with positive MRI offers a number of benefits over systematic biopsy in all men, and as such, may emerge as the new standard of care for the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer.

### Optimizing prostate cancer diagnostic work-up through micro-ultrasound: minimizing unnecessary procedures and reducing overdiagnoses [^f0265993]. The Prostate (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the aforementioned limitations, our data strongly suggest that mUS could significantly reduce the reliance on mpMRI in PCa diagnostic protocols. If widely adopted, mUS could serve as a primary imaging modality, particularly for patients with mildly elevated PSA levels or a family history of PCa. Therefore, we propose a tiered diagnostic strategy where mUS serves as the primary imaging modality for initial patient evaluation, with mpMRI employed selectively as a second‐line tool in cases where mUS findings indicate higher risk or diagnostic ambiguity that requires further clarification. This approach prioritizes referral to biopsy based on a combination of mUS results and clinical evaluation. Such a strategic realignment in the diagnostic pathway could optimize resource utilization and streamline patient management, ensuring that advancements in screening and diagnostic technology translate into more efficient and effective patient care.

### Incorporating androgen deprivation with dose-escalated external-beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer [^d6646545]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

The Oncology Grand Rounds series is designed to place original reports published in the Journal into clinical context. A case presentation is followed by a description of diagnostic and management challenges, a review of the relevant literature, and a summary of the authors' suggested management approaches. The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies, including those published in Journal of Clinical Oncology, to patients seen in their own clinical practice. A 71-year-old man was seen by his primary care physician for routine evaluation in early 2015. On digital rectal examination, his prostate was moderately enlarged, although he had no obvious areas of palpable disease. His prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 7.1 ng/mL. A standard ultrasound-guided biopsy of his prostate revealed a 60-mL prostate volume and a single core (out of 12) of Gleason 3 + 3 disease. He chose to undergo surveillance. Six months later, his PSA level had risen to 10.0 ng/mL; there was still no palpable disease on digital rectal examination. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of his prostate and pelvis revealed two suspicious intraprostatic lesions with restricted diffusion, focal and earlier enhancement with contrast than adjacent normal prostate, and hypointense features on T2-weighted imaging; these findings were highly suspicious for high-grade prostate cancer (Fig 1). Magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy of each lesion yielded a total of four positive biopsy cores of Gleason 4 + 3 = 7, involving 50% to 80% of each core, with perineural invasion noted. The patient's medical history is notable for overweight (but not morbidly obese), hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, cataract surgeries, and inguinal hernia repair, but the patient is otherwise healthy. He has decided against prostatectomy and brachytherapy because of strong personal preference. In particular, he wanted to avoid anesthesia, and was concerned about the potential for greater urinary incontinence and/or urinary irritation associated with these treatments compared with external-beam radiotherapy (RT).(1,2).

Advanced prostate cancer imaging definitions — conventional imaging comprises computed tomography (CT), bone scan, and/or prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), whereas next-generation imaging (NGI) includes positron emission tomography (PET), PET/CT, PET/MRI, and whole-body MRI. Biochemical recurrence is defined as detectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) with a subsequent rise after radical prostatectomy or a rise of 2 above nadir PSA achieved after radiotherapy (Phoenix criteria); in general, a PSA value < 0.2 ng/mL has been considered undetectable, while lower values (PSA ≤ 0.01 ng/mL) have been advocated when clinically available.

### Improved detection of clinically significant prostate cancer with software-assisted systematic biopsy using MR / US fusion in patients with negative prostate MRI [^baacc231]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare detection rates of clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason 7 or above) between standard transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy (TRUSGB) and software-assisted systematic biopsy (SASB) using magnetic resonance/ultrasound fusion in the setting of negative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in biopsy-naïve patients.

Methods

We reviewed our prospectively maintained database of consecutive men that underwent prostate biopsy following mpMRI from September 2015 to December 2016. Patients with no prior biopsy (ie, biopsy naïve) whose mpMRI demonstrated no targetable lesions were included. Patients underwent either TRUSGB (n = 23) or SASB (n = 29). SASB was performing using the MRI/US fusion systematic template. Prebiopsy data were collected, and the detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer was compared between biopsy approaches.

Results

Baseline patient characteristics were similar between the TRUSGB and SASB groups. Clinically significant prostate cancer was found in no patients undergoing TRUSGB and in 6 patients undergoing SASB (0 vs 21%, P = 0.028).

Conclusion

Based on our institutional experience, SASB is associated with a higher detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer when compared to TRUSGB for biopsy-naïve patients with negative prostate mpMRI. Software co-registration of the MRI and ultrasound image may optimize the distribution of biopsy cores allowing for improved prostate cancer detection compared to conventional TRUSGB.

### Comparison of magnetic resonance imaging and transrectal ultrasound informed prostate biopsy for prostate cancer diagnosis in biopsy Naïve men: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b6fc622e]. The Journal of Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging with informed targeted biopsies has changed the paradigm of prostate cancer diagnosis. Randomized studies have demonstrated a diagnostic benefit of clinical significance for targeted biopsy compared to standard systematic biopsies. We evaluated whether multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging informed targeted biopsy has superior diagnosis rates of any, clinically significant, high grade and clinically insignificant prostate cancer compared to systematic biopsy in biopsy naïve men.

Materials and Methods

Data were searched in Medline®, Embase®, Web of Science and Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews-Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from database inception until 2019. Studies were selected by 2 authors independently, with disagreements resolved by consensus with a third author. Overall 1,951 unique references were identified and 100 manuscripts underwent full-text review. Data were pooled using random effects models. The meta-analysis is reported according to the PRISMA statement and the study protocol is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019128468).

Results

Overall 29 studies (13,845 patients) were analyzed. Compared to systematic biopsy, use of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging informed targeted biopsy was associated with a 15% higher rate of any prostate cancer diagnosis (95% CI 10–20, p < 0.00001). This relationship was not affected by the study methodology (p = 0.11). Diagnoses of clinically significant and high grade prostate cancer were more common in the multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging informed targeted biopsy group (risk difference 11%, 95% CI 0–20, p = 0.05 and 2%, 95% CI 1–4, p = 0.005, respectively) while there was no difference in diagnosis of clinically insignificant prostate cancer (risk difference 0, 95% CI -3 to 3, p = 0.96). Notably, the exclusion of systematic biopsy in the multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging informed targeted biopsy arm significantly modified the association between a multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging strategy and lower rates of clinically insignificant prostate cancer diagnosis (p = 0.01) without affecting the diagnosis rates of clinically significant or high grade prostate cancer.

Conclusions

Compared to systematic biopsy a multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging informed targeted biopsy strategy results in a significantly higher diagnosis rate of any, clinically significant and high grade prostate cancer. Excluding systematic biopsy from multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging informed targeted biopsy was associated with decreased rates of clinically insignificant prostate cancer diagnosis without affecting diagnosis of clinically significant or high grade prostate cancer.

### A noninferiority within-person study comparing the accuracy of transperineal to transrectal MRI-US fusion biopsy for prostate-cancer detection [^f69e1052]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We performed a noninferiority, within-person study, comparing the detection rate of csPCa between TR and TP-fusion biopsies. Sampling the index lesion using the TP-fusion approach was found to be noninferior and the 90% CI indicated its superiority to TR-fusion. This was consistent in the per-protocol and in the intention-to-treat analyses. Furthermore, the paired analysis supported this conclusion. Exploratory subgroup analyses suggest that this conclusion was robust across participant and index-lesion derived parameters.

MRI–US fusion biopsies require a multidisciplinary cooperative effort including MRI technicians, interpreting radiologists, image segmentation, and the operating urologist. An error in each of these components may affect the accuracy of targeting.

Our study design mitigated many of the potential biases. The same radiologist interpretation and MRI segmentation was used in both techniques, thus MRI errors cannot account for the differences we found between TP and TR-fusion. The overlay between MRI and US to create 3D-prostate model could potentially include a deviation. However, in our study, we used the same MRI–US fusion system for both approaches, so any deviation error will equally affect both. We also checked for overlay asymmetry and did not find significant differences (data not shown).

In a previous study we demonstrated the effect of learning curve on detection rate; however, the performing surgeon was well experienced in both techniques.

Needle delivery may also have a significant impact on targeted biopsy. Our group showed that needle deflection occurs during TR biopsies. As TP biopsies are performed via a stabilized template it is rational to assume less deflection, however, to the best of our knowledge, there are no in vivo study comparing deflection rate differences between the two approaches.

Our "real-world" population may introduce several biases. First we included many participants with a previous negative systematic biopsy, and only few who were biopsy naive. The anatomical locations of most missed PCa are in the apex, dorsolateral, and anterior prostate segments. These are exactly the locations for which the TP route provides an easier access. Second, including previously biopsied patients may select for patients with lower likelihood of clinically significant disease. Larger, higher grade lesions may be more likely to be detected with both TP and TR approaches. However, in our exploratory subgroup analyses TP was consistently more accurate than TR irrespective of index-lesion location or size, and irrespective of previous biopsy history.

### Comparison of MR / ultrasound fusion-guided biopsy with ultrasound-guided biopsy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer [^2484375f]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Targeted magnetic resonance (MR)/ultrasound fusion prostate biopsy has been shown to detect prostate cancer. The implications of targeted biopsy alone vs standard extended-sextant biopsy or the 2 modalities combined are not well understood.

Objective

To assess targeted vs standard biopsy and the 2 approaches combined for the diagnosis of intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Prospective cohort study of 1003 men undergoing both targeted and standard biopsy concurrently from 2007 through 2014 at the National Cancer Institute in the United States. Patients were referred for elevated level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or abnormal digital rectal examination results, often with prior negative biopsy results. Risk categorization was compared among targeted and standard biopsy and, when available, whole-gland pathology after prostatectomy as the "gold standard".

Interventions

Patients underwent multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging to identify regions of prostate cancer suspicion followed by targeted MR/ultrasound fusion biopsy and concurrent standard biopsy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary objective was to compare targeted and standard biopsy approaches for detection of high-risk prostate cancer (Gleason score ≥ 4 + 3); secondary end points focused on detection of low-risk prostate cancer (Gleason score 3 + 3 or low-volume 3 + 4) and the biopsy ability to predict whole-gland pathology at prostatectomy.

Results

Targeted MR/ultrasound fusion biopsy diagnosed 461 prostate cancer cases, and standard biopsy diagnosed 469 cases. There was exact agreement between targeted and standard biopsy in 690 men (69%) undergoing biopsy. Targeted biopsy diagnosed 30% more high-risk cancers vs standard biopsy (173 vs 122 cases, P < .001) and 17% fewer low-risk cancers (213 vs 258 cases, P < .001). When standard biopsy cores were combined with the targeted approach, an additional 103 cases (22%) of mostly low-risk prostate cancer were diagnosed (83% low risk, 12% intermediate risk, and 5% high risk). The predictive ability of targeted biopsy for differentiating low-risk from intermediate- and high-risk disease in 170 men with whole-gland pathology after prostatectomy was greater than that of standard biopsy or the 2 approaches combined (area under the curve, 0.73, 0.59, and 0.67, respectively; P < .05 for all comparisons).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among men undergoing biopsy for suspected prostate cancer, targeted MR/ultrasound fusion biopsy, compared with standard extended-sextant ultrasound-guided biopsy, was associated with increased detection of high-risk prostate cancer and decreased detection of low-risk prostate cancer. Future studies will be needed to assess the ultimate clinical implications of targeted biopsy.

Imaging algorithm — patients with rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after local treatment and conventional imaging negative for mets proceed by treatment intent: If local therapy not planned or inappropriate, No indication for NGI (next-generation imaging). If suitable for salvage local therapy after previous radical prostatectomy, Consider NGI where available* (WB-MRI, 11C-choline PET, 18F-fluciclovine PET, 18F-NaF PET, or PSMA PET†); if NGI positive, Consider biopsy of accessible lesions, and subsequently Consider mpMRI (multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging) prostate ± prostate biopsy. If suitable for salvage local therapy after previous radiotherapy or ablation (whole gland or focal), Consider NGI where available* (WB-MRI, 11C-choline PET, 18F-fluciclovine PET, 18F-NaF PET, or PSMA PET†); branches include Outside of prostate: Consider biopsy of accessible lesions and prostate-directed evaluation with Consider mpMRI prostate ± prostate biopsy. For men for whom salvage local therapy is an option, there is evidence supporting the use of NGI to assess local or distant sites of disease; PSMA imaging is not currently FDA approved and should thus be only performed as part of a clinical trial or other controlled research setting.
