## Question

Is clobetasol is all a treatment for psoriasis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether clobetasol is a treatment for psoriasis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact drug identity and potency. Then, I should verify FDA-labeled indications across formulations. Next, I will review randomized controlled trial efficacy data. After that, I need to check guideline recommendations and where clobetasol fits in treatment algorithms. Finally, I should confirm safety, duration limits, and special populations before synthesizing a clear answer.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity and potency. Clobetasol propionate is a super-high potency topical corticosteroid classified as Class 1 (ultrahigh potency) in the WHO/AAD schema, which places it among the strongest topical steroids available for dermatologic use [^6a1d328f].

> I will now examine labeled indications. Multiple FDA sources consistently approve clobetasol propionate for plaque psoriasis and scalp psoriasis across several formulations, including cream, emollient cream, foam, spray, shampoo, and ointment, with age restrictions and surface area limits specified on a product-by-product basis, which confirms it is an indicated therapy for psoriasis rather than an off-label option [^e080ff00] [^01ae1413] [^816a3663] [^b6eec357] [^c3974ac9] [^8f5a7e13].

> Next, I should review efficacy from randomized trials. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit. In vehicle-controlled RCTs, clobetasol foam achieved clear or almost clear status in 68% versus 21% with vehicle after 2 weeks, and clobetasol spray achieved 75% clear or almost clear versus 45% with calcipotriene/betamethasone ointment after 4 weeks; clobetasol shampoo achieved 85% success versus 13% with vehicle in scalp psoriasis after 4 weeks, all indicating robust short-term efficacy [^eca97967] [^f1edee7a] [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about long-term use. I need to check guideline positioning. Contemporary AAD-NPF guidelines endorse clobetasol as a first-line topical for moderate-to-severe plaque and scalp psoriasis, often in combination regimens such as weekday vitamin D analogues with weekend clobetasol pulses, and emphasize limiting continuous use to 2–4 weeks to mitigate adverse effects, which aligns with FDA cautions and supports its role as a standard, not fringe, therapy [^d921e9ff] [^e216443d].

> I should confirm safety and duration limits. Super-potent steroids carry risks of skin atrophy, telangiectasia, and rare systemic effects including HPA axis suppression, especially with prolonged use, large surface area, occlusion, or in children; FDA labeling generally restricts continuous use to 2–4 weeks and advises not exceeding about 50 g per week, with pediatric use restricted or not recommended depending on the formulation, which reinforces the need for careful dosing and monitoring [^e080ff00] [^01ae1413] [^b6eec357] [^ff7858c0].

> But wait, what if the question is about maintenance rather than induction. Let me reconsider. Although clobetasol is not FDA-approved for indefinite maintenance, guidelines support intermittent or weekend pulse strategies after induction to sustain remission, and observational and small studies suggest sequential regimens (for example, clobetasol followed by calcitriol) can maintain control with acceptable safety when used judiciously, which is a recognized approach in practice even if not a formal maintenance indication [^d921e9ff] [^5b102e35] [^28640cbd].

> Putting this together, I should double-check that I am not overstating scope. Clobetasol propionate is definitively an established, guideline-endorsed treatment for plaque psoriasis and scalp psoriasis, with strong RCT evidence and clear FDA labeling across multiple vehicles, but it is not the only treatment and is generally reserved for short-term induction or carefully selected maintenance strategies due to potency-related risks, so it is a core option within a broader topical and systemic treatment armamentarium rather than the sole therapy for all patients [^e080ff00] [^eca97967] [^d921e9ff].

---

Clobetasol is a **super-potent topical corticosteroid** [^6a1d328f] indicated for short-term treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and scalp psoriasis [^e080ff00] [^b6eec357], with **rapid symptom control** and high efficacy in clinical trials [^eca97967] [^b571c2ef]. It is not a cure and is generally limited to 2–4 weeks of continuous use [^e216443d] due to risks of skin atrophy, HPA axis suppression, and rebound flares [^6f127219]; long-term management relies on intermittent or sequential regimens with non-steroidal agents [^d921e9ff] [^5b102e35]. Clobetasol is contraindicated on the face, groin, and axillae, and use in children is restricted because of higher systemic absorption risk [^e080ff00] [^930766e6].

---

## Mechanism of action

Clobetasol exerts its therapeutic effects through **anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, and antiproliferative actions**:

- **Anti-inflammatory effects**: Inhibits phospholipase A2, reducing prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis [^8438a337].
- **Immunosuppressive effects**: Suppresses cytokine production and T-cell activation, decreasing inflammation [^notfound].
- **Antiproliferative effects**: Reduces keratinocyte proliferation, addressing the hyperproliferative component of psoriasis [^notfound].

---

## Clinical efficacy

Clobetasol has **demonstrated high efficacy** in treating psoriasis:

- **Plaque psoriasis**: Clinical trials show significant improvement in plaque thickness, erythema, and scaling, with many patients achieving clearance or near-clearance within 2–4 weeks [^eca97967] [^b571c2ef].
- **Scalp psoriasis**: Clobetasol shampoo and foam formulations have shown high success rates in treating moderate-to-severe scalp psoriasis, with rapid symptom control and improved quality of life [^a0c7f665] [^6d6df3c0].
- **Comparative studies**: Clobetasol has been shown to be more effective than many other topical corticosteroids and non-steroidal agents, including calcipotriene/betamethasone combinations [^f1edee7a].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

While clobetasol is highly effective, it carries potential adverse effects, particularly with prolonged use or application to large areas:

- **Local adverse effects**: Skin atrophy, striae, telangiectasia, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, and perioral dermatitis [^b1da2497].
- **Systemic adverse effects**: Rare but possible HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria, especially with prolonged use or application to large surface areas [^b1da2497] [^9e2c28f4].
- **Ocular adverse effects**: Increased risk of cataracts and glaucoma with periocular use or prolonged application near the eyes [^e216443d] [^a1e2c81e].

---

## Limitations and precautions

Clobetasol is **not suitable for long-term continuous use** because of the risk of adverse effects. Recommended duration is typically limited to 2–4 weeks, followed by tapering or alternative therapies [^e216443d]. It is contraindicated on the face, groin, and axillae due to the thinness of the skin and increased risk of atrophy [^e080ff00]. Pediatric use is restricted because of higher systemic absorption and risk of HPA axis suppression; use in children under 12 years is generally not recommended [^ff7858c0] [^930766e6].

---

## Alternative and combination therapies

To mitigate adverse effects and maintain remission, clobetasol is often used in combination with other therapies:

- **Vitamin D analogues**: Calcipotriene or calcitriol are commonly combined with clobetasol to enhance efficacy and reduce steroid exposure [^d921e9ff] [^891e21a8].
- **Sequential therapy**: Short-term clobetasol induction followed by maintenance with non-steroidal agents (e.g. calcipotriene, tazarotene) is a common strategy [^d921e9ff] [^5b102e35].
- **Phototherapy**: Narrowband UVB or excimer laser therapy may be used in conjunction with clobetasol for refractory cases [^3017f259].

---

## Patient adherence and quality of life

Patient adherence is critical for optimal outcomes. Clobetasol formulations such as foam, spray, and shampoo **improve adherence** by offering ease of application and reduced messiness, thereby enhancing quality of life [^7ab24988] [^be2b3707].

---

Clobetasol is a **highly effective topical corticosteroid** for short-term control of moderate-to-severe psoriasis and scalp psoriasis, but it is not a cure and requires careful monitoring for adverse effects. Long-term management typically involves intermittent or sequential regimens with non-steroidal agents to maintain remission and minimize risks [^d921e9ff].

### Clobetasol propionate for psoriasis: are ointments really more potent? [^52035234]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Clobetasol propionate is the most common topical therapy used for psoriasis in the US. Conventional dermatologic wisdom is that ointment preparations provide the highest potency (due to their occlusive nature and moisturizing ability) and are best suited for psoriasis. However, patients often find application of ointment to be messy, raising concerns about both short-term and long-term adherence to treatment. This article reviews the current literature and assesses the relative potency of clobetasol propionate ointment compared to other clobetasol propionate preparations in the treatment of psoriasis. Relevant literature was identified by PubMed and Google searches. We included studies of psoriasis that reported the percentage of subjects that achieved desired efficacy endpoints, as well as studies that reported the subjects' mean change in symptoms from baseline. We excluded studies conducted before 1980 and those that allowed concomitant treatments.

Observations

Efficacy rates ranged from 17% to 80% for the different vehicles: ointment, solution, foam, cream, lotion, shampoo, and emollient.

Conclusions

Clobetasol propionate is a very effective treatment for psoriasis. Ointment preparations have similar efficacy to other preparations in clinical trial situations. In clinical practice, a situation in which patient preferences are more likely to affect compliance, it may be best to choose whichever vehicle patients find preferable.

### A multi-center, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a sequential treatment regimen of clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray followed by calcitriol 3 mg / g ointment in the management of plaque psoriasis [^5b102e35]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Psoriasis is a hyperproliferative and inflammatory skin disorder that affects roughly 2 percent of the worldwide population. Clobetasol propionate is the most common corticosteroid used to treat moderate-to-severe psoriasis but the potential for side effects limits its long-term use. Topical vitamin D, which is used to treat mild-to-moderate psoriasis, has been shown to be safe when used daily for up to 52 weeks. To date, very few studies exist evaluating the use of clobetasol propionate in a regimen with calcitriol to manage moderate-to-severe disease over time.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and assess safety of a regimen of sequential topical treatments with clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray for up to four weeks followed by calcitriol 3 μg/g ointment for eight weeks in the management of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

Methods

This was a multi-center, open-label study in subjects aged 18–80 years with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis at baseline. Subjects applied clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray twice daily for up to four weeks. At the end of four weeks, if the subject's overall disease severity (ODS) was assessed as clear, almost clear, mild or moderate, subjects started treatment with calcitriol 3 μg/g ointment twice daily. Twice-daily treatment with calcitriol 3 μg/g ointment continued for eight weeks (until week 12) or unless the subject's ODS was assessed as severe or returned to the baseline score, at which time it was discontinued. Subjects were evaluated at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12.

Results

Of the 305 subjects enrolled, 170 subjects completed the full 12-week study with no major protocol deviations and comprised the per-protocol (PP) study population. Treatment success, defined as at least one grade improvement in ODS at week 12 compared to baseline, was achieved in 84.1 percent of subjects. The percent body surface area affected (% BSA) decreased from 7.1 percent at baseline to 3.9 percent at week 12 (P < 0.001). The sequential treatment regimen was well tolerated with no unexpected adverse events. Most reported adverse events and cutaneous irritations were mild in severity.

Conclusions

The results of this study indicate that the 12-week regimen of clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray treatment for four weeks immediately followed by an eight-week treatment phase with calcitriol 3 μg/g ointment is efficacious and safe for the management of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

### An intra-individual randomized safety and efficacy comparison of clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray and its vehicle in the treatment of plaque psoriasis [^b571c2ef]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Plaque psoriasis affects about 2% of the US population. A new and unique spray formulation of clobetasol propionate (CP) 0.05% was developed to provide advantages over the currently available treatment formulations.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of CP 0.05% spray compared to its vehicle in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

Methods

A 4-week, single-center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, intra-individual study in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Each of 2 target lesions per subject were randomized to receive either CP 0.05% spray or its vehicle twice daily over 4 weeks. Efficacy parameters included overall target plaque severity score, scaling, erythema, and plaque elevation at all visits. Adverse events were reported throughout the study.

Results

A total of 27 subjects were enrolled in the study. At all visits there was a significant intra-individual treatment effect for the overall target plaque severity (P < .001) in favor of CP spray. Throughout the study, results for scaling, erythema, and plaque elevation were significantly (P < .001) in favor of CP spray. After 4 weeks of treatment, all intra-individual response measures, with the exception of erythema, showed an average difference in severity scores of more than 4 points (based on a 9-point scale) between the lesions treated with CP 0.05% spray and the lesions treated with vehicle. No serious adverse event occurred during the course of the study. One local adverse event at the application site (5%) was considered probably related to study medication.

Conclusion

CP 0.05% spray was effective and safe in reducing overall plaque severity, scaling, erythema, and plaque elevation from the first week of treatment continuing throughout the trial.

### Clobetasol propionate shampoo 0.05%: a new option to treat patients with moderate to severe scalp psoriasis [^6d6df3c0]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic, papulosquamous condition that affects up to 2% of the U.S. population. Approximately 50% of patients with psoriasis have involvement of the scalp. This was a multicentre, randomized, vehicle-controlled, double-masked and parallel-group study. The aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of clobetasol propionate shampoo, 0.05% versus its corresponding vehicle in subjects aged 12 years and older with moderate to severe scalp psoriasis over a treatment period of 4 weeks. Recurrence of scalp psoriasis was assessed during a two week follow-up period. A total of 142 subjects were treated. Results after 4 weeks demonstrated that clobetasol propionate shampoo, 0.05% was with a similar safety profile significantly more effective than its vehicle. The novel short contact shampoo formulation of clobetasol propionate is convenient and efficacious and minimizes systemic exposure while being efficient, safe and well-tolerated in the treatment of moderate to severe scalp psoriasis.

### Clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray for the management of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp: results from a randomized controlled trial [^a0c7f665]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray is available for treating moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis; however, there is limited information with plaque psoriasis of the scalp.

Objective

Evaluate the efficacy, safety, and quality-of-life impact of clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp.

Methods

Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study involving 81 men and women with moderate-to-severe (Global Severity Score [GSS] = 3 or 4) plaque psoriasis of the scalp. Eligible patients were treated with clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray or vehicle spray, which was applied twice daily for up to four weeks. The primary efficacy end point was the GSS of psoriasis of the scalp after four weeks. Safety assessments included local tolerability, presence of Cushing's syndrome, and adverse events.

Results

At the end of treatment, 85 percent (35/41) of patients in the clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray group achieved success (GSS clear or almost clear), compared with 13 percent (5/40) in the vehicle spray group (P is less than .001). The proportion of patients treated with clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray who achieved a rating of clear (GSS = 0) after two weeks and at the end of treatment was 12 percent and 51 percent, respectively. Clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray was well tolerated, and there were no serious adverse events or reported cases of folliculitis or Cushing's syndrome.

Conclusion

Treatment with clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray for up to four weeks is effective and well tolerated for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis of the scalp.

### Impact of clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray on health-related quality of life in patients with plaque psoriasis [^be2b3707]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Psoriasis causes significant distress and impairment in health-related quality of life (QOL) in afflicted patients. For this reason, QOL is an essential and important measure of treatment outcome in patients with the disease. Clobetasol propionate is a super-highpotent class I topical corticosteroid. The spray formulation is approved for twice-daily use for up to 4 weeks by patients 18 years and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Data collected from 2,236 patients enrolled in 5 clinical trials demonstrate consistent improvement in QOL measures using multiple instruments. In a randomized, double-blind trial in patients with scalp psoriasis, treatment with clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray produced significantly greater improvement in QOL compared with vehicle, as measured by the Scalpdex QOL instrument. In another randomized trial in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray produced significantly greater reductions in mean affected body surface area and significantly greater improvements in QOL, as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), compared with a 0.05% foam formulation. When compared with calcipotriene/betamethasone dipropionate ointment, clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray produced greater rates of lesion clearance and similar improvement in QOL scores after 2 or 4 weeks of treatment. When clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray was used as monotherapy or as an add-on therapy for 4 weeks in a large, observational trial, approximately 80% of patients experienced consistent and significant improvement in QOL on 2 separate, validated QOL instruments (DLQI and the Koo-Menter Psoriasis Index). In conclusion, clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray is an efficacious and safe treatment for plaque psoriasis and produces significant improvement in QOL for affected patients.

### Predicting improvement in signs and symptoms of plaque psoriasis after 1 week of treatment with clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray [^793b784e]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

One of the hurdles to effectively managing plaque psoriasis is lack of adherence to prescribed treatments. Up to 40% of subjects report they do not adhere to their medication for a variety of reasons. Earlier response to treatment may be a motivator for subjects to better adhere to treatment. Clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray (CPS) is a highly potent topical corticosteroid indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis that has efficacy as early as 1 week after initiating therapy. Using data from the 2 CPS pivotal trials, a post hoc analysis was performed to determine the relationship between week 1 improvements and week 4 treatment success (defined as a score of 0 [clear] or 1 [almost clear] in overall disease severity [ODS]). Improvements in week 1 ODS and pruritus were predictive of week 4 treatment success. Subjects who had ODS or pruritus scores of moderate or better at week 1 tended to be treatment successes at week 4 whereas no relationship between week 1 scores and week 4 treatment success was observed for those treated with vehicle spray. The results of this post hoc analysis indicate that early improvement correlates to treatment success.

### Topical clobetasol propionate in the treatment of psoriasis: a review of newer formulations [^7ab24988]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Ultrapotent topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of psoriasis treatment, used either alone or in combination with a topical vitamin D analog. Traditionally used in an ointment vehicle for psoriasis, clobetasol propionate 0.05% is also available in spray, foam, lotion, and shampoo formulations, which may provide for improved convenience and acceptance in many patients with similar efficacy, safety, and tolerability as the traditional ointment and cream formulations. To compare newer formulations with traditional ointment and cream formulations, we performed a systematic review of the literature. Search terms included 'clobetasol propionate', in combination with 'psoriasis', 'vasoconstriction', 'vasoconstrictor', or 'absorption' for each of the four vehicles ('spray', 'foam', 'lotion', and 'shampoo'). While there are very few direct comparison studies between clobetasol propionate in different vehicles, the efficacy rates (with success defined as clear or almost clear of psoriasis) for more recent formulations are high, with most patients achieving success after 2–4 weeks of treatment in well controlled clinical trials, with response rates that are similar to those with the traditional clobetasol propionate ointment. Small differences in vasoconstrictor potency or cutaneous absorption have been noted among the formulations, but the clinical significance of these observations is difficult to discern. Recent research has emphasized the importance of treatment adherence in the management of psoriasis. Adherence to treatment is likely to be a far more important determinant of success than are small differences in drug delivery, especially in actual clinical use as opposed to the well controlled environment of clinical trials. For patients who prefer a less messy vehicle, adherence and outcomes are likely to be better with the more recent formulations compared with the traditionally recommended ointment.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Like other topical corticosteroids, clobetasol propionate foam has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The precise mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of topical steroids in the treatment of steroid-responsive dermatoses, in general, is uncertain. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2.

Pharmacokinetics:

Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from intact healthy skin. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion, inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may also increase percutaneous absorption.

Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Due to the fact that circulating levels are well below the level of detection, the use of pharmacodynamic endpoints for assessing the systemic exposure of topical corticosteroids is necessary. They are metabolized, primarily in the liver, and are then excreted by the kidneys. In addition, some corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted in the bile.

CLINICAL STUDIES

A well-controlled clinical study evaluated 188 subjects with moderate to severe scalp psoriasis. Subjects were treated twice daily for 2 weeks with one of four treatments: Olux Foam, Vehicle foam, a commercially available clobetasol propionate solution (Temovate®Scalp Application), or Vehicle solution. The efficacy of Olux Foam in treating scalp psoriasis at the end of the 2 weeks' treatment was superior to that of Vehicle (foam and solution), and was comparable to that of the commercially available Scalp Application. See Table 1 below.

Another well-controlled clinical study evaluated 279 subjects with mild to moderate plaque-type psoriasis (mean Body Surface Area at baseline was 6.7% with a range from 1% to 20%) of non-scalp regions. Subjects were treated twice daily for 2 weeks with Olux Foam or Vehicle foam. The face and intertriginous areas were excluded from treatment. The efficacy of Olux Foam in treating non-scalp psoriasis at the end of 2 weeks' treatment was superior to that of Vehicle foam. See Table 2 below.

### Efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of all-trans retinoic acid / clobetasol propionate compound ointment in the treatment of mild to moderate psoriasis vulgaris: a randomized, single-blind, multicenter clinical trial [^cc6a8124]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

To assess the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of all-trans retinoic acid/Clobetasol Propionate Compound Ointment and calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate ointment in the treatment of mild-to-moderate patients with psoriasis vulgaris. This was a randomized, single-blind, multicenter clinical trial. A total of 240 patients were randomized to receive twice-daily all-trans retinoic acid/Clobetasol Propionate Compound Ointment (treatment group) or once-daily calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate ointment (control group) for 4 weeks. The efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness were assessed at Weeks 2 and 4. After 4 weeks, both groups showed a significant clinical improvement compared to baseline (88.33% vs. 89.83%, respectively, p = .7112). But PASI 75 response in the treatment group was superior to the control group (44.12% vs. 28.57%, respectively, p = .0200), at Week 4. SSRI improvement rate in the treatment group was also superior to control group (67.11% vs. 59.43%, respectively, p = .0119) at Week 4. All-trans retinoic acid/Clobetasol Propionate Compound Ointment showed a significant clinical improvement in erythema, infiltration, and scales of skin lesions and PASI score compared to baseline. 1.67% of patients (treatment group) reported adverse reactions compared to 2.50% (control group) with no statistical significance. In addition, the cost-effectiveness assessment showed a higher cost-effectiveness of the treatment group compared to the control group in 4 weeks (199.25 vs. 801.51). All-trans retinoic acid/Clobetasol Propionate Compound Ointment was effective and safe in the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris with similar efficacy as calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate ointment and lower treatment costs.

### Clobetasol propionate foam, 0.05% [^76e4f3a0]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Clobetasol propionate foam (clobetasol foam), a new formulation of the superpotent corticosteroid, has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. It was reported that the absorption rate of clobetasol was greater from the foam than from the solution in cadaver skin. In patients with moderate to severe scalp psoriasis, topical application of clobetasol 0.05% foam twice daily for 2 weeks induced significant improvement of all signs and symptoms of the disease compared with placebo. Compared with clobetasol 0.05% solution, clobetasol foam demonstrated greater improvement of scaling after 2 weeks of treatment and after 2 weeks of follow-up. The investigator's global assessment rated 74% of patients in the clobetasol foam group to be clear or almost clear (90 to 100%) of scalp psoriasis compared with 10% of the placebo foam group. Adverse events at the application site of clobetasol 0.05% foam were limited to one case each of dry skin, eczema, and skin hypertrophy. Clobetasol foam 7 g/day for 2 weeks induced reversible suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in 3 out of 13 patients (methodology of assessment not provided).

### The use of 0.25% zinc pyrithione spray does not enhance the efficacy of clobetasol propionate 0.05% foam in the treatment of psoriasis [^62f11759]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

It was discovered that Skin Cap (Cheminova Internacional S. A. Madrid, Spain), an over-the-counter psoriasis therapy with zinc pyrithione, contained clobetasol propionate and it was withdrawn from the market by the US Food and Drug Administration review. Some suggested that there might be a synergistic effect of zinc pyrithione with clobetasol propionate.

Objective

We sought to evaluate the efficacy of clobetasol propionate 0.05% foam with and without the coadministration of a topical 0.25% zinc pyrithione spray in treating psoriasis involving sites other than the scalp.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, right/left study of patients with mild to moderate, generally symmetric, plaque-type psoriasis. Patients were assigned to treatment with clobetasol propionate foam on all psoriatic lesions and then randomly assigned to use zinc pyrithione spray to either the right or left side of their body (vehicle spray to be applied to the opposite side). There was a 2-week treatment phase (visits at baseline, week 1, and week 2) and a follow-up phase (visit at week 4), and all treatments were administered twice daily for 2 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline to week 2 in the composite score of the signs of psoriasis (erythema, scaling, plaque thickness) for symmetric target lesions.

Results

A total of 25 patients were enrolled; 24 completed the trial and 1 was lost to follow up. Of those who completed the study, 63% (15 of 24) were men, and the mean age (± SD) was 50 years (± 12.2). After 2 weeks of therapy, the average decline in the composite score was 3.5 (± 1.8) for monotherapy (clobetasol propionate foam and vehicle) and, similarly, 3.3 (± 1.8) for clobetasol propionate foam plus zinc pyrithione spray (P = 0.5).

Discussion

Zinc pyrithione spray does not appear to enhance the efficacy of clobetasol propionate foam after 2 weeks of therapy.

### A randomized, multicenter study of calcipotriene ointment and clobetasol propionate foam in the sequential treatment of localized plaque-type psoriasis: short-and long-term outcomes [^891e21a8]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The merit of topical sequential therapy involving clobetasol foam and calcipotriene ointment has not been experimentally demonstrated.

Objective

We sought to assess the short-term efficacy of twice-daily clobetasol foam plus calcipotriene ointment compared with either agent alone as monotherapy and to compare long-term use of weekday calcipotriene ointment with or without clobetasol foam weekend pulse therapy.

Methods

Eighty-six subjects with plaque-type psoriasis received twice-daily treatment with clobetasol foam plus calcipotriene ointment or either agent as monotherapy for 2 weeks. Subjects in the combination group who achieved remission received weekday calcipotriene plus weekend pulse therapy with either clobetasol foam or vehicle for 6 months.

Results

After 2 weeks, psoriasis scores were significantly lower (P < .001) in the combination therapy group (adjusted trunk lesion score = 0.67) compared with monotherapy with either agent (lesion scores = 1.40 calcipotriene, 1.13 clobetasol foam). During the follow-up "weekday-weekend" phase, after 6 months, weekend pulse clobetasol foam was associated with a trend toward greater maintenance of remission compared with vehicle (92% improvement of trunk lesion vs 62%).

Limitations

Small sample size may have hampered the detection of statistical significance during long-term therapy.

Conclusion

The combination of clobetasol foam and calcipotriene ointment is significantly more effective than monotherapy for short-term treatment. Weekday calcipotriene plus weekend pulse clobetasol foam shows a consistent trend toward greater maintenance of remission.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. section 3. guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with topical therapies [^e216443d]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Topical corticosteroids for plaque-type psoriasis (Table III) can be used as monotherapy 1–2 times daily and can be combined with other topical agents, UV light, and systemic agents; the Stoughton-Cornell classification system divides steroids into 7 classes. For duration, Class I steroids: available data for 2–4 weeks of treatment, and gradual reduction in usage recommended following clinical response; while optimal end point is unknown, unsupervised continuous use is not recommended; for clobetasol and halobetasol, maximal weekly use should be 50 g or less. Short-term results note that highly potent agents have greater efficacy than less potent agents, whereas true efficacy and risks associated with long-term use are unknown as most clinical trials are of short duration; tachyphylaxis, while not demonstrated in clinical trials, may affect the long-term results achieved in a given patient, and combination with other topicals and variations in dosing schedules may lessen risk of long-term side effects. Systemic risks include that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression may occur with use of medium- and high-potency topical steroids and increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and cataracts have been reported with use around the eye; risks increase when used with excessive frequency or duration and it is unknown if there is an increased risk of infection with long-term use. Baseline monitoring: None, with ongoing monitoring including assessment of growth in children using topical corticosteroids for long term and regular skin checks for all patients receiving long-term therapy to assess for atrophy; special populations guidance includes Pregnancy: Category C, Nursing: Unknown safety, and Pediatric use cautions that risks to infants and children may be higher for systemic effects secondary to enhanced absorption and that growth retardation is also a potential concern.

### Yin-yang strategy: proposing a new, effective, repeatable, sequential therapy for psoriasis [^5b054e16]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic disease that exists in two phases: (1) the acute, flaring phase when psoriasis is highly inflamed, erythematous and pruritic and (2) the chronic, indolent phase after the acute manifestations are brought under control. Ideal therapies for psoriasis must focus on both of these phases. Therefore, a rapid and effective agent must be utilized to treat the acute phase, followed by safe long-term therapy for maintenance. This article proposes a new, effective sequential topical therapy for psoriasis using ongoing treatment with clobetasol (Clobex®) spray for one month followed by calcitriol (Vectical®) ointment for the next month. This strategy provides a highly effective, reliable and safe treatment option with minimal local and systemic adverse risks.

### The efficacy of three class I topical synthetic corticosteroids, fluocinonide 0.1% cream, clobetasol 0.05% cream and halobetasol 0.05% cream: a scholtz-dumas bioassay comparison [^6030bd4d]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

This study compared the efficacy of a novel, topical class I synthetic, 0.10% fluocinonide corticosteroid with two other class I corticosteroids and placebo for the treatment of plaque psoriasis.

Methods

A 0.5 gram dose of fluocinonide 0.1% cream, clobetasol propionate 0.05% cream, halobetasol propionate 0.05% cream, and placebo ointment were applied to test sites on one psoriatic plaque per patient (n = 5). Test sites were outlined according to the Scholtz-Dumas bioassay. Test sites were assessed by a blinded evaluator (1 = psoriasis worsened to 5 = psoriasis clear or almost clear), cleaned and medications were reapplied on days 3, 5, 7, 10 and 12.

Results & Conclusion

The three class I corticosteroid products were comparably effective, numerically and statistically, in clearing the psoriatic plaques. Upon completion of treatment, 60–80% of active-treated sites were clear or almost clear of psoriasis compared to zero with the placebo.

### Combination topical therapy for the treatment of psoriasis [^e68c5796]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Dermatological research continues to move toward the goal of developing an effective psoriasis treatment that would rapidly clear lesions and provide long-term freedom from visible signs and symptoms. Currently, topical corticosteroids remain a pivotal treatment due to their effective anti-inflammatory properties; however, potential adverse effects associated with chronic application limit long-term continuous therapy. Vitamin D analogues provide another mechanism of action, reducing lesions through effects on both keratinocytes and on the cytokine environment. A topical combination of corticosteroid and vitamin D derivative appears to provide a balanced approach to psoriasis treatment. The development of clobetasol propionate foam 0.05% (clobetasol propionate foam/Olux) offers a convenient topical corticosteroid that can be used concomitantly, that is, immediately followed by application of calcipotriene ointment 0.005% (Dovonex). This regimen has been shown to offer an increased short-term efficacy compared with either agent alone. Continued application of calcipotriene ointment on weekdays supplemented by long-term clobetasol propionate foam pulse therapy on weekends appears to provide an enhanced maintenance of remission compared with calcipotriene monotherapy.

### Clobetasol propionate emulsion formulation foam 0.05%: review of phase II open-label and phase III randomized controlled trials in steroid-responsive dermatoses in adults and adolescents [^a06bb742]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Clobetasol propionate 0.05% emulsion foam was recently developed for use on multiple body sites.

Objective

We sought to evaluate safety and efficacy of clobetasol emulsion foam 0.05% to treat steroid-responsive dermatoses in multiple age groups.

Methods

A phase II open-label study evaluated the effect of clobetasol foam on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in 52 participants aged 6 years or older with mild-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Cosyntropin stimulation test was used to determine the effect of clobetasol foam on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, with a normal response considered to be a postinjection serum cortisol level greater than 18 mug/dL. Another phase II open-label pharmacokinetic safety study was conducted in 32 participants aged 12 years or older with mild-to-moderate plaque-type psoriasis. Pharmacokinetic parameters evaluated included maximal plasma concentration of clobetasol propionate, time to achieve maximum concentration, and area under the curve. Two phase III, randomized controlled studies assessed treatment success in participants aged 12 years or older with moderate-to-severe AD (N = 377) or mild-to-moderate plaque-type psoriasis (N = 497). In all studies, participants received study drug for 2 weeks. In the AD study, treatment success was determined using a composite end point requiring an Investigator's Static Global Assessment (ISGA) score of 0 or 1, erythema score of 0 or 1, induration/papulation score of 0 or 1, and improvement in the ISGA score of at least two grades from baseline. Likewise, the study in plaque-type psoriasis used a composite end point requiring an ISGA score of 0 or 1, erythema score of 0 or 1, scaling score of 0 or 1, plaque thickness score of 0, and improvement in the ISGA score of at least two grades from baseline.

Results

Significantly more participants achieved treatment success on clobetasol foam than vehicle foam (P < .0001 and P = 0.0005 for each study). Reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression was observed in 27% of participants aged 18 years or older and 47% in participants aged between 6 and younger than 12 years, but 0% in participants aged between 12 and younger than 18 years.

Limitations

The studies evaluated short-term use only.

Conclusion

Clobetasol emulsion formulation foam is safe and effective for treatment of moderate-to-severe AD and mild-to-moderate plaque-type psoriasis in patients aged 12 years or older.

Psoriasis topical corticosteroids — precautions, dosing limits, and systemic effects: Local cutaneous side effects, which occur more frequently than systemic side effects, are more commonly seen at steroid-sensitive sites, including the face and intertriginous areas, as well as in any areas that are treated over the long term; these include skin atrophy, telangiectasia, striae distensae, acne, folliculitis, and purpura, and rebound can occur wherein disease recurs worse than the pretreatment baseline after discontinuation. Systemic side effects, although infrequent, may occur, with the greatest risk when ultra-high-potency or high-potency corticosteroids are used over a large surface for a prolonged period or under occlusion; the continuous use of class I topical corticosteroids should normally be limited to no more than twice daily for up to 2 to 4 weeks and no more than 50 g/wk. Although symptomatic hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression is a relatively uncommon side effect, laboratory evidence is more common with more potent agents, and in two distinct studies, 20% of patients treated with clobetasol ointment (class I) had laboratory evidence for HPA suppression compared to 3% with desonide ointment (class VI). Infants and younger children are at increased risk of local and systemic side effects, all topical corticosteroids are pregnancy category C and of unknown safety in nursing women, and approaches to minimize side effects include transitioning to weaker potency agents after clinical improvement and intermittent usage (weekend only).

HPA axis suppression was evaluated in a clinical trial in adult subjects (N = 24) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis involving a mean BSA of 26.5 +8.6%. Treatment consisted of twice daily application of IMPOYZ Cream, 0.025% for 15 days. Adrenal suppression, as indicated by a 30-minute post-stimulation cortisol level ≤ 18 mcg/dL, was observed in 3 out of 24 subjects (12.5%) after 15 days.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from intact healthy skin. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the product formulation and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion, inflammation, and/or other disease processes in the skin may also increase percutaneous absorption. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are metabolized, primarily in the liver, and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted in the bile.

In a pharmacokinetic study in 24 adult male and female subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis were treated twice daily for 15 days with a mean dose of approximately 3.7 g of IMPOYZ Cream, 0.025% per application to a mean BSA of 26.5 ± 8.6%. On day 15, the mean + SD pre-treatment and post-treatment systemic concentrations of clobetasol propionate were 50.7 ± 96.0 pg/mL and 56.3 ± 104.7 pg/mL, respectively.

### Clobetasol propionate (Olux) [^816a3663]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Olux Foam is a super-potent topical corticosteroid indicated for short-term topical treatment of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of moderate to severe corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses of the scalp, and for short-term topical treatment of mild to moderate plaque-type psoriasis of non-scalp regions excluding the face and intertriginous areas.

Treatment beyond 2 consecutive weeks is not recommended and the total dosage should not exceed 50 g per week because of the potential for the drug to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In a controlled pharmacokinetic study, some subjects experienced reversible suppression of the adrenals following 14 days of OLUX Foam therapy (See ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Use in children under 12 years of age is not recommended.

Azathioprine

Azathioprine is not licensed for HE. One single-blind RCT compared topical clobetasol versus clobetasol plus azathioprine 50 mg/day, with better outcomes after 24 weeks in the group with additional azathioprine treatment. Azathioprine can be started at a dose of 1 mg/kg bodyweight/day orally, increased up to 3 mg/kg bodyweight/day for a minimum of 3 months, and may be used as a long-term treatment at the minimum effective dose.

Methotrexate

Methotrexate is not licensed for use in CHE and no RCTs have been conducted. Two retrospective studies on the use methotrexate in CHE, with a low number of patients, reported 'almost clearance' after 12 months. Hyperkeratotic HE may respond better. A dosage of 7.5 mg orally per week may be started and can be increased to 25 mg orally per week. A randomized, open-label trial in 42 patients with severe CHE (without hyperkeratotic HE) was prematurely discontinued, showed a high withdrawal rate of 57.1%, and confirmed that methotrexate has a high number of adverse effects and is frequently ineffective.

Further Treatments

Although HE is a highly prevalent disease, fewer evidence-based treatment studies are available compared with other chronic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis or AD. As the number of treatments for AD has steadily increased, some of these new treatments may also address CHE, especially atopic CHE. Future studies will investigate their efficacy and will also demonstrate if combination treatments, e.g. with topical glucocorticoids, are necessary and/or beneficial.

### The use of a reliable, ubiquitous, inexpensive, and user-friendly tablet-based system to track target lesion improvements in subjects with plaque psoriasis treated with clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray [^026fff72]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Ubiquitous electronic devices, such as smartphones and tablets, have the potential to enable a fundamental shift in the paradigm of healthcare as these devices may allow patients and health care providers (HCPs) to rapidly and remotely communicate with each other. Once fully realized, these devices may facilitate interactions between patients and HCPs. While these devices hold much promise, much work remains in assessing their viability in various diseases. A pilot study was conducted to investigate the use of a tablet-based numeric rating scale to assess improvements in a plaque psoriasis target lesion treated with clobetasol propionate 0.05% spray (CPS). Twenty-eight subjects with plaque psoriasis enrolled and were treated with CPS twice daily for 15 days. Target lesion severity (scale of 0 [no psoriasis] to 10 [very severe psoriasis]) and effectiveness scores (scale of 0 [none] to 3 [severe]) were recorded using a tablet-based system by the investigator and subjects. The tablet was also used to take photos of the target lesion to capture photographic evidence of improvement. Investigator and subject assessed target lesion severity and effectiveness scores improved during the study from baseline to day 15; in addition subjects indicated a high level of satisfaction with CPS treatment. Very few technological failures were reported and captured photographs were consistent visit to visit and of high quality. Taken together, this study supports the use of a tablet-based system to measure and track plaque psoriasis disease progression and also confirmed that CPS is an effective and safe treatment for plaque psoriasis.

### Scalp psoriasis [^2f15d376]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic, debilitating disease that commonly involves the scalp. Despite a wide range of therapy options, scalp psoriasis remains difficult to treat, highlighting a long-standing unmet need for the safe and effective treatment of scalp psoriasis. Many topical therapies for scalp psoriasis are also difficult or unpleasant to apply, resulting in decreased adherence and efficacy. In brief, the high level of patient dissatisfaction with currently available treatments for psoriasis supports the need for new, effective and well-tolerated treatment options for scalp psoriasis. This article aims to review the efficacy and safety of new formulations and treatment options available to control scalp psoriasis. For example, a new formulation of calcipotriene/betamethasone scalp solution has a rapid onset of action with once daily dosing that improves compliance. The CalePso study examines the safety profile of otherwise established Clobetasol propionate (CP) shampoo 0.05%, and reports that CP shampoo is safe and efficacious in the long-term management of scalp psoriasis. A new foam formulation of coal tar is shown to be cosmetically acceptable and easier to apply.

### Short-term safety assessment of clobetasol propionate 0.05% shampoo: hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, atrophogenicity, and ocular safety in subjects with scalp psoriasis [^5dffde3b]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Clobetasol propionate is known to be a very effective treatment for psoriasis; however, its use is limited by potent corticosteroid class related side effects such as hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression and atrophogenicity. The aim of this single-center, parallel group, randomized study was to assess the HPA axis suppression potential, atrophogenicity, and ocular tolerability of clobetasol propionate shampoo in 26 patients with scalp psoriasis. Suitable subjects were treated once daily for 4 weeks with clobetasol propionate shampoo, to be rinsed off after 15 minutes or with a leave-on clobetasol propionate gel. The study demonstrated that clobetasol propionate shampoo did not lead to HPA axis suppression or to skin atrophy. Conversely, the gel led to HPA axis suppression and a decrease in skin thickness. Neither formulation had an impact on ocular safety. Despite the short contact application time, the clobetasol propionate shampoo provides similar efficacy results to the gel.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Corticosteroids play a role in cellular signaling, immune function, inflammation, and protein regulation; however, the precise mechanism of action in corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses is unknown.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In a trial evaluating the potential for HPA axis suppression using the cosyntropin stimulation test, clobetasol propionate foam, 0.05% (emulsion) demonstrated reversible adrenal suppression after two weeks of twice-daily use in subjects with atopic dermatitis of at least 30% body surface area (BSA). The proportion of subjects aged 12 years and older demonstrating HPA axis suppression was 16.2% (6 out of 37). In this trial HPA axis suppression was defined as serum cortisol level ≤ 18 mcg/dL 30 minutes post cosyntropin stimulation. The laboratory suppression was transient; in all subjects serum cortisol levels returned to normal when tested 4 weeks post treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use In Specific Populations (8.4)].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from intact healthy skin. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the product formulation and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusion, inflammation, and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption. The use of pharmacodynamic endpoints for assessing the systemic exposure of topical corticosteroids may be necessary due to the fact that circulating levels are often below the level of detection. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted in the bile.

Following twice-daily application of clobetasol propionate foam, 0.05% (emulsion) for one week to 32 adult subjects with mild to moderate plaque-type psoriasis, mean peak plasma concentrations (± SD) of 59 ± 36 pg/mL of clobetasol were observed at around 5 hours post dose on Day 8.

### Retrospective analysis of ocular adverse events with clobetasol [^a1e2c81e]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic autoinflammatory skin disease that affects 2% of the population worldwide. Psoriasis has various clinical manifestations, the most common one being plaque psoriasis. When it is untreated, the complications include chronic pain, bleeding, pruritus, and depression. The treatment of psoriasis is often determined by clinical severity of the lesions and the extent/percentage of the affected body surface. For mild‐to‐moderate psoriasis, high potency topical corticosteroids (TCS), vitamin D analogues, and phototherapy are often the first‐line treatment. However, one significant concern about high potency TCS use is systemic absorption, which lead to an increased rate of cataracts and glaucoma, which has been associated with oral cortisol steroid use. Since clobetasol is one of the most used high‐potency TCS for the treatment of psoriasis, our goal was to analyze the rate of cataracts and glaucoma reported to the FDA in association with topical clobetasol usage versus systemic therapies such as methotrexate and adalimumab when used in psoriasis treatment.

Ocular adverse events associated with clobetasol, methotrexate, and adalimumab that were reported to the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) Database were gathered and assessed.

In total, 3466 total adverse events associated with clobetasol were reported to FAERS. Of these events, 19 (0.55%) were cataracts and 22 (0.63%) were glaucoma. A total of 7359 adverse events reported were associated with methotrexate for patients being treated for dermatologic conditions only, of which 140 (1.91%) were cataracts and 382 (5.19%) were glaucoma. A total of 41,737 adverse events reported were associated with adalimumab for patients being treated for dermatologic conditions only, of which 198 (0.47%) were cataracts and 74 (0.18%) were glaucoma.

### Clobetasol propionate — clobetasol propionate — emollient [^b1da2497]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Effects on the Endocrine System

Clobetasol propionate is a highly potent topical corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the HPA axis at doses as low as 2 grams per day.

Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of the topical corticosteroid.

Because of the potential for systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression. In a study including 12 subjects ages 18 years and older with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis involving at least 30% body surface area (BSA), adrenal suppression was identified in 3 out of 12 subjects (25%) following 1 week of treatment.

Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, use over prolonged periods, use under occlusion, use on an altered skin barrier, and use in patients with liver failure.

An ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression. If HPA axis suppression is documented, an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids.

Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids.

Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure.

Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from use of topical corticosteroids [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]

5.2 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids

Local adverse reactions may be more likely to occur with occlusive use, prolonged use or use of higher potency corticosteroids. Reactions may include atrophy, striae, telangiectasias, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, hypertrichosis, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, and miliaria. Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible. Clobetasol propionate is not recommended in patients with acne vulgaris, rosacea or perioral dermatitis.

3 WHAT DIFFERENT TOPICAL MAINTENANCE THERAPY REGIMENS EXIST?

In contrast to atopic dermatitis where topical tacrolimus ointment is approved by regulatory agencies for maintenance therapy, in PsO there are currently no topical regimens approved for maintenance therapy. Consequently, maintenance treatment decisions in PsO are based on clinical experience and on a limited number of studies reporting on long‐term efficacy, safety, and acceptability of select topical therapy regimens, primarily TCS, vitamin D 3 analogs, or a combination of both, applied using a variety of maintenance approaches including continuous therapy, chronic intermittent therapy, step‐down regimens, sequential or "pulse" regimens, and proactive maintenance therapy. These approaches variably meet the goals of long‐term management of PsO as summarized in Table 1.

TABLE 1
Summary of long‐term management regimens (≥ 12 weeks) for the topical treatment of psoriasis

Evidence supports the efficacy of TCS for inducing remission and reducing the frequency of relapses over periods of up to 6 months of continuous twice‐daily treatment (see Supplemental Table 1). However, treatment success with TCS is variable across short‐term studies, and there are relatively few longer‐term studies despite PsO being a chronic disease. Importantly, no severe adverse effects including hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis suppression were reported in trials of patients who used up to 20 g per week of clobetasol propionate ointment 0.05%, betamethasone valerate 0.1% ointmentor fluocinolone acetonide 0.025% ointment with or without occlusion. Continuous long‐term treatment with vitamin D 3 analogs such as tacalcitol and calcitriol significantly decreases Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores within weeks and this effect was generally maintained with continued treatment, without clinically relevant disturbances in calcium homeostasis or other serious adverse effects reported in studies of up to 18 months' duration. There is limited evidence of efficacy for continuous long‐term treatment with topical therapies that are used off‐label in PsO (e.g. topical calcineurin inhibitors); however, studies were generally limited to ≤ 12 weeks and most investigated specific body areas (e.g. genitals and nails).

Topical corticosteroids — efficacy in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for psoriasis — show that for ultrahigh-potency (class 1) agents, efficacy rates vary from 58% to 92%, including an RCT of 279 patients where after 2 weeks of clobetasol foam (class 1), 68% achieved a Physician's Static Global Assessment (PSGA) score of 0 or 1 versus 21% with vehicle, and another double-blind RCT of 81 patients reported 58% versus 15% achieving moderate or marked improvement, or almost or completely clear psoriasis after 2 weeks. For high-potency (class 2 and 3) corticosteroids, efficacy rates vary from 68% to 74%; in a double blind-RCT, 0.25% desoximetasone cream (class 2) for 3 weeks yielded 68% versus 23% improvement, and two RCTs of fluticasone propionate 0.005% (class 3) showed 68% to 69% versus 29% to 30% after 4 weeks. For moderate-potency (class 4 and 5) corticosteroids, efficacy rates vary from 70% to 83%; in scalp psoriasis, fluocinolone acetonide 0.01% oil (class 5) achieved 83% vs 36% after 3 weeks, and fluticasone propionate 0.05% cream (class 5) was superior to hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1% cream (class 7) with 79% vs 68% after 3 weeks. A systematic review revealed that potent and super-potent topical corticosteroids were more efficacious than mild or moderately potent corticosteroids.

### Comparison of clobetasol propionate cream plus coal tar vs. topical psoralen and solar ultraviolet A therapy in palmoplantar psoriasis [^5627bf6c]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

Palmoplantar psoriasis (PPP) produces significant morbidity and requires prompt treatment. Topical agents form the mainstay of therapy. We compared the efficacy and side-effect profile of a steroid/coal-tar combination with topical psoralen and solar ultraviolet A (PUVAsol) in PPP.

Methods

In total, 52 patients with PPP were randomized to receive either a combination of clobetasol propionate cream and coal tar daily (group 1) or topical PUVAsol on alternate days (group 2) for 16weeks. Response was assessed as change in Psoriasis Activity and Severity Index (PASI) and Patient Global Assessment (PGA).

Results

Of the 52 patients, 43 completed the treatment phase. There was a reduction in PASI for the palms and soles in both treatment groups throughout the treatment period until week 16. There was a greater reduction in PASI in palmar psoriasis with topical PUVAsol, and a greater reduction in psoriasis of the soles with the steroid/coal-tar combination. In both groups, patients perceived 'good improvement'. Improvement or cure in palmar lesions was observed in 90% of cases in the topical steroid/coal-tar group and in 75% of cases in the topical PUVAsol group; for the soles, these figures were 76% and 79%, respectively. No adverse effects were experienced with the steroid/coal-tar combination, whereas for the topical PUVAsol, phototoxicity occurred in 22% of cases.

Conclusion

Both treatments had comparable efficacy. In both groups, patients experienced 'good improvement' after 16weeks of therapy.

### Clobetasol propionate cream (clobetasol propionate) [^8438a337]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY:

Like other topical corticosteroids, clobetasol propionate has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid.

Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2.

Pharmacokinetics:

The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by

many factors, including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusive dressings with hydrocortisone for up to 24 hours has not been demonstrated to increase penetration;

however, occlusion of hydrocortisone for 96 hours markedly enhances penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption.

Studies performed with clobetasol propionate cream indicate that it is in the super-high range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids.

### A review of topical corticosteroid foams [^c17b6ebb]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND: Topical corticosteroids are efficacious treatment options for multiple dermatoses. However, ointments and cream corticosteroid vehicles can be cumbersome to patients and may act as a barrier to adherence. Foam vehicles may be preferred by some patients.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical corticosteroid foams.

METHODS: A literature review was conducted using the keywords "clobetasol", "betamethasone", "propionate", "valerate", "topical", "foam", "vehicles", "desonide", and "clinical trial". Thirty-seven articles were chosen.

RESULTS: For moderate plaque-type psoriasis, 68% of subjects using clobetasol propionate foam achieved a Physician Static Global Assessment score of 0 or 1 at week 2 compared with 21% in the control group (P < 0.0001). For betamethasone valerate (BMV) foam, a 12-week regimen for alopecia areata yielded a mean Investigator Global Assessment score of 2.9 compared with placebo (4.6; P < 0.001) and achieved ≥ 75% hair regrowth in 42.86% of subjects. Furthermore, BMV foam cleared or almost cleared 72% of scalp psoriasis subjects compared with BMV lotion (P ≤ 0.005%). For calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate foam, 38.3% of psoriasis subjects achieved treatment success compared with placebo (22.5%; P < 0.001). Desonide 0.05% foam was superior to vehicle foam in pediatric atopic dermatitis subjects.

CONCLUSION: Topical corticosteroid foams can be used for a variety of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses. Topical corticosteroid foams are generally easy to apply and may improve patient adherence and, therefore, clinical outcome in patients who prefer a convenient and less messy topical therapy.

### Retrospective analysis of ocular adverse events with clobetasol [^df1b556b]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

According to the FAERS data, patients treated with clobetasol have an overall low incidence of cataracts (0.55%) and glaucoma (0.63%) as adverse events. Worldwide, the incidence of cataracts is approximately 2.5% in those aged of 40–49 years, 6.8% in those aged of 50–59 years, 20.0% in those aged of 60–69 years, 42.8% in those aged of 70 to 79 years, and 68.3% in those aged greater than 80 years. Globally an estimated 3.5% of people aged 40–80 are diagnosed with glaucoma. When compared to the incidence of cataracts and glaucoma, the incidence of cataracts and glaucoma is much lower with less than 0.7% for both among all reported adverse events associated with clobetasol. Furthermore, patients being treated for psoriasis with clobetasol did not demonstrate a significant statistical difference in the incidence of cataracts when compared to those being treated with methotrexate (0.55% vs. 1.91%, P > 0.05) or adalimumab (0.55% vs. 0.47%, P > 0.05). Patients being treated for psoriasis with clobetasol had a lower rate in the incidence of glaucoma when compared to those being treated with methotrexate (0.63% vs. 5.19%, P < 0.05) and no statistically significant difference when compared to adalimumab (0.63% vs. 0.18%, P > 0.05). A recent review of all case reports regarding TCS associated ocular adverse events by Daniel et al.also supports the FDA data. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on PUBMED, Google, and Cochrane databases using the search criteria: topical corticosteroids and ocular side‐effects, glaucoma, and cataracts. No cases reports of glaucoma or cataracts associated with high potency TCS applied to non‐periorbital area were found (Table 1). Thus, the findings support the understanding that the application of appropriately prescribed TCS to areas other than periorbital skin is unlikely to result in ocular disease.

### Combination of calcipotriene (dovonex) ointment and tazarotene (tazorac) gel versus clobetasol ointment in the treatment of plaque psoriasis: a pilot study [^f1c8fb26]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Both calcipotriene and tazarotene have been shown to be effective in the treatment of psoriasis. No study has evaluated the effect of using both agents simultaneously.

Objective

Our purpose was to evaluate the effectiveness of combination treatment of psoriasis with calcipotriene ointment and tazarotene gel by comparing them with clobetasol ointment, a class I topical corticosteroid. A secondary objective was to evaluate the clinical compatibility of applying both agents at the same time.

Methods

This pilot study was a prospective, single-center, open-label, right/left comparison of 28 lesion pairs in 15 patients. It consisted of a 2-week treatment phase, followed by a 4-week post-treatment observation phase.

Results

All 15 patients completed the treatment phase of the study. At the end of the active treatment phase (end of week 2), calcipotriene- and tazarotene-treated lesions showed nearly identical reductions in scaling (P = 0.93), plaque elevation (P = 0.76), and overall lesional severity scores (P = 0.29) compared with their matched clobetasol-treated counterparts. Erythema improved significantly more in clobetasol-treated lesions (P < .05) during the treatment period, but differences became statistically insignificant during the post-treatment period (P = 0.20). No patients had significant irritation from the treatments. During the post-treatment phase (weeks 3–6), all lesions worsened; plaque elevation returned somewhat more rapidly in calcipotriene- and tazarotene-treated lesions (P < .01), whereas changes in scaling, erythema, and overall lesional severity were not significantly different between the two treatment groups (P > .05).

Conclusion

The nonsteroid combination of twice-daily calcipotriene ointment and once-daily tazarotene gel was not statistically different from twice-daily application of the class I corticosteroid clobetasol ointment in reducing psoriatic scaling, plaque elevation, and overall lesional severity over a 2-week period. There does not seem to be any chemical incompatibility between calcipotriene ointment and tazarotene gel that is clinically significant.

### Clinical studies of a new vehicle formulation for topical corticosteroids in the treatment of psoriasis [^fd5b96d9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids have been the mainstay of topical anti-inflammatory therapy of psoriasis and are available in different treatment strengths or doses and various formulations or vehicles. Traditional formulations have included ointments, creams, and lotions. More recently, the mid-potency corticosteroid betamethasone valerate (BMV) and the ultra-high-potency corticosteroid clobetasol propionate (CP) have become available in a novel, thermolabile, low-residue foam vehicle for topical application. This review examines recent clinical studies on efficacy and safety of these two new formulations, BMV 0.12% foam (Luxiq; Connetics Corp, Palo Alto, Calif) and CP 0.05% foam (OLUX, Connetics Corp), as treatments for scalp and nonscalp psoriasis. The studies demonstrated that BMV foam and CP foam are safe and effective treatments for psoriasis affecting scalp and nonscalp regions of the body. BMV foam and CP foam were absorbed more rapidly and demonstrated greater total absorption than their respective comparison formulations, namely BMV lotion and CP solution. The foam vehicle also appears to be associated with better compliance and improvements in quality of life. The unique nature of the foam vehicle, together with the positive findings of in vitro studies suggest these new foam formulations may expand the options currently available for combination therapy.

CLOBETASOL PROPIONATE- clobetasol propionate spray Alembic Pharmaceuticals Inc. ----------. Corticosteroids play a role in cellular signaling, immune function, inflammation, and protein regulation; however, the precise mechanism of action in corticosteroid responsive dermatoses is unknown. Clobetasol propionate spray, 0. 05% is in the super-high range of potency as demonstrated in a vasoconstrictor study in healthy subjects when compared with other topical corticosteroids. However, similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Suppression The effect of clobetasol propionate spray, 0. 05% on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function was investigated in adults in two studies. In the first study, patients with plaque psoriasis covering at least 20% of their body applied clobetasol propionate spray, 0. 05% twice daily for up to 4 weeks.

15% of patients displayed adrenal suppression after 4 weeks of use based on the Cosyntropin Stimulation Test. The laboratory suppression was transient; all subjects returned to normal after cessation of drug use. In the second study, patients with plaque psoriasis covering at least 20% of their body applied clobetasol propionate spray, 0. 05% twice daily for either 2 or 4 weeks. 19% of patients treated for 2 weeks and 20% of patients treated for 4 weeks displayed adrenal suppression at the end of treatment based on the Cosyntropin Stimulation Test. The efficacy of clobetasol propionate spray, 0. 05% in psoriasis has been demonstrated in two randomized, vehicle controlled clinical trials, which were identical in design. The studies were conducted in patients aged 18 years and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Patients were treated twice daily for up to 4 weeks with either clobetasol propionate spray, 0. 05% or vehicle spray.

What is clobetasol propionate spray. Clobetasol propionate spray is a prescription corticosteroid medicine used to treat adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis that affects up to 20% of the body's skin surface. Clobetasol propionate spray is for use on the skin only.

### Joint AAD-NPF guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with topical therapy and alternative medicine modalities for psoriasis severity measures [^e7e968e9]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Tazarotene topical therapy — efficacy, recommended duration, and randomized controlled trial (RCT) findings. The use of topical tazarotene for 8 to 12 weeks is recommended for the treatment of mild to moderate psoriasis. In 2 RCT of 1303 patients with plaque psoriasis, 40% and 51% of patients treated with tazarotene (0.1% cream and 0.05% cream, respectively) compared with 25% of patients treated with the vehicle once daily for 12 weeks achieved treatment success, defined as overall lesional assessment of none, minimal, or mild psoriasis activity (P for trend = .04). A 12-week RCT showed that the efficacy of tazarotene 0.1% gel for plaque psoriasis was comparable to fluocinonide cream, with treatment success defined as 50% to 74% improvement. Combination therapy data indicate that tazarotene 0.1% gel plus clobetasol propionate 0.05% ointment was more effective than tazarotene gel alone in maintaining clearance after 20 weeks, and tazarotene plus narrowband UVB improved phototherapy efficacy and reduced UV dose needed to achieve 50% or better improvement using a 6-point global improvement scale. For nail psoriasis, a double-blind RCT comparing tazarotene 0.1% cream with clobetasol 0.05% cream under occlusion for 12 weeks found both groups improved on the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index.

### Joint AAD-NPF guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with topical therapy and alternative medicine modalities for psoriasis severity measures [^0f9a8dcf]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Topical corticosteroid safety and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis effects — short-term high-potency use appears low risk: The daily use of ultrahigh- and high-potency (class 1–3) corticosteroids for up to 4 weeks is generally safe with minimal risk of skin atrophy, and in a systematic review of 13 randomized studies up to 4 weeks, reductions in morning cortisol were 0% with halobetasol or fluocinonide, 0% to 48% with clobetasol propionate, and 0% to 18% with betamethasone dipropionate; nevertheless, adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation tests were always within normal reference ranges even when assessed after 6 to 12 months of topical corticosteroid use.

### Ultrasound evaluation of clobetasol propionate 0.05% foam application in psoriatic and healthy skin: a pilot study [^f30f5c66]. Dermatologic Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate through ultrasound imaging the response to treatment of twice and once daily application of clobetasol propionate 0.05% foam on psoriatic skin as well as the atrophogenic potential of once daily application of the foam on healthy skin. The study included a total of 40 participants, 30 affected by Psoriasis vulgaris and 10 healthy volunteers. Patients with psoriasis were branched in two groups of 15 subjects: in the first group, clobetasol propionate 0.05% foam was applied twice daily for up to 2 weeks on targeted plaques, in the second group, it was applied once daily for up to 4 weeks. Ten healthy adult volunteers were instructed to apply the foam to a 4 x 4 cm area on the volar aspect of the forearm once daily for 4 weeks. Ultrasound evaluation was performed in all treated areas using a 20-MHz B-mode high-resolution system (EasyScan Echo), Business Enterprise, Trapani, Italy). At the end of the study, ultrasound showed a reduction of psoriatic skin thickness, with values equal to those of adjacent healthy skin, in all treated plaques. No differences in treatment efficacy between the two groups of patients with psoriasis were observed. As regards the healthy group, no ultrasound variations in skin thickness were observed at the end of the study. Ultrasound imaging, allowing an objective and reproducible measurement of skin thickness, is a useful technique for a noninvasive evaluation both of the efficacy of psoriasis treatment and of the potential side effects of topical corticosteroids.

### Comparison of the effects of pulsed dye laser, pulsed dye laser + salicylic acid, and clobetasole propionate + salicylic acid on psoriatic plaques [^4fffa5c4]. Dermatologic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Studies show that pulsed dye laser (PDL) has some clinical benefits on psoriasis with a low clearance rate. In addition, it has been suggested that applying keratolytics before treatment might be helpful in PDL therapy. Topical corticosteroids remain the most commonly prescribed agents for psoriasis.

Objective

This study was designed to compare the efficacy of the PDL treatment with that of PDL treatment after salicylic acid on psoriatic plaques. The other goal of this study was to compare the efficacy of the PDL treatment with that of clobetasol propionate treatment.

Methods

Twenty-two patients with chronic, stable psoriatic plaques that involved less than 20% of their body were included in the study. Three similar-appearing psoriasis plaques in these patients were selected. Whereas the first plaque received only PDL, the second plaque received PDL after salicylic acid, and the third plaque received clobetasol propionate ointment and salicylic acid. Evaluation of the study plaques was carried out by the modified Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (mPASI) score and by measuring the area of the plaques.

Results

Of the 21 patients, 19 completed the study. Although the decrease in mPASI scores was determined to be maximum for clobetasol propionate + salicylic acid-treated plaques and minimum for only PDL-treated plaques, the decrease was statistically significant in all groups when compared with baseline (p < .003). At the 3- and 6-week evaluations, there was a statistically significant difference between clobetasol propionate + salicylic acid-treated plaques and the two PDL-treated plaques (p < .003); however, the difference observed at the 9-, 12-, and 15-week evaluations was statistically significant only between clobetasol propionate + salicylic acid-treated plaques and PDL-treated plaques (p < .003). When the baseline and 15-week evaluations were compared, there was no statistically significant increase in the mean lesion areas of clobetasol propionate + salicylic acid-treated psoriatic plaques (p > .003), but there was a statistically significant increase in the mean lesion areas of two PDL-treated psoriatic plaques (p < .003).

Conclusion

The results of this study showed that the effect of PDL could be increased when salicylic acid was added to treatment, although there was no statistically significant difference between both treatment protocols. However, clobetasol propionate + salicylic acid treatment is more effective than both PDL and PDL + salicylic acid treatment.

### Combining lesional short-contact dithranol therapy of psoriasis with a potent topical corticosteroid [^225d7bd8]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Since its introduction, the effectiveness of dithranol in treating psoriasis has been unequalled by other topical treatments. Out-patient short-contact dithranol treatment is effective with regard to clinical response rate and relapse rate after 1 year. A drawback, however, is the relatively long treatment duration.

Objectives

To study a dithranol regimen combined with a potent topical corticosteroid with regard to clinical response rate, treatment duration and remission period after clearance.

Methods

Twelve patients with stable psoriasis vulgaris participated in this study. We treated three comparable psoriasis lesions on the extremities for 39 consecutive days. The first lesion was treated daily with short-contact dithranol cream followed by clobetasol-17-propionate ointment 5 days per week. The second lesion was treated daily with short-contact dithranol cream followed by the vehicle of clobetasol-17-propionate ointment. The third lesion was treated with clobetasol-17-propionate ointment 5 days per week. The patients attended on days 1, 4, 9, 12, 15, 18, 22, 25, 32 and 39 during treatment. We assessed lesional severity scores at each visit and registered the baseline area at the first visit. During the follow up at weeks 2, 4, 6, 10, 14, 19 and 23 we assessed lesional sum scores. We also estimated the area involved in recurrence of the lesion as a percentage of the baseline area. The overall differences between the three treatment curves for the treatment period and follow-up period separately were tested with a likelihood ratio test.

Results

Differences between the curves of the sum scores during treatment (P < 0.001) were mainly due to the different time-course of dithranol monotherapy, which showed a slower decrease in sum score. Differences between the linear trends of the sum score (P < 0.001) and the area score P < 0.001) during follow up were due to a different time-course of the combination therapy, which started lower and increased more slowly, suggesting a slower relapse rate with combination therapy. When comparing the follow-up data, it must be kept in mind that the three treatments showed an overall significantly different sum and area score at the start of follow up.

Conclusions

Intermittent addition of clobetasol-17-propionate ointment enhanced the antipsoriatic efficacy of short-contact, high-dose dithranol therapy in terms of clearing capacity and treatment duration, without shortening remission duration.

### Clobetasol propionate — clobetasol propionate — emollient [^ff7858c0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of Clobetasol propionate cream, 0.05% (emollient) in pediatric patients have not been established and its use in pediatric patients under 12 years of age is not recommended. In a study including 12 subjects ages 18 years and older with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis involving at least 30% body surface area (BSA), adrenal suppression was identified in 3 out of 12 subjects (25%) following 1 week of treatment. Four-week HPA axis suppression studies with Clobetasol propionate cream, 0.05% (emollient) in pediatric subjects have not been conducted.

Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of HPA axis suppression and Cushing's syndrome when they are treated with topical corticosteroids. They are therefore also at greater risk of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency during or after withdrawal of treatment. Adverse effects including striae have been reported with inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids in infants and children.

HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include low plasma cortisol levels and absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema.

The use of Clobetasol propionate cream, 0.05% (emollient) for 4 consecutive weeks has not been studied in pediatric patients under 16 years of age.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of Clobetasol propionate cream, 0.05% (emollient) did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious.

### Treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis with alefacept for up to one year: a case series [^856229c2]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Alefacept has an established efficacy and safety profile for 12 weeks of treatment of severe chronic plaque type psoriasis. The effectiveness and safety of longer-term continuous use is not well characterized.

Methods

Fifteen subjects with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque type psoriasis were given weekly 15 mg alefacept injections for 16 consecutive weeks followed by monthly 15 mg injections for up to eight consecutive months, along with clobetasol propionate spray 0.05% twice daily for the first four weeks. Disease severity was measured using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA).

Results

Mean PASI scores improved 33 percent overall during the first month with combination treatment. There was an overall 21 percent worsening in PASI scores after the transition from weekly to monthly medication administration. Of the 15 initially enrolled patients, 27 percent achieved PASI 75 by end of study. No patients achieved an IGA of 0 or 1 by end of study. Two major adverse events were reported: low CD4 count and severe allergic dermatitis.

Conclusion

Topical clobetasol propionate 0.05% was only partially effective at augmenting the early treatment effect of alefacept. The authors did not observe marked benefit or major side effects by continuing additional monthly alefacept treatments beyond 16 weeks of weekly treatment.

### Treatment of psoriasis and long-term maintenance using 308 nm excimer laser, clobetasol spray, and calcitriol ointment: a case series [^3017f259]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that is characterized by thickened red plaques covered with silvery scales. Excimer laser therapy is a cutting-edge advancement in UVB phototherapy. In contrast to traditional phototherapy, the 308 nm excimer laser only targets psoriasis plaques, while it spares uninvolved skin. It allows for treatment with a supra-erythmogenic dose of UVB irradiation. Targeted UVB therapy is a possible treatment especially for many who have failed topical treatments, systemic therapy, and traditional phototherapy. For safe and effective psoriasis treatment, a combination of therapies may be used, including a combination of laser treatment with topical medications. We present two cases demonstrating effective treatment with excimer laser in conjunction with clobetasol spray and calcitriol ointment for 12 weeks. Long-term near-clearance of psoriasis was sustained after 6 months and one-year follow up periods without further therapy.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

In clinical trials with clobetasol propionate shampoo, 0.05%, the following adverse reactions have been reported: headache, burning/stinging, pruritus, edema, folliculitis, acne, dry skin, irritant dermatitis, alopecia, urticaria, skin atrophy and telangiectasia.

Table 1 summarizes selected adverse reactions that occurred in at least 1% of subjects in the Phase 2 and 3 studies for scalp psoriasis.

Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible HPA axis suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clobetasol propionate shampoo, 0.05%.

Endocrine disorders: Cushing's syndrome, Adrenal suppression
Eye: Eye pain, Vision blurred, Eye irritation
CNS: Dizziness
GI: Nausea
Skin: Erythema, Skin exfoliation, Rash, Skin irritation, Hair color changes, Allergic contact dermatitis, Pain of skin, Skin tightness
Other: Psoriasis (aggravation)

### Emerging paradigm shift toward proactive topical treatment of psoriasis: a narrative review [^e180f582]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

An alternative to continuous long‐term therapy involves rapidly gaining disease control with daily topical therapy and then stepping down to less frequent dosing. This approach has been demonstrated effective at maintaining long‐term remission. In scalp PsO, once daily induction with clobetasol propionate shampoo for 4 weeks followed by 6 months of twice‐weekly maintenance therapy was shown to prolong time to relapse by 141 days compared to a vehicle control. Studies involving fixed‐dose combinations of TCS and vitamin D 3 analogs also support a step‐down strategy to maintain remission in patients with stable disease. A large European and Canadian study in patients with scalp PsO demonstrated that twice‐weekly application of Cal/BD gel was significantly more effective at maintaining remission and preventing relapse compared to a reactive strategy (i.e. "on demand" daily application). A smaller study conducted in China compared once or twice weekly maintenance treatment with Cal/BD ointment versus calcipotriol ointment daily for 12 weeks in patients with stable body PsO. The twice‐weekly Cal/BD maintenance regimen provided comparable efficacy as daily treatment with calcipotriol, and both regimens were significantly more effective than once weekly Cal/BD ointment. Patients with limb or trunk PsO who achieved disease control after 8 weeks of daily treatment with Cal/BD gel were randomized to either maintain once daily treatment continuously or as needed, or to twice weekly treatment on weekends for a further 8 weeks in a small Korean study. Long‐term daily treatment used either continuously or as‐needed was significantly more effective at maintaining remission than weekend‐only therapy. It should be noted that this study had a relatively short duration of maintenance therapy (i.e. 8 weeks) compared to other long‐term trials.

### Comparison of skin concentrations following topical versus oral corticosteroid treatment: reconsidering the treatment of common inflammatory dermatoses [^70aac40d]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Topical corticosteroids are often considered to have greater safety and poorer efficacy than oral corticosteroids in treating psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. There are limited data for assessing relative efficacy of topical and systemic corticosteroids, however. The concentration of corticosteroid in skin, adjusted for the relative potency of the active compound, may be a predictor of clinical efficacy and can be estimated for both topical and oral administration.

Purpose

To analyze the assumption that oral corticosteroid therapy should be more potent than topical therapy by comparing relative corticosteroid concentrations in the skin expected with topical versus systemic administration.

Methods

The estimated skin concentration of prednisone following oral dosing was calculated based on data showing 70–100% bioavailability and an even tissue distribution. Data on the concentration of corticosteroids found in skin after topical application were obtained from the literature. The relative potencies of corticosteroid molecules were then used to compare skin concentrations of corticosteroid following topical versus oral treatment.

Results

Data derived from the existing literature demonstrated that hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment, triamcinolone 0.1% ointment, and clobetasol 0.05% foam achieved effective skin concentrations greater than the effective concentration achieved by oral prednisone. Betamethasone 0.1% cream achieved effective concentrations in skin within the range created by oral prednisone.

Limitations

This analysis was limited by the paucity of data regarding cutaneous concentrations of corticosteroids after topical application, and by the differing experimental designs utilized in the available studies.

Conclusion

Most topical corticosteroids have the potential to achieve greater effective drug levels in the superficial layers of skin than those achieved with standard doses of oral prednisone. The apparently greater efficacy of oral corticosteroid therapy may be attributable, in part, to poor patient compliance with topical therapy. Systemic alterations in immune function following oral, but not topical, corticosteroid use may also play a role.

### Joint American Academy of Dermatology-National Psoriasis Foundation guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis in pediatric patients [^930766e6]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric psoriasis — topical corticosteroids usage, efficacy, and precautions are as follows: It is advisable to avoid the use of ultra-high-potency topical corticosteroids in the face, fold, and genitalia of infants and children. Short-term (2 weeks) clobetasol foam had no limit on BSA of application; in patients younger than 12 years of age hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression was found but was reversible, whereas no HPA suppression was noted in patients ages 12 through 18 years. In 11 pediatric patients treated with halobetasol monotherapy for 14 days, ten of the 11 (90.9%) reported marked improvement and 8 (72%) complete clearance at study end; the study recommended limiting use to 1 week, switching to a moderate- or mild-potency steroid thereafter and avoiding use on the face, body folds, and genitalia. The adverse effect profile for topical corticosteroids in children is analogous to that in adults, particularly relating to burning and stinging at the application site. Younger patients ages 0 through 6 years are vulnerable to HPA suppression. High-potency or ultra-high-potency topical corticosteroids should be used with caution, and patients should be followed closely by a dermatologist to ensure proper use and to monitor for overuse and adverse effects. Careful instruction on the amount to apply and safe sites for use should be reiterated, and a limited quantity should be supplied. Providers and caregivers should be aware of the potential for rebound flare if high-potency corticosteroids are abruptly discontinued without transition to an appropriate alternative treatment.

### Molecular signatures order the potency of topically applied anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with atopic dermatitis [^28903974]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Atopic dermatitis (AD) presents a large unmet need for treatments with better safety and efficacy. To facilitate development of topical therapeutics, we need an efficient model for assessing different formulations and concentrations. The "plaque model" has been successfully implemented in patients with psoriasis, another common inflammatory disease, to assess the efficacy of topical treatments. This model has not been validated for AD, which has higher placebo responses and less stable lesions than psoriasis.

Objective

We aimed to assess changes in molecular signatures of intrapatient target lesions treated with topical therapeutics.

Methods

We enrolled 30 patients with mild-to-moderate AD in a randomized, double-blind, intraindividual comparison of 3 approved agents applied blindly at the investigator site daily for 14 days: pimecrolimus, betamethasone dipropionate, clobetasol propionate, and a vehicle/emollient control. Changes in total sign scores (TSSs), transepidermal water loss, and tissue biomarkers (determined by using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry) were evaluated.

Results

TSSs showed improvements of 30%, 40%, 68%, and 76% at 2 weeks with vehicle, pimecrolimus, betamethasone, and clobetasol, respectively, with parallel changes in transepidermal water loss (P < .05). Significant differences versus vehicle values were limited to steroids (P < .0001). Steroids (particularly clobetasol) restored epidermal hyperplasia and terminal differentiation versus minimal changes with vehicle or pimecrolimus (P < .001). Levels of cellular infiltrates and cytokines (IL-13, IL-22, and S100As) were similarly reduced only by steroids (P < .001). TSS improvement correlated with changes in hyperplasia, infiltrates, and differentiation markers.

Conclusion

We detected significant clinical and tissue differences between agents, providing a novel approach to study the differential effects of topical formulations using a limited sample size.

### Clobetasol propionate ointment, 0.05% (clobetasol propionate) [^e589f0dc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Like other topical corticosteroids, clobetasol propionate has anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of the topical steroids, in general, is unclear. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released frommembrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2.

Pharmacokinetics: The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors, including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier. Occlusive dressing with hydrocortisone for up to 24 hours has not been demonstrated to increase penetration; however, occlusion of hydrocortisone for 96 hours markedly enhances penetration. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption.

Studies performed with clobetasol propionate ointment indicate that it is in the super-high range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids.

### Clobetasol propionate gel (Clobetasol propionate) [^ec305d60]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

In a controlled trial with clobetasol propionate gel, 0.05%, the only reported adverse reaction that was considered to be drug related was a report of burning sensation (1.8% of treated patients).

In larger controlled clinical trials with other clobetasol propionate formulations, the most frequently reported adverse reactions have included burning, stinging, irritation, pruritus, erythema, folliculitis, cracking and fissuring of the skin, numbness of fingers, skin atrophy, and telangiectasia (all less than 2%).

Cushing's syndrome has been reported in infants and adults as a result of prolonged use of topical clobetasol propionate formulations.

The following additional local adverse reactions are reported infrequently with topical corticosteroids, but may occur more frequently with super-high potency corticosteroids such as Clobetasol Propionate Gel, 0.05%. These reactions are listed in approximate decreasing order of occurrence: dryness, hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, irritation, striae, and miliaria.

### Efficacy of novel topical liposomal formulation of cyclosporine in mild to moderate stable plaque psoriasis: a randomized clinical trial [^59ea28ae]. JAMA Dermatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Attempts to use topical cyclosporine in treatment of psoriasis have failed because of unfavorable physicochemical properties and inappropriate formulation design of the conventional dosage forms.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of topical cyclosporine using liposomal nanocarriers (lipogel) in limited chronic plaque psoriasis.

Design, Setting, and, Participants

A single-center randomized clinical trial was conducted using a 3-arm parallel group, double-blind, vehicle and active comparator design and included 38 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis measuring less than or equal to 100 cm2 performed in a tertiary care hospital.

Interventions

In the first arm, a total of 24 patients were randomized to receive either cyclosporine lipogel, 2.0% weight by weight (w/w), or placebo lipogel. In the second arm, 7 patients were randomized to receive cyclosporine lipogel, 2.0%, or conventional cyclosporine cream, 2.0% w/w. The third arm comprised 7 patients randomized with cyclosporine lipogel, 2.0% or standard clobetasol propionate cream, 0.05% w/w. Patients were examined twice weekly for 14 weeks, or until total lesional clearance was observed, whichever was earlier.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome measure was the dermatological sum score (DSS) assessing erythema, scaling, and plaque elevation on a 4-point scale (0, absent; 1, minimal; 2, moderate; 3, severe).

Results

In 38 patients (23 men and 15 women with a mean [SD] age range from 35 [8] to 40 [13] years), a 19% decrease in DSS score from a mean (SD) of 8.45 (0.67) to 6.82 (0.77) compared with baseline was observed after 2 weeks of treatment with cyclosporine lipogel, 2.0% w/w (P < .001; 95% CI, 13.77–24.51) in 59% of psoriasis lesional sites. At the end of the eighth week, a significant reduction (approximately 83%) in DSS was seen in all sites treated with cyclosporine lipogel, (P < .001; 95% CI, 77.48–88.22). At the end of the study period, complete clearance (ie, DSS = 0) was observed in 16 (41%) psoriasis lesional sites treated with cyclosporine lipogel, 85.7% of sites treated with clobetasol propionate cream, and none of the sites treated with conventional cyclosporine cream or placebo gel.

Conclusions and Relevance

Topical liposomal formulation of cyclosporine, 2.0% w/w, is effective in treatment of limited chronic plaque psoriasis with a satisfactory safety profile. Future clinical trials should assess liposomal cyclosporine in larger study populations.

### Clobetasol propionate (Olux) [^a2df6baf]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

In a controlled pharmacokinetic study, 5 of 13 subjects experienced reversible suppression of the adrenals at any time during the 14 days of Olux Foam therapy to at least 20% of the body surface area. Of the 13 subjects studied, 1 of 9 with psoriasis were suppressed after 14 days and all 4 of the subjects with atopic dermatitis had abnormal cortisol levels indicative of adrenal suppression at some time after starting therapy with Olux Foam. (See Table 3 below.)

Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible adrenal suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients (see PRECAUTIONS).

In a controlled clinical trial (188 subjects) with Olux Foam in subjects with psoriasis of the scalp, there were no localized scalp adverse reactions reported in the Olux Foam treated subjects. In two controlled clinical trials (360 subjects) with Olux Foam in subjects with psoriasis of non-scalp regions, localized adverse events that occurred in the Olux Foam treated subjects included application site burning (10%), application site dryness (< 1%), and other application site reactions (4%).

In larger controlled trials with other clobetasol propionate formulations, the most frequently reported local adverse reactions have included burning, stinging, irritation, pruritus, erythema, folliculitis, cracking and fissuring of the skin, numbness of the fingers, skin atrophy, and telangiectasia (all less than 2%).

The following additional local adverse reactions have been reported with topical corticosteroids, but they may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency corticosteroids such as Olux Foam. These reactions are listed in an approximate decreasing order of occurrence: dryness, hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, maceration of the skin, secondary infection, striae, and miliaria.

### Topical desoximetasone 0.25% spray and its vehicle have little potential for irritation or sensitization [^b04f1c5a]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND: Topical corticosteroids are the most common dermatologic medications and are available in numerous different vehicles. Adherence is limited by traditional vehicles because they are messy and time consuming to apply. The preferred spray formulations have the advantage of being applied with ease, resulting in improved adherence and subsequently improved psoriasis. One limitation of topical treatments, especially spray vehicles, is the potential for irritation and sensitization. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the irritation and sensitization potential of topical desoximetasone spray formulation. METHODS: A multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, controlled study assessed the irritancy and sensitization of 0.25% and 0.05% topical desoximetasone spray. Controls included vehicle, a positive control (0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate), negative control (0.9% saline), and an active comparator control (clobetasol spray). The primary outcome of the study was to evaluate the difference in mean cumulative irritation and potential sensitization response of desoximetasone 0.25% and 0.05% topical sprays. RESULTS: Of the 297 enrolled, 269 completed the study per protocol for the irritation phase and 250 completed the protocol for the sensitization phase. At 22 days, desoximetasone 0.25 and 0.5% spray were less irritating than clobetasol 0.05% spray; mean irritation score difference of -0.46 and -0.57, respectively. Median total irritation score over the 22 days was 0 for all products. No subjects demonstrated any sensitization reaction to any of the six products. No serious adverse reactions were reported. LIMITATIONS: Selection bias, use of a healthy population, limits the external validity. In addition, the duration of the study was short lived, unlike numerous inflammatory skin diseases.

Conclusions

Desoximetasone spray has little potential for irritation or sensitization. The availability of another spray option for patients desiring less messy treatment may facilitate better adherence and treatment outcomes. <em> J Drugs Dermatol. 2017;16(8):755–758. </em>.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

In controlled clinical trials involving 821 subjects exposed to clobetasol propionate foam, 0.05% (emulsion) and vehicle foam, the pooled incidence of local adverse reactions in trials for atopic dermatitis and psoriasis with clobetasol propionate foam, 0.05% (emulsion) was 1.9% for application site atrophy and 1.6% for application site reaction. Most local adverse events were rated as mild to moderate and they were not affected by age, race, or gender.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of clobetasol formulations: erythema, pruritus, burning, alopecia, and dryness.

The following additional local adverse reactions have been reported with topical corticosteroids: folliculitis, acneiform eruptions, hypopigmentation, perioral dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, secondary infection, irritation, striae, and miliaria. They may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency corticosteroids, such as clobetasol propionate.

Cushing's syndrome has been reported in infants and adults as a result of prolonged use of topical clobetasol propionate formulations.

Ophthalmic adverse reactions may include cataracts, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and central serous chorioretinopathy.

### Clobetasol propionate (Impoyz) [^9e2c28f4]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Effects on the Endocrine System

IMPOYZ Cream can cause reversible hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency. This may occur during treatment or after withdrawal of treatment. Because of the potential of systemic absorption, use of topical corticosteroids, including IMPOYZ Cream, may require that patients be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. Factors that predispose a patient to HPA axis suppression include the use of high-potency steroids, large treatment surface areas, prolonged use, use of occlusive dressings, altered skin barrier, liver failure, and young age.

Evaluation for HPA axis suppression may be done by using the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. In a trial evaluating the effects of IMPOYZ Cream on the HPA axis, subjects with plaque psoriasis applied IMPOYZ Cream twice daily to at least 20% of involved Body Surface Area (BSA) for 15 days. Abnormal ACTH stimulation tests suggestive of HPA axis suppression were seen in 3 of 24 (12.5%) subjects on IMPOYZ Cream [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. In another trial to evaluate the effects of IMPOYZ Cream on the HPA axis, subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis applied IMPOYZ Cream twice daily to at least 25% of involved BSA for 28 consecutive days. Abnormal ACTH stimulation test suggestive of HPA axis suppression was seen in 8 of 26 (30.8%) of subjects on IMPOYZ Cream.

If HPA axis suppression is documented, gradually withdraw the drug, reduce the frequency of application, or substitute with a less potent corticosteroid. If signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal occur, supplemental systemic corticosteroids may be required. Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids.

Systemic effects of topical corticosteroids may also manifest as Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria. These complications are rare and generally occur after prolonged exposure to larger than recommended doses, particularly with high-potency topical corticosteroids.

Use of more than one corticosteroid-containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic exposure to topical corticosteroids.

Minimize the unwanted risks from endocrine effects by mitigating risk factors favoring increased systemic bioavailability and by using the product as recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity because of their larger skin surface to body mass ratios [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

### The influence of a topical corticosteroid on short-contact high-dose dithranol therapy [^a73244f4]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Dithranol (anthralin) has been known to be effective in the treatment of psoriasis for more than 80 years. However, perilesional and uninvolved skin often show irritation during dithranol treatment, which limits its use. As the relapse rate of psoriasis is worsened by adding corticosteroids to a dithranol regimen, the use of topical corticosteroids to reduce dithranol irritation is controversial.

Objectives

The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical and cell biological effect of clobetasol-17-propionate 0.05% ointment on dithranol-treated lesional and perilesional skin.

Methods

For 17 consecutive days, 2% dithranol cream was applied on two test sites. A third site was left untreated on all participating patients (n = 8). All sites consisted of a psoriasis lesion as well as a 3-cm zone of perilesional skin localized on the back. After 1 h, the cream was washed off, and subsequently one of the dithranol-treated sites was treated once a day with clobetasol-17-propionate 0.05% ointment. The second site was treated once daily with the vehicle. On day 17, punch biopsies were taken from all three lesions and from the perilesional zone of all test sites in order to perform an immunohistochemical investigation, using markers to assess proliferation, differentiation and inflammation.

Results

The SUM score (erythema + induration + scaling) of the lesion treated with dithranol/clobetasol showed a pronounced reduction, which was significantly greater than the SUM score of the lesion treated with dithranol/vehicle. However, the scores of both sites were equal by 6 weeks of follow-up. Comparing the two treated lesions, we observed a lower number of cycling epidermal cells in the dithranol/clobetasol lesion and a significantly lower perivascular dermal score of T lymphocytes. Comparing the perilesional skin of the two treated sites we observed less cycling epidermal cells in the dithranol/clobetasol-treated site. Regarding perilesional differentiation, the interpapillary involucrin expression was higher in the dithranol/clobetasol-treated site. With respect to perilesional inflammation the expression of dermal polymorphonuclear leucocytes, monocytes, macrophages and T lymphocytes in the dermal infiltrate were significantly lower in the dithranol/clobetasol-treated site.

Conclusions

The addition of clobetasol-17-propionate enhanced the antipsoriatic efficacy of dithranol by interfering with T-cell accumulation and epidermal proliferation. The addition of a corticosteroid reduced perilesional dithranol inflammation at the cellular level, although clinically detectable dithranol erythema was not reduced.

8.3 Nursing Mothers

Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when CLOBEX Shampoo, 0.05%, is administered to a nursing woman.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Use of CLOBEX Shampoo, 0.05%, in patients under 18 years old is not recommended due to potential for HPA axis suppression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

The effect of CLOBEX (clobetasol propionate) Shampoo, 0.05%, on HPA axis suppression was evaluated in one trial in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age with moderate to severe scalp psoriasis with involvement of at least 25% of the scalp. In this trial, 5 of 12 evaluable subjects developed suppression of their HPA axis following 4 weeks of treatment with CLOBEX (clobetasol propionate) Shampoo, 0.05%, applied once daily for 15 minutes to a dry scalp before lathering and rinsing. Only 1 of the 5 subjects who had suppression was tested for recovery of HPA axis, and this subject recovered after 2 weeks.

No studies have been performed in patients under the age of 12. Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass, pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of HPA axis suppression and Cushing's syndrome when they are treated with topical corticosteroids. They are therefore also at greater risk of adrenal insufficiency during and/or after withdrawal of treatment. Adverse effects including striae have been reported with inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids in infants and children. Therefore, use is not recommended in patients under the age of 18.

HPA axis suppression, Cushing's syndrome, linear growth retardation, delayed weight gain, and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include low plasma cortisol levels and an absence of response to ACTH stimulation. Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles, headaches, and bilateral papilledema.

### The evolving role of therapeutic shampoos for targeting symptoms of inflammatory scalp disorders [^8a54a734]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Scalp lesions are common among patients with psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis and a number of other inflammatory and fungal conditions. Topical corticosteroids are a mainstay of treatment for many scalp dermatoses and they significantly reduce erythema, scaling and pruritus. Conventional corticosteroid formulations such as cream and ointments are often difficult or time consuming for patients to apply and may produce undesirable cosmetic effects. Medicated shampoos provide a more convenient alternative for patients who require topical administration of corticosteroids for scalp conditions. Tar shampoos have long been used to treat psoriasis and are effective for the long-term maintenance of remission in patients who respond to therapy. Antifungal shampoos are effective for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis and other mycotic conditions. A shampoo formulation containing fluocinolone acetonide, 0.01% is also approved for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. One superpotent corticosteroid shampoo (clobetasol propionate 0.05%; Clobex Shampoo) is approved in the United States (U.S.) for once-daily treatment of psoriasis of the scalp. The results of a 2007 pilot study also demonstrated that clobetasol propionate shampoo improved the signs and symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis. These findings suggest that high-potency corticosteroid shampoos may provide an important option for topical corticosteroid therapy in dermatologic conditions affecting the scalp.

### Halobetasol 0.01% / tazarotene 0.045% lotion in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: maintenance of therapeutic effect after cessation of therapy [^59712aae]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated disease that varies widely in its clinical expression. Topical corticosteroids (TCS) are the mainstay of treatment. Long-term safety remains a concern, limiting use, and posttreatment flare is common. Tazarotene has also been shown to be effective in psoriasis, with efficacy maintained several weeks posttreatment. Fixed combination therapy with TCS and tazarotene may improve psoriasis signs and minimize posttreatment flare or rebound.

Objective

To investigate the maintenance of effect posttreatment with a once-daily application of halobetasol propionate 0.01%/tazarotene 0.045% (HP/TAZ) lotion in comparison with its active ingredients and vehicle in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

Methods

Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 2 study in moderate or severe psoriasis (N = 212). Patients randomized (2:2:2:1 ratio) to receive HP/TAZ, individual active ingredients, or vehicle, once-daily for 8 weeks with a 4-week posttreatment follow-up. Efficacy assessments included treatment success (defined as at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline in the IGA score, and 'clear' or 'almost clear'), and impact on individual signs of psoriasis (erythema, plaque elevation, and scaling) at the target lesion.

Results

At the end of the 4-week posttreatment period, 38.2% of patients who had been treated with HP/TAZ were treatment successes; compared with 21.0%, 12.8% and 6.9% of patients who had been treated with HP (P = 0.042), TAZ (P = 0.004), or vehicle (P = 0.002). HP/TAZ lotion was also superior in maintaining reductions in psoriasis signs of erythema, plaque elevation, and scaling at the target lesion. At the end of the 4-week posttreatment period, 49.1%, 54.5%, and 54.5% of patients, respectively, were treatment successes: compared with 38.7% (P = 0.26), 48.4% (P = 0.51), and 48.4% (P = 0.51) of patients who had been treated with HP; 29.8% (P = 0.049), 31.9% (P = 0.022), and 23.4% (P = 0.001) who had been treated with TAZ; and 13.8% (P = 0.002), 20.7% (P = 0.003), and 20.7% (P = 0.003) who had been treated with vehicle. Side effects were minimal and tended to resolve during the posttreatment period.

Conclusions

In conclusion, HP 0.01%/TAZ 0.045% lotion provides synergistic efficacy following 8 weeks' therapy that is sustained after a 4-week posttreatment period. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(7):723–726.

### Progressive ascending telangiectasias [^4030e708]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following treatments is most likely to result in successful treatment in this patient?
A. Pulsed-dye laser
B. Sclerotherapy
C. Narrowband UV-B
D. Topical clobetasol
E. Oral methylprednisone

Answers:
A. Pulsed-dye laser – Correct. Pulsed-dye laser produces pulsed light at wavelengths of 585 or 595 nm, specifically targeting intravascular oxyhemoglobin by selective thermolysis, resulting in destruction of blood vessels within the dermis. It has previously been used successfully to treat CCV. Our patient was treated with 12 sessions of pulsed-dye laser with marked improvement in appearance and symptoms.
B. Sclerotherapy – Incorrect. Sclerotherapy has been used previously to treat vascular disorders successfully but has not been found effective in the treatment of CCV.
C. Narrowband UV-B – Incorrect. Narrowband UV-B delivers energy at a 311 to 312–nm wavelength for effective penetration of the epidermis and epidermodermal junction. It has been used for effective treatment of skin diseases like psoriasis, vitiligo, and atopic dermatitis.
D. Topical clobetasol – Incorrect. Topical corticosteroids that classically act through antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive mechanisms will not treat CCV, where characteristic findings include dilation and thickening of blood vessels from hyaline and collagen deposition. In our case, the patient used triamcinolone cream that did not alleviate symptoms.
E. Oral methylprednisone – Incorrect. Oral steroids, which are typically used to treat systemic inflammatory conditions including vasculitis, do not have a role in the treatment of CCV.

Case report

A 48-year-old man with a history of psoriasis was using intermittent topical clobetasol for a recent flair of his psoriasis. He presented with new-onset blurred vision in the left eye after application of clobetasol to the tip of his nose, eyebrows, and periauricular skin. The patient was evaluated by a retina specialist and was found to have CSCR in the left eye (Fig 1), with no significant visual acuity loss. Additional pertinent medications were azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray and fluticasone propionate nasal spray. The patient was advised to discontinue topical and intranasal steroids. At 2-month follow up, the subretinal fluid associated with CSCR was completely resolved (Fig 2). Six months later, the patient restarted only clobetasol without the intranasal preparations. Within 2 weeks, the patient presented to the retina specialist with a relapse in CSCR (Fig 3). The patient once again discontinued topical steroids and the subretinal fluid resolved (Fig 4).

### Safety and efficacy of a once-daily halobetasol propionate 0.01% lotion in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: results of two phase 3 randomized controlled trials [^2433ecff]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Topical corticosteroids (TCS) are the mainstay of psoriasis treatment; long-term safety concerns limiting consecutive use of potent TCS to 2–4 weeks.

Objective

Investigate safety and efficacy of halobetasol propionate 0.01% lotion in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

Methods

Two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 3 studies (N = 430). Subjects randomized (2:1) to halobetasol propionate 0.01% lotion or vehicle once-daily for 8 weeks, 4-week posttreatment follow-up. Primary efficacy assessment: treatment success (at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline in Investigator Global Assessment [IGA] score and 'clear' or 'almost clear') at week 8. Safety and treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) evaluated throughout.

Results

Halobetasol propionate 0.01% lotion demonstrated statistically significant superiority over vehicle as early as week 2. By week 8, 36.5% (Study 1) and 38.4% (Study 2) of subjects were treatment successes compared with 8.1% and 12.0% on vehicle (P less than 0.001). Halobetasol propionate 0.01% lotion was also superior in reducing psoriasis signs and symptoms, body surface area (BSA), and improving quality of life. Halobetasol propionate 0.01% lotion was well-tolerated with no treatment-related AEs greater than 1%.

Limitations

Study did not include subjects with BSA greater than 12.

Conclusions

Halobetasol propionate 0.01% lotion was associated with significant reductions in the severity of the clinical signs of psoriasis, without the safety concerns of a longer treatment course. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(10):1062–1069.
