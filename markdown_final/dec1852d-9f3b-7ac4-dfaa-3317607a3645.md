## Question

Oral colloidal silver risk

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risks of oral colloidal silver. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and whether any authoritative body recognizes oral colloidal silver as safe or effective. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence for toxicity, especially case reports and series documenting serious outcomes. Next, I will examine the dose-response and pharmacokinetics to gauge risk at typical supplement exposures. After that, I should review less severe but common adverse effects and potential drug interactions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical risk assessment and counseling points, making sure I distinguish oral ingestion from topical or dental uses of silver compounds where appropriate.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory position, because that frames baseline risk. The FDA does not consider over-the-counter colloidal silver products to be generally recognized as safe and effective for any disease or condition, and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health has issued a consumer advisory warning of serious side effects, which already signals a red flag for oral use [^09f01a04].

> Wait, let me verify the most compelling toxicity signals. The most severe outcome repeatedly reported is irreversible argyria, a slate-blue or gray discoloration of skin, nails, and mucous membranes due to silver deposition; case reports document generalized argyria after prolonged ingestion of colloidal silver solutions, with serum silver levels far above normal and histologic confirmation of silver granules in skin and other tissues, and this discoloration is generally permanent or only very slowly reversible with limited options [^afd97585] [^cba80610] [^98c2062e] [^3dcfe43a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about neurologic risk without checking the strength of evidence. I initially thought neurologic toxicity was a consistent, well-documented class effect, but wait, I should double-check the sources. The clearest signal comes from a case report of myoclonic status epilepticus and persistent vegetative state after months of daily oral colloidal silver, with markedly elevated silver in plasma, erythrocytes, and CSF, which, while low-certainty, is highly concerning and biologically plausible given silver's distribution and potential neurotoxicity; broader neurologic epidemiology is limited, so I need to be cautious not to overgeneralize beyond case-level evidence [^aa2c260d].

> I need to check systemic organ toxicity beyond the skin and brain. Case reports describe hepatic injury with fibrosis and portal venous silver deposition, renal involvement including pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis, and endocrine effects such as central adrenal insufficiency with markedly elevated plasma silver and hypoceruloplasminemia; these reports reinforce that chronic exposure can produce multi-organ toxicity even if the exact incidence is unknown [^eed2801b] [^8a5e365d].

> Next, I should review dose-response and pharmacokinetics to contextualize risk. Patients developing argyria have often ingested large cumulative amounts over months to years, with serum silver levels reported in the hundreds to thousands of ng/mL versus a typical reference under 15 ng/mL; silver is variably absorbed and can deposit in skin, eyes, liver, kidneys, and brain, and excretion is slow, explaining persistence and accumulation with chronic use [^afd97585] [^eed2801b].

> Let me consider less severe but more common adverse effects and interactions. Reported effects include gastrointestinal upset, headache, fatigue, and skin irritation, and silver can interfere with absorption of certain prescription drugs such as penicillamine, quinolones, tetracyclines, and thyroxine, which is clinically relevant for patients on these therapies; I should confirm that these interaction warnings are consistent across authoritative summaries, which they are [^09f01a04].

> But wait, what if someone argues that topical or dental silver agents are safe, so oral silver might be too? I need to ensure I distinguish modalities. Topical silver compounds like silver sulfadiazine and silver-containing dressings have established roles in burn care with mostly local effects and rare systemic toxicity at standard exposures, and dental silver diamine fluoride is effective for caries arrest with primarily cosmetic staining and transient mucosal irritation; these are not comparable to chronic oral ingestion, which bypasses local barriers and leads to systemic accumulation and argyria, so I should not conflate them [^03c5deb9] [^8b5d64a3] [^26dd7f8f].

> I should double-check whether any credible guideline or review supports oral colloidal silver for any indication. I find no supportive recommendations from major medical or dental organizations, and contemporary reviews of COVID-19 therapeutics explicitly list colloidal silver among agents with no demonstrated efficacy, reinforcing that there is no proven benefit to offset known risks [^c9df9100].

> Let me synthesize the risk profile and make sure it aligns with the evidence. The balance is unfavorable: there is no proven therapeutic benefit for oral colloidal silver, there are credible reports of serious and sometimes irreversible toxicity including argyria, neurologic injury, hepatic and renal disease, and endocrine dysfunction, and there are plausible drug interactions; given the lack of benefit and the potential for permanent harm, the risk-benefit calculus strongly argues against oral use [^09f01a04] [^afd97585] [^aa2c260d] [^eed2801b].

> Finally, I should translate this into practical counseling. I would advise patients to avoid oral colloidal silver products, explain that argyria is permanent and disfiguring, review potential drug interactions, and redirect to evidence-based alternatives for the conditions they are trying to treat; if they are already using these products, I would recommend stopping and, if there are concerning symptoms or prolonged high-dose use, consider checking a baseline serum silver and assessing for organ involvement, recognizing that management is supportive and cessation is the key intervention [^09f01a04] [^eed2801b].

Oral colloidal silver poses **significant health risks** with no proven benefit. The most serious risk is **argyria**, a permanent bluish-gray discoloration of skin, nails, and mucous membranes from silver deposition [^afd97585] [^3dcfe43a]. Chronic ingestion can also cause **neurologic injury** (myoclonus, seizures, encephalopathy) [^aa2c260d], renal and hepatic toxicity [^eed2801b], and hematologic effects, including leukopenia and anemia [^notfound]. Silver may interfere with antibiotics (penicillamine, quinolones, tetracyclines, thyroxine) and is **not approved** by the FDA for any medical use [^09f01a04]. Given these risks and the absence of evidence for benefit, oral colloidal silver should be avoided [^c9df9100].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and systemic absorption

- **Absorption**: Silver nanoparticles and ions are absorbed via the gastrointestinal tract, with systemic distribution to skin, liver, kidneys, brain, and eyes [^33f5cfd5].

- **Accumulation**: Silver accumulates in tissues over time, especially with chronic exposure, leading to deposition in skin and mucous membranes [^3da0703d].

- **Excretion**: Silver is eliminated slowly, primarily via feces, with urinary excretion contributing minimally, which facilitates accumulation with repeated dosing [^8a5e365d].

---

## Clinical evidence of adverse effects

### Argyria (silver deposition)

- **Permanent discoloration**: Argyria is characterized by bluish-gray discoloration of the skin, nails, and mucous membranes due to silver deposition in the dermis and submucosa [^afd97585] [^3dcfe43a].

- **Case reports**: Multiple cases document argyria following chronic ingestion of colloidal silver, including generalized and localized forms [^afd97585] [^cba80610] [^98c2062e].

- **Histopathology**: Silver granules are found in the dermis, blood vessel walls, and basement membranes, confirming deposition [^afd97585].

---

### Neurological toxicity

Neurological toxicity includes **myoclonic status epilepticus** and encephalopathy, as reported after chronic ingestion, with elevated silver levels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid [^aa2c260d]. Chronic exposure has also been linked to **cognitive impairment**, sensory disturbances, and gait abnormalities [^eed2801b].

---

### Renal and hepatic toxicity

Renal toxicity manifests as **acute kidney injury** and nephrotic syndrome, with silver deposition in renal tissues documented in case reports [^8a5e365d]. Hepatic toxicity includes **elevated liver enzymes**, hepatitis, and hepatic fibrosis, indicating significant hepatocellular injury [^eed2801b].

---

### Hematologic effects

Hematologic effects include **leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia**, reflecting bone marrow suppression and direct toxicity to blood cells [^65e18d24].

---

## Drug interactions

Silver compounds can **interfere with the absorption and efficacy** of certain medications, including:

- **Antibiotics**: Penicillamine, quinolones, tetracyclines.

- **Thyroxine**: Reduced absorption, potentially causing hypothyroidism.

- **Other medications**: Possible interference with absorption of other oral drugs.

---

## Regulatory status and safety warnings

The **FDA** has issued warnings stating that colloidal silver products are not generally recognized as safe or effective (GRAS/GRAE) for any medical condition [^09f01a04]. The **FTC** has taken enforcement actions against companies making unsubstantiated health claims about colloidal silver products.

---

## Comparison with other silver-containing products

| **Product** | **Formulation** | **Clinical use** | **Risks** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Colloidal silver | Suspension of silver particles | Oral supplement | - Argyria <br/> - Neurologic toxicity <br/> - Renal/hepatic injury <br/> - Hematologic effects |
| Silver sulfadiazine | Topical cream | Burn wound care | - Local irritation <br/> - Rare systemic absorption <br/> - Minimal risk of argyria |
| Silver diamine fluoride | Topical solution | Dental caries arrest | - Black staining of lesions <br/> - Minimal systemic risk |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Oral colloidal silver carries **substantial risks** — including permanent argyria, neurologic injury, renal and hepatic toxicity, and hematologic effects — with no proven therapeutic benefit. Given these risks and the lack of regulatory approval, oral colloidal silver should be avoided. Patients using these products should discontinue use and seek medical evaluation if adverse effects occur.

SARS-CoV-2 emerged in 2019 and led to the COVID-19 pandemic. Efforts to develop therapeutics against SARS-Cov-2 led to both new treatments and attempts to repurpose existing medications. Here, we provide a narrative review of the xenobiotics and alternative remedies used or proposed to treat COVID-19. Most repositioned xenobiotics have had neither the feared toxicity nor the anticipated efficacy. Repurposed viral replication inhibitors are not efficacious and frequently associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Antiviral medications designed specifically against SARS-CoV-2 may prevent progression to severe disease in at-risk individuals and appear to have a wide therapeutic index. Colloidal silver, zinc, and ivermectin have no demonstrated efficacy. Ivermectin has a wide therapeutic index but is not efficacious and acquiring it from veterinary sources poses additional danger. Chloroquine has a narrow therapeutic index and no efficacy. A companion review covers vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and immunotherapies. Together, these two reviews form an update to our 2020 review.

Adult oral health screening and preventive interventions in primary care — USPSTF I statement indicates that the US Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening or preventive interventions for oral health conditions in the primary care setting for adults and suggests primary care clinicians use their clinical expertise to decide whether to perform these services. For the purposes of the review, screening included clinical assessments (eg, physical examination) and standardized risk prediction tools or a combination of approaches by primary care clinicians to identify adults who have existing oral health conditions or adults who might benefit most from interventions to prevent future negative oral health outcomes due to increased risk, and interventions that were reviewed included counseling and health education to reduce bacterial burden and refined sugar intake and the use of fluoride, dental sealants, silver diamine fluoride solution, and xylitol to promote resistance to caries.

Preterm neonates — additional approaches have unknown impact on VAP and VAE rates but risk of harm likely minimal, and are reasonable to consider if rates remain elevated despite essential practices; listed options are lateral recumbent positioning, reverse Trendelenberg positioning, and closed/in-line suctioning systems (all LOW). Generally not recommended options due to unknown impact on VAP rates and inadequate data on risks are regular oral care with an antiseptic or Biotene (LOW) and oral care with maternal colostrum (MODERATE). Interventions that may be harmful, where the risk-benefit balance does not favor intervention unless specifically indicated for reasons other than VAP prevention, include histamine-2 receptor antagonists (MODERATE), prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics (MODERATE), daily spontaneous breathing trials (LOW), daily sedative interruptions (LOW), and prophylactic probiotics or synbiotics (LOW). Not recommended because appropriate products are not available or approved for use in this population are endotracheal tubes with subglottic secretion drainage ports and silver-coated endotracheal tubes (quality of evidence NA).

### Screening and interventions to prevent dental caries in children younger than 5 years: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^822abbbb]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

A 2014 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found that oral fluoride supplementation and topical fluoride use were associated with reduced caries incidence in children younger than 5 years.

Objective

To update the 2014 review on dental caries screening and preventive interventions to inform the USPSTF.

Data Sources

Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (to September 2020); surveillance through July 23, 2021.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on screening, preventive interventions, referral to dental care; cohort studies on screening and referral; studies on diagnostic accuracy of primary care oral examination or risk assessment; and a systematic review on risk of fluorosis included in prior USPSTF reviews.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

One investigator abstracted data; a second checked accuracy. Two investigators independently rated study quality.

Results

Thirty-two studies (19 trials, 9 observational studies, and 4 nonrandomized clinical intervention studies [total 106 694 participants] and 1 systematic review [19 studies]) were included. No study evaluated effects of primary care screening on clinical outcomes. One study (n = 258) found primary care pediatrician examination associated with a sensitivity of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.55 to 0.91) and specificity of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.92 to 0.98) for identifying a child with cavities, and 1 study found a risk assessment tool associated with sensitivity of 0.53 and specificity of 0.77 (n = 697, CIs not reported) for a child with future caries. No new trials of dietary fluoride supplementation were identified. For prevention, topical fluoride compared with placebo or no topical fluoride was associated with decreased caries burden (13 trials, n = 5733; mean caries increment [difference in decayed, missing, and filled teeth or surfaces], -0.94 [95% CI, -1.74 to -0.34]) and likelihood of incident caries (12 trials, n = 8177; RR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.66 to 0.95]; absolute risk difference, -7%) in higher-risk populations or settings, with no increased fluorosis risk. Evidence on other preventive interventions was limited (education, xylitol) or unavailable (silver diamine fluoride), and no study directly evaluated primary care dentistry referral vs no referral.

Conclusions and Relevance

There was no direct evidence on benefits and harms of primary care oral health screening or referral to dentist. Dietary fluoride supplementation and fluoride varnish were associated with improved caries outcomes in higher-risk children and settings.

### Silver-resistance, allergy, and blue skin: truth or urban legend? [^3205501e]. Burns (2014). Low credibility.

Medical and non-medical uses of silver are increasing. While the health benefits of silver therapy are widely claimed, few studies address the possible side effects of resistance, allergy, or skin discoloration. In this manuscript, a review of silver absorption, mechanism of action, allergy, microbial resistance and skin changes is presented. The ideal silver-delivery system is unknown. Most studies of side effects are animal or laboratory studies, which may not correlate with human experience. There is little correlation between serum silver levels, end-organ deposition and cytotoxic effects. The multiple mechanisms of antimicrobial action make true resistance unlikely. In microbes, genotypic resistance does not necessarily confer phenotypic resistance. Most cases of argyria occur from occupational exposure or from ingestion of colloidal silver rather than from topical application. Although toxicity, resistance and chronic skin changes are a theoretic concern, the lack of reported side effects despite widespread silver use is reassuring.

### Silver nitrate (repara silver nitrate) [^e1908498]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

CONTRAINDICATIONS & ANTIDOTES:

Repara ® Silver Nitrate Applicators must not be used for genital warts. Continued application to mucous membranes and open wounds leads to argyria, a blush-black discoloration of the skin due to depositions of granules of silver compounds in the connective tissues. This condition persists indefinitely or disappears very slowly. Poisoning by oral ingestion is unlikely with the quantities involved, but treatment for poisoning is the immediate ingestion of large amounts of salt water followed by an emetic. Then administer a dose of Epsom salts followed with milk. Immediately call a physician.

### Consensus guidelines for the safe prescription and administration of oral bowel-cleansing agents [^1826d9e8]. Gut (2012). Low credibility.

Oral bowel-cleansing preparations are used before colonic surgery and endoscopic and radiological assessment of the intestine to minimise faecal contamination. In February 2009, the UK National Patient Safety Agency issued a Rapid Response Report highlighting the potential risk of harm associated with the use of these preparations and instructing local NHS Trusts to implement safeguards to reduce this risk. This guidance has been prepared to help NHS Trusts to respond to these concerns, as the risk of complications is influenced by both individual patient risk factors and the choice of bowel preparation, for which definitive guidance was not previously available. This document provides an outline of the different available oral bowel-cleansing agents and the complications that may arise. This is followed by recommendations for their use in different patient groups and circumstances. The recommendations are based on consensus between the authors, each of whom circulated drafts to members of their specialist society. The evidence for these recommendations has been assessed using the modified GRADE system. The recommendations cover the choice, administration and complications (relative and absolute) of the different oral bowel-cleansing agents, with specific guidance provided for different patient groups.

### A case of generalized argyria after ingestion of colloidal silver solution [^afd97585]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

A 58-year-old woman was referred to our hospital due to progressive skin darkening, which began 5 months previously. The patient had strikingly diffuse blue-gray discoloration of the skin, most prominent in sun-exposed areas, especially her face and hands. The oral mucosa, tongue, gums, eye conjunctiva, ears, nail beds, and trunk were also involved. Bluish-gray discoloration of all nails was aggravated by cold weather. She had ingested 1 L of colloidal silver solution daily for approximately 16 months as a traditional remedy. Her serum silver concentration was 381 ng/ml which was a very high (reference level: < 15 ng/ml). Light microscopic examination of a punch biopsy specimen from her nose revealed fine, minute, round, and brown-black granules deposited in the basement membrane of hair follicular epithelium. Scanning electron microscopic examination showed electron-dense granules deposited in the intercellular space of sweat glands. Energy disperse X-ray spectrometry analysis demonstrated peaks for silver and sulfur in the dense black deposits. The ingestion of colloidal silver appears to be an increasing practice among patients using alternative health practices. All silver-containing products including colloidal silver should be labeled with a clear warning to prevent argyria, especially in alternative health practices.

### Screening and preventive interventions for oral health in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^61fc80ef]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Table 2 — research needs and gaps in screening and preventive interventions for oral health in adults highlights that research should focus on strategies feasible in primary care and on inclusion of populations with higher prevalence of oral health conditions, including Asian, Black, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Hawaiian Native/Pacific Islander persons and persons with social determinants that contribute to disparities in oral health. Research is needed to assess the effectiveness and harms of primary care–based oral health screening strategies on oral health outcomes and to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of oral health examinations and risk assessment tools in the primary care setting to identify adults with oral health conditions. Research is also needed to develop primary care–based oral health risk assessment tools to accurately identify adults at increased risk of oral health conditions and to assess the effectiveness and harms of preventive interventions in the primary care setting, including fluoride, topical fluoride gel, fluoride varnish, sealants, silver diamine fluoride, and xylitol, and should include the water fluoridation status, oral health behaviors, and education of study participants. Additional needs include assessing the effectiveness and harms of oral health education, behavioral, and counseling interventions on oral health outcomes and identifying the effectiveness of strategies deliverable in primary care to prevent oral health conditions and their effects on associated adverse health outcomes such as tooth loss or cognitive or cardiovascular conditions.

In vitro intestinal toxicity of commercially available spray disinfectant products advertised to contain colloidal silver 8 01 2020 By Rogers, Kim R.; Henson, Taylor E.; Navratilova, Jana;. Source: Sci Total Environ. 728: 138611 English. Details: Alternative Title: Sci Total Environ Personal Author: Description: The use of colloidal silver-containing products as dietary supplements, immune boosters and surface disinfectants has increased in recent years which has elevated the potential for human exposure to silver nanoparticles and ions. Product mislabeling and long-term use of these products may put consumers at risk for adverse health outcomes including argyria. This study assessed several physical and chemical characteristics of five commercial products as well as their cytotoxicity using a rat intestinal epithelial cell model. Concentrations of silver were determined for both the soluble and particulate fractions of the products.

Primary particle size distribution and elemental composition were determined by transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, respectively. Hydrodynamic diameters were measured using nanoparticle tracking analysis and dynamic light scattering. The effect of gastrointestinal simulation on the colloidal silver products was determined using two systems. First, physical and chemical changes of the silver nanoparticles in these products was assessed after exposure to Synthetic Stomach Fluid resulting in particle agglomeration, and the appearance of AgCl on the surfaces and between particles. IEC-6 cells were exposed for 24 h to dilutions of the products and assessed for cell viability. The products were also treated with a three-stage simulated GI system prior to exposure of the IEC-6 cells to the isolated silver nanoparticles. Cell viability was affected by each of the consumer products.

Based on the silver nitrate and commercial silver nanoparticle dose response, the cytotoxicity for each of the colloidal silver products was attributed to the particulate silver, soluble silver or non‑silver matrix constituents.

### Topical silver diamine fluoride (SDF) for preventing and managing dental caries in children and adults [^26dd7f8f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Dental caries is the world's most prevalent disease. Untreated caries can cause pain and negatively impact psychosocial health, functioning, and nutrition. It is important to identify cost-effective, easy-to-use agents, which can prevent or arrest caries. This review evaluates silver diamine fluoride (SDF).

Objectives

To assess the effects of silver diamine fluoride for preventing and managing caries in primary and permanent teeth (coronal and root caries) compared to any other intervention including placebo or no treatment.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Oral Health's Trial Register and two clinical trials registers in June 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with parallel-group or split-mouth design, in children and adults (with or without carious lesions) that compared SDF with placebo or no treatment; different frequencies, concentrations or duration of SDF; or any other intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane, and GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. We collected data for primary caries prevention (change in caries increment), arrest of carious lesions, secondary prevention of caries (lesions do not progress from initial classification), adverse effects, dental pain or sensitivity, and aesthetics at the end of study follow-up.

Main Results

We included 29 RCTs (13,036 participants; 12,020 children, 1016 older adults). We summarise outcome data for the five most clinically relevant comparisons. All studies included high risks of bias, and some findings were imprecise (e.g. because of small sample sizes). SDF versus placebo or no treatment (14 studies; 2695 children, 905 older adults) Compared to placebo or no treatment, SDF may help prevent new caries in the primary dentition (1 study, 373 participants), or on the coronal surfaces of permanent dentition (1 study, 373 participants) but the evidence is very uncertain. SDF likely prevents new root caries (mean difference (MD) -0.79 surfaces, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.40 to -0.17; 3 studies, 439 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). SDF may help arrest caries in the primary dentition (MD 0.86 surfaces, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.33; 2 studies, 841 participants; low-certainty evidence) and the permanent dentition (coronal: 1 study, 373 participants; root: 1 study, 158 participants) but the evidence is very uncertain. The evidence is very uncertain for secondary prevention of caries (primary dentition: 1 study, 128 participants; permanent dentition (coronal): 1 study, 663 participants), for adverse effects (5 studies, 1299 participants), and aesthetics (1 study, 43 participants). Different approaches to SDF application (5 studies, 1808 children) Studies compared different frequencies or intervals of application, different concentrations of SDF, and different durations of treatment. Some studies included multiple comparisons of different approaches. Because of the different approaches, we could not combine findings from these studies. Due to very low-certainty evidence, we were unsure whether any approach to SDF application was better than another for caries arrest (4 studies, including 8 comparisons of different approaches, 1360 participants); secondary prevention of caries (1 study, 203 participants), or led to differences in adverse effects (3 studies, 1121 children) or aesthetics (1 study, 119 children). SDF versus fluoride varnish (8 studies, 2868 children, 223 older adults) Compared to flouride varnish, SDF may result in little or no difference to the prevention of new caries in the primary dentition (MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.26; 1 study, 434 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain for this outcome measure in the permanent dentition (coronal: 1 study, 237 participants; root: 1 study, 100 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Due to very low-certainty evidence, we were unsure whether or not there were any differences between flouride varnish (applied weekly for three applications) and SDF for caries arrest and secondary prevention of caries in the primary dentition (1 study, 309 participants). Similarly, we were unsure of adverse effects (3 studies, 980 children), dental pain or sensitivity (1 study, 62 children), or aesthetics (1 study, 263 children). SDF versus sealants and resin infiltration (2 studies, 343 children) Very low-certainty evidence in this comparison meant we were unsure if either treatment was better than the other for primary prevention of caries in permanent dentition (coronal: 1 study, 242 participants), or adverse effects (2 studies, 336 participants). SDF versus atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) with glass ionomer cement (GIC) or GI material (4 studies, 610 children) Very low-certainty evidence in this comparison meant we were unsure if either treatment was better than the other at arresting caries in the primary dentition (1 study, 143 participants). We were also unsure whether there were any differences between treatments in adverse effects (3 studies, 482 participants), dental pain or sensitivity (1 study, 234 participants), or aesthetics (2 studies, 248 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

In the primary dentition, evidence remains uncertain whether SDF prevents new caries or progression of existing caries compared to placebo or no treatment, but it may offer benefit over placebo or no treatment in caries arrest. Compared to placebo or no treatment, SDF probably also helps prevent new root caries. However, the evidence is uncertain for other caries outcome measures in this dentition and in all caries outcomes for coronal surfaces of permanent dentition. Compared to flouride varnish, SDF may offer little or no benefit in preventing new caries in the primary dentition, but the evidence is very uncertain for other caries outcome measures in the primary dentition and for preventing new caries in the permanent dentition. We were unable to establish whether one SDF treatment approach was better than another, or how SDF compared to other treatments, because of very low-certainty evidence. The impact of SDF staining of teeth was poorly reported and the evidence for adverse effects is very uncertain. Additional well-conducted studies are needed. These should measure the impact of staining and be analysed to take account of clustering issues within participants.

### Effect of oral decontamination with chlorhexidine on the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia: a meta-analysis [^ed8e4291]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In this meta-analysis, we failed to find any clinical benefits of regular oral chlorhexidine application on the incidence of NP and mortality rate in critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Although colonization of dental plaques with pathogenic bacteria may be a precursor for the disease, chlorhexidine based decontamination of oral microbial flora alone might not be sufficient to reduce the burden of bacteria responsible for NP. Routine oral care in ICU settings should be pursued along with other preventive measures aimed at reducing biofilm formation pending the results of ongoing trials addressing oral mechanical interventions and silver coated endotracheal tubes.

### Screening and preventive interventions for oral health in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^964ba0b3]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF oral health in adults — sealants, silver diamine fluoride, and xylitol: The review found no studies on the effectiveness of sealants vs no sealants to prevent dental caries in primary care, and two trials (n = 178) evaluating light-cured resin-based sealants in young adults applied by dental professionals were of limited quality and yielded imprecise results. Three trials (n = 590) examined silver diamine fluoride solution in older adults and evidence suggests it may be more effective than placebo to reduce new root dental caries or fillings (mean difference, −0.33 to −1.3 at 24 to 30 months) and may reduce the likelihood of new root dental caries (adjusted odds ratio, 0.4 [95% CI, 0.3–0.7] and relative risk, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.07–0.46] in 2 randomized clinical trials; n = 478). No evidence was found evaluating the effects of xylitol to prevent dental caries or periodontitis.

Background

Argyria is a rare condition characterized by gray/blue dislocation of the skin caused by chronic exposure to silver salts.

Case Report

We review the case of an 81-year-old man who presented to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident, was incidentally found to have skin discoloration, and was ultimately diagnosed with argyria. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Although most emergency physicians will not complete a toxicology fellowship, all emergency physicians are on the front line of toxicological presentations and should be able to recognize argyria and differentiate this condition from other causes of skin discoloration.

Alternative considerations

Elimination diets

The JTFPP conditionally recommends against specific food elimination diets, with a low certainty of evidence, as opposed to an unrestricted diet owing to the risk of development of an IgE-mediated food allergy or malnutrition. The AAD does not provide an updated statement of its previous 2014 recommendation regarding elimination diets, which stated that "food elimination diets based solely on the findings of food allergy test results are not recommended for the management of AD".

Allergen immunotherapy

The JTFPP conditionally recommends allergen immunotherapy in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. Alternatively, the JTFPP recommends against allergen immunotherapy in patients with mild AD alone, with the consideration that it may be of benefit if a patient has other allergic comorbidities with relevant sensitizations. These recommendations are made with a moderate certainty of evidence. The AAD does not discuss the use of allergy immunotherapy in either its previous guidelines or its current guidelines.

Oral antibiotics

The AAD states that there are insufficient data to make a recommendation on the use of oral antibiotics for secondary infection, but it notes that their use "should be limited to instances of clinically evident infection". The JTFPP does not provide a GRADE recommendation, although it states that there is "no significant improvement across outcomes" when using oral antibiotics for AD.

Other interventions

In their updated guidelines, neither the AAD nor the JTFPP provide recommendations regarding topical tar, silver-impregnated clothing, silk clothing, bath additives (other than bleach), vitamin D, environmental modifications, or psychological care.

### How nanotechnology-enabled concepts could contribute to the prevention, diagnosis and therapy of bacterial infections [^ff76d5da]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Here, I discuss recent developments in the field of nanoscale engineering that could potentially be employed to address major challenges in critical care medicine. I will focus on a few landmark concepts that could potentially be useful in the prevention, detection and treatment of bacterial infection and sepsis.

Generally, the best way to eliminate a problem is to eliminate its cause. Implantable devices and endotracheal tubes are a major source of hospital-acquired infection responsible for more than 40% of all episodes of nosocomial sepsis. Silver-based compounds have been exploited for their medicinal properties for centuries; however, due to the emergence of antibiotics, the use of silver-based compounds has lost importance. With the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, metallic silver in the form of silver nanoparticles has made a remarkable comeback as a potential antimicrobial agent. In contrast to older silver-containing formulations that were rapidly inactivated by the environment, nano-sized silver particles ensure a sustained release of silver ions providing antimicrobial activity. However, the toxicity of silver nanoparticles remains a concern. While some studies have observed cytotoxic effects of silver nanoparticles in vitro, systemic toxicity of ingested silver nanoparticles is rarely seen. Supporting this, Wong and Liu did not observe any overt systemic effects when injecting silver nanoparticles into mice intravenously despite the relatively high dose. Oral administration of silver nanoparticles of up to 32 ppm to healthy volunteers did not induce observable clinically important toxicity markers. However, the overall significance in the in vivo setting and the applicability to humans remain largely unknown. Remarkably, a trigger-dependent release of silver ions has been achieved by using silver nanoparticle-decorated biodegradable tricalcium phosphate particles (Fig. 1). Bacteria, when present, degrade the tricalcium phosphate matrix, thereby releasing silver that then in turn kills them. If no bacteria are present, no silver is released, hence potentially minimizing side effects when applied in clinical settings. As such trigger-dependent systems greatly reduce the required dose of silver nanoparticles, they may be seen as a first step towards the safe use of silver nanoparticle-coated surfaces in clinics. Such self-sterilizing systems may significantly improve the performance of currently used silver-based coatings (for example, on surfaces and textiles), and once safety concerns have been ruled out also on catheters, endotracheal tubes, or implants. Trigger-dependent silver-based antimicrobial coatings may thus become an integral part of controlling bacterial spread in hospital environments.

### Reliance on clinical signs and symptoms assessment leads to misuse of antimicrobials: analysis of 350 chronic wounds [^ca819873]. Advances in Wound Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite the availability of advanced therapies, less than half of chronic wounds achieve closure within 12 weeks. Patients with chronic wounds experience a decreased quality of life, loss of function and in some cases, significant morbidity. The accumulation of bacteria at concentrations > 10⁴ colony-forming units per gram of tissue (CFU/g) has been associated with an increased risk of delayed wound healing. In a 228-patient randomized controlled trial, presence of bacterial loads > 10⁴ CFU/g had a significant negative effect on healing. Similarly, others have shown delayed healing when bacterial loads > 10⁵ CFU/g are present. Therefore, reducing this clinically significant level of bacterial burden is a rational approach to improve healing.

Wound clinicians must work efficiently to identify and appropriately reduce bioburden in wounds to facilitate healing and treat or prevent infection. Treatment methods employed to reduce bioburden and facilitate wound healing vary depending on the type and size of wound, patient history, and other comorbidities, but typically include debridement, pressure off-loading, application of appropriate dressings, and increasingly the use of antimicrobials.

Antimicrobials, which include antiseptics as well as antimicrobial dressings (e.g. silver impregnated dressings), topical, oral and intravenous antibiotics, are a routine part of management of bacterial burden; however, across specialties up to 50% of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary or inappropriate.

Chronic wound patients receive significantly more antibiotic prescriptions than age- and gender-matched patients without wounds. Physicians concerned with failing to detect infection in a timely manner may prescribe antimicrobial agents in the absence of evidence supporting critical levels of bacteria. Analysis of antibiotic prescribing behaviors in the United Kingdom between 2013 and 2015 revealed that wounds accounted for 16.5% of all systemic antibiotic prescriptions.

Clinicians are often pressured by patients to prescribe antibiotics as they are viewed as the safe option. However, unlike most drug therapies, antibiotics become less effective with use; chronic wounds including diabetic foot, venous, arterial and pressure ulcers, often harbor multiple drug-resistant bacteria, and form biofilms blocking access to antibiotic and topical antimicrobial access.

### Fluoride use in caries prevention in the primary care setting [^8b5d64a3]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) in primary teeth — indication, follow-up, contraindication, and adverse effects are described as follows: SDF is indicated for the arrest of cavitated carious lesions in primary teeth as part of a comprehensive caries management program, and after SDF application, the lesions must be followed to assess their hardness state, with additional treatments applied to obtain sufficient hardness. The only known contraindication to SDF is silver allergy, and SDF is not indicated for carious lesions involving the pulp. The only significant adverse effect of SDF is that the carious lesion turns black; SDF can also temporarily stain the skin black if it accidentally comes into contact with the epithelium, and SDF can cause mucosal irritation for approximately 48 hours after mucosal contact, so care must be taken when applying SDF to a cavitated lesion to avoid contact with the child's mucosa or skin.

### Screening and interventions to prevent dental caries in children younger than 5 years: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^9ec241a9]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF — effectiveness of fluoride-based preventive interventions in children younger than 5 years indicates benefit across multiple trials, with dietary fluoride supplementation reducing caries in low-fluoride settings and fluoride varnish lowering incident caries. The USPSTF considered 15 trials (2 good quality and the rest fair quality), with participants ranging from 123 to 2536 (total N = 9541). Dietary fluoride supplementation compared with no supplementation in water fluoride level less than 0.6 ppm F reduced incidence, ranging from 48% to 72% for primary teeth and from 51% to 81% for primary surfaces. Fluoride varnish decreased likelihood of incident caries (12 trials; n = 8177; risk ratio, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.66 to 0.95]), with high-risk defined by low socioeconomic status, high caries burden, or suboptimal oral health practices and no difference in benefits related to whether trials occurred in adequately fluoridated settings. Evidence on other preventive interventions was limited (eg, xylitol and silver diamine fluoride).

Introduction

Colloidal silver packaged as a dietary supplement is readily available online and is thought to be safe. Literature describing its toxicity in humans is scarce.

Case Report

A 47-year-old man presented to us for sensory and gait problems. He had unremarkable past health except dystrophic nails. He further volunteered a history of receiving chronic oral and intravenous administration of colloidal silver. We confirmed his plasma silver was 1200-fold elevated, measuring 11990nmol/L (normal < 10nmol/L). He had deranged liver function tests, and liver biopsy showed distorted acinar architecture, bridging fibrosis and lymphocytic infiltrate with silver particles clustering along the vascular endothelium and portal venules. Brain magnetic resonance imagining showed features of mineralization over bilateral globus pallidi. There was biochemical evidence of central adrenal insufficiency, intracellular iron overload and hypoceruloplasminemia (< 0.05g/L). Gradual clinical and biochemical improvement was noted after silver cessation: his plasma silver dropped to 4800nmol/L (3 months) and 1650nmol/L (12 months), and serum ceruloplasmin reverted to 0.13g/L (10 months) and 0.29g/L (20 months).

Conclusions

The potential effects of silver to liver and copper metabolism were shown in this case. Serum ceruloplasmin also serves as a surrogate marker in monitoring silver intoxication.

### Antimicrobial mouthwashes (gargling) and nasal sprays to protect healthcare workers when undertaking aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) on patients without suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection [^4b22516b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 infection poses a serious risk to patients and - due to its contagious nature - to those healthcare workers (HCWs) treating them. The risks of transmission of infection are greater when a patient is undergoing an aerosol-generating procedure (AGP). Not all those with COVID-19 infection are symptomatic, or suspected of harbouring the infection. If a patient who is not known to have or suspected of having COVID-19 infection is to undergo an AGP, it would nonetheless be sensible to minimise the risk to those HCWs treating them. If the mouth and nose of an individual undergoing an AGP are irrigated with antimicrobial solutions, this may be a simple and safe method of reducing the risk of any covert infection being passed to HCWs through droplet transmission or direct contact. Alternatively, the use of antimicrobial solutions by the HCW may decrease the chance of them acquiring COVID-19 infection. However, the use of such antimicrobial solutions may be associated with harms related to the toxicity of the solutions themselves or alterations in the natural microbial flora of the mouth or nose.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of antimicrobial mouthwashes and nasal sprays administered to HCWs and/or patients when undertaking AGPs on patients without suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.

Search Methods

Information Specialists from Cochrane ENT and Cochrane Oral Health searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2020, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 June 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: This is a question that urgently requires evidence, however at the present time we did not anticipate finding many completed RCTs. We therefore planned to include the following types of studies: randomised controlled trials (RCTs); quasi-RCTs; non-randomised controlled trials; prospective cohort studies; retrospective cohort studies; cross-sectional studies; controlled before-and-after studies. We set no minimum duration for the studies. We sought studies comparing any antimicrobial mouthwash and/or nasal spray (alone or in combination) at any concentration, delivered to the patient or HCW before and/or after an AGP.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Our primary outcomes were: 1) incidence of symptomatic or test-positive COVID-19 infection in HCWs or patients; 2) significant adverse event: anosmia (or disturbance in sense of smell). Our secondary outcomes were: 3) COVID-19 viral content of aerosol (when present); 4) change in COVID-19 viral load at site(s) of irrigation; 5) other adverse events: changes in microbiome in oral cavity, nasal cavity, oro- or nasopharynx; 6) other adverse events: allergy, irritation/burning of nasal, oral or oropharyngeal mucosa (e.g. erosions, ulcers, bleeding), long-term staining of mucous membranes or teeth, accidental ingestion. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We found no completed studies to include in this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified no studies for inclusion in this review, nor any ongoing studies. The absence of completed studies is not surprising given the relatively recent emergence of COVID-19 infection. However, we are disappointed that this important clinical question is not being addressed by ongoing studies.

### Severe generalized argyria secondary to ingestion of colloidal silver protein [^98c2062e]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Argyria is a rare cause of cutaneous discolouration caused by silver deposition. We report a case of dramatic and diffuse argyria secondary to ingestion of colloidal silver protein over a 1-year period. Stained electron microscopy with spectral analysis was used to confirm the clinical diagnosis. Silver-protein complexes are deposited in the skin and reduced to inert silver salts by sunlight in a process similar to that harnessed in photography. Our patient had obtained the silver for consumption via mail order. It had been advertised as a cure for a variety of diseases. Colloidal silver protein is commercially available as a 'food supplement', hence circumventing the strict controls placed on medicines.

Nanoparticles (NPs)

NPs are particles ≤ 100 nm in all dimensions and exist in a variety of shapes, sizes and compositions (organic, inorganic and carbon based). The nanometer scale of these particles allows for their direct interaction with cells and/or passage through biological barriers. Molecules (including proteins) can coat the NP surface, forming a NP corona and effectively become particle passengers. Leveraging this property, NPs have been used as a therapeutic delivery mechanism for a variety of chemotherapeutic compounds. However, NP pharmacological characteristics are often quickly altered in vivo as NPs become coated with biological milieu following delivery. The interaction of NPs with cells is influenced by the proteins and other molecules attached to their surface, as demonstrated by one ex vivo study reporting that the binding specificity of targeted NPs can be lost in the presence of plasma proteins. The complexity and diversity of protein interactions with NPs to form the corona has not been completely elucidated. While NP size and ability to transport molecules contributes to their therapeutic promise, these same characteristics may also interfere with vital cellular processes, resulting in cellular toxicity as well as human health and environmental concerns. For instance, silver (Ag) NPs have been predominately used for the development of medicines, drug delivery systems and medical device coatings as a result of their antibacterial properties, yet multiple studies have demonstrated the toxicity of Ag NPs in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the soft duality of NP features may also pose a detriment to a number of organs and highlights the need for a clearer understanding of these particles in biomedicine, manufacturing as well as general regulations for use.

### Resident rounds: part III-case report: argyria – A case of blue-gray skin [^3dcfe43a]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Argyria is an uncommon blue-gray pigmentation of the skin (increased in sun-exposed areas), nail unit, and mucous membranes caused by prolonged silver exposure. Commonly occurs in the setting of occupational exposure, silver-containing medications, or systemic absorption from use of silver sulfadiazine on extensive burns/wounds. Recently, there appears to be an increase in the practice of colloidal silver ingestion given the popularity and easy availability of alternative medicines and dietary supplements containing various silver-containing compounds. We report a case of argyria in a 72-year-old male following ingestion of colloidal silver as a supplement for over 10 years. He had a diffuse, blue-gray discoloration of his face and nails. A skin biopsy was performed and histology supported the clinical diagnosis of argyria. Our objective is to increase the awareness for this rare dermatologic entity by highlighting the clinical and histological features through a case report. Dermatologists should warn patients in regards to the use of colloidal silver for alternative health practices.

### Antibacterial prophylaxis in dermatologic surgery: an evidence-based review [^36c03d93]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Clean, non-contaminated skin surgery is associated with low rates of surgical site infection (SSI), bacterial endocarditis, and joint prosthesis infection. Hence, antibacterial prophylaxis, which may be associated with adverse effects, the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens, and anaphylaxis, is generally not recommended in dermatologic surgery. Some body sites and surgical reconstructive procedures are associated with higher infection rates, and guidelines for SSI antibacterial prophylaxis have been proposed for these cases. Large prospective, controlled trials are needed to ascertain the role of oral SSI prophylaxis for these surgical sites and procedures especially in patients with diabetes mellitus who are intrinsically at greater risk of SSI. Topical antibacterial ointment and sterile paraffin appear to make no difference to healing or the incidence of SSIs in clean wounds. Although further research is needed, preliminary studies have shown that intraincisional antibacterials, which may be associated with fewer adverse effects and a lower risk of multidrug-resistant bacteria, could potentially be helpful for SSI prophylaxis. Trials using honey- and silver-impregnated dressings have found no advantage in the healing of chronic wounds. However, several case studies, which need corroboration in larger studies, suggest that these dressings may be helpful in preventing and treating SSIs. Bacterial endocarditis and joint prosthesis infection prophylaxis are not routinely recommended in cutaneous surgery. The updated 2007 American Heart Association guidelines now advocate bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis for high-risk cardiac patients having surgery involving the oral mucosa or infected skin. The latest American Dental Association/American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgery guidelines recommend considering antibacterial prophylaxis for oral procedures where bleeding is anticipated and for surgery involving acute orofacial skin infections if the patient has had a total joint replacement within 2 years or is in a high-risk group and has had a joint replacement at any time.

### Perioperative acute kidney injury: diagnosis, prediction, prevention, and treatment [^c47472d3]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Crystalloid versus Colloid

Whether colloids have a role in surgery has been debated and studied. Colloids, specifically hydroxyethyl starch solutions, initially held promise as a way to minimize overall volume of fluids administered, but have been shown to be nephrotoxic in the intensive care setting. – While the nephrotoxic effect was not replicated in surgical populations, strong evidence of coagulopathy, bleeding, and transfusionprompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (Silver Spring, Maryland) to issue a black box warning in 2013 and the European Medicines Agency (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) to suspend marketing authorization in 2018. Widespread use of the synthetic colloid hydroxyethyl starch waned behind mounting evidence of potential clinical harm; however, whether this risk persists with human-derived albumin (the primary colloid replacement for hydroxyethyl starch) remained unresolved.

Albumin is routinely utilized in cardiac surgery to prime the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit and for volume replacement, although evidence supporting such practice is limited or conflicting. The randomized, double-blind, single-center Albumin in Cardiac Surgery (ALBICS) trial showed no difference in major adverse events (a composite including AKI) between cardiac surgery patients with albumin or lactated Ringer's solution use for cardiopulmonary bypass priming fluid and perioperative volume replacement, suggesting that routine use of albumin did not provide any benefit for patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. A recent meta-analysis confirmed this finding, leading to the conclusion that albumin should be used restrictively in cardiac surgery.

Data on the perioperative use of albumin is almost nonexistent outside of cardiac surgery. The Choosing Wisely in Anesthesiology Initiative stated that routine administration of colloid for volume resuscitation "without appropriate indication" is one of the top five "low-value" activities in the field of anesthesiology; however, it did not give guidance on when albumin might be indicated. Ongoing research seeks to better define populations that may derive benefit. Albumin may have a limited role in specific surgical populationsincluding hepatorenal syndrome, – spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or after paracentesis in liver failure patients. –

### Pauci immune crescentic glomerulonephritis in a patient with T-cell lymphoma and argyria [^8a5e365d]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Silver is a transition metal element with a range of industrial and ornamental uses. Silver also has pharmaceutical applications, primarily as a disinfectant and antimicrobial, and is known to be toxic when ingested in significant amounts. The recognised manifestations of this are irreversible deposition in the eye, causing argyrosis, and in the skin, mucous membranes and internal organs, causing argyria.

Ingested silver is thought to be excreted mainly via the gastrointestinal tract with only small amounts eliminated by the kidneys. Nevertheless some cases of nephrotoxicity due to silver have been reported. Here we present the case of a woman who used colloidal silver as a remedy for an un-treated T cell lymphoma and who subsequently developed argyria and a pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis.

### The safety of nanocrystalline silver dressings on burns: a study of systemic silver absorption [^ec3907e5]. Burns (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Wound dressings containing silver have been in widespread use for many years. However, there are few quantitative data on the systemic absorption of silver or whether there is associated clinical risk.

Objectives

To assess systemic silver levels when Acticoat dressings containing nanocrystalline silver were used, and to determine whether increases in such levels were associated with haematological or biochemical indicators of toxicity.

Method

A prospective, single-centre, open-label study of 30 patients with relatively small burns that required skin grafting. Serum silver levels were measured before, during and at discontinuation of the use of the Acticoat dressings, and again at 3 and 6 months following completion of treatment.

Results

The median total postoperative wound size was 12% of the total body surface area. The median time to maximum silver levels was 9 days. The median maximum serum silver level was 56.8 microg/l. The median serum level at 6 months was 0.8 microg/l. There were no haematological or biochemical indicators of toxicity associated with the silver absorption observed in this study.

Conclusion

This study has confirmed our view that Acticoat products are safe for use on burns and they remain a standard part of treatment at our centre.

### Prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia by metal-coated endotracheal tubes: a meta-analysis [^33f5cfd5]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Nonetheless, promoting metal-coated ETT necessitates caution due to ongoing debates about its safety. In investigations of AgNPs, after 28 days of oral exposure in domestic rabbits, these nanoparticles were found in the basal layer, macrophages, and the connective tissue of the submucosal layer. Furthermore, studies suggest that when AgNPs of various sizes were administered intravenously to rats, there was a redistribution of these nanoparticles to the liver, lungs, heart, and other organs, highlighting their systemic distribution. Although the safety of silver-coated ETT has been reported by Marin H. Kollef and Jordi Rello, they did not explore if residual silver ions persist in the body or if additional harm might be inflicted. Silver-coated ETT have been on the market since 2013, with claims from the manufacturer that this coating did not release silver ions into the surrounding environment. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of clinical studies that substantiate its safety. Besides silver-coated ETT, other variations include those coated with zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs), selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs), and titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs). However, no research currently exists that examines the preventive effects of these metal-coated ETTs on VAP, and their safety requires additional scrutiny.

### Middle-aged female with blue nails and graying skin [^6d90e49b]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case

A 60-year-old female presented for her nail beds becoming blue over the past 3 years. Additionally, it was noted her sun exposed skin had a gray discoloration (Fig 1). She was healthy, review of systems was negative, and had no pertinent family history. She denied any prescribed medications but reported taking multivitamins and angstrom silver, both of which she took regularly for 10 years. A punch biopsy was done and confirmed the diagnosis (Fig 2).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Melasma
B. Wilson's disease
C. Argyria
D. Addison's disease
E. Vitamin deficiency

Answers:
A. Melasma – Incorrect. Melasma is hyperpigmentation localized to the face and is common in women. It should be considered in this case especially if she had been taking hormone replacement. Additionally, melasma does not cause blue discoloration of the nails.
B. Wilson's disease – Incorrect. Wilson's disease can lead to hyperpigmentation, but this is unlikely in our patient. She was healthy, had a negative review of systems, and had an unremarkable exam besides pigmentation changes. In Wilson's disease, we would expect patients to be positive for symptoms related to liver dysfunction including abdominal pain, lack of appetite, and fatigue.
C. Argyria – Correct. She developed argyria, a rare dermatologic condition due to exposure or ingestion of silver. Generalized argyria, in comparison to localized argyria, typically results from ingesting colloidal silver. Despite the superiority of antibiotics, silver is still taken as a homeopathic antimicrobial. This case is unique as the patient was taking angstrom silver, which is 1 million times smaller than colloidal, and has not previously been reported to cause argyria.
D. Addison's disease – Incorrect. Addison's disease, primary adrenal insufficiency, can lead to hyperpigmentation typically at scars, pressure points, mucous membranes, and skin folds. This is unlikely as she denied the typical systemic symptoms including fatigue, weakness, appetite decrease, and polydipsia.
E. Vitamin deficiency – Incorrect. Vitamin deficiencies can lead to pigment changes; however, this is doubtful in our patient. She had no history of gastrointestinal absorption issues, ate well, and took multivitamins.

### Oral health inequities over time among older adults of different racial / ethnic backgrounds: a comparative decomposition analysis across Australia and the United States [^52d8ce65]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Integration of oral health into general geriatric health care plans could help improve the oral health of vulnerable older adults in both Australia and the United States. Evidence in the United States has demonstrated that a range of healthcare and ancillary workers, with appropriate training and support systems, can both assess risk and screen for common oral conditions, provide preventive services including application of silver diamine fluoride and educate around how to best prevent oral diseases as comorbidities and other factors impacting mobility and agility (which may impact on ability to hold a toothbrush and brush teeth for a sustained period) increase.

Oral health challenges experienced by older populations with culturally diverse backgrounds were summarized by Marino into six salient points: (l) language and communication; (2) lack of information; (3) financial assistance and social support; (4) social isolation; (5) acculturation and (6) racism and prejudices. Other factors include unfamiliarity of healthcare systems, lack of culturally tailored services, and different cultural behaviors and attitudes towards oral health. As the goal of any country is to improve the health of all population groups, irrespective of cultural background, it is important that greater recognition be given to the different value and belief systems of multicultural groups. Systemic barriers that exist in terms of models of dental service provision for older populations identifying as non-White require far greater attention, both for economic and social equity reasons.

### Systematic scoping review of the noma evidence landscape: current knowledge and gaps [^5edb4583]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Treatment modalities

Most studies (96%, 352/366, n = 4207 patients) reported treatment details for noma cases or study population. 30% of studies described medical interventions (108/366), 26% surgical interventions (94/366) and 33% of publications reported both medical and surgical interventions (119/366). A further 8% reported neither medical nor surgical interventions (31/366). The intervention was unknown for a large number of patients (n = 8210), though from a limited number of studies in 4% (14/366).

Across 352 studies, 381 different therapeutic interventions were described (online supplemental SF3 table 10). Online supplemental table 13 SF3 depicts the total publications and patients for each of the five subgroup intervention categories. While providing an overview of the reported literature, these results may not align with current intervention proportions. Notably, the majority of included patients received alternative therapies, a result influenced by a single retrospective cross-sectional study of over 7000 patients. In this study, the most common intervention was home treatment with charcoal in 42% of patients (n = 3011), followed by 13% (n = 951) opting for traditional treatment, including cultural rituals. The majority of publications (n = 208, 56.8%) reported other medical interventions and therapies (ie, not antibiotics, see online supplemental figure 1 SF3), which included a wide range of treatments from opiates, tincture of chloride, topical silver nitrate, topical zinc peroxide, vitamin therapy to blood transfusion. Antibiotics (or bactericidal products) were prescribed in 176 studies, only two of which were interventional studies across different noma stages. Consequently, there is no evidence to support better results from any antibiotic family (online supplemental SF3 table15 and figure13). Alongside the use of antibiotics in the acute stages, a number of case reports have shown that early intervention, with proper oral hygiene, debridement and chlorhexidine mouthwash, can lead to proper wound healing and no long-term adverse effects.

For each study design, the number of patients and studies by intervention category are presented in table 2. Further discussion of noma treatment by study design, noma stage and year of publication, including numbers by additional subgroup intervention categories and detailed observations are provided in online supplemental SF3 section 5. This review found little evidence on noma prevention with no studies examining preventative interventions online supplemental SF3 section 4.

### Efficacy and safety of a novel skin cleansing formulation versus chlorhexidine gluconate [^0026a7ea]. American Journal of Infection Control (2018). Low credibility.

Background

This study evaluated whether a multi-ingredient surfactant colloidal silver technology was noninferior to a 4% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) antiseptic on immediate and persistent antimicrobial activity.

Methods

The inguinal regions of 81 healthy adults were demarcated into 4 quadrants, and 3 were used for testing each product at baseline, 10 minutes, and 6 hours postapplication. The log of the number of colony forming units was obtained using a cylinder sampling technique. The 95% confidence interval of the test product to the control product with a margin of 0.65 was established as the upper limit of noninferiority.

Results

A total of 81 individuals were enrolled. The colloidal silver product was found to be noninferior to 4% CHG at both 10 minutes and 6 hours postapplication.

Conclusions

The colloidal silver-based product was noninferior to the 4% CHG product at 10 minutes and 6 hours postapplication.

### Noninferiority of silver diamine fluoride vs sealants for reducing dental caries prevalence and incidence: a randomized clinical trial [^cce32b30]. JAMA Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Dental caries is the world's most prevalent noncommunicable disease. The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Researchestimates that more than 50% of US children between the ages of 6 and 8 years have experienced caries, with the rate in some racial and ethnic minority groups exceeding 70%. The United Nations considers oral diseases to be a major global burden that shares common risk factors with other noncommunicable diseases, and the World Health Organization Global Oral Health Action Plannames oral disease prevention as a primary strategic objective, recommending the use of cost-effective, community-based methods to prevent caries. In 2022, the World Health Organization added glass ionomer sealants and silver diamine fluoride (SDF) to its Model List of Essential Medicines.

Despite increases in Medicaid entitlements for dental benefits, there remain persistent access challenges to oral disease prevention throughout the US. More than 69 million individuals in the US live in dental care health professional shortage areas. The US Centers for Disease Control and Preventionrecommends school sealant programs to increase access to care and improve health equity. Dental sealants — thin coatings applied to the pits and fissures of teeth to protect against bacteria — can prevent the onset of carious lesions and arrests them in the early stages. However, the burgeoning costs of care limits their use in schools. Alternatively, SDF is a colorless alkaline solution consisting of silver and fluoride with antimicrobial properties that remineralizes teeth. In clinical studies, SDF application prevents caries in the primary dentition compared to placeboand arrests existing caries.SDF can be applied in minutesand is a cost-effective strategy to reduce the burden of caries, particularly in under resourced areas. In 2017, the US Food and Drug Administrationgranted breakthrough therapy status to SDF.

The Silver Diamine Fluoride Versus Therapeutic Sealants for the Arrest and Prevention of Dental Caries in Low-Income Minority Children (CariedAway) pragmaticrandomized clinical trialinvestigated the use of SDF as an alternative therapy for community-based caries control and prevention. Primary clinical outcomes for CariedAway included the noninferiority of SDF compared to dental sealants and atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) in the 2-year arrest of existing dental cariesand the 4-year prevalence of caries. We report on the cumulative incidence and prevalence of caries over 4 years.

### Nanocrystalline silver: a systematic review of randomized trials conducted on burned patients and an evidence-based assessment of potential advantages over older silver formulations [^d6e2faa4]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The aim of this meta-analysis was to collect data from randomized trials in burn patients and to analyze them with a meta-analytic approach to give a clear message of potential advantages of nanocrystalline silver (NC) versus older silver formulations (SS). A review of all-English prospective randomized trials that compared NC versus silver sulfadiazine or silver nitrate was conducted. Primary outcome was the evaluation of differences in the infection rate of burns. Secondary outcomes were the eventual differences in the pain experienced during medications, the length of hospitalization (LOS) and costs. Five articles that met the inclusion criteria were selected (n = 285 patients). The NC group had a significant lower incidence of infections compared with the SS group (9.5% vs. 27.8%, odds ratio: 0.14 [95% CI: 0.06–0.35]; chi2 test, P < 0.001), with a 2.9-fold decrease of the risk. Not all studies investigated the pain during change of dressings, LOS and costs. However, when data were available, these showed lower costs (US $1533 per patient for the SS group and US $946 per patient for the NC group) and decreased pain values in the NC group (Hedges' G: -1.44 [95% CI: -1.86/-1.01]; P < 0.0001), while contrasting results were obtained for LOS. Nanocrystalline silver is a relatively new product with a significant stronger antimicrobial activity compared with older formulations. Its long lasting properties reduce dressing change frequency and are probably responsible for the decreased pain and the minor costs experienced.

### Editorial commentary: every cloud has a silver lining… but silver may not Be the currency of choice: the bioelectric silver-zinc dressing requires additional investigation [^b22ff4dc]. Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

The use of silver in various forms has been advocated for its antibacterial properties for centuries, because its toxicity to human cells is considerably lower than its toxicity to bacteria. The Greek historian Herodotus recounted how the king of Persia, before going to war, among his provisions included boiled water stored in flagons of silver, ostensibly to mitigate the risk of foodborne infections in his troops. Additionally, recent studies support the use of silver to generate an electrical stimulation for promotion of wound healing. These concepts have been combined in a proprietary postoperative dressing that is promoted to mitigate the risk of postoperative infections.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guideline on care of burns in the wilderness [^ae39723c]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Burn dressings — field options and recommendations: Silver sulfadiazine was long the standard of care for burn dressings but has largely been replaced by antibiotic ointment, which provides equivalent or better healing and is more likely to be included in a first aid kit. No antibiotic ointment or specialized dressing is required if time to definitive care is less than 12 to 24 h. Absorbent foam dressings such as MepilexTM (Mölnlycke Health Care, Peachtree Corners, GA) are useful for superficial partial-thickness burns and may be left in place for up to 1 wk, minimizing the pain of dressing changes. There is a significant body of literature to support the use of honey as an improvised burn dressing. Although topical antibiotics can reduce colonization and risk of infection, prophylactic oral or systemic antibiotics should not be used, as prophylactic antibiotics may increase the risk of later infection with resistant organisms. We recommend using absorbent foam dressings on superficial partial-thickness burns. Grade: Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. We recommend using antibiotic ointment or honey on deep partial-thickness burns if attempting field management or evacuation will be delayed. Grade: Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. We suggest that absorbent foam dressings may be easier to manage in the field than other types of dressings. Grade: Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

### Strategies to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator-associated events, and nonventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^444e1e1c]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Approaches that should not be considered a routine part of VAP and/or VAE prevention in adult patients

The following interventions are inconsistently associated with lower VAP rates and have no impact or negative impact on duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, or mortality.

Oral care with chlorhexidine (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) Oral care with chlorhexidine has been studied in multiple randomized controlled trials. The impact of oral care with chlorhexidine on pneumonia rates is unclear. Meta-analyses report significantly lower VAP rates, but this signal is driven by unblinded studies. There was no association between oral care with chlorhexidine and lower VAP rates when the analysis was restricted to double-blinded studies. Meta-analyses of both blinded and unblinded studies also show no impact on duration of mechanical ventilation or ICU length of stay. Chlorhexidine's lack of impact on VAP, duration of mechanical ventilation, or ICU length of stay was echoed in a large randomized trial of chlorhexidine de-adoption versus usual care. Some meta-analyses of randomized trials and some observational studies report an association between oral care with chlorhexidine and higher mortality rates.– The mortality signal is uncertain, however, because other meta-analyses did not find higher mortality rates, there was no change in mortality observed in a large randomized trial of chlorhexidine de-adoption, and the observational studies may be at risk of residual confounding. Nonetheless, given chlorhexidine's lack of clear impact on VAP rates and the possibility of harm, routine oral care with chlorhexidine is not recommended. Oral care including toothbrushing without chlorhexidine, however, is considered an essential practice.
Probiotics (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) Multiple meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials have reported a possible association between probiotics and lower VAP rates, but these analyses have included many studies at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. – There is no association between probiotics and VAP when restricting the analysis to double-blinded studies. This finding was mirrored in a large, rigorous, multicenter, randomized trial conducted after the most recent meta-analysis. Neither this trial nor the meta-analyses found a significant impact on ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay, or mortality. Probiotics should not be used in patients with compromised immune systems or gastrointestinal diseases that increase the risk of gut translocation. Multiple cases of fungemia or bacteremia have been reported in patients administered probiotics as have cases of aerosol transmission of probiotics within ICUs. –
Ultrathin polyurethane endotracheal tube cuffs (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) Ultrathin polyurethane cuffs seal more uniformly against the tracheal wall and may therefore allow fewer secretions to seep around the cuff and into the lungs. Two small randomized trials, reported lower VAP rates but a larger, more rigorous study found no difference in VAP rates, duration of endotracheal intubation, or ICU length of stay. Similarly, there were no significant associations between polyurethane cuffs and VAP rates, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, or mortality on meta-analysis.
Tapered endotracheal tube cuffs (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) A meta-analysis of 5 randomized trials of tapered versus conical endotracheal tube cuffs found no differences in VAP rates, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, hospital length of stay or mortality.
Automated control of endotracheal-tube cuff pressure (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) Automated control of endotracheal-tube cuff pressure was associated with lower VAP rates in 2 small trials but this signal has not been borne out in other trials. – Indeed, 2 large, multicenter, randomized trials of automated cuff-pressure regulation versus thrice-daily manual cuff-pressure assessments found no difference between arms in VAP, VAE, antibiotic utilization, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, or mortality.
Frequent endotracheal-tube cuff-pressure monitoring (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) A single-center prospective trial found no advantage to more frequent versus less frequent cuff-pressure monitoring. At least 1 laboratory investigation suggests that manual measurement of cuff pressure is associated with loss of cuff pressure and potential leakage of fluid around the cuff.
Silver-coated endotracheal tubes (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) A large, multicenter, randomized controlled trial found that silver-coated endotracheal tubes reduced VAP rates by 36%. However, the organisms associated with VAP included nonpathogenic colonizers, and there was no impact on mean duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay, or mortality.
Kinetic beds (continuous lateral rotational therapy and oscillation therapy) (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) A meta-analysis of 15 randomized controlled trials found a significant decrease in VAP rates but no impact on duration of mechanical ventilation or mortality. The meta-analysis researchers warned that the observed reduction in VAP rates might be artifactual given weaknesses in contributing studies' design and execution.
Prone positioning (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) Prone positioning is associated with lower mortality rates among patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS, but this signal appears to be independent of VAP. Prone positioning may be indicated for reasons other than VAP prevention. –
Chlorhexidine bathing (Quality of Evidence: MODERATE) Observational studies have suggested that chlorhexidine bathing may reduce the risk of VAP, but this finding has not been borne out in randomized trials. – Chlorhexidine bathing is, however, beneficial in preventing other healthcare-associated infections.

### Interventions to reduce contaminated aerosols produced during dental procedures for preventing infectious diseases [^1885818d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Many dental procedures produce aerosols (droplets, droplet nuclei and splatter) that harbour various pathogenic micro-organisms and may pose a risk for the spread of infections between dentist and patient. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to greater concern about this risk.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of methods used during dental treatment procedures to minimize aerosol production and reduce or neutralize contamination in aerosols.

Search Methods

Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases on 17 September 2020: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in the Cochrane Library, 2020, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946); Embase Ovid (from 1980); the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease; the US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov); and the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register. We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) on aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) performed by dental healthcare providers that evaluated methods to reduce contaminated aerosols in dental clinics (excluding preprocedural mouthrinses). The primary outcomes were incidence of infection in dental staff or patients, and reduction in volume and level of contaminated aerosols in the operative environment. The secondary outcomes were cost, accessibility and feasibility.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened search results, extracted data from the included studies, assessed the risk of bias in the studies, and judged the certainty of the available evidence. We used mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as the effect estimate for continuous outcomes, and random-effects meta-analysis to combine data. We assessed heterogeneity.

Main Results

We included 16 studies with 425 participants aged 5 to 69 years. Eight studies had high risk of bias; eight had unclear risk of bias. No studies measured infection. All studies measured bacterial contamination using the surrogate outcome of colony-forming units (CFU). Two studies measured contamination per volume of air sampled at different distances from the patient's mouth, and 14 studies sampled particles on agar plates at specific distances from the patient's mouth. The results presented below should be interpreted with caution as the evidence is very low certainty due to heterogeneity, risk of bias, small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals. Moreover, we do not know the 'minimal clinically important difference' in CFU. High-volume evacuator Use of a high-volume evacuator (HVE) may reduce bacterial contamination in aerosols less than one foot (~ 30 cm) from a patient's mouth (MD -47.41, 95% CI -92.76 to -2.06; 3 RCTs, 122 participants (two studies had split-mouth design); very high heterogeneity I² = 95%), but not at longer distances (MD -1.00, -2.56 to 0.56; 1 RCT, 80 participants). One split-mouth RCT (six participants) found that HVE may not be more effective than conventional dental suction (saliva ejector or low-volume evacuator) at 40 cm (MD CFU -2.30, 95% CI -5.32 to 0.72) or 150 cm (MD -2.20, 95% CI -14.01 to 9.61). Dental isolation combination system One RCT (50 participants) found that there may be no difference in CFU between a combination system (Isolite) and a saliva ejector (low-volume evacuator) during AGPs (MD -0.31, 95% CI -0.82 to 0.20) or after AGPs (MD -0.35, -0.99 to 0.29). However, an 'n of 1' design study showed that the combination system may reduce CFU compared with rubber dam plus HVE (MD -125.20, 95% CI -174.02 to -76.38) or HVE (MD -109.30, 95% CI -153.01 to -65.59). Rubber dam One split-mouth RCT (10 participants) receiving dental treatment, found that there may be a reduction in CFU with rubber dam at one-metre (MD -16.20, 95% CI -19.36 to -13.04) and two-metre distance (MD -11.70, 95% CI -15.82 to -7.58). One RCT of 47 dental students found use of rubber dam may make no difference in CFU at the forehead (MD 0.98, 95% CI -0.73 to 2.70) and occipital region of the operator (MD 0.77, 95% CI -0.46 to 2.00). One split-mouth RCT (21 participants) found that rubber dam plus HVE may reduce CFU more than cotton roll plus HVE on the patient's chest (MD -251.00, 95% CI -267.95 to -234.05) and dental unit light (MD -12.70, 95% CI -12.85 to -12.55). Air cleaning systems One split-mouth CCT (two participants) used a local stand-alone air cleaning system (ACS), which may reduce aerosol contamination during cavity preparation (MD -66.70 CFU, 95% CI -120.15 to -13.25 per cubic metre) or ultrasonic scaling (MD -32.40, 95% CI - 51.55 to -13.25). Another CCT (50 participants) found that laminar flow in the dental clinic combined with a HEPA filter may reduce contamination approximately 76 cm from the floor (MD -483.56 CFU, 95% CI -550.02 to -417.10 per cubic feet per minute per patient) and 20 cm to 30 cm from the patient's mouth (MD -319.14 CFU, 95% CI - 385.60 to -252.68). Disinfectants ‒ antimicrobial coolants Two RCTs evaluated use of antimicrobial coolants during ultrasonic scaling. Compared with distilled water, coolant containing chlorhexidine (CHX), cinnamon extract coolant or povidone iodine may reduce CFU: CHX (MD -124.00, 95% CI -135.78 to -112.22; 20 participants), povidone iodine (MD -656.45, 95% CI -672.74 to -640.16; 40 participants), cinnamon (MD -644.55, 95% CI -668.70 to -620.40; 40 participants). CHX coolant may reduce CFU more than povidone iodine (MD -59.30, 95% CI -64.16 to -54.44; 20 participants), but not more than cinnamon extract (MD -11.90, 95% CI -35.88 to 12.08; 40 participants).

Authors' Conclusions

We found no studies that evaluated disease transmission via aerosols in a dental setting; and no evidence about viral contamination in aerosols. All of the included studies measured bacterial contamination using colony-forming units. There appeared to be some benefit from the interventions evaluated but the available evidence is very low certainty so we are unable to draw reliable conclusions. We did not find any studies on methods such as ventilation, ionization, ozonisation, UV light and fogging. Studies are needed that measure contamination in aerosols, size distribution of aerosols and infection transmission risk for respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 in dental patients and staff.

### Interim guidance for medical screening and hazard surveillance for workers potentially exposed to engineered nanoparticles [^ea74f458]. CDC (2009). Medium credibility.

Interim guidance for the medical screening and hazard surveillance for workers potentially exposed to engineered nanoparticles — introduction summarizes that engineered nanoparticles are materials with at least one dimension of approximately 1 to 100 nanometers, and that the term "ultrafine" is used for particles with dimensions less than 100 nanometers. The potential occupational health risks are not yet clearly understood; exposure during manufacturing and use may occur through inhalation, dermal contact, or ingestion, with inhalation exposure the main route of concern, and there is very limited information about dominant exposure routes, potential for exposure, and material toxicity. The text notes that one of the first areas where exposures will occur is the workplace, that the real risks are not known and perceived risks are undetermined, and that implementing appropriate occupational health surveillance measures may assure the public that efforts are being taken to identify and control potential hazards, as stakeholders have raised questions about whether workers exposed to engineered nanoparticles should be provided some type of medical surveillance.

### Joint practice guidelines for radionuclide lymphoscintigraphy for sentinel node localization in oral / oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma [^5cc7d6da]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Exclusion Criteria

In pregnant women, the urgency and the necessity of staging the neck should be discussed. Lymphoscintigraphy is specifically contraindicated in the pelvis of pregnant women, but no such recommendations are currently available for the head and neck. As discussed in the "Dosimetry" section, the risk of fetal damage is negligible during routine SNB procedures. However, SNB protocols should be modified in pregnant patients to minimize risks of radiation exposure and blue-dye injections. For example, the use of a 1-day protocol allows a lower injected radiation dose, and the additional radiation associated with SPECT/CT imaging may not be warranted in the pregnant patient. SNB can be performed in lactating women, but it is advised that breastfeeding be discontinued following the procedure. OSCC is rare in children, though each case should be treated individually. In the UK, Nanocolloid is approved for use in children, though licencing varies between countries. The potential benefits of sentinel node biopsy are not as well delineated in the pediatric population and, in practice, most SNB trial protocols generally exclude these patients from participation. Off-label use of radiopharmaceuticals should be considered with caution and with respect to an individual risk–benefit analysis. Other relative contraindications include known allergy to albumin colloid, and primary tumor treatment by external-beam radiotherapy.

In summary, SNB is currently indicated for cT1/2, cN0 oral, and select oropharyngeal SCC, where it may be considered a valid alternative to elective neck dissection. Other head and neck sites, histologies, and clinical situations remain under investigation.

Pregnancy Category B. A reproductive study has been performed in rabbits at doses up to three to ten times the concentration of silver sulfadiazine in silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% and has revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to silver sulfadiazine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly justified, especially in pregnant women approaching or at term.

### Silver nasal sprays: misleading internet marketing [^3266a55d]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Long-term use of silver-containing products is associated with a permanent bluish-gray discoloration of the skin known as argyria, but they remain widely available despite several measures by the FDA to regulate them. Several recent case reports have described the occurrence of argyria as a result of using these "natural" products. We used the five most common Internet search engines to find Web sites providing information on silver-containing nasal sprays. Of 49 Web sites analyzed, only 2 (4%) mentioned argyria as a possible complication, although 30 (61%) did caution against long-term use. Eight sites (16%) made specific claims about the health benefits of the product. All 49 sites (100%) provided direct or indirect links to buy silver-containing nasal sprays. We conclude that information about silver-containing nasal sprays on the Internet is misleading and inaccurate. Therefore, otolaryngologists should be aware of the misinformation their patients may be receiving about these products.

### Iatrogenic rhinopharyngeal isolated argyria induced by silver-containing nasal drug [^ebbe0713]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Localized nasal argyria has been reported in 3 published articles as secondary to occupational exposure and involving the anterior part of the nose. No previous cases of such pathology involving the rhinopharynx were described. Here we report the first case of localized argyria of the roof and of the posterior wall of the rhinopharynx secondary to prolonged use of nasal drops containing colloidal silver protein. The recognition of such pathology can be useful to increase the number of conditions that must be considered in the differential diagnosis of rhinopharyngeal mucosa alterations.

### Association between dentition and frailty and cognitive function in community-dwelling older adults [^ea0d6e5f]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Globally the number of older adults is increasing at an unprecedented rate and Singapore is no exception where one in four of the population will be ≥ 65 years old by 2030. With ageing population, the prevalence of dementia, frailty and non-communicable diseases (NCD) will increase putting a strain on health and social care resources. Maintaining oral health with ageing is crucial for healthy longevity as it is associated with better swallowing, chewing, nutrition, communication, socialisation and has positive effect on diabetes and NCD. It is an important indicator of general health, well-being and quality of life. Studies have shown a longitudinal association between oral health, functional decline, Alzheimer's Disease and frailty. Poor oral health is characterised by tooth loss and periodontitis. These are highly prevalent amongst older adults especially those with frailty and cognitive impairment. Clinicians have limited knowledge and guidance on appropriate dental treatment for complex older adults and similarly, there is limited integration of frailty and cognition assessment in dental practice.

Frailty is a dynamic state, affecting multiple physiological system and refers to a state of increased vulnerability to stressors resulting in functional decline, falls, increased morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of frailty in medical outpatient clinic locally is 27% and community 6%. Frailty is reversible with targeted interventions such as nutrition, exercise, polypharmacy and oral health management. Number of remaining teeth is a known predictor of frailty and frail edentulous older adults also have reduced maximum bite force and impaired mastication escalating the downward spiral to disability. Other factors associated with poor oral health include cognitive impairment and/or dementia, smoking and body mass index. Frailty, cognitive impairment and poor oral health share common risk factors including poor nutrition, chronic inflammation and reduced socialisation.

Studies have shown that older adults with 20 or more teeth have overall reduced prevalence of frailty and cognitive impairment compared with edentulous older adults. The 'Healthy Japan 21' strategy recommends on keeping at least 20 or more teeth by the age of 80 years old encouraging collaborations between health authorities, dental associations and domiciliary dental services. Singapore has introduced Project Silver Screen, a nation-wide programme for ≥ 60 years old to screen on vision, hearing and oral health. However, there is limited information on risk factors and personalised goal targeted stage-specific dental recommendations. Our study aimed to evaluate 1) the dentition status and 2) risk factors and association of dentition status with frailty and cognitive impairment in community dwelling older adults.

Exclusion criteria

In pregnant women, the urgency and the necessity for staging the neck should be discussed. LSG is specifically contraindicated in the pelvis of pregnant women, but no such recommendations are currently available for the head and neck.

### Silver nitrate applicator (Styptstix) [^3da0703d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Silver salts stain tissue black due to deposition of reduced silver. The stain gradually disappears within a period of two

weeks. Prolonged ingestion or absorption of silver compounds leads to deposition of silver in connective tissues, producing

a slate-blue discoloration of the skin known as argyria. This discoloration may also appear on mucous membranes such as

the margins of gums. The sclera of the eye is also stained.

### Safety of silver dressings in infants; a systematic scoping review [^60f3980b]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Silver-based dressings are used to reduce infection risk and optimize conditions for wound healing. They are widely used in the management of burns and other complex wounds. However, reports of elevated serum silver and concern over systemic toxicity have meant that their use in young children has been questioned. The aim of the current study was to map the literature relating to the use of silver-based dressings in children under 1 year of age. A systematic scoping review was conducted according to the methodology described by the Joanna Briggs Institute. Sources were identified from major medical databases as well as the gray literature. Inclusion criteria were the use of silver-based dressing in children under 1 year of age. Outcomes of interest were complications or adverse events attributed to silver-based dressings and elevated serum silver levels. A total of 599 sources were identified through the search strategy, with 110 included for review. Complications were described in 31 sources, with the most frequent being wound infection. No cases of argyria, kernicterus, or methemoglobinemia were reported. Six sources documented elevated serum silver levels in infants but none reported adverse events related to this. On the basis of current evidence, we suggest reserving silver dressings in infants under 1 for wounds that are at high risk of infection. Wound area and duration of treatment should be considered when assessing the risk of systemic absorption of silver. Standardized data collection and recording of complications and adverse events is recommended to better inform future clinical decision-making.

Adverse effects with silver diamine fluoride (SDF) during follow-up included black staining and other events occurring infrequently; black staining was reported as an adverse event, lesions treated with 38% SDF had a statistically significant increased chance of becoming black compared with those receiving 12% SDF, and lesions treated semiannually also had a higher chance than those treated annually, while tooth pain, gingiva pain, gingiva swelling, and gingiva bleaching affected a small proportion of children (1%-7%). At 36 months in primary dentition, the 38% SDF group averaged 0.3 surfaces with arrested caries versus 0.1 in controls (P < .05), and black stains were more frequent in SDF-treated inactive lesions (97%) than controls (48%) (P < .001).

### Silver acetate for smoking cessation [^4694d354]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Silver acetate produces an unpleasant taste when combined with cigarettes, thereby producing an aversive stimulus. It has been marketed in various forms with the aim of extinguishing the urge to smoke, by pairing the urge with an unpleasant stimulus.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to determine the effectiveness of silver acetate products (gum, lozenge, spray) in promoting smoking cessation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group specialised trials register. Most recent search was in July 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials of silver acetate for smoking cessation with reports of smoking status at least six months after the beginning of treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate on the type of subjects, the dose and form of silver acetate, the outcome measures, method of randomisation, and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome measure was biochemically validated abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up in patients smoking at baseline. Subjects lost to follow-up were counted as continuing smokers. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed effects model.

Main Results

Two studies provided long-term follow-up data on patients randomised to silver acetate or placebo. In one of these studies, there was a third arm, randomised to 2mg nicotine gum. The pooled risk ratio for quitting for silver acetate vs placebo was 1.04 (95% confidence interval 0.69 to 1.57).

Authors' Conclusions

Existing trials show little evidence for a specific effect of silver acetate in promoting smoking cessation. The confidence intervals for the ratio are quite wide. However, the upper limit of the confidence intervals for a positive effect equates to an absolute increase in the smoking cessation rate of about 4%. Any effect of this agent is therefore likely to be smaller than nicotine replacement therapy. The lack of effect of silver acetate may reflect poor compliance with a treatment whose rationale is to create an unpleasant stimulus.

### Is there a cloud in the silver lining for imatinib? [^b380712f]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec® or Glivec®), a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia, has been said to herald the dawn of a new era of rationally designed, molecularly targeted oncotherapy. Lurking on the same new horizon, however, is the age-old spectre of drug resistance. This review sets the intoxicating clinical perspective against the more sobering laboratory evidence of such divergent mechanisms of imatinib resistance as gene amplification and stem cell quiescence. Polychemotherapy has already been considered to combat resistance, but a more innovative, as yet unformulated, approach may be advocated.

### Silver linings of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic from an infection prevention and control perspective [^8993a739]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2021). Medium credibility.

To the Editor — As a response to the evolving information about the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, health agencies and organizations have been updating guidelines for infection prevention and control. McMullen et almade some predictions about increasing and decreasing hospital-acquired infection rates due to the crisis care for COVID-19. Despite the numerous infection control challenges posed by severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in acute-care facilities, in some ways, we have been able to identify some "silver linings" or opportunities for improved infection control practices amidst the pandemic.

Skin care and xerosis management — patients are advised to avoid extreme temperatures and direct sun exposure, and "should refrain from using alcohol-containing lotions or skin products that may dehydrate skin". For mild or moderate xerosis, treatment "consists of thick moisturizing creams without fragrances or potential irritants", with occlusive, emollient creams "generally packaged in a jar or tub rather than a lotion that can be pumped or poured"; specific options "include urea, colloidal oatmeal, and petroleum-based creams". For scaly xerosis, "ammonium lactate or lactic acid creams can be utilized". Greasy creams "may be used on the limbs" but are "cautioned on the face and chest, along with extremely hairy sites, due to risk for folliculitis secondary to occlusion". For more severe xerosis "topical steroid creams may be necessary", while "Topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide gels are not recommended due to their drying effect".
