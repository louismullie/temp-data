## Question

What is the optimal treatment for a dull based 3 cm meningioma?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal treatment approach for a 3 cm dural-based meningioma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and establishing baseline imaging features. Then, I should assess symptoms and mass effect. Next, I will stratify risk based on size, location, edema, and growth dynamics. After that, I will align management options with guideline-based thresholds for observation, surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery, and fractionated radiotherapy. I will then consider special scenarios such as skull base location, high-grade histology, and patient factors like age and comorbidity. Finally, I will outline surveillance protocols, define triggers for intervention, and summarize a practical decision algorithm with explicit contingencies and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and baseline features on MRI, because management hinges on accurate characterization. A dural-based, homogeneously enhancing lesion with a dural tail and CSF cleft is classic for meningioma, and I should document size, location, peritumoral edema, proximity to critical structures such as the optic apparatus, brainstem, and venous sinuses, and any calcification or T2 hyperintensity that might signal higher growth potential, while remembering that definitive grading requires tissue and that molecular profiling is emerging but not yet standard in routine practice [^115nQV2K] [^114AGWPo] [^1113zZrW].

> Wait, let me verify the symptom status before jumping to treatment. I need to check for focal deficits, seizures, headaches, visual changes, or cognitive symptoms, and correlate with mass effect or edema on MRI, because symptomatic tumors generally warrant intervention rather than observation, whereas asymptomatic lesions may be observed if low risk features are present [^115nQV2K] [^111YkPyC].

> I will now examine risk stratification by size. A 3 cm meningioma sits at a commonly cited threshold where observation may still be reasonable in select cases, but I should double-check that tumors ≥ 3 cm have higher absolute growth rates and greater risk of clinical progression, which pushes me toward earlier intervention in many patients, especially if other risk features coexist [^115DHpJs] [^111Eo91o].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about location. I need to check whether this is skull base, convexity, parasagittal/parafalcine, or cavernous sinus, because skull base meningiomas often carry higher surgical morbidity and proximity to cranial nerves and vessels may favor radiosurgery or fractionated radiotherapy, whereas convexity lesions are more amenable to safe gross total resection and thus surgery is often preferred when feasible [^112tPdyf] [^111NskP4].

> I should confirm the presence or absence of peritumoral edema, since edema is a strong predictor of symptom development and progression. If edema is present, the risk of neurologic decline increases and this should lower my threshold for intervention rather than prolonged observation [^1113zZrW] [^111Eo91o].

> Next, I should review growth dynamics. If prior imaging is available, I need to calculate the absolute growth rate and consider that faster growth correlates with higher WHO grade and clinical progression, and if no prior imaging exists, I should plan early interval imaging to establish a baseline growth trajectory before committing to long-term observation [^115DHpJs] [^1113zZrW].

> Let me consider observation as an option if the patient is asymptomatic, the tumor is 3 cm or smaller, there is no edema, the location is not adjacent to critical neurovascular structures, and there are no concerning imaging features. In that scenario, active surveillance with MRI at 6 months and then annually for the first 5 years is reasonable, with the caveat that most progression occurs within 5 years and that larger size alone increases risk, so I should counsel the patient accordingly and remain vigilant for interval changes [^115nQV2K] [^111YkPyC] [^115DHpJs].

> But wait, what if the tumor is exactly 3 cm and otherwise low risk? I should double-check whether early intervention could prevent future morbidity, and indeed some data suggest that tumors ≥ 3 cm have higher progression risk and that early SRS can improve radiographic control compared with surveillance in select skull base cohorts, though clinical symptom development may be similar, so shared decision-making about the timing of radiosurgery is essential [^115DHpJs] [^111HWAxa].

> If the patient is symptomatic, has peritumoral edema, or the lesion is causing mass effect, I should confirm that surgery is generally the preferred initial treatment when feasible, aiming for maximal safe resection with neurosurgical adjuncts such as navigation and neuromonitoring. Extent of resection correlates strongly with progression-free survival, and Simpson grading remains informative, though aggressive dural resection may not always be necessary or safe in skull base disease [^111NskP4] [^111WyXHB] [^112tPdyf].

> I need to ensure postoperative planning is explicit. Obtain MRI within 48 hours to assess extent of resection, and if gross total resection is achieved for a presumed grade 1 tumor, observation is acceptable, whereas subtotal resection or higher-grade histology should prompt consideration of adjuvant radiotherapy, with the timing individualized to balance local control against toxicity and patient factors [^115nQV2K] [^1137vfbE].

> If surgery is high risk due to location or comorbidity, or the patient prefers a nonoperative approach, I should review stereotactic radiosurgery as a primary modality. Single-fraction SRS yields excellent local control for small to medium volumes, typically under about 3–3.5 cm or 10 cc, with 12–16 Gy commonly used for grade 1 lesions, and for a 3 cm tumor I need to verify proximity to optic structures and brainstem to avoid exceeding tolerance [^112F9FMa] [^117CwiDw].

> Hold on, I should verify the limits for larger or critically located tumors. For lesions near the optic pathway or brainstem, or when the volume exceeds SRS comfort zones, hypofractionated SRS or fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy in 3–5 fractions or conventional 54–60 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions is preferred to respect normal tissue tolerance while maintaining control, and this is particularly relevant for skull base meningiomas where conformal techniques improve safety [^116CUc7i] [^116pkVvW] [^111vK9rk].

> Let me reconsider the role of observation at the 3 cm threshold. Although many incidental meningiomas grow slowly, tumors ≥ 3 cm demonstrate higher absolute growth and progression risk, so if observation is chosen, I should commit to close follow-up and a low threshold to escalate if growth accelerates or new risk features appear, recognizing that most progression requiring intervention occurs within 5 years [^115DHpJs] [^111YkPyC].

> I should confirm how to handle suspected or confirmed higher-grade histology. For WHO grade 2 with subtotal resection, adjuvant RT at 54–60 Gy is recommended, and for WHO grade 3, postoperative RT to 59.4–60 Gy with wider margins is standard, with dose escalation strategies considered in select cases and ongoing trials addressing the role of RT after gross total resection of atypical meningiomas [^116pkVvW] [^112uLmmH] [^1112E8R7].

> Next, I should review patient-specific modifiers. In elderly patients or those with significant comorbidity, the balance may favor observation or primary radiotherapy rather than aggressive resection, whereas in younger patients with long life expectancy, earlier definitive treatment may be prioritized to mitigate cumulative risk from growth or multiple interventions [^111joV3b] [^1113zZrW].

> I will now examine surveillance after definitive treatment. After gross total resection of a presumed grade 1 tumor, MRI at 3–6 months and then annually for 5 years is reasonable, with longer intervals thereafter if stable, whereas after subtotal resection or any radiotherapy, closer intervals every 3–6 months initially are prudent, and for recurrent or high-grade disease, lifelong imaging every 6–12 months is appropriate [^111WLgvs] [^115c8YXD].

> Let me think about triggers to escalate during observation. Any new symptoms, development of peritumoral edema, documented growth exceeding about 2–3 mm per year, or proximity threatening critical structures should prompt reconsideration of surgery or SRS, and I should double-check that early intervention before the tumor exceeds SRS volume constraints preserves more options and may reduce morbidity in select cases [^1113zZrW] [^112yNj6G].

> To synthesize, for a 3 cm dural-based meningioma, I should confirm diagnosis and symptoms, stratify by size, location, edema, and growth, then choose among observation with structured surveillance if asymptomatic and low risk, upfront surgery if symptomatic or causing mass effect, or primary SRS or fractionated RT if surgery is high risk or declined. Postoperative adjuvant RT is indicated for incomplete resection or high-grade histology, and surveillance should be tailored to grade, extent of resection, and clinical context, with multidisciplinary input guiding complex skull base or high-grade scenarios [^115nQV2K] [^114AGWPo] [^1113zZrW].

For a 3 cm dural-based meningioma, **maximal safe surgical resection is first-line** [^111WyXHB] if the tumor is accessible and the patient is fit, as it provides tissue diagnosis and immediate decompression [^111NskP4]. If surgery is high risk or incomplete, **adjuvant radiotherapy** (SRS or fractionated RT) [^11355Y77] improves local control [^116zFH15] [^1112E8R7]. For asymptomatic, slow-growing tumors, observation with serial MRI is reasonable [^111YkPyC], but tumors ≥ 3 cm have higher progression risk [^115DHpJs], so **early intervention** may be justified [^115DHpJs]. Management should be individualized based on symptoms, location, growth rate, and patient factors, with multidisciplinary planning [^115nQV2K].

---

## Surgical management

- **Indications**: Surgery is indicated for symptomatic tumors, those with mass effect, rapid growth, or when tissue diagnosis is needed [^111NskP4] [^114AGWPo].

- **Extent of resection**: Maximal safe resection is the goal [^111NskP4]; Simpson grade 1–3 resections are associated with lower recurrence [^112tPdyf].

- **Outcomes**: Gross total resection (GTR) offers ~75–85% 10-year progression-free survival (PFS) for WHO grade 1 [^111WyXHB] [^1157C5HZ].

- **Risks**: Morbidity depends on location and patient factors; skull base tumors carry higher risk of cranial nerve injury and vascular complications [^111NskP4] [^114Hvwrz].

---

## Radiation therapy

- **Adjuvant RT**: Recommended after subtotal resection or for recurrent tumors to improve local control [^116zFH15] [^11355Y77].

- **Techniques**: SRS is preferred for small tumors (< 3–3.5 cm) away from critical structures [^117CwiDw]; fractionated RT (50–60 Gy) is used for larger tumors or near optic pathways/brainstem [^116CUc7i] [^111vK9rk].

- **Outcomes**: SRS provides 90–95% 5-year local control for benign meningiomas [^111vK9rk]; fractionated RT achieves ~90% 5-year control [^111vK9rk].

- **Risks**: SRS can cause cranial neuropathy or edema; fractionated RT has lower acute toxicity but may cause late effects [^116hXJRw] [^111vK9rk].

---

## Observation

Observation is appropriate for **asymptomatic, slow-growing tumors** without mass effect or edema [^111YkPyC] [^115DHpJs]. Tumors ≥ 3 cm have higher progression risk, so **closer surveillance or earlier treatment** may be warranted [^115DHpJs] [^111Eo91o]. Typical surveillance includes MRI at 6–12 months, then annually if stable [^115DHpJs].

## Factors influencing treatment choice

| **Factor** | **Surgical resection** | **Radiation therapy** | **Observation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Tumor size | ≤ 3 cm, accessible | Small, inaccessible | < 3 cm, slow growth |
| Location | Convexity, parasagittal | Skull base, cavernous sinus | Non-eloquent |
| Symptoms | Present | Minimal/asymptomatic | Absent |
| Patient age/comorbidities | Fit | High surgical risk | Elderly, comorbidities |
| Growth rate | Rapid | Moderate | Slow |

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

NCCN recommends **surgery for accessible tumors**; RT for residual/recurrent or inoperable cases [^116zFH15] [^115nQV2K]. EANO emphasizes **maximal safe resection** and RT for residual or high-grade tumors [^114AGWPo] [^116b5xk8]. ISRS supports SRS for small, benign meningiomas, especially at the skull base [^116hXJRw] [^113NZxRi].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

- **Systemic therapy**: Bevacizumab and somatostatin analogs are options for refractory cases [^114KWawP] [^115VWH2R].

- **Particle therapy**: Protons/carbon ions are under study for dose escalation with sparing of normal tissue [^111KXrPX] [^1112VPh5].

- **Molecular profiling**: May refine risk stratification and guide therapy selection [^112wG9c8] [^1153pwQS].

## Conclusion and recommendations

For a 3 cm dural-based meningioma, **maximal safe resection is preferred** if accessible and the patient is fit, providing diagnosis and immediate decompression [^111WyXHB]. If surgery is high risk or incomplete, **adjuvant RT** (SRS or fractionated) improves local control [^11355Y77]. Observation is reasonable for asymptomatic, slow-growing tumors, but **≥ 3 cm size increases progression risk**, so **early intervention** may be justified [^115DHpJs]. Management should be individualized with multidisciplinary input [^115nQV2K].

### Hypofractionated stereotactic radiation therapy in skull base meningiomas [^111Ciukv]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

To investigate the role of hypo-fractionated stereotactic radiation treatment (HSRT) in the management of skull base meningioma. Twenty-six patients were included in the study and treated with a dose of 30 Gy in 5 fractions with volumetric modulated arc therapy (RapidArc). Eighteen patients were symptomatic before treatment. Endpoints were local toxicity and relief from symptoms. Tumors were located in anterior skull base in 4/27 cases, in middle skull base in 12/27 and in posterior skull base in 11/27. HSRT was performed as first treatment in 17 (65%) patients, in 9 (35%) patients it followed a previous partial resection. Median follow up was 24.5 months (range 5–57 months). clinical remission of symptoms, complete or partial, was obtained in the vast majority of patients after treatment. Out of the 18 symptomatic patients, partial remission occurred in 9 (50%) patients and complete remission in 9 (50%). All asymptomatic patients retained their status after treatment. No severe neurologic toxicity grade III-IV was recorded. No increase of meningioma in the same site of treatment occurred; 16 (62%) patients had stable disease and 9 (38%) patients had tumor reduction. The mean tumor volume after treatment was 10.8 ± 17.8 cm³ compared with 13.0 ± 19.1 cm³ before treatment (p = 0.02). The mean actuarial OS was 54.4 ± 2.8 months. The 1- and 2-years OS was 92.9 ± 0.7%. HSRT proved to be feasible for these patients not eligible to full surgery or to ablative radiation therapy. Local control and durability of results suggest for a routine application of this approach in properly selected cases.

### From data to practice: brain meningioma treatment in elderly patients-a survey of the Italian society of neurosurgery (SINch ®) and systematic review and meta-analysis [^111joV3b]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Meningiomas account for 16–36% of all intracranial tumors in adults. Their incidence is about 1 case per 12,500 individuals in the general population but increases significantly with age, reaching 1 case per 2,000 individuals in those over 80 years old. Enhanced life expectancy and better diagnostic technology have resulted in more cases of symptomatic and incidental intracranial meningiomas, this suggests a growing demand for neurosurgical treatment, particularly in older patients, and raises questions about the best risk–benefit balance among available treatment options.

Traditionally, surgical resection remains the gold standard of treatment for large, symptomatic lesions, and rapidly growing tumors under surveillance.

The primary goal of surgical treatment is to maximize tumor removal while minimizing morbidity and mortality. In meningioma elderly patients (MEP) existing literature has demonstrated a broad spectrum of mortality (ranging from 0 to 45%) and complication rates (varying from 10 to 39%). Furthermore, several comparative studies have indicated that surgery in MEP carries a higher risk of mortality and morbidity when compared to younger patients.

The shorter life expectancy of older patients and higher comorbidities ratio has thus led to consideration of subtotal resection (STR) as an alternative to gross-total resection (GTR), often combined with adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), especially in skull-base meningioma (SBM).

In addition, the 'wait and see' strategy, especially in patients with comorbidities and minimally symptomatic tumors, might be preferred. Nonetheless, it was reported that elderly patients who opted for conservative treatment exhibited higher tumor-related mortality rates in comparison to those who underwent surgical resection. Furthermore, elderly patients appear to experience a higher occurrence of atypical and anaplastic meningiomas, which exhibit more aggressive behavior compared to benign meningiomas and have the potential to complicate the clinical progression.

A consensus on the surgical approach for MEP has not yet been reached, and there is limited establishment of predictive factors for this patient group who undergo surgical resection. This leads to the issue of whether the initial surgical intervention is equally effective for older patients as it is for younger adults, and whether the postoperative clinical outcomes in terms of complications, surgical morbidity, and mortality are comparable between these two age groups.

This investigation aims to elucidate the existing evidence and tackle the recognized challenges linked to MEP, discussing the current clinical mindset of Italian neurosurgeons in light of recent literature data.

### The concept, intention, and evaluation of the term treatment-refractory meningioma [^114qp4nk]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

We integrate findings from this present study with recommendations from previous trials and guidelines to enhance the consistency and clarity in defining "treatment-refractory" meningiomas. Four main areas were considered and summarized in Table 2: (1) definition, (2) endpoints, (3) clinical core elements and, (4) molecular classification.

Table 2
Recommendations for "treatment-refractory meningioma"

Definition

A critical element is to more accurately assess radiologically confirmed tumor progression before starting treatment, minimizing bias from different growth kinetics. The Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) Working Group proposed a definition of progression to allow for clinical trial enrollment: "… patients be considered eligible for clinical trials if there is 15% increase in the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of the contrast-enhancing lesions within the prior 6 months". As discussed in the EORTC-1320 trial, a treatment-refractory meningioma should specifically denote visible residuals – not gross totally removed lesions – measurable (minimum 10 mm × 10 mm) on MRI within four weeks prior to treatment initiation/randomization. Moreover, cases with extracranial metastasis should not be included.

Standard criteria should include patients who have exhausted conventional treatment options, specifically surgery and radiotherapy. However, this is difficult to generalize, as such considerations are site-specific and influenced by multiple factors, including local guidelines, clinical practices, and individual physician decisions. However, these criteria are essential for defining clinical eligibility as "treatment-refractory". Given the vast potential for inconsistencies, these critical parameters should be clearly detailed in a "Clinical core elements" section (discussed below). Finally, eligible patients must not have previously received systemic therapy for their meningioma.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: central nervous system cancers, version 2.2022 [^111WLgvs]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Meningioma — follow-up and recurrence management: In the absence of definitive data, clinicians should base surveillance on individual clinical conditions, with malignant or recurrent meningiomas followed more closely than grade 1 and 2 tumors. A typical low-grade schedule is MRI every 3 months in year 1, then every 6 to 12 months for another 5 years; after 5 years, imaging may be done every 1 to 3 years as clinically indicated. Upon detection of recurrence, the lesion should be resected whenever possible followed by RT; non-surgical candidates should receive RT; systemic therapy is reserved for unresectable recurrence refractory to RT; observation is an option if there is no clinical indication for treatment at recurrence.

### Treatment of WHO grade 2 meningiomas with stereotactic radiosurgery: identification of an optimal group for SRS using RPA [^115NXNTY]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study assesses a large multi-institutional database to present the outcomes of World Health Organization grade 2 meningiomas treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). We also compare the 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) to that reported in the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0539 phase 2 cooperative group meningioma trial.

Methods and Materials

From an international, multicenter group, data were collected for grade 2 meningioma patients treated with SRS for demonstrable tumor from 1994 to 2019. Statistical methods used included the Kaplan-Meier method, Cox proportional hazards analysis, and recursive partitioning analysis.

Results

Two hundred thirty-three patients treated at 12 institutions were included. Patients presented at a median age of 60 years (range, 13–90), and many had at least 2 prior resections (30%) or radiation therapy (22%). Forty-eight percent of patients had prior gross total resection. At SRS, the median treatment volume was 6.1 cm³ (0.1–97.6). A median 15 Gy (10–30) was delivered to a median percent isodose of 50 (30–80), most commonly in 1 fraction (95%). A model was developed using recursive partitioning analysis, with one point attributed to age > 50 years, treatment volume > 11.5 cm³, and prior radiation therapy or multiple surgeries. The good-prognostic group (score, 0–1) had improved PFS (P < .005) and time to local failure (P < .005) relative to the poor-prognostic group (score, 2–3). Age > 50 years (hazard ratio = 1.85 [95% confidence interval, 1.09–3.14]) and multiple prior surgeries (hazard ratio = 1.80 [1.09–2.99]) also portended reduced PFS in patients without prior radiation therapy. Two hundred eighteen of 233 patients in this study qualified for the high-risk group of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0539, and they demonstrated similar outcomes (3-year PFS: 53.9% vs 58.8%). The good-prognostic group of SRS patients demonstrated slightly improved outcomes (3-year PFS: 63.1% vs 58.8%).

Conclusions

SRS should be considered in carefully selected patients with atypical meningiomas. We suggest the use of our good-prognostic group to optimize patient selection, and we strongly encourage the initiation of a clinical trial to prospectively validate these outcomes.

### Proposed response assessment and endpoints for meningioma clinical trials: report from the response assessment in neuro-oncology working group [^117GmzNS]. Neuro-Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

No standard criteria exist for assessing response and progression in clinical trials involving patients with meningioma, and there is no consensus on the optimal endpoints for trials currently under way. As a result, there is substantial variation in the design and response criteria of meningioma trials, making comparison between trials difficult. In addition, future trials should be designed with accepted standardized endpoints. The Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Meningioma Working Group is an international effort to develop standardized radiologic criteria for treatment response for meningioma clinical trials. In this proposal, we present the recommendations for response criteria and endpoints for clinical trials involving patients with meningiomas.

### Meningiomas in 2009: controversies and future challenges [^115ogTQT]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Meningiomas are the most common intracranial primary neoplasm in adults. Over recent years, interest in this clinically diverse group of tumors has intensified, bringing new questions and challenges to the fore, particularly in the fields of epidemiology, radiology, pathology, genetics, and treatment. Interest in modern meningioma research has been stimulated by the high tumor prevalence and the advances in technology. The incidence of meningiomas is climbing, and may indicate increased exposure to environmental risk factors or more sensitive diagnostic modalities. Technological advances have dramatically improved radiologic imaging and radiotherapy treatments, and further refinements are under investigation. Furthermore, the current era of tumor genetics and molecular biology is challenging translational researchers to discover new, targeted, therapeutic agents. This review is an update on the recent advances in the understanding of meningiomas and their management, and highlights pertinent research questions to be addressed in the future.

### Multimodal therapy of cavernous sinus meningioma: impact of surgery andGa-DOTATATE PET-guided radiation therapy on tumor control and functional outcome [^115XJQTG]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Notably, volumetric analysis on gadolinium-enhanced MRI showed a significant smaller intracranial tumor volume in patients treated with FSRT alone in comparison to groups A and B. Due to this significant space-occupying effect in both surgical groups, surgical MSR was necessary to allow postoperative FSRT and relieve symptoms associated with the mass effect created by the tumor. Therefore, our study suggests a MSR followed by RT to optimize long-term neurological performance, corroborating results of other groups, pointing in a similar direction. We could not find a significant difference in total tumor volume, due to higher ratio of orbital involvement in patients treated with FSRT alone.

Regarding RT, 2 methods are commonly utilized to treat CSM: either stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), delivered with Gamma Knife/CyberKnife or a conventional LINAC) or FSRT. Both modalities were used as combined treatment after incomplete resection as well as sole therapy. SRS was performed to treat small volume CSM with a maximum diameter of 3 cm. Various published SRS series treated CSM with a median tumor volume range from 4 up to 14 ccm. On the contrary, FSRT is recommended for larger lesions, tumors compressing the optic pathway, or tumors with irregular borders. FSRT has been preferred over SRS in our cohort due to larger GTVs (median ranged from 12.4 to 12.6 ccm) and PTVs (median ranged from 42.3 to 54.2 ccm). Furthermore, in 37 patients who underwent FSRT (as combined or sole therapy), orbital infiltration was found in 25 patients (67.6%) and the infiltration of whole CS was found in 27 patients (72.9%). These factors aggravated the implementation of SRS and made FSRT the optimal choice for our patients.

Clinical core elements

Nassiri et al. recently provided a framework for clinical core data elements in studies on meningiomas to improve comparability but did not address experimental therapy or treatment-refractory meningioma. The current framework considers two modules: the patient-level module (including e.g. age, sex, receipt of prior chemotherapy, prior cranial radiation and chemotherapy, history of malignancy and multiple meningiomas, date of death) and the tumor-level module, which include timing of surgery, tumor size and location, resection extent/Simpson grade, histopathological grade, year of WHO classification, and time to recurrence. We propose an additional third module, specifically an experimental therapy-level module. The experimental therapy-level module should contain data elements on: agent used and mechanism of action, toxicities, definition of progression (preferably adherence to RANO response criteria), termination of experimental therapy in case of clinical deterioration, and cumulative dose at either recurrence/progression, death or study termination. Finally, transparency of what defined "depleted treatment options" locally is necessary to specify the treatments to which individual patients have become refractory, including the number of surgeries, radiotherapy (total dose in Gy and fractionation), and radiosurgery (total dose in Gy and target area in cm³).

Molecular classification

While not yet routinely implemented, molecular classification methods such as DNA methylation profiling may offer a more objective and reproducible framework for stratifying meningiomas, particularly in aggressive subtype. Ideally, these markers would constitute an independent parameter within the experimental therapy-level module of the "core elements. In the future, broader adoption of such techniques could enhance consistency in patient selection, risk stratification, and trial comparability. However, most current and ongoing trials have yet to systematically incorporate or report molecular data. Until molecular classification is implemented widely, harmonization efforts must rely on accurate histopathological grading. As demonstrated in this study, distinguishing between individual WHO grades remains essential for ensuring clinical and methodological clarity in the absence of molecular criteria.

###: meningioma [^113UVmeT]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Meningioma is by far the most common primary intracranial tumor in adults. Treatment of meningioma is complex due to a tremendous amount of variability in tumor behavior. Many patients are incidentally found to have tumors that will remain asymptomatic throughout their lives. It is important to identify these patients so that they can be spared from potentially morbid interventions. On the other end of the spectrum, high-grade meningiomas can behave very aggressively. When treatment is necessary, surgical resection is the cornerstone of meningioma therapy. Studies spanning decades have demonstrated that extent of resection correlates with prognosis. Radiation therapy, either in the form of external beam radiation therapy or stereotactic radiosurgery, represents another important therapeutic tool that can be used in place of or as a supplement to surgery. There are no chemotherapeutic agents of proven efficacy against meningioma, and chemotherapy treatment is generally reserved for patients who have exhausted surgical and radiotherapy options. Ongoing and future studies will help to answer unresolved questions such as the optimum use of radiation in resected WHO grade II meningiomas and the efficacy of additional chemotherapy agents.

### Efficacy and safety of gamma knife radiosurgery for posterior cranial fossa meningioma: a systematic review [^111yfqkF]. Neurosurgical Review (2020). Medium credibility.

The management of posterior cranial fossa meningioma [PCFM] is challenging and many neurosurgeons advise gamma knife radiosurgery [GKRS] as a modality for its upfront or adjuvant treatment. Due to the varying radiosurgical response based on lesion location, tumor biology, and radiation dosage, we performed a pioneer attempt in doing a systematic review analyzing the treatment efficacy and safety profile of GKRS for PCFM based on current literature. A systematic review was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses [PRISMA] guidelines. A thorough literature search was conducted on PubMed, Web of science, and Cochrane data base; articles were selected systematically based on PRISMA protocol, reviewed completely, and relevant data was summarized and discussed. A total of 18 publications pertaining to GKRS for PCFM were included with a pooled sample size of 2131 patients. The median pre-GKRS tumor volume ranged from 2.28 to 10.5 cm³. Primary GKRS was administered in 61.1% of the pooled study cohorts, adjuvant treatment in 32.9%, and salvage therapy in 6.5% patients. Majority of the meningiomas were WHO grade 1 tumors (99.7%). The pooled mean marginal dose in the studies was 13.6 Gy (range 12–15.2 Gy) while the mean of maximum doses was 28.6 Gy (range 25–35 Gy). Most studies report an excellent radiosurgical outcome including the tumor control rate and the progression-free survival [PFS] of over 90%. The tumor control, PFS, and adverse radiation effect [ARE] rates in author's series were 92.3%, 91%, and 9.6%, respectively. The favorable radiosurgical outcome depends on multiple factors such as small tumor volume, absence of previous radiotherapy, tumor location, elderly patients, female gender, longer time from symptom onset, and decreasing maximal dose. GKRS as primary or adjuvant treatment modality needs to be considered as a promising management strategy for PCFM in selected patients in view of the growing evidence of high tumor control rate, improved neurological functions, and low incidence of ARE. The use of multiple isocenters, 3-D image planning, and limit GKRS treatment to tumors less than 3.5 cm help to avoid complications and achieve the best results. The treatment decisions in PCFM cases must be tailored and should consider the factors such as radiological profile, symptom severity, performance level, and patient preference for a good outcome.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: central nervous system cancers, version 2.2022 [^116pkVvW]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

WHO grade 2 meningiomas — treatment should be directed to gross tumor (if present), surgical bed, and a margin (0.5–2 cm) to account for microscopic disease, with limited margin expansion into brain parenchyma if there is no evidence of brain invasion and CTVs edited and constrained anatomically. RT dosing is 54–60 Gy in 1.8–2.0 Gy fractions, and higher doses (59.4–60 Gy) are recommended for patients with subtotally resected disease or recurrent tumors. Select WHO grade 2 cases (recurrence post prior radiation and smaller size amendable to SRS) may also be treated with SRS doses of 16–20 Gy in a single fraction or consider hypofractionated SRT at 27.5–30 Gy in 5 fractions if near critical structures; optimal dosing has not been determined.

Meningiomas — general radiation treatment information states that sensitive and specific imaging modalities for radiation treatment planning can be helpful, including MR perfusion and PET imaging (eg, Ga-68 DOTATATE PET-MRI and/or CT). If appropriate, meningiomas may be treated using SRS or fractionated SRS. Highly conformal fractionated RT techniques (eg, 3D-CRT, IMRT, VMAT, proton therapy) are recommended to spare critical structures and uninvolved tissue, and stereotactic or image-guided therapy is recommended when using tight margins or when close to critical structures. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### An evidence-based treatment algorithm for the management of WHO grade II and III meningiomas [^116u3fE8]. Neurosurgical Focus (2015). Low credibility.

The management of WHO Grade II "atypical" meningiomas (AMs) and Grade III "malignant" meningiomas (MMs) remains controversial and under-investigated in prospective studies. The roles of surgery, radiation therapy, radiosurgery, and chemotherapy have been incompletely delineated. This has left physicians to decipher how they should treat patients on a case-by-case basis. In this study, the authors review the English-language literature on the management and clinical outcomes associated with AMs and MMs diagnosed using the WHO 2000/2007 grading criteria. Twenty-two studies for AMs and 7 studies for MMs were examined in detail. The authors examined clinical decision points using the literature and concepts from evidence-based medicine. Acknowledging the retrospective nature of the studies concerning AM and MM, the authors did find evidence for the following clinical strategies: 1) maximal safe resection of AM and MM; 2) active surveillance after gross-total resection of AM; 3) adjuvant radiation therapy after subtotal resection of AM, especially in the absence of putative radioresistant features; and 4) adjuvant radiation therapy after resection of MM.

Surgical Management

Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment for growing or symptomatic meningiomas (Figure 5). Goals of surgery, as defined by the 2021 EANO guidelines, are predominantly to obtain a tissue diagnosis, relieve mass effect, and alleviate neurologic symptoms if present. Notably, extent of resection is an important correlate of outcome, and maximal safe resection should be sought while minimizing neurologic morbidity in all symptomatic cases. To this end, surgical adjuncts including neuronavigation, ultrasonography, and intraoperative neuromonitoring are critical for tumors located in highly eloquent areas such as the cerebellopontine angle or foramen magnum, to reduce the risk of incurring permanent neurologic injury. Since some meningiomas are intimately associated with critical neurovascular structures, complete resection without unacceptable morbidity is not always possible; it is, therefore, important to standardize a maximally beneficial degree of resection for these cases in a meaningful way.

### Meningioma: international consortium on meningiomas consensus review on scientific advances and treatment paradigms for clinicians, researchers, and patients [^111igMeX]. Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Standard treatment guidelines for RIMs do not currently differ from sporadic meningiomas, with surgical resection as first line therapy for symptomatic cases. When multiple RIMs are present in the same patient, surgery should target the largest and/or symptomatic tumors first. Otherwise, active surveillance remains a safe initial strategy for these tumors, with a low rate of neurologic morbidity. The role of adjuvant RT for RIMs is unclear but may be utilized in cases of subtotally resected meningiomas or those that are higher WHO grade. However, even CNS WHO grade 1 RIMs can demonstrate aggressive behavior and many of these cases are RT-resistant. SRS in select cases however appears to be safe and well tolerated for RIMs that are not amenable to surgical resection or in patients with multiple RIMs that require treatment. Overall, tumor control rates following SRS are lower for RIMs than for sporadic meningiomas, and larger treatment volume is associated with worse PFS.

Meningiomas

Grade 1 Meningiomas

xRT given as SRS or SRT is frequently used to improve local control after incomplete resection of a large and symptomatic grade 1 meningioma arising at unfavorable locations or small asymptomatic meningiomas patients not in need of invasive surgery. Following a dose of 50–57.6 Gy given in 30–33 fractions, local tumor control rates reported in recent large retrospective series range from 90% to 100% at 5 years. In a series of 507 patients with a skull base meningioma who received conventionally fractionated SRT (n = 376) or IMRT (n = 131), Combs et al.have observed equivalent local control rates of 91% at 10 years for patients with a benign meningioma and similar tumor control rates have been observed in other large published series. Depending on tumor location, long-term toxicity includes hypopituitarism in 5%–15% of patients and decreased visual acuity or visual field defects in 0%–3% of irradiated patients; other adverse radiation effects such as cranial deficits or neurocognitive impairment are rarely reported; however, no results of neurocognitive formal testing have been reported in published studies. Using single-fraction SRS doses of 13–15 Gy, reported tumor control rates are in the range of 90%–95% at 5 years and 80%–90% at 10 and 15 years, with a variable improvement of neurological functions seen in up to 60% of patients. The rate of adverse effects is < 8% in most published series, including radiation-induced optic neuropathy and transient or permanent damage of cranial nerves located in the cavernous sinus (III, IV, and VI cranial nerves). Fractionated SRS (2–5 daily fractions) has been employed as an alternative to single-fraction SRS for relatively large meningiomas in close proximity to the anterior optic pathway. Using doses of 21–25 Gy delivered in 3–5 fractions, a few series report a local control of 93%–95% at 5 years, and this was associated with no ≥ 3 cranial nerves toxicity.

### The simpson grading: defining the optimal threshold for gross total resection in meningioma surgery [^116DFpnt]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Data recovery

Data were recovered from the local meningioma data base and have been extensively described previously. Briefly, archives of the Institute of Neuropathology were reviewed for all histopathologically confirmed meningiomas resected in our department between 1991 and 2018. Neuropathological diagnosis and histopathological grading had been performed according to the current 2016 WHO classification in all cases. Clinical and radiological data included age at diagnosis, sex, preoperative Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), and the tumor location, classified into "skull base" and "non-skull base" position. Surgery had been indicated for progressive lesions inaccessible for radiosurgical treatment and for symptomatic and/ or space occupying tumors. Maximum safely achievable tumor resection or reduction was performed in all patients, and the extent of resection was classified intraoperatively according to the Simpson classification by the attending neurosurgeon, as it is standard in our institution. As we aimed to analyze the prognostic value of the intraoperatively assessed extent of resection and, furthermore, postoperative imaging was not considered to further classify the extent of resection. Adjuvant irradiation was recommended for primary diagnosed anaplastic and recurrent or subtotally resected atypical meningiomas as well as for benign lesions after debulking. None of the patients received chemotherapy for meningioma treatment. Patients were followed up by clinical examinations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In detail, contrast-enhanced MRI was performed 3 months after surgery and then repeated in 12- and 6-month intervals in grade I and high-grade meningiomas, respectively. Tumor progression was evaluated by a team of two independent observers, including at least one neurosurgeon and one (neuro-)radiologist. Progression was diagnosed in cases of any detected tumor growth. Contrast-enhanced CT scans were performed in patients with contraindications against MRI. Data about progression were additionally updated by standardized questionnaires, which were sent to the primary care takers. Data collection and scientific use were approved by the local ethics committee (Münster 2018–061-f-S).

### Biology and treatment of meningiomas: a reappraisal [^1123pnJS]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Meningiomas are largely indolent tumors with a benign clinical course, but a minority exhibit aggressive behavior characterized by rapid growth, neurologic deficits, and increased mortality. Identifying high-risk patients requiring intervention is challenging, but recent insights into meningioma biology provide a useful guide for decision making. Standard of care for recurrent or biologically aggressive tumors consists of surgery and radiation therapy. Systemic therapies targeting vascular endothelial growth factor signaling and somatostatin analogues are potential options for those with refractory disease but display only modest activity. New paradigms in meningioma clinical trial design provide hope for improved options in the future.

### Stereotactic radiosurgery versus active surveillance for asymptomatic, skull-based meningiomas: an international, multicenter matched cohort study [^112yNj6G]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The optimal management of asymptomatic, skull-based meningiomas is not well defined. The aim of this study is to compare the imaging and clinical outcomes of patients with asymptomatic, skull-based meningiomas managed either with upfront stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or active surveillance.

Methods

This retrospective, multicenter study involved patients with asymptomatic, skull-based meningiomas. The study end-points included local tumor control and the development of new neurological deficits attributable to the tumor. Factors associated with tumor progression and neurological morbidity were also analyzed.

Results

The combined unmatched cohort included 417 patients. Following propensity score matching for age, tumor volume, and follow-up 110 patients remained in each cohort. Tumor control was achieved in 98.2% and 61.8% of the SRS and active surveillance cohorts, respectively. SRS was associated with superior local tumor control (p < 0.001, HR = 0.01, 95% CI = 0.002–0.13) compared to active surveillance. Three patients (2.7%) in the SRS cohort and six (5.5%) in the active surveillance cohort exhibited neurological deterioration. One (0.9%) patient in the SRS-treated and 11 (10%) patients in the active surveillance cohort required surgical management of their meningioma during follow-up.

Conclusions

SRS is associated with superior local control of asymptomatic, skull-based meningiomas as compared to active surveillance and does so with low morbidity rates. SRS should be offered as an alternative to active surveillance as the initial management of asymptomatic skull base meningiomas. Active surveillance policies do not currently specify the optimal time to intervention when meningioma growth is noted. Our results indicate that if active surveillance is the initial management of choice, SRS should be recommended when radiologic tumor progression is noted and prior to clinical progression.

### Stereotactic radiosurgery for benign (World Health Organization grade I) cavernous sinus meningiomas-international stereotactic radiosurgery society (ISRS) practice guideline: a systematic review [^113NZxRi]. Neurosurgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has become popular as a standard treatment for cavernous sinus (CS) meningiomas.

Objective

To summarize the published literature specific to the treatment of CS meningioma with SRS found through a systematic review, and to create recommendations on behalf of the International Stereotactic Radiosurgery Society.

Methods

Articles published from January 1963 to December 2014 were systemically reviewed. Three electronic databases, PubMed, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, were searched. Publications in English with at least 10 patients (each arm) were included.

Results

Of 569 screened abstracts, a total of 49 full-text articles were included in the analysis. All studies were retrospective. Most of the reports had favorable outcomes with 5-yr progression-free survival (PFS) rates ranging from 86% to 99%, and 10-yr PFS rates ranging from 69% to 97%. The post-SRS neurological preservation rate ranged from 80% to 100%. Resection can be considered for the treatment of larger (> 3 cm in diameter) and symptomatic CS meningioma in patients both receptive to and medically eligible for open surgery. Adjuvant or salvage SRS for residual or recurrent tumor can be utilized depending on factors such as tumor volume and proximity to adjacent critical organs at risk.

Conclusion

The literature is limited to level III evidence with respect to outcomes of SRS in patients with CS meningioma. Based on the observed results, SRS offers a favorable benefit to risk profile for patients with CS meningioma.

### Efficacy and tolerance of intensity modulated radiation therapy for skull base meningioma [^113fY14B]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The main objective of skull base meningioma treatment is to preserve neurologic function with minimal morbidity. In this perspective, RT provides an excellent compromise between these 2 constraints despite the lack of objective radiologic response in most cases. Furthermore, IMRT provides a high rate of clinical symptom improvement, and the current study demonstrated that adding a CTV margin is the only predictive factor of this improvement.

### Long-term outcomes for patients with atypical or malignant meningiomas treated with or without radiation therapy: a 25-year retrospective analysis of a single-institution experience [^112YvoQM]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

RT was considered adjuvant if delivered ≤ 4 months after surgery and salvage if delivered beyond 4 months after histologic and/or radiographic evidence of progression or recurrence. Given changes in RT techniques, equipment, and practice patterns at our institution, treatment courses were categorized into 3 eras for subgroup analysis: pre-2001, 2001 to 2008, or 2009 to 2017. These eras corresponded to conventional external beam RT and 3-dimensional techniques; fractionated stereotactic RT (FSRT) in a relocatable headframe and 3-dimensional or intensity modulated treatment plans or single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in a halo using dynamic-conformal arcs (both using 3-mm leaf-width collimator attachment); and image guided RT using a relocatable thermoplastic face mask (BrainLAB, Munich, Germany), daily image guidance with kV imaging, and/or cone beam computed tomography on a dedicated linear accelerator equipped with an integral high-resolution collimator (Novalis Tx or TrueBeam STx, Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA), respectively.

In this third group, the treatment of choice was typically hypofractionated SRS or FSRT using an intensity-modulated technique. The gross tumor volume during all these periods was based on the resection cavity and/or residual/recurrent enhancing tumor volume on magnetic resonance imaging. However, to limit normal tissue toxicity, the clinical target volume (CTV) evolved from a uniform 1 cm expansion of the gross tumor volume with an additional CTV-to-planning target volume expansion of 3 to 4 mm during the initial period to an anisotropic expansion of 5 to 10 mm in the plane of the meninges, and 2 to 3 mm expansion perpendicular to this plane into the normal brain parenchyma without an additional CTV to planning target volume margin.

### Meningiomas [^114ae3xe]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Meningiomas are by far the most common tumours arising from the meninges. Progressive enlargement of the tumour leads to focal or generalised seizure disorders or neurological deficits caused by compression of adjacent neural tissue. Surgery remains the primary treatment of choice, although the use of fractionated radiotherapy or stereotactic single-dose radiosurgery is increasing for meningiomas that are incompletely excised, surgically inaccessible, or recurrent and either atypical or anaplastic. Although most meningiomas have good long-term prognosis after treatment, there are still controversies over management in a proportion of cases. We review various features of meningioma biology, diagnosis, and treatment and provide an overview of the current rationale and evidence base for the various therapeutic approaches.

Radiotherapy and treatment planning

Target volume delineation followed international consensus guidelines and institutional standards. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was defined as the contrast-enhancing lesion or postoperative residual tumor on MRI. The clinical target volume (CTV) was generated by adding a margin of 0.5–1.0 cm to the GTV to account for potential microscopic spread, with larger margins (up to 1–2 cm) applied in WHO grade II–III meningiomas depending on anatomical site and individual risk factors. The planning target volume (PTV) was created by expanding the CTV by 2–5 mm to compensate for setup uncertainties, immobilization accuracy, and institutional image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) protocols. For skull base tumors, delineation adhered to ESTRO-ACROP consensus recommendations where applicable.

Treatment modality (photon vs. particle therapy) was selected through interdisciplinary tumor board discussion. Of the entire cohort (n = 97), 56 patients (57.7%) received photon radiotherapy and 41 patients (42.3%) underwent particle therapy, including 38 with protons (39.2%) and 3 with carbon ions (3.1%). No bimodal photon–particle regimens were used.

Photon radiotherapy was delivered with conformal, intensity-modulated, or IGRT techniques. The prescribed dose ranged from 34 to 68 Gy (mean 58.8 Gy; median 59.4 Gy; SD ± 6.5 Gy), in line with current recommendations. Proton and carbon ion therapy were prescribed at total doses of 45–64 Gy(RBE) (mean 58.6 Gy; median 59.4 Gy; SD ± 3.1 Gy), delivered in 1.8–3.0 Gy(RBE) fractions. Carbon ion therapy (n = 3) was administered using fractionated regimens according to institutional protocols. Dose prescriptions considered relative biological effectiveness (RBE) and linear energy transfer (LET) distribution, with optimization aimed at minimizing high-LET exposure to adjacent organs at risk.

### Meningioma: international consortium on meningiomas consensus review on scientific advances and treatment paradigms for clinicians, researchers, and patients [^116pZX86]. Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

In a meta-analysis of non-cavernous sinus CNS WHO grade 1 meningiomas treated with SRS or HSRT, local control rates ranged from 71% to 100% (median 94.2%) while PFS ranged from 55% to 97% (median 89.4%) with a median follow-up of at least 3 years. Factors associated with improved tumor control included smaller tumor volume and patient age under 65 years. Local control and PFS rates for cavernous sinus meningiomas appear to be more favorable, with 5-year PFS rates ranging from 86% to 99% and 10-year PFS rates from 69% to 97%. Factors associated with improved local control following SRS included higher marginal dose, small-to-medium sized tumors (generally < 10 cc), CNS WHO grade 1, primary SRS (vs adjuvant), treatment within 1 year of symptom onset, female sex, younger age, and less conformal plans. By contrast, tumor volume > 10 cc, parasagittal/parafalcine tumor location, and venous sinus invasion were associated with worse tumor control and an increased rate of complications after SRS.,

The evidence on SRS for higher grade meningiomas (CNS WHO grades 2 and 3) is limited. However, tumor control in histologically confirmed higher-grade meningiomas is typically poor, with one series reporting rates as low as 50% and 17% at 2–2.5 years for WHO grade 2 and 3 meningiomas respectively. A recent multicenter study of 233 WHO grade 2 meningiomas found a similar 3-year PFS rate of 53.9% after SRS, with a 5-year PFS rate of 33.1%. When recursive partitioning analysis was performed, 2 subgroups were identified with divergent prognoses. Poor outcomes were associated with patient age over 50 years, multiple prior resections or prior RT, and treatment volume > 11.5 cm 3. There are limited data on whether higher SRS doses or hypofractionated treatment regimens are advantageous for higher grade meningiomas and existing evidence is confounded by clinical factors such as pretreatment clinical history, treatment timing, and RT field. Therefore, prospective studies are needed, particularly for cases with treatment equipoise. Importantly, as with external beam RT, given the lack of molecular stratification in the current SRS literature, future studies should focus on incorporating molecular criteria into retrospective and prospective analyses.

### Radiotherapy intensification for atypical and malignant meningiomas: a systematic review [^1176SYAW]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The outcomes of nonbenign (WHO Grades 2 and 3 [G2, G3]) meningiomas are suboptimal and radiotherapy (RT) dose intensification strategies have been investigated. The purpose of this review is to report on clinical practice and outcomes with particular attention to RT doses and techniques.

Methods

The PICO criteria (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes) were used to frame the research question, directed at outlining the clinical outcomes in patients with G2–3 meningiomas treated with RT. The same search strategy was run in Embase and MEDLINE and, after deduplication, returned 1 807 records. These were manually screened for relevance and 25 were included.

Results

Tumor outcomes and toxicities are not uniformly reported in the selected studies since different endpoints and time points have been used by different authors. Many risk factors for worse outcomes are described, the most common being suboptimal RT. This includes no or delayed RT, low doses, and older techniques. A positive association between RT dose and progression-free survival (PFS) has been highlighted by analyzing the studies in this review (10/25) that report the same endpoint (5y-PFS).

Conclusions

This literature review has shown that standard practice RT leads to suboptimal tumor control rates in G2–3 meningiomas, with a significant proportion of disease recurring after a relatively short follow-up. Randomized controlled trials are needed in this setting to define the optimal RT approach. Given the increasing data to suggest a benefit of higher RT doses for high-risk meningiomas, novel RT technologies with highly conformal dose distributions are preferential to achieve optimal target coverage and organs at risk sparing.

### Introduction: ongoing clinical challenges in the management of meningiomas and future directions [^113RiXbB]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Although traditionally thought of as a benign tumor, meningiomas, particularly clinically aggressive variants, can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite recent advances in the molecular profiling of meningiomas, there still exists noteworthy challenges in the clinical management of these tumors that can create uncertainty for both healthcare providers and patients. The aim of this Special Issue is to provide a comprehensive review of the current evidence on the clinical management of select meningiomas and meningioma patient populations, written and curated by experts in their respective fields. In doing so, we hope this issue will help guide clinical treatment, address knowledge gaps, and identify topical areas of current and future research that will improve the care of meningioma patients worldwide.

### Multiple meningiomas: epidemiology, management, and outcomes [^114BCM7c]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Surgery

Surgery is the primary treatment modality for the majority of symptomatic or growing meningiomas in patients with both SM and MM, aiming to relieve mass effect and neurological symptoms, as well as obtain a tissue diagnosis. Despite the lack of randomized trials comparing surgery to other therapies, this is a well-established approach. The evidence for surgery as first-line treatment stems from many case series showing that the extent of resection (EOR) is an important prognostic factor. The primary goal of meningioma surgery is maximum safe resection, with low morbidity and preservation of neurological and cognitive function. If possible, the aim is gross total resection (GTR), but the EOR is additionally determined by a number of factors, including tumor location, consistency, and size, as well as proximity to or involvement of critical neurovascular structures. The principles are the same in patients with MM, but surgical decisions are more challenging as resection of more than 1 tumor may be necessary although removal of all tumors is seldom a reasonable goal. Tumors may be left after successful surgery, as the procedure should be focused on the symptomatic or growing tumors. Thus, patients with MM are rarely "cured" with surgery in the same sense that those with SM may be. When GTR is not a realistic goal, the aim should be a safe subtotal resection with preservation of neurological and cognitive function. The management of residual tumors should be individualized, with options including monitoring, postoperative conformal fractionated radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).

Before the surgery, it is vital to discuss with the patient the surgical goals, as well as the surgical risks. In patients with MM, it is important to clearly explain the goals of treatment, particularly where not all tumors can be removed and disease control is the aim. The patient should be prepared for multiple treatments and lifelong surveillance.

### Stereotactic radiosurgery and stereotactic radiotherapy in the treatment of skull base meningiomas [^115qR3Ee]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Meningiomas are the most common nonglial brain tumors. They tend to be slow growing and benign and can reach substantial sizes before becoming symptomatic. Complete surgical resection of intracranial meningiomas remains the treatment of choice. Location of a meningioma within the cranial vault may make complete surgical resection unlikely; tumors arising from the dura of the skull base are particularly challenging. Advances in radiation therapy, including stereotactic techniques, can expand the options for treatment available in these situations. They may be used as adjuncts to surgery or as alternative modalities in the treatment of these complex tumors.

Treatment Recommendations

The therapeutic strategies for patients with MM must be customized because of the nature of the tumors and the potential consequences of treatment for different patients vary considerably. In patients with MM, the overall goal is tumor control, as surgical removal of all tumors is seldom possible, and it is necessary to have the perspective of chronic disease. The multiplicity brings particular challenges, including localizing the symptomatic lesion or lesions, choosing the most suitable treatment modality, avoiding treatment risks, and predicting the behavior of individual untreated tumors. It is crucial to consider that a patient with MM might need repeated treatments over their lifetime (Figure 1).

An important consideration is the likely growth rate of any tumor. The natural history and growth rate of MM were investigated by Wong et al 2013. They analyzed 55 tumors in 12 patients with an average follow-up of 61 months (range 24–101 months). They reported an average growth rate of 0.46 cm³/year (range 0.57–2.94 cm³/year), which is similar to that reported for incidental found SM. The relationship between tumor multiplicity and growth rates was also analyzed, but no correlation between the number of meningiomas per patient and growth rate was observed.

Although meningiomas are common, the levels of evidence for their treatment are surprisingly low. Management might appear to be standardized, but controlled clinical trials are uncommon, so standards of care are to a great extent defined by local experience, long-standing tradition, and occasionally experience-based practice. Furthermore, in many cases, more than 1 treatment option is reasonable. In 2016, the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) issued its first guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of meningiomas. Since then, the level of evidence for diagnostic and clinical decisions has increased, including data from controlled clinical trials and the new fifth Edition of the WHO Classification of Central Nervous System Tumors. Therefore, EANO has updated its meningioma treatment guideline in 2021. Specific recommendations regarding MM are not discussed in these guidelines but are warranted. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to present management guidelines for MM (Figures 2 and 3).

### Radiotherapy and radiosurgery for meningiomas [^117CwiDw]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

In general, meningiomas smaller than 2–3cm in diameter or 10cc in volume, with well-defined margins and an adequate distance from critical structures such as the optic nerve/chiasm or brainstem can be effectively treated with single-fraction SRS, with toxicity rates of approximately 10% or less even for low-grade complications. For WHO grade 1 meningiomas or imaging-defined meningiomas, the target typically contains little or no dural margin and excludes the dural tail, with no apparent detriment in local control. At 10 years, reported local control ranges from 83 to 92%. Regional recurrence is possible, with some series with long-term follow-up reporting rates of 15–20% at timepoints past 10 years. For larger meningiomas or meningiomas in close proximity to critical structures, hypofractionated radiosurgery of 18–30 Gy in 3–5 fractions is safe and effective but is supported by less data than single-session SRS for smaller tumors.

The role of SRS is less well studied in WHO grade 2 and 3 meningiomas, but as with EBRT, in-field, marginal, and distant intracranial progression is common after SRS treatment of high-grade meningiomas. Due both to the propensity of high-grade meningiomas to infiltrate the dura and other adjacent tissues, and the smaller margins used for SRS, 5-year progression-free survival rates after SRS are low, ranging from 34% to 56%with many recurrences elsewhere in the untreated areas of resection cavities. Despite these limitations, SRS can be a versatile and useful treatment for meningiomas due to its exquisitely targeted and conformal delivery of high doses of ionizing radiation, for example in heavily pre-treated patients for whom large field irradiation may afford the unacceptably high risk of wound complications or radionecrosis. Interpretation of the available data supporting the efficacy of SRS as a treatment for atypical and anaplastic meningiomas is limited by the heterogeneity of clinical contexts, including postoperative treatment of residual tumor in the primary setting, salvage treatment of recurrent tumor after surgery and/or prior radiotherapy, or primary treatment without resection. There is limited data regarding SRS dose-response for WHO grade 2–3 meningiomas, and uncertainty among reports suggesting higher SRS doses as to whether higher SRS doses reflect a dose-response or are a proxy for larger effective margins. Further study of the radiobiology and underlying mechanisms of radiosensitivity or radioresistance in meningiomas is needed to guide this clinically versatile treatment.

### The role of simpson grading in meningiomas after integration of the updated WHO classification and adjuvant radiotherapy [^111cUg3R]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Incomplete resection of meningiomas remains an independent prognostic factor. The prognostic benefit of radical treatment of the dural attachment is questionable and needs to be weighed against the intraoperative risk for each case. Selected adjuvant radiotherapy is an independent positive prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival if applied for selected cases.

### Meningiomas: knowledge base, treatment outcomes, and uncertainties. A RANO review [^11226S2m]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2015). Low credibility.

Evolving interest in meningioma, the most common primary brain tumor, has refined contemporary management of these tumors. Problematic, however, is the paucity of prospective clinical trials that provide an evidence-based algorithm for managing meningioma. This review summarizes the published literature regarding the treatment of newly diagnosed and recurrent meningioma, with an emphasis on outcomes stratified by WHO tumor grade. Specifically, this review focuses on patient outcomes following treatment (either adjuvant or at recurrence) with surgery or radiation therapy inclusive of radiosurgery and fractionated radiation therapy. Phase II trials for patients with meningioma have recently completed accrual within the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer consortia, and Phase III studies are being developed. However, at present, there are no completed prospective, randomized trials assessing the role of either surgery or radiation therapy. Successful completion of future studies will require a multidisciplinary effort, dissemination of the current knowledge base, improved implementation of WHO grading criteria, standardization of response criteria and other outcome end points, and concerted efforts to address weaknesses in present treatment paradigms, particularly for patients with progressive or recurrent low-grade meningioma or with high-grade meningioma. In parallel efforts, Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) subcommittees are developing a paper on systemic therapies for meningioma and a separate article proposing standardized end point and response criteria for meningioma.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: central nervous system cancers, version 2.2022 [^116zFH15]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Meningioma — initial treatment and adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) recommendations: Meningiomas are typically diagnosed by brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and surgery or octreotide scan may be considered for confirmation. Patients are stratified by symptoms and tumor size; most asymptomatic small tumors (≤ 3 cm) are best managed by observation, otherwise patients should undergo surgical resection whenever possible, and non-surgical candidates should undergo RT. All patients with surgically resected grade 3 meningioma, even after gross total resection (GTR), should receive adjuvant RT to enhance local control. For grade 2 disease, postoperative RT is recommended for incomplete resection; after complete resection, postoperative RT may be considered although this remains controversial. Grade 1 meningioma may be observed following surgery, with postoperative RT considered for symptomatic disease, and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) may be used in lieu of conventional RT as adjuvant or primary therapy in asymptomatic cases.

### Low-risk meningioma: initial outcomes from NRG oncology / RTOG 0539 [^1157C5HZ]. Neuro-Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Three- and five-year progression-free survival (PFS) for low-risk meningioma managed with surgery and observation reportedly exceeds 90%. Herewith we summarize outcomes for low-risk meningioma patients enrolled on NRG/RTOG 0539.

Methods

This phase II trial allocated patients to one of three groups per World Health Organization grade, recurrence status, and resection extent. Low-risk patients had either gross total (GTR) or subtotal resection (STR) for a newly diagnosed grade 1 meningioma and were observed after surgery. The primary endpoint was 3-year PFS. Adverse events (AEs) were scored using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.

Results

Among 60 evaluable patients, the median follow-up was 9.1 years. The 3-, 5-, and 10-year rates were 91.4% (95% CI, 84.2 to 98.6), 89.4% (95% CI, 81.3 to 97.5), 85.0% (95% CI, 75.3 to 94.7) for PFS and 98.3% (95% CI, 94.9 to 100), 98.3%, (95% CI, 94.9 to 100), 93.8% (95% CI, 87.0 to 100) for overall survival (OS), respectively. With centrally confirmed GTR, 3/5/10y PFS and OS rates were 94.3/94.3/87.6% and 97.1/97.1/90.4%. With STR, 3/5/10y PFS rates were 83.1/72.7/72.7% and 10y OS 100%. Five patients reported one grade 3, four grade 2, and five grade 1 AEs. There were no grade 4 or 5 AEs.

Conclusions

These results prospectively validate high PFS and OS for low-risk meningioma managed surgically but raise questions regarding optimal management following STR, a subcohort that could potentially benefit from adjuvant therapy.

### Meningioma: international consortium on meningiomas consensus review on scientific advances and treatment paradigms for clinicians, researchers, and patients [^1112E8R7]. Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

The use of adjuvant RT in all CNS WHO grade 3 meningiomas and partially resected CNS WHO grade 2 meningiomas (so-called "high-risk" cases) is supported by the same RTOG-0539 trial, which treated these cases with intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) with 60 Gy over 30 fractions. This achieved a 3-year PFS of 58.8% and overall survival of 78.6% in 51 enrolled patients, with minimal adverse effects (one grade 5 necrosis-related complication in a patient with a large RT treatment field, all others being grades 1–3 adverse events). Additionally, EORTC 22042–26042, a non-randomized phase II study of patients with WHO grade 2 meningioma who underwent complete resection and postoperative RT (60 Gy), achieved an encouraging 3-year PFS of 88.7%. With improvements in RT technology, dose escalation has been proposed as a strategy for higher-grade (WHO grade 2 or 3) meningiomas. The phase II MARCIE trial utilized a carbon-ion (C12) boost of 18 Gy over 6 fractions combined with IMRT or fractionated stereotactic RT of 50.4 Gy/28 fractions for incompletely resected WHO grade 2 meningiomas, with resultant 3-year PFS and local control rates of 80.3% and 86.7%, respectively. However, a higher-than-expected proportion of patients developed radiation-induced contrast enhancement post-treatment and the study was prematurely terminated due to one treatment-associated death. A large, single-center retrospective study from Toronto found that dose escalation of conventional photon-based RT to 66–70 Gy over 33–35 fractions for WHO grades 2 and 3 meningiomas (both as adjuvant and salvage treatment) led to improvements in local control and PFS compared to standard dose RT regimens (59.4–60 Gy/30–33 Fr), without a significant difference in treatment-related adverse events, although the authors acknowledged likely underreporting of these toxicities. Given these uncertainties, a randomized controlled trial may be needed to answer the question of optimal RT dosing for higher-grade meningiomas. Several other retrospective studies also supported the use of adjuvant RT in CNS WHO grade 2 and 3 meningiomas but these studies were often limited by small sample sizes, non-standardized RT doses/techniques, lack of distinction between local and out-of-field treatment failures, and evolving WHO criteria. There continues to be controversy surrounding the benefit of adjuvant RT in patients with completely resected CNS WHO grade 2 meningiomas, a group wherein the guidelines remain equivocal. This critical question is being addressed with the ongoing phase III randomized trials NRG BN-003 (NCT03180268) and ROAM/EORTC-1308 (ISRCTN71502099) with results of both trials pending.

### Atypical meningoma: current management dilemmas and prospective clinical trials [^111NV2xz]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Atypical meningioma is an intermediate grade tumour with a greater risk of recurrence following surgical resection. Changes to the WHO classification have resulted in an increased reporting of these tumours. The role of early adjuvant radiotherapy after gross total resection has not been clearly defined and the literature evidence is of poor quality providing conflicting information. This review assesses the evidence for current clinical practice, management dilemmas and the need for prospective clinical trials for atypical meningioma.

### EANO guideline on the diagnosis and management of meningiomas [^114AGWPo]. Neuro-Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Meningiomas are the most common intracranial tumors. Yet, only few controlled clinical trials have been conducted to guide clinical decision making, resulting in variations of management approaches across countries and centers. However, recent advances in molecular genetics and clinical trial results help to refine the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to meningioma. Accordingly, the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) updated its recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of meningiomas. A provisional diagnosis of meningioma is typically made by neuroimaging, mostly magnetic resonance imaging. Such provisional diagnoses may be made incidentally. Accordingly, a significant proportion of meningiomas, notably in patients that are asymptomatic or elderly or both, may be managed by a watch-and-scan strategy. A surgical intervention with tissue, commonly with the goal of gross total resection, is required for the definitive diagnosis according to the WHO classification. A role for molecular profiling including gene panel sequencing and genomic methylation profiling is emerging. A gross total surgical resection including the involved dura is often curative. Inoperable or recurrent tumors requiring treatment can be treated with radiosurgery, if the size or the vicinity of critical structures allows that, or with fractionated radiotherapy (RT). Treatment concepts combining surgery and radiosurgery or fractionated RT are increasingly used, although there remain controversies regard timing, type, and dosing of the various RT approaches. Radionuclide therapy targeting somatostatin receptors is an experimental approach, as are all approaches of systemic pharmacotherapy. The best albeit modest results with pharmacotherapy have been obtained with bevacizumab or multikinase inhibitors targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, but no standard of care systemic treatment has been yet defined.

### Surgical strategies for intracranial meningioma in the molecular era [^115BsT5m]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Indications for meningioma surgery

Current initial treatment strategies for meningiomas include observation, surgical resection, and/or radiotherapy. Among these, radiation is widely accepted as a stand-alone treatment for a presumed meningioma or as an adjunct after surgery, but not within the scope of this review. Certainly, surgery is not indicated for all meningiomas. A range of factors impact the decision for surgical management and timing of intervention, including presenting symptoms, patient age, medical comorbidities, and tumor characteristics, such as size, the presence of edema and/or mass effect in the surrounding brain.

Intracranial meningiomas can often be incidentally found, more recently with increasing incidence. This is most likely due to an aging population and more frequent utilization of more sensitive brain imaging. Studies report the presence of one or more meningiomas on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans is nearly 1% of the general population. While there is no class I or II evidence to support a standard protocol, incidental, asymptomatic, small to moderate sized meningiomas without concerning radiographic features (discussed below) are generally monitored with serial imaging. The reported growth rates of untreated, incidental meningiomas, however, vary greatly. Growth has been reported in 11% to 74%, of patients, of which 0% to 56% become symptomatic. The majority of tumors grow less than 1 cm 3 /year, but growth can range anywhere from 0.03 to 2.62 cm 3 /year. These wide ranges underscore the relative biologic heterogeneity of meningiomas, emphasizing the importance of management on a patient-by-patient basis.

### The management of incidental meningioma: an unresolved clinical conundrum [^111gx6EE]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

The widespread availability and use of brain magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography has led to an increase in the frequency of incidental meningioma diagnoses. Most incidental meningioma are small, demonstrate indolent behavior during follow-up, and do not require intervention. Occasionally, meningioma growth causes neurological deficits or seizures prompting surgical or radiation treatment. They may cause anxiety to the patient and present a management dilemma for the clinician. The questions for both patient and clinician are "will the meningioma grow and cause symptoms such that it will require treatment within my lifetime?" and "will deferment of treatment result in greater treatment-related risks and lower chance of cure?". International consensus guidelines recommend regular imaging and clinical follow-up, but the duration is not specified. Upfront treatment with surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery/radiotherapy may be recommended but this is potentially an overtreatment, and its benefits must be balanced against the risk of related adverse events. Ideally, treatment should be stratified based on patient and tumor characteristics, but this is presently hindered by low-quality supporting evidence. This review discusses risk factors for meningioma growth, proposed management strategies, and ongoing research in the field.

Meningiomas in Patients With NF2-Related Schwannomatosis

Pathogenic germline alterations in the NF2 gene, whether inherited or acquired (eg, new germline variant), result in the development of the tumor predisposition syndrome NF2-SWN.NF2-SWN is a highly penetrant autosomal dominant condition with an incidence of 1 in 25 000 to 33 000. While classically characterized by the development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas, 48%–75% of patients with NF2-SWN will develop meningiomas at some point in their clinical course. Compared to patients with sporadic meningiomas, patients with NF2-SWN typically develop meningiomas at a younger age and are at higher risk for developing multiple meningiomas. Therefore patients with these phenotypes should be screened for germline NF2 and SMARCE1 mutations. The majority of NF2-SWN-associated meningiomas are asymptomatic and often diagnosed during the work up for NF2-SWN or over the course of routine radiographic surveillance. When present, approximately 10% of these meningiomas will grow rapidly (defined as ≥ 2 cm³/year by one study) while the remainder will demonstrate no or very slow growth. New meningiomas will develop in 20% of NF2-SWN patients. Importantly, patients with NF2-SWN who have a meningioma have been found to have a significantly increased risk of death compared to those who do not.

Given their complexity, the management of patients with NF2-SWN by multidisciplinary teams at high-volume centers has been demonstrated to improve both their quality of life and life expectancy. The majority of NF2-SWN-associated meningiomas can be safely observed including those that demonstrate slow, clinically silent growth. Surgery remains the primary treatment for symptomatic or rapidly enlarging tumors, although its risks must be weighed against the anticipated risks of additional or future operative procedures that NF2-SWN patients may need to undergo for their other neoplasms. Maximizing extent of resection remains important but even moreso here must be balanced against the risk of incurring a significant neurologic deficit that may irreparably impair their quality of life or make them ineligible for other required interventions.NF2-SWN-associated meningiomas tend to be more biologically aggressive than sporadic cases (52% are WHO grades 2 or 3), although this statistic may be confounded by a relative hesitancy on the part of most surgeons to resect the presumably more benign, slow-growing tumors in these patients.

### Hypofractionated stereotactic radiosurgery for large-sized skull base meningiomas [^112qvf4i]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Although stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been proven to be effective and safe for treating intracranial meningiomas, concerns have been raised about the use of SRS for large-sized tumors involving the skull base that frequently encroach onto adjacent critical neural structures. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of hypofractionated SRS as a therapeutic option for large-sized skull base meningiomas.

Methods

Thirty-one consecutive patients (median age: 55 years, 9 men and 22 women) who had been treated with hypofractionated SRS using CyberKnife for large-sized skull base meningiomas (> 10 cm³ in volume, median of 18.9 cm³, range 11.6–58.2 cm³) were enrolled. All patients harbored middle or posterior skull base tumors, most frequently of cavernous sinus (n = 7, 22.6%), petroclival (n = 6, 19.4%), or tentorial edge (n = 6, 19.4%) locations. SRS was delivered in five daily fractions (range 3–5 fractions) with a median cumulative dose of 27.8 Gy (range 22.6–27.8 Gy).

Results

With a median follow-up of 57 months (range 9–98 months), tumor control was achieved for 28 (90.3%) of 31 patients. Treatment response on MRI included partial response (volume decrease > 20%) in 17 (54.8%) patients, stable in 11 (35.5%), and progression (volume increase > 20%) in 3 (9.7%). Of 21 patients with cranial neuropathy, 20 (95.2%) showed improved neurological status.

Conclusions

Our current results suggest a promising role of hypofractionated SRS for large-sized skull base megningiomas in terms of tumor control and neurological outcomes. It is a reasonable therapeutic option for select patients.

### Radiation therapy for atypical and anaplastic meningiomas: an overview of current results and controversial issues [^114gSBXP]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors and account for more than one-third of all brain tumors. Based on local invasiveness and cellular features of atypia, meningiomas are histologically characterized as benign (grade 1), atypical (grade 2), or anaplastic (grade 3) tumors by the latest World Health Organization (WHO) classification scheme; accordingly, the proportion of meningiomas that have been classified as atypical and anaplastic meningiomas is around 20–25% and 1–3%, respectively. For both, surgical resection is the first choice of treatment; however, a significant proportion of tumors display a more aggressive behavior associated with an approximately 6–8-fold increased risk of recurrence and a significantly higher risk of dying of tumor progression compared to benign meningiomas.

Beyond surgery, external beam radiation therapy (RT) has been usually recommended to increase local control after resection of grade 2 and 3 tumors. The evidence supporting this treatment recommendation largely comes from systematic reviews including retrospective series and two recent nonrandomized observational prospective trials conducted by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG 0539) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC 22042); however, several issues remains a matter of debate, including the timing of the treatment (early versus delayed postoperative RT), the optimal radiation technique, and types of radiation dose and fractionation. One of the most controversial topics is the superiority of early adjuvant RT over observation in reducing the risk of tumor recurrence after gross total surgical resection in patients with atypical meningiomas. In addition, there is concern regarding potential risks of RT-related toxicity, which include but are not limited to neurocognitive impairment, hypopituitarism, and the development of a second tumor. Hopefully, these important questions will be answered by two prospective controlled phase III trials where patients were randomized to receive adjuvant RT or observation after surgical resection of an atypical meningioma: the recently closed ROAM/EORTC 1308 trial and the ongoing NRG-BN003 (Identifier: NCT03180268) trial.

In this review, we discuss some of the most recent advances in radiation treatment of patients with atypical and anaplastic meningiomas, as well as evidence supporting its use in the context of different clinical situations. The safety and efficacy of different radiation approaches and techniques were also examined.

### Exploring the role of radiosurgery for atypical meningiomas: addressing suboptimal local control in high-risk patients [^115z9f7v]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Meningioma, the most prevalent primary intracranial tumor, accounted for approximately 37,020 cases in the United States in 2022. While most meningiomas are benign (World Health Organization [WHO] grade 1) with favorable long-term outcomes, atypical (WHO grade 2) and anaplastic (WHO grade 3) meningiomas exhibit distinct clinical behavior characterized by aggressiveness, frequent treatment failures, and higher risk of dying of tumor progression.,

Because of the relative rarity of high-grade meningioma, available data predominantly stem from retrospective reviews. While it is well-established that recurrence risk is substantial following initial surgery, there remains a lack of consensus regarding optimal adjuvant treatment strategies. Addressing this gap, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0539 trial emerged as the first prospective effort to address this issue.

In the RTOG 0539 trial, patients were stratified into risk groups based on factors such as tumor grade, extent of resection, and recurrent disease. An established adjuvant algorithm was applied accordingly. High-risk patients, defined as those with subtotal resected WHO grade 2 meningioma, recurrent WHO grade 2 meningioma, or any grade 3 meningioma, received dose-escalated intensity modulated radiation therapy (RT). The prescribed dose was 60 Gy to a 1 cm margin and 54 Gy to a 2 cm margin. This approach yielded a reported 3-year local control (LC) rate (LCR) of 68.9% and an overall survival (OS) of 78.6%, demonstrating favorable outcomes compared with historical controls. However, despite these promising results, concerns regarding suboptimal LCRs remain.

One technique that has been explored to try to improve LC is stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Data exploring its role in patients with higher-grade meningiomas are based on limited retrospective studies, with widely varying rates reported in the literature ranging from 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) of 20% to 64.4%. The pattern of failure with SRS appears to be different than that with fractionated RT. While the most common pattern of failure after fractionated RT is within the radiation field (92.9% in the RTOG 0539 trial, high-risk group), the predominant pattern of recurrence after SRS seems to be along the margin of the prescribed dose. This observation suggests that failures less frequently occurred in the high-dose region and more commonly occurred at the edge of the field, possibly because of overly conformal treatment or the region of sharp dose fall-off where the dose may be lower.

Number of clinical responses of the patients with interval of improvement

No correlation was noted between clinical efficacy and sex (men [67%] vs women [72%]; P = 1), lesion topography (cavernous sinus [76%] vs other skull base localizations [64%]; p = 0.7), surgery (operated patients [63%] vs non-operated [79%] patients; p = 0.5), and techniques of RT (NFSRT [75%] vs HT [68%]; p = 0.9).

The clinical efficacy rate was 85% for patients with a CTV margin of 5 mm versus 53% for patients treated without a CTV margin (P = 0.06). An analysis of types of IMRT subgroups (ie, upfront, adjuvant, or salvage) did not show any statistical implication of CTV. The median PTV of patients with a clinical improvement was significantly increased (65 mL; range, 7.8–184.5 mL) compared with those without improvement (18.2 mL; range, 1.1–216 mL; p = 0.05). The median PTV for HT was 72.7 cc (range, 12.7–223 cc) and the median PTV for NFSRT was 27.9 cc (range, 1.1–149.2 cc; p = 0.0006). A larger PTV was not correlated with the number of symptoms per patient (P = 0.8). If PTV can be a significant factor of symptom improvement, this is independent of the type of device used to treat the patient. However, there was a strong correlation between PTV and the use of CTV.

### EANO guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of meningiomas [^116ikUC7]. The Lancet: Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Although meningiomas are the most common intracranial tumours, the level of evidence to provide recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of meningiomas is low compared with other tumours such as high-grade gliomas. The meningioma task force of the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) assessed the scientific literature and composed a framework of the best possible evidence-based recommendations for health professionals. The provisional diagnosis of meningioma is mainly made by MRI. Definitive diagnosis, including histological classification, grading, and molecular profiling, requires a surgical procedure to obtain tumour tissue. Therefore, in many elderly patients, observation is the best therapeutic option. If therapy is deemed necessary, the standard treatment is gross total surgical resection including the involved dura. As an alternative, radiosurgery can be done for small tumours, or fractionated radiotherapy in large or previously treated tumours. Treatment concepts combining surgery and radiosurgery or fractionated radiotherapy, which enable treatment of the complete tumour volume with low morbidity, are being developed. Pharmacotherapy for meningiomas has remained largely experimental. However, antiangiogenic drugs, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, and targeted agents are promising candidates for future pharmacological approaches to treat refractory meningiomas across all WHO grades.

Patient characteristics

We identified 45 WHO high-risk grade 2 meningiomas in 25 patients who were treated with SRS in the postoperative setting and had not previously received RT. The median age at the time of radiosurgery treatment was 63 years (range, 33–87) (Table 1). Eleven patients received adjuvant SRS following subtotal resection (STR), accounting for 12 meningiomas. We treated 14 patients in the recurrent setting, which included 33 meningiomas. Two of these patients had a STR of the recurrent disease prior to SRS.

Lesion characteristics and treatment details

The most common location of the treated meningioma was the convexity (46.7%), followed by parasagittal/parafalcine (37.8%) and skull base (13.3%) (Table 2). The majority of lesions (n = 33, 73%) were treated with sf-SRS, while the remaining 27% (n = 12) lesions were treated with hf-SRS. The median dose for sf-SRS was 16 Gy (range, 12–18 Gy), while for hf-SRS it was 25 Gy (range, 21–27.5 Gy) delivered in 3 or 5 fractions. The treatment target was to the residual disease in 35 lesions and to the surgical cavity plus residual disease in 10 lesions.

### The management of incidental meningioma: an unresolved clinical conundrum [^111HWAxa]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Upfront Intervention

Several studies recommend upfront treatment of an incidental meningioma. This is due to factors including uncertainty surrounding the long-term outcomes (beyond 10 years), location, proximity to critical neurovascular structures that would impede safe surgery if growth were to occur, and the chance of missing the window for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) if volume exceeds 10 cm³. In a study of 201 patients with < 3 cm meningioma, of whom 102 were asymptomatic, the overall risk of permanent neurological morbidity was 4.9% in asymptomatic patients compared to 23.2% in symptomatic patients. The authors concluded surgery may be considered as first-line management choice. After matching for patient age, tumor location, and extent of resection, another study demonstrated patients with an asymptomatic tumor had a similar risk of side effects, such as seizure (7%) and a new or worsening neurological deficit (9%), 1 year after surgery. In a meta-analysis, histopathological grading of an incidental meningioma often showed WHO grade 1 meningioma (94%).

Upfront treatment with SRS is an appealing option given the excellent local control rates (98%–99%), and the low risk of permanent side effects (2.5%–3%). The I ncidental M eningioma P rogression During A ctive S urveillance or After S t E reotactic Radiosurgery (IMPASSE) international multicenter study compared outcomes of 311 patients treated with SRS, matched based on age, tumor volume, location, and duration of imaging follow-up to a cohort of patients actively monitored. After a median of approximately 5 years, radiological tumor control was improved in patients who were treated with SRS (99.4% vs 62.1%). However, this did not translate into a reduction in the risk of symptom development (~3% in both cohorts). Interestingly risk factors for development of an adverse event after SRS treatment include a larger meningioma volume and the presence of peri-tumoral edema; factors that also predispose to meningioma growth.

### Incidental intracranial meningiomas: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prognostic factors and outcomes [^115DHpJs]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical implications

Active monitoring of incidental meningioma is becoming increasingly common, with recent guidelines advocating its use in asymptomatic patients demonstrating no radiological mass effect. However, while the guidelines recommend annual monitoring after a 6-month scan, they do not provide advice regarding the length of follow-up. This stems from the marked heterogeneity of active monitoring regimens, compounded by poor reporting of time to meningioma progression. Moreover, while the development of symptoms is a clear indication for treatment, no consensus exists as to what constitutes significant meningioma growth and when it may necessitate intervention. To this end, we analaysed growth dynamics for meningiomas greater or less than 3 cm. No significant difference was present in the relative growth rate; however, meningiomas ≥ 3 cm demonstrated a higher absolute growth rate (AGR) and a greater risk of clinical progression. This may suggest the use of AGR as a more clinically relevant measure of incidental meningioma growth, which has also been suggested to correlate with a higher WHO meningioma grade.

Only a quarter of patients undergoing active monitoring demonstrate radiological or clinical progression requiring intervention. Since most incidental meningiomas are histologically benign and the risk of treatment-related morbidity from surgery or radiosurgery is similar to those reported for symptomatic meningiomas, a policy of active monitoring seems justified. Meningioma progression and subsequent treatment intervention in the vast majority of cases occurs within 5 years of diagnosis. Given the current lack of consensus on the required duration of monitoring, this suggests that for those patients who do not have radiological and/or clinical progression, imaging surveillance beyond 5-years may be less frequently required or unnecessary depending on individual patient demographics including comorbidity. However, it is important to consider these results within the context of meningioma location. Skull base meningioma constitutes a different clinical and biologic disease entity, and the absence of a significant prognostic effect is most likely due to skull-base tumors comprising a minority of truly asymptomatic meningiomas.

Patients with ≥ 3 cm meningiomas and those with peritumoral edema are at a higher risk of symptom development and should therefore be more frequently monitored within the first 5 years of diagnosis. However, an early scan at 3 months is not necessary to rule out metastatic disease as no tumors were reported to be metastatic lesions radiologically misdiagnosed as a meningioma. An argument could also be made for early intervention in these cases; however, the optimal timing remains unclear and we envisage a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing early and delayed (on evidence of progression) treatment would help inform this decision.

In summary, radiotherapy and radiosurgery are integral components of comprehensive, individualized meningioma care. Radiotherapy is effective in improving local control and symptoms in both the definitive and postoperative setting and can be a useful tool to address areas that are difficult to access intraoperatively. Recent advances in the understanding of meningioma biology or imaging may improve clinical risk stratification of patients, or may refine patient selection for postoperative radiotherapy, radiosurgery, clinical trials, or imaging surveillance.

WHO grade 3 meningiomas — treat as malignant tumors with treatment directed to gross tumor (if present), surgical bed, and a margin (1–2 cm, depending on distribution of disease and histopathology). RT dosing is 59.4–60 Gy in 1.8–2.0 Gy fractions, and higher doses (66–70 Gy at 2 Gy per fraction) may be needed to provide durable local control of gross tumor but require highly conformal technique and respect of normal tissue tolerances; using techniques like IMRT with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) are helpful in these instances.

### Radiation therapy for atypical and anaplastic meningiomas: an overview of current results and controversial issues [^115S1JYq]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Meningiomas are the most common intracranial tumors. Most meningiomas are WHO grade 1 tumors whereas less than one-quarter of all meningiomas are classified as atypical (WHO grade 2) and anaplastic (WHO grade 3) tumors, based on local invasiveness and cellular features of atypia. Surgical resection remains the cornerstone of meningioma therapy and represents the definitive treatment for the majority of patients; however, grade 2 and grade 3 meningiomas display more aggressive behavior and are difficult to treat. Several retrospective series have shown the efficacy and safety of postoperative adjuvant external beam radiation therapy (RT) for patients with atypical and anaplastic meningiomas. More recently, two phase II prospective trials by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG 0539) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC 2042) have confirmed the potential benefits of fractionated RT for patients with intermediate and high-risk meningiomas; however, several issues remain a matter of debate. Controversial topics include the timing of radiation treatment in patients with totally resected atypical meningiomas, the optimal radiation technique, dose and fractionation, and treatment planning/target delineation. Ongoing randomized trials are evaluating the efficacy of early adjuvant RT over observation in patients undergoing gross total resection.

Radiation therapy for meningiomas — when safe GTR is not feasible, SRS followed by adjuvant EBRT has been shown to result in long-term survival comparable to GTR (86% vs. 88%, respectively), compared to only 51% with incomplete resection alone, and conformal fractionated RT may be used in patients with grade 1 meningiomas to spare critical structures. For high-grade tumors, postoperative high-dose EBRT (> 54 Gy) has become the accepted standard of care to improve local control, and in the phase II RTOG 0539 trial, patients with high-risk meningioma treated with IMRT (60 Gy in 30 fractions) had a 3-year PFS rate of 58.8%. The use of SRS continues to evolve; advocates have suggested this therapy in lieu of EBRT for small (< 35 mm), recurrent, or partially resected tumors, and nonrandomized and retrospective studies show that SRS is associated with excellent tumor control and good survival outcomes, particularly in grade 1 tumors, indicating effectiveness as primary and second-line treatment for meningiomas smaller than 3.5 cm, although optimal dosing has not been determined; SRS may also be considered in carefully selected patients with grade 2 meningiomas, such as those with recurrent disease.

### The growth rate and clinical outcomes of radiation induced meningioma undergoing treatment or active monitoring [^115DGpS1]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Radiation induced meningioma (RIM) incidence is increasing in line with improved childhood cancer survival. No optimal management strategy consensus exists. This study aimed to delineate meningioma growth rates from tumor discovery and correlate with clinical outcomes.

Methods

Retrospective study of patients with a RIM, managed at a specialist tertiary neuroscience center (2007–2019). Tumor volume was measured from diagnosis and at subsequent interval scans. Meningioma growth rate was determined using a linear mixed-effects model. Clinical outcomes were correlated with growth rates accounting for imaging and clinical prognostic factors.

Results

Fifty-four patients (110 meningiomas) were included. Median duration of follow-up was 74 months (interquartile range [IQR], 41–102 months). Mean radiation dose was 41 Gy (standard deviation [SD] = 14.9) with a latency period of 34.4 years (SD = 13.7). Median absolute growth rate was 0.62 cm³/year and the median relative growth rate was 72%/year. Forty meningiomas (between 27 patients) underwent surgical intervention after a median follow-up duration of 4 months (IQR 2–35). Operated RIMs were clinically aggressive, likely to be WHO grade 2 at first resection (43.6%) and to progress after surgery (41%). Median time to progression was 28 months (IQR 13–60.5). A larger meningioma at discovery was associated with growth (HR 1.2 [95% CI 1.0–1.5], P = 0.039) but not progression after surgery (HR 2.2 [95% CI 0.7–6.6], P = 0.181). Twenty-seven (50%) patients had multiple meningiomas by the end of the study.

Conclusion

RIMs exhibit high absolute and relative growth rates after discovery. Surgery is recommended for symptomatic or rapidly growing meningiomas only. Recurrence risk after surgery is high.

Figure 5.
Summary of most contemporary treatment guidelines for the management of meningiomas based on WHO grade, extent of resection, with the incorporation of molecular data if available. Content for this figure was partly adopted from Goldbrunner et al. EANO Guideline on The Diagnosis and Treatment of Meningiomas (2021) published in Neuro-Oncology. Used with permission. MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; SRS, stereotactic radiosurgery; fRT, fractionated external beam radiotherapy; GTR, gross total resection; STR, subtotal resection.

The Simpson grade, first introduced in 1957, describes the surgeons' assessment of the extent of resection for meningioma. It ranges from Simpson grade 1 (complete resection of tumor, affected dural attachment, and bone) to 5 (decompression/biopsy only) with higher grades associated with higher rates of recurrence. Complete tumor resection may be designated as Simpson grades 1, 2, or 3 depending on whether the underlying dura is resected, coagulated in situ, or left intact, respectively. While the Simpson grade has historically been a major predictor of postoperative PFS, its role in modern meningioma surgery has become somewhat controversial. For example, recent studies have shown that resecting the underlying dura (Simpson grade 1 resection) may not be associated with improved outcomes compared to other Simpson grades. This is important in cases of meningiomas originating from the skull base, where aggressive dural resection may be associated with increased risk of complications such as CSF leak or for meningiomas involving dural venous sinuses where hemorrhage, venous infarct, or air embolism are notable risks when pursuing aggressive resection. In these cases, achieving maximal tumor resection without excising the underlying dura may decrease morbidity without meaningfully affecting PFS. Additionally, skull base meningiomas are more likely to exhibit more benign biology, which is used as evidence for opposing viewpoints. On one hand, striving for a Simpson grade 1 resection in these complex cases may confer unnecessary surgical risk, thereby supporting a more conservative philosophy. On the other hand, complete resection in the context of a meningioma with more benign biology may provide an opportunity for robust oncologic cure, obviating the need for further surgery or adjuvant RT and this view supports a more aggressive surgical approach. The optimal strategy in these cases will depend largely on the surgeon's comfort level, experience, and of course, the patient's wishes and their risk tolerance for neurologic deficits, temporary or permanent, that may be incurred in an effort to achieve a potential cure. As an additive step to a Simpson grade 1 excision, a "Simpson grade 0" resection, whereby an additional 2-cm margin of surrounding dura is removed, has been proposed primarily for convexity-located meningiomas where this is most feasible. However, there are currently no well-established guidelines for the extent of dural resection recommended to optimally prolong time to recurrence and adjunctive technologies such as Raman spectroscopy or SSTR PET may help to better define this moving forward.

### Long-term experience of LINAC single-dose radiosurgery for skull base meningiomas: a retrospective single-center study of 241 cases [^115C2XMQ]. Operative Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is increasingly applied to treat meningiomas, attributable to their increased incidence in older individuals at greater surgical risk. To evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with linear accelerator (LINAC)-based stereotactic radiosurgery in skull base meningiomas as either primary treatment or postresection adjuvant therapy.

Methods

This study included 241 patients diagnosed with skull base meningiomas treated by single-dose SRS, with a median age of 59 years. SRS was primary treatment in 68.1% (n = 164) and adjuvant treatment in 31.9% (n = 77), using LINAC (Varian 600, 6 MeV). The median tumor volume was 3.2 cm³, and the median coverage dose was 14 Gy. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine predictive factors for tumor progression, clinical deterioration, and complications. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used for survival analysis.

Results

After the median follow-up of 102 months, the tumor control rate was 91.2% (n = 220). Progression-free survival rates were 97.07%, 90.1%, and 85.7% at 5, 10, and 14 years, respectively. Clinical improvement was observed in 56 patients (23.2%). In multivariate analysis, previous surgery (hazard ratio 3.8 [95%CI 1.136–12.71], P = 0.030) and selectivity (hazard ratio .21 [95%CI 0.066–0.677], P = 0.009) were associated with tumor progression and increased maximum dose (odds ratio [OR] 4.19 [95% CI 1.287–13.653], P = 0.017) with clinical deterioration. The permanent adverse radiation effect rate was 6.2% (n = 15) and associated with maximum brainstem dose > 12.5 Gy (OR 3.36 [95% CI .866–13.03], P = 0.08) and cerebellopontine angle localization (OR 3.93 [95% CI 1.29–11.98], P = 0.016).

Conclusion

Treatment of skull base meningiomas with single-dose SRS using LINAC is effective over the long term. Superior tumor control is obtained in patients without previous surgery. Adverse effects are related to localization in the cerebellopontine angle, and maximum brainstem radiation dose was > 12.5 Gy.

### Core outcome sets for meningioma in clinical studies (COSMIC): an international patient and healthcare professional consensus for research studies [^116A2vLo]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

The Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) Meningioma Working Group published recommendations for assessing response and progression in clinical trials involving patients with meningioma, due to lack of consensus on optimal endpoints and variation in trial design and response criteria. Whilst both of these initiatives highlight concerns regarding outcome measurement and reporting heterogeneity for specific issues (namely response and progression), no initiative has asked what outcomes matter most to key stakeholders (including meningioma patients) and what outcomes should always be measured, as a minimum, in meningioma clinical studies.

Clinical studies of incidental and untreated intracranial meningioma are uncommon, mostly observational, single-center, and retrospective in design. International consensus guidelines currently recommend interval MRI monitoring as the first-line management strategy for an incidental meningioma, but the interval timing, follow-up duration, and treatment indications are not defined. There is heterogeneity in imaging frequency and variation in clinical management between active long-term MRI and clinical monitoring or upfront surgery or radiotherapy/radiosurgery. The balance of the risks and benefits of active surveillance versus upfront treatment is also not well defined.

Recent work has attempted to accurately define risk factors for untreated meningioma growth. The Asan Intracranial Meningioma Scoring System (AIMSS) and Incidental Meningioma: Prognostic Analysis Using Patient Comorbidity and MRI Tests (IMPACT) calculator stratify patients based on the clinical and imaging features into risk groups. Definitions of growth or progression have not been uniform, which has hampered the synthesis of results; for instance, some studies report absolute changes in tumor size, whilst others report relative changes in tumor size. The RANO Meningioma Working Group has recommended that change with relation to time (rate) should be used, but this has been inconsistently applied.

A Core Outcome Set (COS) is defined as the minimum set of outcomes that should be measured and reported in all clinical trials for a specific health condition or health area.COS development is in its infancy within the field of neuro-oncology, but efforts are underway for pediatric brain tumors and have recently been completed for glioma.

COS development and uptake for meningioma would ensure that the outcomes that are of critical importance to key stakeholders are measured in future meningioma clinical trials and studies, and in doing so, tackle the issues described. Here, we present the results of The COSMIC Project: an international, multi-stakeholder, consensus-driven effort to develop two COS for meningioma. The results are reported in accordance with the Core Outcome Set Standards for Reporting (COS-STAR) statement.

### The management of incidental meningioma: an unresolved clinical conundrum [^112iVsMV]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The widespread availability and use of brain magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography has led to an increase in the frequency of incidental meningioma diagnoses. Most incidental meningioma are small, demonstrate indolent behavior during follow-up, and do not require intervention. Occasionally, meningioma growth causes neurological deficits or seizures prompting surgical or radiation treatment. They may cause anxiety to the patient and present a management dilemma for the clinician. The questions for both patient and clinician are "will the meningioma grow and cause symptoms such that it will require treatment within my lifetime?" and "will deferment of treatment result in greater treatment-related risks and lower chance of cure?". International consensus guidelines recommend regular imaging and clinical follow-up, but the duration is not specified. Upfront treatment with surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery/radiotherapy may be recommended but this is potentially an overtreatment, and its benefits must be balanced against the risk of related adverse events. Ideally, treatment should be stratified based on patient and tumor characteristics, but this is presently hindered by low-quality supporting evidence. This review discusses risk factors for meningioma growth, proposed management strategies, and ongoing research in the field.

### Stereotactic radiosurgery for intracranial noncavernous sinus benign meningioma: international stereotactic radiosurgery society systematic review, meta-analysis and practice guideline [^116hXJRw]. Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The issue regarding optimal imaging has not been defined yet; it is very important to establish a common strategy to delineate the TV and critical structures. Most studies define the TV as the contrast-enhanced tumor without margins. The role of biological imaging (CT/MRI positron emission tomography) requires a more in-depth investigation as well.

Finally, regarding clinical outcome and toxicity, it is well known that specific treatment-related risks are often closely linked to the tumor location. For example, skull base meningioma often involves cranial nerves, and sparing them becomes challenging both in terms of surgery and SRS. Parasagittal meningiomas are also associated with an increased risk of post-SRS edema, and there is a lack of outcome data co-relating the risk of edema with dose fractionation and volume. The results on neurological toxicity from this review suggest a low risk of neurological deterioration (median 7.4%) and a low rate of serious adverse events (median 8.0%).

The role of the tumor location in term of both tumor control and clinical outcome is also of importance and requires further investigation.

Cognitive status and quality-of-life were not analyzed in the literature reviewed and are an active area of investigation. A summary of recommendations based on this review of the evidence as endorsed by the ISRS are provided in Table 6.

TABLE 6.
Summary of the ISRS Recommendations for SRS and Meningioma

Key Areas for Future Investigation

– Although SRS in the treatment of intracranial benign meningioma is being increasingly used, the literature lacks class I and II evidence. Higher-level evidence is needed, particularly in regards to comparative analysis of SRS, HSRT, intensity modulated radiation therapy, charged particle radiation, and the various surgical techniques, in order to help clinicians make optimal therapeutic decisions.
– The timing of SRS (primary, adjuvant, or as salvage treatment) requires further investigation.
– Before HSRT can be recommended as a standard of care, mature follow-up of existing series is needed and ideally comparative clinical trials, especially for large or meningioma located in critical locations where SRS is limited by dose tolerances.
– Further research as to the ideal MR sequence to define the TV, including the dural tail, and the incorporation of multimodal imaging, including biological imaging, is needed.
– While there is consensus on the prescription dose for SRS, the best treatment schedule, dose-per-fraction, and total dose for HSRT require further investigations.

### Clinical features, surgical management, and prognostic factors of secretory meningiomas: a single-center case series of 149 patients [^116yeMYj]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Secretory meningioma (SM) is a rare histological subtype of the meningioma family. Few reports investigating SM have been published due to its extremely low incidence; thus, the current understanding of this disease is poor. We analyzed the incidence and clinical, radiological, pathological, and prognostic features of SM. Approximately 12,380 intracranial meningiomas were surgically resected at Beijing Tiantan Hospital between April 2008 and January 2017. All pathologically confirmed SM cases were identified. SMs accounted for approximately 1.2% of the intracranial meningiomas (149 of 12,380). The patients with SM had a mean age of 51.0 years and were predominantly female (112 female and 37 male). Radiologically, peritumoral brain edema was observed in 49 (32.9%) patients. Gross total resection was achieved in 115 (77.2%) cases. At the 35-months median follow-up (range 4–109 months), six patients had tumor recurrence, and one patient died from the tumor recurrence. The 5-year progression-free survival rates were 95.9%, and the 5-year overall survival rate was 99.3%. A skull base location and a tumor size ≥ 3.5 cm were significantly associated with poor short-term outcomes, and a skull base location was significantly associated with an increased risk of poor long-term outcomes (P < 0.05). A skull base location (OR 3.797; 95% CI 1.071–13.468; P = 0.039) and tumor size ≥ 3.5 cm (OR 2.616; 95% CI 1.107–6.181; P = 0.028) were independent risk factors for non-gross total resection. A son-skull base location (OR 0.070; 95% CI 0.028–0.177; P = 0.001) was the only independent risk factor that correlated with more severe peritumoral brain edema. SM is a rare subtype of meningiomas with a female predominance and low recurrence. Our results highlight the risk factors for short- and long-term outcomes, which can be useful for selecting treatments and predicting prognosis. Microsurgical treatment of a skull base SM remains a formidable challenge due to a large tumor size and critical neurovascular structure encasement.

### Meningioma: international consortium on meningiomas consensus review on scientific advances and treatment paradigms for clinicians, researchers, and patients [^113T7Wxq]. Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

There are currently no standardized response criteria or clinical trial endpoints for meningioma studies. Previous trials have used a modification of the Macdonald criteria (initially developed for high-grade gliomas), the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria for high-grade gliomas, or the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria for systemic cancers. While some trials have used a reduction in lesion size as a radiographic endpoint, meningioma control is better encapsulated by lack of growth (size stabilization) as a decrease in size occurs in only a relative minority of cases treated with RT over time (approximately 20%–30% of cases). Additionally, while overall survival is often the gold standard for determining treatment efficacy, the long follow-up time required to reach this endpoint for all but the most aggressive meningiomas presents a significant challenge, particularly for clinical trials. The RANO Working Group instead proposed that 6-month PFS could be a viable endpoint for meningioma drug trials with a 25% increase in the tumor's bidimensional product representing definitive progression. For patients enrolling in clinical trials, collection of pretreatment MRIs will be important to confirm adequate progression of the tumor during trial follow-up. In the future, measurement of tumor volume and assessing changes in the rate of tumor growth before and after treatment may be another method of evaluating the efficacy of novel therapies. For reporting in retrospective studies, the ICOM proposed the definition of tumor progression to be any radiographic progression that leads to a change in the clinical management of the tumor (eg, from observation to consideration for surgery, RT, or stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS]), thereby excluding cases of minimal radiographic growth or small volume increases followed by a plateau of stability that may not be clinically significant.

### Opportunities for clinical research in meningioma [^115Ai6T7]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Meningiomas, when benign, are commonly treated with surgical resection alone. However, the optimal treatment for patients with subtotally resected or recurrent World Health Organization (WHO) grade I tumors, or WHO grade II and III tumors, regardless of the extent of resection, is not well defined, with both a paucity of high quality published evidence as well as a perceived minimal clinical effect for currently available interventions, specifically in terms of prolonging survival. In consideration of the size of the patient population with incompletely treated or non-benign meningiomas, there are opportunities for conducting high quality, prospective, multicenter clinical trials. In this review, we discuss a number of trials that were attempted and/or completed by cooperative groups or clinical consortia, and describe areas of clearly unmet need in terms of defining the optimal treatment regimens. Finally, we discuss ongoing efforts to develop new trials to more definitively address important therapeutic questions.

### Surgical strategies for intracranial meningioma in the molecular era [^1133buFR]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Surgical resection has long been the treatment of choice for meningiomas and is considered curative in many cases. Indeed, the extent of resection (EOR) remains a significant factor in determining disease recurrence and outcome optimization for patients undergoing surgery. Although the Simpson Grading Scale continues to be widely accepted as the measure of EOR and is used to predict symptomatic recurrence, its utility is under increasing scrutiny. The influence of surgery in the definitive management of meningioma is being re-appraised considering the rapid evolution of our understanding of the biology of meningioma.

Discussion

Although historically considered "benign" lesions, meningioma natural history can vary greatly, behaving with unexpectedly high recurrence rates and growth which do not always behave in accordance with their WHO grade. Histologically confirmed WHO grade 1 tumors may demonstrate unexpected recurrence, malignant transformation, and aggressive behavior, underscoring the molecular complexity and heterogeneity.

Conclusion

As our understanding of the clinical predictive power of genomic and epigenomic factors matures, we here discuss the importance of surgical decision-making paradigms in the context of our rapidly evolving understanding of these molecular features.

### Incidence, management, and outcome of incidental meningioma: what has happened in 10 years? [^114zfufv]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

A Choosing Wisely campaign from 2014 strongly recommended against the radiological scanning of asymptomatic patients after syncope, head-trauma, and a normal neurological examination. In our cohort head injury was among the most common indication for imaging. For patients with obvious sign of traumatic brain injury, or presenting with other "red flags", neuroimaging has obvious benefits, such as guiding medical and neurosurgical interventions. However, for patients without symptoms, other factors must be considered, such as increased length of hospital stay, harm and cost from incidental findings, and risk of subsequent cancer due to exposure to ionizing radiation. Meningiomas presenting with focal neurological deficits and seizures have clear management guidelines, with surgery or radiotherapy as first line treatment, but that is not the case for incidental and asymptomatic meningioma. European Association of Neuro-Oncology and Response assessment in Neuro-Oncology guidelines suggest active monitoring, but this seems unreasonable in many of the scenarios where incidental meningiomas are detected. The guidelines further state that treatment should be kept for situations where symptoms develop, substantial growth occurs, or there is danger to sensitive areas. In lack of better selection criteria, clinical judgement is needed with respect to how incidental meningiomas are managed upon detection. Of note in the results of this study is that during both time periods around 30% of patients were deceased within 3 years after diagnosis, due to causes other than their meningioma. When discussing potential treatment and follow-up with a patient with newly diagnosed incidental meningioma, it is therefore of importance to consider not only factors related to the meningioma itself, but also factors related to the entire patient. Even at the event of growth, or even mild symptom development, one might consider withholding treatment or follow-up in patients with significant comorbidity, or short life expectancy.

Treatment overview — observation: Studies examining incidental meningiomas in otherwise asymptomatic patients suggested that many asymptomatic meningiomas may be followed safely with serial brain imaging until either the tumor enlarges significantly or becomes symptomatic. These studies confirm that many meningiomas grow very slowly and that a decision not to operate is justified in selected asymptomatic patients, and because growth rate is unpredictable in any individual, repeat brain imaging is mandatory to monitor an incidental asymptomatic meningioma.

### Incidental intracranial meningiomas: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prognostic factors and outcomes [^111Eo91o]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Incidental discovery accounts for 30% of newly-diagnosed intracranial meningiomas. There is no consensus on their optimal management. This review aimed to evaluate the outcomes of different management strategies for these tumors.

Methods

Using established systematic review methods, six databases were scanned up to September 2017. Pooled event proportions were estimated using a random effects model. Meta-regression of prognostic factors was performed using individual patient data.

Results

Twenty studies (2130 patients) were included. Initial management strategies at diagnosis were: surgery (27.3%), stereotactic radiosurgery (22.0%) and active monitoring (50.7%) with a weighted mean follow-up of 49.5 months (SD = 29.3). The definition of meningioma growth and monitoring regimens varied widely impeding relevant meta-analysis. The pooled risk of symptom development in patients actively monitored was 8.1% (95% CI 2.7–16.1). Associated factors were peritumoral edema (OR 8.72 [95% CI 0.35–14.90]) and meningioma diameter ≥ 3 cm (OR 34.90 [95% CI 5.17–160.40]). The pooled proportion of intervention after a duration of active monitoring was 24.8% (95% CI 7.5–48.0). Weighted mean time-to-intervention was 24.8 months (SD = 18.2). The pooled risks of morbidity following surgery and radiosurgery, accounting for cross-over, were 11.8% (95% CI 3.7–23.5) and 32.0% (95% CI 10.6–70.5) respectively. The pooled proportion of operated meningioma being WHO grade I was 94.0% (95% CI 88.2–97.9).

Conclusion

The management of incidental meningioma varies widely. Most patients who clinically or radiologically progressed did so within 5 years of diagnosis. Intervention at diagnosis may lead to unnecessary overtreatment. Prospective data is needed to develop a risk calculator to better inform management strategies.

### Improvement in visual outcomes of patients with base of skull meningioma as a result of evolution in the treatment techniques in the last three decades: a systematic review [^111o2Vhd]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We systematically reviewed visual outcomes over the last three decades in patients undergoing treatment for base of skull (BOS) meningiomas and provide recommendations to preserve vision.

Methods

In accordance with the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews, a search was conducted from 6/1/2022–9/1/2022 using PubMed and Web of Science. Inclusion criteria included (1) patients treated for BOS meningiomas (2) treatment modality specified (3) specifics of surgical techniques and/or dose/fractions of radiotherapy (4) individual patient outcomes of treatment. Each study was assessed for bias based on study design and heterogeneity of results.

Results

A total of 50 studies were included (N = 2911). When comparing improved vision versus unchanged or worsened vision, studies investigating surgery alone published from 2006 and onward had significantly better visual outcomes compared to pre-2006 studies (p = 0.02). When comparing improved vision versus unchanged or worsened vision, studies investigating combined therapy with surgery and radiation published from 2008 and onward had significantly better visual outcomes compared to pre-2008 studies (p < 0.01). Combined modality therapy was less likely to worsen vision compared to either surgery or radiation monotherapy (p < 0.01). However, surgery and radiation monotherapy were more likely to actually improve outcomes compared to combination therapy (p < 0.01).

Conclusion

For over a decade we have observed improvement in visual outcomes in patients managed for meningioma of BOS, likely attributing the innovation in microsurgical and more targeted and conformal radiation techniques. Combination therapy may be the safest option for preventing worsening of vision, but the highest rates of improving visual function are achieved through monotherapy when indicated.

### Dosimetric evaluation of fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy for skull base meningiomas using hyperArc and multicriteria optimization [^113NcVW3]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Base-of-skull (BOS) meningiomas account for nearly 35% to 50% of all intracranial meningiomas. The extent of surgical resection is a prognostic factor of progression free survival rates; however, the challenge of resecting BOS meningiomas using microsurgical techniques is the proximity to cranial nerves II-VI, brain stem, and the internal carotid arteries. In the 1990s, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) became an alternative treatment method, either as primary or adjuvant therapy for BOS lesions with similar 5-year tumor control rates and less morbidity than surgery. In the 2000s, improvements in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), image guided radiation therapy, and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), established radiation therapy (RT) as an effective method of managing BOS meningioma.

Hypo-fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (hFSRT), in 5 to 10 fractions, or fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (FSRT), in greater than 10 fractions, are techniques used when use of SRS may be prohibitive owing to tumor size, location adjacent to critical organs at risk (OARs), or other logistical reasons (such as inability of patient to lie supine for treatment duration). FSRT and hFSRT combine the precision of stereotactic immobilization and steep dose gradients while simultaneously providing the benefit of fractionation, allowing for normal tissue repair. Studies comparing SRS, hFSRT, and FSRT treatments for BOS meningiomas show no statistical significance in progression free survival and lower incidence of adverse effects using hFSRT and FSRT for larger lesions. RT-related toxicities for large lesions include increased risk of edema, radiation necrosis, clinical worsening of neurologic functions, and permanent neurologic deficits. The risk of secondary meningiomas developing after RT is also a concern for younger, pediatric patients.

### Meningioma: international consortium on meningiomas consensus review on scientific advances and treatment paradigms for clinicians, researchers, and patients [^112wG9c8]. Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors in adults and are increasing in incidence due to the aging population and increased access to neuroimaging. While most exhibit nonmalignant behavior, a subset of meningiomas are biologically aggressive and are associated with treatment resistance, resulting in significant neurologic morbidity and even mortality. In recent years, meaningful advances in our understanding of the biology of these tumors have led to the incorporation of molecular biomarkers into their grading and prognostication. However, unlike other central nervous system (CNS) tumors, a unified molecular taxonomy for meningiomas has not yet been established and remains an overarching goal of the Consortium to Inform Molecular and Practical Approaches to CNS Tumor Taxonomy-Not Official World Health Organization (cIMPACT-NOW) working group. Additionally, clinical equipoise still remains on how specific meningioma cases and patient populations should be optimally managed. To address these existing gaps, members of the International Consortium on Meningiomas including field-leading experts, have prepared this comprehensive consensus narrative review directed toward clinicians, researchers, and patients. Included in this manuscript are detailed overviews of proposed molecular classifications, novel biomarkers, contemporary treatment strategies, trials on systemic therapies, health-related quality-of-life studies, and management strategies for unique meningioma patient populations. In each section, we discuss the current state of knowledge as well as ongoing clinical and research challenges to road map future directions for further investigation.

Methods and Materials

Patient selection

Twelve patients previously treated at our institution with BOS meningiomas were retrospectively replanned. All patients were World Health Organization grade I; 6 received subtotal or partial resection and the other 6 patients were not candidates for surgery owing to proximity and involvement of the optic pathway. These patients were specifically chosen due to the target volume located adjacent to 1 or more OARs. The gross target volume was contoured based on gadolinium-contrast enhanced MRI; a 2-mm margin was used to create the PTV. The average PTV volume was 38.02 cm³ (0.90–114.68 cm³). The original plans were prescribed to either 52.2 or 54 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions to the PTV depending on OAR constraints.

Patients were immobilized in the Encompass SRS Immobilization System (QFix, Avondale, PA). The QFix Encompass SRS system consists of a 2-piece clamshell style mask attached to a U-shaped carbon fiber couch insert. It is a prerequisite for HA-HDRT delivery because the Encompass system is used to demarcate the patient protection zone in the treatment planning system. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography images were obtained on a Philips Brilliance Big Bore CT scanner (Philips, Best, Netherlands) with 1-mm slice thickness and fused with the contrast-enhanced MR.

Plan setup and optimization

Treatment planning was performed in the Eclipse Treatment Planning System v15.6 (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) on an EDGE linear accelerator (Varian Medical Systems) equipped with a high-definition multileaf-collimator. Plans were optimized using the 6 MV flattened beam with a maximum dose rate of 600 MU/min and calculated with the default HA grid size of 1.25 mm. The HA template includes 2 180° coplanar arcs and 3 additional noncoplanar arcs with couch rotations of 45, 315, and 90 or 270. For predominantly left or right sided disease, only 3 arcs were used with couch kicks of 0 and 45 or 315, whereas when the lesion was located more midline, an additional vertex (couch 90/270°) was added to the 3-arc beam arrangement.

### Radiation therapy for meningiomas-where Do we stand and what's on the horizon? [^1112VPh5]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2025). Medium credibility.

Radiation therapy, including conventionally fractionated external beam radiation therapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, and fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy, is a cornerstone in the interdisciplinary management of meningiomas. Recent advances in radiation oncology and also in other fields, such as neuropathology and imaging, have various implications for meningioma radiation therapy. This review aims to summarize current and anticipated developments, as well as active clinical trials related to the use of radiation therapy for meningiomas. In imaging, positron emission tomography has proven valuable for assessing the spatial extension of meningiomas and may enhance target delineation, treatment response monitoring, and recurrence assessment after radiation therapy. Particle therapy, including protons and carbon ions, as well as stereotactic radiosurgery and fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy, allow for conformal treatments that permit dose escalation in selected patients with high-grade meningiomas. Additionally, emerging integrated molecular and genetic classifications offer superior risk stratification and may refine patient selection for radiation therapy. However, there is a paucity of active meningioma trials directly investigating or refining the use of radiation therapy. In summary, significant advances in functional imaging, molecular and genetic diagnostics, and radiation treatment techniques hold the potential to improve patient outcomes and to avoid over- and undertreatment. Collaborative efforts and further clinical trials are essential to optimize meningioma radiation therapy.

### Meningioma: international consortium on meningiomas consensus review on scientific advances and treatment paradigms for clinicians, researchers, and patients [^1113zZrW]. Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

While many meningiomas are diagnosed symptomatically, approximately 20% are found incidentally, a proportion likely to increase with an aging population with increased access to neuroimaging. Incidental meningiomas can be a source of significant anxiety for patients, an economic burden due to the need for regular follow-up imaging, and a clinical dilemma for clinicians due to their unpredictable biology given the absence of diagnostic tissue. Natural history studies on incidental meningiomas typically only extend to the 10-year follow-up mark and most have found a relatively slow rate of growth (average < 5% volumetric increase per year). Approximately 5–8% of patients will develop new symptoms during a mean follow-up period of 4.1 years (standard deviation 2.4 years). Imaging features that may portend a higher risk of progression of an incidental meningioma include: lack of calcification, hyperintensity on T2-weighted MRI, presence of peritumoral edema, large tumor volume at diagnosis (> 10 cm³), non-skull base location, and closer proximity to a dural venous sinus. There are currently no standardized guidelines for the interval or duration of monitoring for incidental meningiomas. Although most meningiomas that progress will do so within 5 years of observation, some cases can remain indolent for a longer period before demonstrating accelerated recurrence or growth. Consequently, many clinicians may follow incidental meningiomas in younger patients for a longer duration of time, progressively lengthening the interval between neuroimaging while elderly patients may be discharged from follow-up earlier after a confirmatory period of radiographic stability. Several prognostic models such as IMPACT (Incidental Meningioma: Prognostic Analysis Using Patient Comorbidity and MRI Tests) have been developed to assist clinicians in tailoring follow-up to a specific patient based on individualized clinical and tumor factors but these models all require prospective validation. Upfront treatment of incidental meningiomas is also an option, with surgical resection for often larger tumors, and SRS as a reasonable option for smaller volume cases or for patients with contraindications to surgery. Decisions to treat usually hinges on a combination of patient wishes, clinician preference, and tumor factors including proximity of the meningioma to critical neurovascular structures such that further enlargement or growth could make later resection more challenging or higher risk. Newer technologies such as liquid biopsy or 18 F-FLT PET could be used to help predict the risk of recurrence non-invasively and better individualize management for these cases. While SRS improves radiographic local control of asymptomatic meningiomas compared to observation, this may not translate to a reduced risk of developing new symptoms over time. Furthermore, even though a subset of incidental meningiomas will grow radiographically, these changes may not become clinically significant until tumor size reaches a certain threshold or nears eloquent brain areas. As usual, treatment decisions should weigh the risks of progression versus the risks of intervention, while also taking into consideration the psychosocial, neurocognitive, and socioeconomic effects of active surveillance for the patient versus upfront treatment.

### Incidental intracranial meningiomas: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prognostic factors and outcomes [^114HNhwj]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Incidental, asymptomatic intracranial meningiomas are common with no clear consensus on the optimal management strategy. This review demonstrates a wide variation in current clinical practice. Considering that most incidental meningiomas are WHO grade I and reported treatment-related morbidity, the decision to intervene at initial presentation should not be made lightly. Active monitoring might constitute a better strategy and this study shows that the majority of patients who develop clinical or radiological progression will do so within the first 5 years of diagnosis. Regular monitoring may therefore be less frequently required beyond this time point. However, the data used to reach this conclusion has methodological shortcomings. Large prospective multi-center studies are required to develop management algorithms that minimize unnecessary treatment and optimize patient outcomes and quality of life.

Finally, patients undergoing primary RT for meningioma in lieu of surgery may undergo either SRS or fractionated external beam RT. While both have been associated with high rates of tumor control, the latter may be preferred for larger tumors (typically larger than 2–3 cm in maximum diameter but may be institution-dependent) or those close to radiation-sensitive structures such as the brainstem or optic nerves since fractionation optimizes normal tissue tolerance. Nevertheless, recent non-randomized evidence suggests that larger meningiomas may have worse outcomes with fractionated RT. Small cavernous sinus meningiomas and optic nerve sheath meningiomas; however, tend to be well controlled with primary fractionated RT and have similarly high rates of symptomatic improvement after treatment.

### Stereotactic radiation treatment for benign meningiomas [^111PVfPb]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

Meningiomas are the second most common primary tumor of the brain. Gross-total resection remains the preferred treatment if achievable with minimal morbidity. For incompletely resected or inoperable benign meningiomas, 3D conformal external-beam radiation therapy can provide durable local tumor control in 90 to 95% of cases. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) are highly conformal techniques, using steep dose gradients and stereotactic patient immobilization. Stereotactic radiosurgery has been used as an alternative or adjuvant therapy to surgery for meningiomas in locations, such as the skull base, where operative manipulation may be particularly difficult. Stereotactic radiotherapy is useful for larger meningiomas (> 3–3.5 cm) and those closely approximating critical structures, such as the optic chiasm and brainstem. Although SRS has longer follow-up than SRT, both techniques have excellent 5-year tumor control rates of greater than 90% for benign meningiomas. Stereotactic radiotherapy has toxicity equivalent to that of radiosurgery, despite its biased use for larger meningiomas with more complicated volumes. Reported rates of imaging-documented regression are higher for radiosurgery, but neurological recovery is relatively good with both techniques. Stereotactic radiosurgery and fractionated SRT are complementary techniques appropriate for different clinical scenarios.

### Petroclival meningiomas: an update on surgical approaches, decision making, and treatment results [^114Hvwrz]. Neurosurgical Focus (2013). Low credibility.

Object

Petroclival meningiomas remain a formidable challenge for neurosurgeons because of their location deep within the skull base and proximity to eloquent neurovascular structures. Various skull base approaches have been used in their treatment, and deciding which is the optimal one remains controversial. Attempts at achieving gross- or near-total resections are associated with an increased rate of morbidity and mortality. As adjunctive treatment options such as stereotactic radiosurgery have been developed and become widely available, there has been a trend toward accepting subtotal resections in an effort to minimize neurological morbidity. This paper reviews a recent series of patients with petroclival meningiomas and highlights current management trends and important considerations useful in surgical decision making.

Methods

The records of patients with large (> 3 cm) petroclival meningiomas surgically treated by the senior author over the past 5 years were reviewed. The clinical results are presented as examples of the surgical approaches available for approaching these tumors, and treatment options are reviewed.

Results

Of 196 meningiomas surgically treated during the study period, 8 lesions in 8 patients met the study criteria. Overall clinical results were excellent, with no death or major morbidity. Intracranial gross- or near-total resection (Simpson Grade 1, 2, or 3) was achieved in 5 patients (67%). New cranial nerve deficits occurred in 3 patients (37%) and were more common in patients in whom a subtotal resection was performed (2 of 3 cases). A variety of surgical approaches were used. Important considerations determining the best approach include the location of the tumor relative to the internal auditory canal, the presence of preoperative hearing loss, and the location of the tumor relative to the tentorium.

Conclusions

Achieving gross- or near-total resections of large petroclival meningiomas remains achievable and should be the primary goal of surgical treatment. A retrosigmoid craniotomy remains a workhorse surgical approach for most petroclival tumors of any size. Tumors that are medial to the internal auditory canal and span both middle and posterior cranial fossae are often best treated with a combined transpetrosal approach, which is especially true if there is a preoperative hearing deficit.

### The growth rate and clinical outcomes of radiation induced meningioma undergoing treatment or active monitoring [^111pAWZm]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Radiation induced meningioma is a less commonly reported, but increasing clinical problem with no clear consensus on the optimal management strategy. RIM are more likely to be symptomatic, require surgical resection, have grade 2 histology, and progress compared to sporadic meningioma. They exhibit high absolute and relative growth, and thus appear to be more likely to develop clinical and radiological progression following discovery.

External Beam Radiotherapy for Meningiomas

In addition to surgical resection, RT is the only widely accepted treatment modality for meningiomas. RT may be prescribed as primary treatment or as an adjunct to surgery, either immediately following surgery as adjuvant therapy or delayed as salvage treatment at the time of tumor progression/recurrence. The optimal timing of adjuvant RT is currently unknown. The recent EANO guidelines suggest primary fractionated RT as a treatment option for symptomatic patients or those with sufficiently large meningiomas beyond the treatment limits of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) who cannot undergo surgery due to underlying comorbidities, unacceptably high surgical risk, or patient preference. These same guidelines also recommend RT as an adjunct to surgery in all patients with CNS WHO grade 3 meningiomas or CNS WHO grade 2 cases following subtotal resection. Recent evidence has suggested that RT may have a role even for patients with CNS WHO grade 1 meningiomas that cannot be completely resected, a cohort that had worse PFS than completely resected and irradiated CNS WHO grade 2 meningiomas in the non-randomized RTOG-0539 phase II clinical trial (Figure 5).

### Incidence, management, and outcome of incidental meningioma: what has happened in 10 years? [^1145F6yg]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Numerically more patients were diagnosed with an incidental asymptomatic meningioma between 2018 and 2019 compared to 2008–2009, however not statistically significant, even though the number of scans performed each year was the same. This could perhaps be attributed improved image quality, more use of contrast enhanced scans as well as a demographic shift as more patients were older, and more often had non-metastatic cancer. In the latter period, search for brain metastases was more common. There was no significant difference in the rate of surgical management decision at diagnosis, but within 3 years of follow up significantly more patients in the 2018–2019 cohort had been followed with active monitoring. After 3 years of follow-up, a substantial number of patients from both times periods were deceased due to causes unrelated to their meningioma, which should be taken into account when considering regimes for treatment or follow-up of incidental meningiomas

### Multiple meningiomas: epidemiology, management, and outcomes [^116bWYPf]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points
Given high disease burden, MM treatment should focus on disease control, not cure.
Management of MM may involve observation, surgery, and radiosurgery.
Evidence for gold-standard care in MM is limited, requiring further research.

Importance of Study

With the rising incidence of meningiomas and the ubiquity of cross-sectional neuroimaging, more patients with multiple meningiomas (MM) are being identified. These patients have a higher disease burden, with limited possibility of cure, requiring multiple interventions, and demonstrating potentially worse neurological and functional outcomes. This study provides an up-to-date understanding of MM epidemiology and etiology, including a current understanding of meningioma genetics and molecular biology, and exploring current research detailing the management and outcomes of MM. We outline management perspectives to MM, including a chronic disease model of care framework, with approaches including observation, radiotherapy, and surgery. We further provide current evidence on outcomes following intervention. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop evidence-based guidelines for the management of MM.

SRS has also been proposed as a viable treatment option for enlarging meningiomas in NF2-SWN patients with 5-year local control rates generally greater than 90%. However, distant failure rates range from 27% to 51%, and studies on the topic have been limited to small institutional case series. Additionally, malignant transformation remains a rare but important concern with SRS in this patient population with a significantly higher risk of malignant progression in previously benign tumors from NF2-SWN patients (up to 5–6% absolute risk increase) compared to patients with irradiated sporadic disease. Furthermore, the quality of life of NF2-SWN patients may be negatively impacted by the use of RT. It is because of these considerations that RT should be used judiciously in this patient population and in many instances, are more commonly reserved for recurrent meningiomas or tumors with unacceptably high surgical risk.

Future Clinical Trial Design and Other Future Directions

The design of meningioma clinical trials face several challenges largely related to tumor heterogeneity. One issue is that despite a growing body of evidence demonstrating the value of molecular classification systems, there has yet to be a unified molecular taxonomy that can be readily adopted by the WHO as standard of care classification. The ideal classification scheme should have a strong biological foundation and be readily implementable across most pathology laboratories. This standardization will ensure that patients are grouped based on clinically meaningful biological criteria rather than histopathology alone. Immunohistochemical correlates that can reliably identify molecular groups on a one-to-one basis would also be helpful, particularly in expanding trial access beyond tertiary referral centers in high-income countries that have access to sequencing technology. These measures may ultimately improve the uniformity of meningioma cases included in clinical trials treatment arms and decrease biologic heterogeneity that could confound treatment response, particularly amongst CNS WHO grade 2 cases that are a current cohort of interest in randomized trials.

In addition to classification, standardization of outcomes reporting is crucial. For instance, while PFS-6 has been considered the primary endpoint in most meningioma trials, this control benchmark is largely based on historical cases which may be graded differently today. To account for this, there is a need to retrospectively determine PFS-6 amongst molecularly defined meningioma cohorts, which would contribute to establishing a set of modern control cases for future prospective trial cases (which will likely also be molecularly driven), to benchmark against. Additionally, the relative improvement in PFS-6 that can be considered clinically meaningful should be standardized and these criteria will require subsequent validation. Lastly, as suggested by the RANO group, if PFS is to be used as the primary endpoint, neuroimaging over the last 6–12 months prior to trial enrollment is critical to establish a baseline rate of growth for comparison. Defining the appropriate interval and type of surveillance needed for each meningioma subgroup will also enable clinicians to detect tumor progression or recurrence at an early stage, leading to timely interventions and improved outcomes. Given the poor reliability of historical benchmarks such as PFS-6, ideally randomized trials should be conducted whenever possible. The implementation of adaptive clinical trial designs, which allow for real-time adjustments based on novel data, could also enhance the efficiency of clinical trials and accelerate the identification of novel treatments. Addressing these challenges through collaborative efforts among researchers, clinicians, and regulatory bodies will pave the way for more robust meningioma clinical trials, enhancing the precision and impact of future treatments.

Meningioma surgery — management is guided by patient- and treatment-related factors, and complete surgical resection may be curative and is therefore the treatment of choice, if feasible. Both the tumor grade and the extent of resection impact the rate of recurrence; in a cohort of 581 patients, 10-year PFS was 75% following GTR but dropped to 39% for patients receiving STR, and short-term recurrences for grade 1, 2, and 3 meningiomas were 1% to 16%, 20% to 41%, and 56% to 63%, respectively. The Simpson classification scheme (grades 1–5 in decreasing degree of completeness) correlates with local recurrence rates.
