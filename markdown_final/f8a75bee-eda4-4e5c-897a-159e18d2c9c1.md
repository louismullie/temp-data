## Question

Is there a certain diet recommended for patients with ulcerative colitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there is a specific diet recommended for patients with ulcerative colitis, and if so, what that diet should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between disease-modifying diets and general healthy-eating advice. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines (AGA, ESPEN, IOIBD) actually recommend for UC specifically. Next, I will examine the strength and certainty of evidence for any named diets. After that, I need to consider disease phase and symptom triggers. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, reference-aligned recommendation and clarify what to avoid claiming about diet and UC outcomes.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: there is no single, universally effective "UC diet" proven to induce or maintain remission, and diet is not a substitute for pharmacologic therapy in UC. Wait, let me verify the guideline stance here — ESPEN explicitly advises against primary nutritional therapy (enteral or parenteral) for UC induction or maintenance, and AGA emphasizes that no diet has consistently reduced flare rates in adults with IBD, which includes UC, so I should not overstate diet as disease-modifying in UC [^113bqLMG] [^111B5MyE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — some patients report symptom improvement with certain diets, but I need to check whether that translates into objective anti-inflammatory benefit. The best available randomized and controlled data for solid-food diets in IBD show very low to low certainty of evidence, with no diet reliably outperforming controls for UC remission or relapse prevention, so symptomatic gains may occur without histologic or endoscopic improvement; I should be careful to distinguish symptom control from disease modification when advising patients [^116eSYEF] [^115tKhhV].

> Next, I should review what guidelines do recommend. I will now examine the consistent cross-guideline signal: a Mediterranean-style dietary pattern — rich in fruits and vegetables, emphasizing monounsaturated fats, complex carbohydrates, and lean proteins, and low in ultra-processed foods, added sugars, and salt — is advised for all patients with IBD unless contraindicated, primarily for overall health and potential reduction in UC flares, though the certainty varies and no diet guarantees remission [^114qTpYF] [^111B5MyE].

> Let me consider specific UC-linked signals. AGA notes that a diet lower in red and processed meat may reduce UC flares, which is a modest, population-level association and should be framed as risk reduction rather than a treatment. I should double-check that this is not overgeneralized to Crohn's disease — indeed, the same reduction in red meat has not been shown to reduce relapse in CD, reinforcing disease-specific heterogeneity and the need for caution in extrapolation [^111B5MyE] [^1114Gzwe].

> I need to ensure I address disease phase and symptom triggers. During active disease or flares, patients often benefit from temporary adjustments such as lower fiber, smaller frequent meals, and adequate hydration; a randomized study of a short-term flare-focused dietary approach suggested symptomatic improvement, though the evidence quality is limited and it does not replace anti-inflammatory therapy. In remission, I should encourage liberalization toward the Mediterranean pattern and gradual fiber expansion as tolerated, with individualized attention to lactose or other recognized intolerances [^114RtzQ6] [^113e7eBG] [^1142vKLv].

> But wait, what about fiber — should it be restricted long term? Let me verify the current stance. Contemporary reviews and guidelines generally do not support routine long-term fiber restriction in IBD; fiber can be introduced during remission with attention to tolerance, and patients with strictures may need texture modification rather than global fiber avoidance. I should confirm that this aligns with both mechanistic and clinical data suggesting potential benefits of a diverse, fiber-containing diet on microbiome and inflammation, albeit with low-certainty outcomes evidence [^1142vKLv] [^1164pbpR] [^114RtzQ6].

> Next, I should review micronutrient surveillance because UC patients are at risk for deficiencies. I need to check that AGA recommends routine screening for vitamin D and iron deficiency in all IBD patients, and vitamin B12 in those with extensive ileal disease or resections; this is foundational alongside diet counseling and should be integrated into longitudinal care rather than treated as an afterthought [^116K5dNQ].

> I will now examine the role of dietitians and multidisciplinary care. ESPEN and AGA emphasize early nutrition screening, individualized counseling by a registered dietitian, and co-management in complicated disease or when malnutrition is present; I should confirm that this applies at diagnosis and during transitions in disease activity, as diet quality and adequacy materially affect outcomes and quality of life even when diet is not a primary anti-inflammatory therapy [^112kXQtX] [^116pRpYL] [^113TE4iA].

> Let me synthesize a practical recommendation. For most patients with UC, I advise a Mediterranean-style pattern emphasizing plant diversity, olive oil and other unsaturated fats, lean proteins, and minimization of ultra-processed foods, added sugars, and salt. Consider reducing red and processed meats given possible flare risk reduction. During flares, temporarily lower fiber and adjust meal pattern for symptoms while maintaining nutrition. Throughout, screen for deficiencies, personalize to tolerances, and coordinate with a dietitian. I should confirm that I am not implying remission control — this approach supports overall health, may modestly reduce flares, and complements — but does not replace — pharmacologic therapy [^114qTpYF] [^111B5MyE].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what if a patient asks about named exclusion diets like SCD or low-FODMAP? I should clarify that while symptom benefits are reported, high-quality evidence for durable anti-inflammatory effects in UC is lacking. These diets may be trialed selectively for symptom control with dietitian supervision, but expectations should be tempered and objective disease activity monitored to avoid delaying effective medical therapy [^116eSYEF] [^115ofuaL].

> Final answer: There is no single disease-specific diet proven to treat ulcerative colitis, but guidelines converge on recommending a Mediterranean-style dietary pattern for overall health and potential flare risk reduction, with individualized adjustments during active disease and structured dietitian involvement to prevent deficiencies and tailor to symptoms and preferences [^114qTpYF] [^111B5MyE].

For ulcerative colitis (UC), **no single diet fits all**; instead, adopt a Mediterranean-style pattern [^114qTpYF] rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and omega-3s, and low in ultra-processed foods, red/processed meats, and added sugars [^111B5MyE] [^114qTpYF]. During flares, **limit fiber and lactose** [^1111WuQZ] if symptomatic, and use a low-residue or low-FODMAP approach temporarily [^114RtzQ6] [^116ag8xh]. Always individualize to symptoms and nutritional needs, and work with a dietitian to monitor for deficiencies and adjust intake by disease activity [^112kXQtX] [^116K5dNQ].

---

## General dietary principles

- **Mediterranean diet**: Emphasize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and lean proteins (fish, poultry) [^114qTpYF]; limit red/processed meats, ultra-processed foods, added sugars, and salt [^111B5MyE].

- **Omega-3 fatty acids**: Include fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines) or supplements to lower inflammation [^notfound].

- **Ultra-processed foods**: Minimize intake due to links with increased IBD risk and inflammation [^113ymcdL].

---

## Dietary recommendations during active disease (flare)

During flares, **modify intake to reduce symptoms and support nutrition**:

- **Low-residue diet**: Temporarily limit high-fiber foods (raw fruits/vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains) to reduce frequency and severity of diarrhea and cramping [^114RtzQ6].

- **Lactose restriction**: Avoid lactose if it worsens symptoms (bloating, diarrhea) [^1111rtsD].

- **Small, frequent meals**: Eat 4–6 small meals/day to ease GI burden and maintain intake [^114RtzQ6].

- **Adequate hydration**: Drink enough fluids to prevent dehydration from diarrhea [^114RtzQ6].

---

## Dietary recommendations during remission

In remission, **return to a Mediterranean-style pattern** and liberalize fiber as tolerated to support the microbiome and overall health [^114qTpYF]:

- **Fiber intake**: Gradually increase soluble fiber (oats, bananas, cooked vegetables) to support microbiome diversity and SCFA production [^1142vKLv].

- **Variety**: Maintain dietary diversity to meet micronutrient needs and reduce relapse risk [^116th9vU].

- **Limit red/processed meats**: Lower intake may reduce flare risk [^111B5MyE].

---

## Foods to avoid or limit

Certain foods may worsen symptoms or increase inflammation and should be limited or avoided:

| **Food category** | **Examples** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Red and processed meats | Beef, pork, sausages, bacon | Associated with increased inflammation and flare risk [^111B5MyE] |
| Ultra-processed foods | Fast food, packaged snacks, sugary drinks | Linked to higher IBD risk and inflammation [^113ymcdL] |
| High-lactose foods | Milk, cream, ice cream | May cause bloating and diarrhea in lactose-intolerant patients [^notfound] |
| High-fiber foods (during flares) | Raw fruits/vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains | Can exacerbate diarrhea and cramping [^notfound] |
| Artificial sweeteners | Sorbitol, mannitol | May cause GI discomfort and diarrhea [^notfound] |

---

## Nutritional deficiencies and supplementation

UC patients are at risk for deficiencies; **monitor and replace as needed**:

- **Iron deficiency anemia**: Common due to chronic blood loss; monitor ferritin and hemoglobin, and supplement as indicated [^notfound].

- **Vitamin D deficiency**: Monitor 25(OH)D and supplement if low, especially with limited sun exposure [^115ZbYRW].

- **Vitamin B12 and folate**: Check in extensive disease or after surgery; supplement if deficient [^116FFZkU].

- **Calcium and magnesium**: Monitor and replace if deficient, particularly with chronic diarrhea or steroid use [^115ZbYRW].

---

## Role of dietitian and individualized nutrition

Registered dietitian involvement is essential for **personalized plans**, deficiency monitoring, and education [^112kXQtX]. Individualization should tailor intake to **symptoms, disease activity, and preferences** [^113e7eBG], and nutrition should be reassessed regularly to maintain status and adjust for changes in disease activity [^116VTgem].

---

## Emerging dietary therapies

Several diets are under study, but **evidence remains limited**:

- **Specific carbohydrate diet (SCD)**: May improve symptoms, but limited evidence for sustained anti-inflammatory effects [^115tKhhV].

- **Low-FODMAP diet**: Can reduce symptoms in some patients, particularly with IBS-like features [^1111rtsD].

- **Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN)**: Not recommended as primary therapy in UC, but may be used for nutritional support in select cases [^113bqLMG].

---

## Conclusion

There is **no one-size-fits-all diet for UC**; a Mediterranean-style pattern is a sensible baseline, with temporary low-residue or low-FODMAP adjustments during flares. Individualize to symptoms and nutritional needs, and co-manage with a dietitian to monitor deficiencies and adapt intake as disease activity changes.

### An insight into patients' perspectives of ulcerative colitis flares via analysis of online public forum posts [^116giE3t]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this analysis of patients with UC posting on online public disease forums, advanced AI text analytics and NLP were leveraged to identify the most prevalent themes and topics discussed in relation to disease flares. Of note, half of the flare-related discussions were related to treatment experiences and side effects and flare symptoms, and a quarter were related to emotional support and lifestyle management.

Given that UC is a complex intestinal disease with interplaying genetic, environmental, and biological (microbial and immunological) factors contributing to its pathogenesis, it was not surprising that dietary recommendations were commonly mentioned by patients with this condition (6.0% of flare-related posts). The results of this analysis suggest that patients perceive diet to be a major environmental factor, with a controlled diet being associated with the maintenance of remission, and changes in diet with triggering flares. Consistent with these results, in recent analyses of social media posts by patients with IBD, diet and nutrition were among the top topics of interest. The impact of diet and nutrition on UC flares remains an area that requires further research and confirmation to inform dietary recommendations in clinical guidelines and practice. The PREdiCCt (PRognostic effect of Environmental factors in Crohn's and Colitis) study of patients with IBD in clinical remission will collect information on diet, lifestyle, and gut microbiome over 2 years to investigate any potential associations with flare symptoms. At the baseline of the PREdiCCt study, dietary change was one of the most common patient-reported causes of flare.

### Nutritional management of adults with inflammatory bowel disease: practical lessons from the available evidence [^1111rtsD]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with impairment of nutritional status both anthropometrically and biochemically, which results from both qualitative and quantitative changes in dietary intake alongside disease activity. Dietary intervention to replace deficiency is essential and may also be used to treat active disease and to reduce symptoms. The evidence for dietary interventions in this area is reviewed and the following recommendations made: ■Assessment of nutritional status is an essential part of the investigation of all patients with IBD and deficiency should be actively sought.■Any patient with macro- or micronutrient deficiency should be referred for dietetic assessment.■Micronutrient deficiency (most frequently iron, vitamin B12, folate and magnesium) should be replaced aggressively, parenterally if necessary.■Significant improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms can be achieved by low-residue diets (for stricturing disease) and (always under dietetic supervision) management of lactose and other intolerances.■Irritable bowel syndrome symptoms in patients with IBD can respond to low fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diets, again this must be done under dietetic supervision.■Active Crohn's disease can be treated by exclusive enteral nutrition (elemental/polymeric/altered fat formulations all have equivalent efficacy).■Enteral nutrition can maintain remission in Crohn's disease and in this context can be given alongside normal oral intake.■Nutritional support does not have an established role in the treatment of active ulcerative colitis, other than in the management of malnutrition.■Total parenteral nutrition should not be used unless intestinal failure occurs.■There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of Ω3 fish oil, prebiotics and glutamine in the treatment of active IBD.

### Current recommendations on the role of diet in the aetiology and management of IBD [^11626hgv]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Diet is a key modifier of risk of inflammatory bowel disease development and potentially a treatment option in patients with established disease. International organisations in gastroenterology and inflammatory bowel disease have published guidelines for the role of diet in disease onset and its management. Here, we discuss the major overarching themes arising from these guidelines and appraise recent literature on the role of diet for inflammatory bowel disease prevention, treatment of active disease and maintenance of remission, considering these themes. Except for exclusive enteral nutrition in active Crohn's disease, we currently possess very little evidence to make any further dietary recommendations for the management of inflammatory bowel disease. There is also currently uncertainty on the extrapolation of epidemiological dietary signals on risk of disease development and preclinical experiments in animal models to management, once disease is established. Until high-quality evidence from clinical research becomes available, the only specific recommendations for inflammatory bowel disease we might safely give are those of healthy eating which apply for the general population for overall health and well-being.

### ESPEN guideline on clinical nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease [^116e6wA2]. Clinical Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for ulcerative colitis, more specifically with respect to nutritional support (avoidance of refeeding syndrome), ESPEN 2023 guidelines recommend to consider undertaking standard precautions and interventions to prevent the refeeding syndrome, particularly concerning phosphate and thiamine, in patients with IBD and nutritional deprivation extended over many days.

### Should high-fiber diets be recommended for patients with inflammatory bowel disease? [^1142vKLv]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Dietary fiber intake in IBD patients has oftentimes generated conflicting data and clinical recommendations. This review aims to unify apparently conflicting lines of evidence regarding dietary fiber intake in IBD patients by highlighting new information from natural history studies and prospective clinical trials.

Recent Findings

IBD patients have lower dietary fiber intake than the general population as well as national guideline recommendations. Patients report short-term benefits from fiber avoidance. Low fiber and low FODMAP diets are associated with lower fecal microbiota abundance and essential nutrient intake. There is emerging evidence suggesting that IBD patients may be able to increase dietary fiber intake with short-term benefit and good tolerability, particularly when fiber is introduced during clinical remission. Current societal recommendations do not favor withholding dietary fiber during long-term IBD management. The long-term impact of increased dietary fiber on IBD clinical outcomes remains unanswered.

Summary

Dietary fiber intake is not necessarily contraindicated in IBD patients.

### Management of paediatric ulcerative colitis, part 2: acute severe colitis-an updated evidence-based consensus guideline from the European society of paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition and the European Crohn's and colitis organization [^116AiKVd]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute severe colitis (ASC) is a relatively frequent manifestation in children with ulcerative colitis and one of the few emergencies in paediatric gastroenterology. A standardized proactive approach based on tight monitoring and timely medical and surgical interventions may improve patients' outcomes. We aimed to update the previous ASC guidelines using detailed recommendations and practice points, based on a systematic review of the literature and consensus of experts. These guidelines update is a joint effort of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization. A systematic search was performed in Pubmed Ovid Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases using 13 predefined PICO (patient, intervention, comparison, outcomes) based questions and 30 non-PICO based questions. Grading methodology was based on the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine-Levels of evidence. The questions were addressed by working subgroups following an iterative consensus voting process, including three online voting meetings and one face-to-face meeting. A total of 36 recommendations and 72 practice points were endorsed with a consensus rate of at least 88% for all statements, regarding initial evaluation, monitoring, medical and surgical treatment of ASC in children. Several topics have been revised since the previous 2018 guidelines and differ from corresponding published adult guidelines. These guidelines present a comprehensive overview of the management of ASC in children, offering practical recommendations and practice points aiming to standardize clinical and surgical treatment and improve outcomes of this severe scenario.

The role of diet in the pathogenesis of IBD

Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases of unknown aetiology, characterized by a recurrent inflammatory condition. The pathophysiology is multifactorial and complex, involving an inappropriate immune activation of the gut mucosa in genetically susceptible individuals, triggered by an altered composition of the gut microbiota. The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has increased worldwide in developed nations and more recently in developing countries. This rapid increase in the incidence of IBD over the last half-century, particularly in developing countries, clearly points to the role of changing environmental factors intrinsically implicated in disease development. Genes cannot change within such a short time frame, thus disease susceptibility remains almost identical over several generations. The differing role of genetics and the environment in disease development is clearly reflected by epidemiological data on immigrants from low- to high-IBD-incidence regions: where, the second generation of immigrants has the same risk of developing IBD as the local population living for generations in the same area. A western lifestyle, including changes in dietary habits, urbanization and industrialization, has been proposed as one explanation for this worldwide increase in IBD.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^114Yxu3v]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is an idiopathic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology that seems to be rising in incidence and prevalence throughout the world. These guidelines were developed to indicate the preferred approach to the management of adult patients with ulcerative colitis as established by valid scientific research and represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology under the auspices of the Practice Parameters Committee. The scientific evidence for the recommendations made in these guidelines was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process, assessing the quality of the evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low) and assigning a strength of recommendation based on its apparent clinical benefit (strong or conditional). In instances where the available evidence was not appropriate for a formal Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation recommendation, but there was consensus of significant clinical merit, statements were developed using expert consensus (termed key concept statements). These guidelines are meant to be broadly applicable to practitioners regardless of specialty or interest and should be viewed as the preferred, but not only, approach to clinical scenarios. As opposed to standards of care, guidelines are inherently flexible, and physicians should use them as tools in choosing the best course in a specific clinical situation. These guidelines represent the state of the evidence at the time of this publication. As new evidence emerges, these guidelines will be continuously reviewed, and updates will be published as needed to assure continued validity.

### Using diet to treat inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review [^115KpSWy]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

To review the efficacy of various dietary interventions for induction of clinical remission in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and provide healthcare providers with a practical reference for recommending suitable diets for managing patients with IBD.

Methods

PubMed, Medline(R), and Cochrane were searched from inception up to February 17, 2023, to identify all studies reporting information on using diet to treat IBD. Studies investigating the role of dietary interventions in adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of active IBD for improvement or remission of IBD symptoms were rigorously considered. Sample meal plans, with a list of included and excluded foods, were also generated to provide clinicians with practical tools for advising patients on dietary intake.

Results

Eleven included studies provided data on 10 distinct diets: autoimmune protocol diet, high-fiber diet, 4-strategies-to-SUlfide-Reduction diet, highly restricted diet, McMaster elimination diet for Crohn's disease, specific carbohydrate diet, Mediterranean diet, Crohn's disease exclusion diet, individualized elimination diet, and the food-specific IgG4-guided exclusion diet. A total of 9 studies provided data on clinical remission. Many of these diets share common elements, such as an initial elimination phase with subsequent reintroduction of dietary components, inclusion of whole foods, and exclusion of highly or ultraprocessed foods.

Discussion

Currently, there is limited evidence to support the use of specific diets to treat adult patients with mildly to moderately active IBD. Larger, randomized studies with standardized methodologies and outcome measures, rigorous adherence assessment, and an emphasis on endoscopic assessment outcome measures are required to validate most diets that have been studied for IBD. The included sample diet plans and dietary recommendations may prove helpful in the interim as part of a holistic strategy to manage patients with IBD.

### AGA clinical practice update on diet and nutritional therapies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: expert review [^116VTgem]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for ulcerative colitis, more specifically with respect to nutritional support, management of malnutrition, AGA 2024 guidelines recommend to screen for malnutrition regularly in all patients with IBD by assessing signs and symptoms, including unintended weight loss, edema and fluid retention, and fat and muscle mass loss. Obtain a more complete evaluation for malnutrition by a registered dietitian when symptoms or signs are observed. Do not obtain serum proteins for the identification and diagnosis of malnutrition due to their lack of specificity for nutritional status and high sensitivity to inflammation.

### AGA clinical practice update on diet and nutritional therapies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: expert review [^1111WuQZ]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for ulcerative colitis, more specifically with respect to dietary modifications, AGA 2024 guidelines recommend to recognize that patients with IBD with symptomatic intestinal strictures may not tolerate fibrous, plant-based foods (raw fruits and vegetables) due to their texture. Consider emphasizing careful chewing, cooking, and processing of fruits and vegetables to a soft, less fibrinous consistency, incorporating a wider variety of plant-based foods and fiber in the diet.

### AGA living clinical practice guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis [^114WGKGs]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

AGA Living Clinical Practice Guideline on pharmacological management of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis — future directions and updating plan note that "future selection of therapy may be based on predictive clinical and biomarker-based models", but "there is a paucity of data on how such models can inform treatment selection in the real-world setting", with "ongoing research efforts using multi-omic platforms using serum, stool, and tissue specimens" to develop predictive biomarkers. It emphasizes that "Shared decision making is an important process in selecting the management strategy for management of ulcerative colitis" and describes potential strategies including "combination advanced therapy or episodic use of nonimmunogenic advanced therapies, such as small molecules", while stating that "Further primary data are required to accurately inform the positioning of such strategies". For maintenance as a living guideline, it specifies that "the AGA will update relevant recommendations from these guidelines by periodic review of evidence every 6 months", and that the review "will include availability of phase 3 or phase 4 efficacy data for new treatments, treatment strategies, or existing treatments, as well as significant new safety concerns informing treatment positioning".

### Nutrition in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases [^111FRP6W]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

With the increasing global prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases, research in this field is expanding to better understand the multifactorial etiologies of this complex disease. Nutrition and diet, as modifiable risk factors, have been shown to play an important role in disease activity and prognosis. This article reviews the role of nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease, including appropriate nutrition screening in this at-risk population, and associated micronutrient deficiencies. We provide recommendations on dosing supplementation. We briefly review diet as a risk factor for inflammatory bowel disease and the currently proposed published dietary intervention studies.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis [^113exCmm]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

GRADE strength of recommendation and interpretation (Table 3): Strong uses the wording "The AGA recommends" and for patients means "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course and only a small proportion would not", while for clinicians it means "Most individuals should receive the recommended course of action. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences". Conditional uses the wording "The AGA suggests" and for patients means "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course, but many would not", while for clinicians it states "Different choices would be appropriate for different patients. Decision aids may be useful in helping individuals make decisions consistent with their values and preferences. Clinicians should expect to spend more time with patients when working towards a decision". No recommendation uses the wording "The AGA makes no recommendation" and notes for clinicians that "The confidence in the effect estimate is so low that any effect estimate is speculative at this time".

### AGA clinical practice update on diet and nutritional therapies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: expert review [^111CiBjN]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for ulcerative colitis, more specifically with respect to nutritional support, parenteral nutrition, AGA 2024 guidelines recommend to switch from long-term parenteral nutrition to customized hydration management (such as IV electrolyte support and/or oral rehydration solutions) and oral intake whenever possible to decrease the risk of developing long-term complications in patients with IBD and short bowel syndrome. Consider offering glucagon-like peptide-2 agonists to facilitate this transition.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^1143Pw9W]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the principal forms of inflammatory bowel disease. Both represent chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, which displays heterogeneity in inflammatory and symptomatic burden between patients and within individuals over time. Optimal management relies on understanding and tailoring evidence-based interventions by clinicians in partnership with patients. This guideline for management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults over 16 years of age was developed by Stakeholders representing UK physicians (British Society of Gastroenterology), surgeons (Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland), specialist nurses (Royal College of Nursing), paediatricians (British Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition), dietitians (British Dietetic Association), radiologists (British Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology), general practitioners (Primary Care Society for Gastroenterology) and patients (Crohn's and Colitis UK). A systematic review of 88 247 publications and a Delphi consensus process involving 81 multidisciplinary clinicians and patients was undertaken to develop 168 evidence- and expert opinion-based recommendations for pharmacological, non-pharmacological and surgical interventions, as well as optimal service delivery in the management of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Comprehensive up-to-date guidance is provided regarding indications for, initiation and monitoring of immunosuppressive therapies, nutrition interventions, pre-, peri- and postoperative management, as well as structure and function of the multidisciplinary team and integration between primary and secondary care. Twenty research priorities to inform future clinical management are presented, alongside objective measurement of priority importance, determined by 2379 electronic survey responses from individuals living with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, including patients, their families and friends.

### ESPEN guideline on clinical nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease [^112kXQtX]. Clinical Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for ulcerative colitis, more specifically with respect to nutritional support (counseling), ESPEN 2023 guidelines recommend to provide individual counseling by a dietitian as part of the multidisciplinary approach to improve nutritional therapy and avoid malnutrition and nutrition-related disorders in all patients with IBD,
as well as regarding malabsorption or maldigestion in patients with Crohn's disease.

### Dietary therapy in the management of inflammatory bowel disease: a lasting legacy and a new frontier [^111DxYhp]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

This article highlights the evolving role of dietary strategies in the management of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Advances in understanding diet's influence on IBD pathogenesis and disease progression have renewed interest in the role of diet in the treatment of IBD. Exclusive enteral nutrition remains the gold standard, but whole food diets that mimic the composition of EEN or eliminate foods that negatively impact the intestinal microbiome and immune response have shown promise. Additional research that includes larger patient populations and objective data is needed to expand applicability and develop patient-centered recommendations.

### Management of paediatric ulcerative colitis, part 1: ambulatory care-an updated evidence-based consensus guideline from the European society of paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation [^111n1V44]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Despite advances in the management of ambulatory paediatric ulcerative colitis (UC), challenges remain as many patients are refractory to therapy and some require colectomy. The aim of these guidelines is to provide an update on optimal care for UC through detailed recommendations and practice points.

Methods

These guidelines are an update to those published in 2018 and are a joint effort of the Paediatric IBD Porto group of European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation. An extensive literature search with subsequent evidence appraisal using the Oxford methodology was performed, followed by three online voting sessions and a consensus face-to-face meeting. Thirty-nine recommendations and 77 practice points were endorsed by the 25 experts with at least an 84% consensus rate.

Results

Robust evidence-based recommendations and detailed practice points are provided. In addition to reemphasising and updating the role of more 'traditional' UC therapies, these guidelines outline optimising the use of antitumour necrosis factor therapies and integrating newer biologics and small molecules, as well as supportive therapy, to improve outcomes and provide an updated management algorithm. Measurement and monitoring tools and decision aids are provided, and additional aspects, including nutritional support, extraintestinal manifestations, pouchitis, inflammatory bowel disease-unclassified and patient support, are discussed. Some aspects, including surgery and thromboprophylaxis, are covered in the acute severe UC guidelines.

Conclusions

These guidelines serve as an aid in managing children with UC through a combination of evidence-based recommendations and more practical practice points in the ambulatory setting.

### Dietary management of IBD – insights and advice [^116XRbat]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Medium credibility.

The current general interest in the use of food choice or diet in maintaining good health and in preventing and treating disease also applies to patients with IBD, who often follow poor or nutritionally challenging dietary plans. Unfortunately, dietary advice plays only a minor part in published guidelines for management of IBD, which sends a message that diet is not of great importance. However, a considerable evidence base supports a focused and serious attention to nutrition and diet in patients with IBD. In this Review, a step-wise approach in the evaluation and management of these patients is proposed. First, dietary intake and eating habits as well as current nutritional state should be documented, and corrective measures instituted. Secondly, dietary strategies as primary or adjunctive therapy for the reduction of inflammation and/or prevention of relapse of IBD should be seriously contemplated. Thirdly, use of diet to improve symptoms or lessen the effects of complications should be considered. Finally, dietary advice regarding disease prevention should be discussed when relevant. An increasing need exists for applying improved methodologies into establishing the value of current and new ways of using food choice as a therapeutic and preventive tool in IBD.

### Diets for inflammatory bowel disease: what do we know so far? [^11774RJh]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Medium credibility.

In recent years, the role of diet in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has gained great interest within the scientific community. Eating habits from industrialised countries (the so-called western diet or WD) have been associated with a higher incidence of IBD in observational studies, although the dietary factors responsible for the development of the disease are still to be elucidated. Some components of the diet with proinflammatory potential may cause changes in immunity and intestinal microbiota, leading to the inflammatory reaction that causes IBD-related lesions. The quality of available evidence is low, due to methodological issues, such as the lack of intervention studies, small sample size and heterogeneity of studies. For this reason, scientific societies have offered their recommendations using clinical practice guidelines and consensus documents, in order to establish a common criterion in the nutritional treatment of patients with IBD. The objective of this review was to summarise the data published regarding diet in IBD and review the recommendations given by scientific societies.

### ESPEN guideline on clinical nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease [^113kzh6V]. Clinical Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for ulcerative colitis, more specifically with respect to nutritional support (energy requirements), ESPEN 2023 guidelines recommend to ensure energy intake of 30–35 kcal/kg/day in patients with IBD, as their requirements are similar to the healthy population. Determine individual energy requirements using indirect calorimetry and an individual physical activity factor if there is a clinical suspicion of a different energy requirement in particular disease states.

### When is enteral nutrition indicated? [^114LDbjo]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease — enteral nutrition (EN) roles and perioperative guidance are summarized as follows: The potential role of EN in the management of IBD includes its use as (1) an anti-inflammatory therapy and (2) a source of nutrition, and EN additionally has putative effects on cytokine production and intestinal permeability. Analyses that compared EN formulas found no difference in remission rates based on type (elemental, semi-elemental, polymeric) or fat content, and one very small randomized trial that compared glutamine-enriched and standard polymeric formulas found no difference in remission rates. Other than for the induction of remission in CD, there is no clear role for EN as an anti-inflammatory therapy; for maintenance of remission in CD, earlier trials with 12-month and 24-month follow-up did not show the benefit of EN, although a recent trial found partial EN coupled with a CD Exclusion Diet (CDED) to be superior at maintaining remission compared with partial EN with a standard diet, and for ulcerative colitis the utility is even less clear because of a lack of available data. As patients with active IBD possess a high risk of developing protein-energy malnutrition, EN serves an important role in nutrition support; in patients who cannot maintain an adequate nutrition status despite solid food intake, oral nutrition supplementation or EN is a viable option for nutrition. In the perioperative setting, preoperative nutrition optimization with EN has also been found to improve postoperative outcomes, yet the optimal algorithm to determine when to consider oral nutrition supplements, EN, or PN is under-studied and thus unclear, and ESPEN guidelines provide grade B recommendations that EN be considered for surgical patients who are unable to maintain adequate nutrition intake with solid food and oral nutrition supplements.

### Practical guideline on obesity care in patients with gastrointestinal and liver diseases-joint ESPEN / UEG guideline [^114NR66s]. Clinical Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for ulcerative colitis, more specifically with respect to patients with obesity (nutrition), ESPEN/UEG 2023 guidelines recommend to increase protein intake to 1.2–1.5 g/kg adjusted body weight/day in adult patients with IBD with active disease and obesity. Provide protein in patients with IBD in remission with obesity similar (0.8–1 g/kg adjusted body weight/day in adults) to that recommended for the general population since protein requirements in remission are generally not elevated unless sarcopenia or malnutrition is present. Consider increasing protein intake (1.2–1.5 g/kg adjusted body weight/day) in patients with IBD in remission with obesity and sarcopenia or with a high risk of malnutrition after malnutrition screening and assessment are conducted.

### A prospective, randomized, controlled, exploratory study of comprehensive dietary advice in ulcerative colitis: impact on disease activity and quality of life [^114RtzQ6]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The impact of food on relapse in ulcerative colitis has not been clearly defined. The aim of this prospective, randomized-controlled study was to evaluate the impact of comprehensive dietary guidelines on the clinical course of the disease and quality of life in patients with ulcerative colitis.

Materials and Methods

Patients were allocated randomly to an intervention or a control group. Participants in the intervention group were provided dietary guidelines in the form of an educational booklet that was recommended for use for 4–6 weeks during disease flare, that patients eat little and often (four to six times a day), drink adequate fluids, decrease excess intake of fat, decrease simple carbohydrates and decrease high-fibre foods during flare. Validated and study-designed questionnaires were used to compare patients' perceived quality of life, colitis activity scores and eating habits before and following the dietary advice provided.

Results

Overall, 112 patients completed the study. Study participants were asked to complete the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire and Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index together with the Food Frequency Questionnaire at 0, 6 and 24 weeks. At 24 weeks, there was a mean reduction in the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index score in the intervention group compared with an increase in the score in the control group [-1.304 (P = 0.0108) vs. 0.875 (P = 0.0249)]. There was a mean increase in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire score in the intervention group compared with a reduction in the score in the control group [7.17 (P = 0.126) vs. -3.44 (P = 0.205)]. A total of 69% of patients in the intervention group found the dietary advice significantly or moderately helpful.

Conclusion

The study suggests that there is likely to be a link between the dietary advice provided and symptomatic improvement. The effect of diet may not occur through the addition or the elimination of single nutrients; rather, each food consumed combines many nutrients that allow for a synergistic or an antagonistic action when present in a certain composition.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^116th9vU]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

5.3 Diet and IBD

Good Practice Recommendation 20. IBD patients should be encouraged to eat a varied diet that meets their energy, macro- and micronutrient requirements. All who are at risk of malnutrition should have dietitian or nutrition team review, and where nutritional requirements cannot be met, supplementation with enteral or parenteral nutrition are indicated (Agreement: 100%).

Dietary patterns and food consumption vary hugely across the world and the diet is very different in countries with a high prevalence of IBD compared with countries with a low prevalence. From epidemiological evidence, when people migrate from a country with a low prevalence of IBD to a country with a high prevalence they are at increased risk of developing IBD, thus incriminating environmental changes. Dietary components that have been associated with an increase in the risk of or relapse of IBD include cereals, dietary fibre, sugar, fat, fruit, vegetables and protein. However, no one dietary component is consistently blamed. Thus, until strong scientific evidence supports a defined diet, patients with IBD should be advised to eat a varied diet to meet their energy and nutrient requirements, including dietary fibre. The diet (box 8) should be based on local healthy eating guidelines and include a wide variety of fruit and vegetables, cereals, grains, nuts and seeds, protein-rich foods with a moderation/reduction of high fat, particularly animal fat, high sugar and processed (cured, salted or smoked) meats. Patients with stricturing Crohn's disease may need to alter their intake of dietary fibre and fibrous foods for symptomatic management of strictures and may need supplementation with enteral or parenteral nutrition to achieve their energy and nutritional requirements. Management of short gut or intestinal failure due to Crohn's disease is covered well elsewhere.

### Diet therapy for inflammatory bowel diseases: a call to the dining table [^117FsuMR]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

There is vigorous interest among patients, caregivers, clinicians, and scientists to identify useful dietary interventions for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Through the Cochrane Collaboration, we recently performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of dietary interventions for the induction or maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) to assess the latest state of research. The current quality of evidence was formally graded to be low or very low for various methodological reasons, such as small sample sizes, heterogeneity among studies, and incomplete reporting. There are nonetheless emerging observational studies that progressively advance our knowledge and provide hope for a role of diet among traditional therapies to improve inflammation and symptoms. Further investments and concerted efforts in research are needed to significantly move the needle in identifying effective dietary therapies for IBD.

### AGA clinical practice update on diet and nutritional therapies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: expert review [^115gWS27]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) dietary guidance notes that, at present, it is not known which dietary components of the Mediterranean diet that are emphasized vs those that are minimized underlie its overall efficacy in improving the health of patients with IBD. Specific dietary components that patients with IBD should be cautioned to avoid are sugar-sweetened beverages, which have been linked to etiopathogenic risk and a more severe multiyear clinical course of IBD in a recent prospective cohort study. IBD-specific diet and nutrition guidance for patients and caregivers are available from Crohn's and Colitis Canada and Crohn's and Colitis Foundation, and in ulcerative colitis (UC), decrease in red and processed meat may reduce flares.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^112gyJ4j]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the principal forms of inflammatory bowel disease. Both represent chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, which displays heterogeneity in inflammatory and symptomatic burden between patients and within individuals over time. Optimal management relies on understanding and tailoring evidence-based interventions by clinicians in partnership with patients. This guideline for management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults over 16 years of age was developed by Stakeholders representing UK physicians (British Society of Gastroenterology), surgeons (Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland), specialist nurses (Royal College of Nursing), paediatricians (British Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition), dietitians (British Dietetic Association), radiologists (British Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology), general practitioners (Primary Care Society for Gastroenterology) and patients (Crohn's and Colitis UK). A systematic review of 88247 publications and a Delphi consensus process involving 81 multidisciplinary clinicians and patients was undertaken to develop 168 evidence- and expert opinion-based recommendations for pharmacological, non-pharmacological and surgical interventions, as well as optimal service delivery in the management of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Comprehensive up-to-date guidance is provided regarding indications for, initiation and monitoring of immunosuppressive therapies, nutrition interventions, pre-, peri- and postoperative management, as well as structure and function of the multidisciplinary team and integration between primary and secondary care.

### The role of precision nutrition in the modulation of microbial composition and function in people with inflammatory bowel disease [^114xvBvX]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Inflammatory bowel diseases, principally Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, are multifactorial chronic conditions. Alterations in gut microbial patterns partly affect disease onset and severity. Moreover, the evolution of dietary patterns, and their effect on gut microbial behaviour, have been shown to play a crucial role in disease processes. This Viewpoint reviews the role of dietary patterns, their influence on the structure and function of the gut microbiome, and their effects on inflammation and immunity in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease. We also discuss innovative dietary intervention strategies, summarise findings that have been used to develop recommendations for clinical practice, and provide suggestions for the design of future studies for development of precision nutrition in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

ACG guideline — Grading of recommendations and implications for ulcerative colitis care states that factors influencing the strength of the recommendation include the quality of the evidence, clinical and patient-reported outcomes, risk of harm, and costs/ healthcare resource utilization. Strong recommendations are offered when the desirable effects of an intervention clearly outweigh the undesirable effects, with patient implications that most individuals would prefer the recommended course and clinician implications that most patients should receive the recommended course or an alternative with similar strength. Conditional recommendations are offered when trade-offs are less certain — either because of low quality evidence or because evidence suggests that desirable and undesirable effects are closely balanced, with patient implications that some individuals would want the suggested course while others may not and clinician implications that a shared decision-making model considering patient values and preferences is appropriate.

Conclusions

There is significant variation in nutritional management practices in Europe. Dietitian availability is not optimal for many patients and adherence to recommendations regarding nutrition screening tools is patchy. The main factor associated with differences in practice was the country of the respondent.

More future research is needed for more detailed and comprehensive research on nutritional management of acute severe flare of IBD, as well as reasons for specific practices and hinders for implementing evidence-based guidelines in clinical practice. The current evidence and knowledge gaps will be summarised in the upcoming ECCO consensus on Diet and Nutrition in IBD.

- bowel obstruction with no possibility of placement of a feeding tube beyond the obstruction, or if these attempts have failed

- other complications, such as an anastomotic leak or a high output intestinal fistula.

### Dietary management of adults with IBD-the emerging role of dietary therapy [^116ag8xh]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Historically, dietitians played a minor part in the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Patients were commonly referred for consequences of uncontrolled disease, such as malnutrition and bowel obstruction risk. Today, dietitians are fundamental members of the multidisciplinary IBD team, from educating on the role of diet at diagnosis and throughout the lifespan of a patient with IBD to guiding primary induction therapy. This aspect is reflected in published guidelines for IBD management, which previously placed diet as only a minor factor, but now have diet-specific publications. This Review describes a four-step approach in a dietitian's assessment and management of diet in patients with IBD: (1) identifying and correcting nutritional gaps and dietary imbalances; (2) considering diet to treat active disease with the use of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) or emerging diets that could replace EEN; (3) using therapeutic diets to control existing complications of IBD, such as reduced fibre to prevent bowel obstruction in stricturing disease or a fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols diet to manage co-existing functional gut symptoms; and (4) considering the role of diet in preventing IBD development in high-risk populations.

### Dietary interventions for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^116eSYEF]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

This study aimed (1) to systematically review controlled trials of solid food diets for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); and (2) to grade the overall quality of evidence.

Methods

Systematic review of prospective controlled trials of solid food diets for the induction or maintenance of remission in IBD. Two authors independently performed study selection, data extraction, and assessment of certainty of evidence. Meta-analyses were performed on studies with quantitative data on response, remission, and relapse.

Results

There were 27 studies for meta-analysis. For induction of remission in Crohn's disease (CD), low refined carbohydrate diet and symptoms-guided diet outperformed controls, but studies had serious imprecision and very low certainty of evidence. The Mediterranean diet was similar to the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (low certainty of evidence), and partial enteral nutrition (PEN) was similar to exclusive enteral nutrition (very low certainty of evidence). PEN reduced risk of relapse (very low certainty of evidence), whereas reduction of red meat or refined carbohydrates did not (low certainty of evidence). For ulcerative colitis, diets were similar to controls (very low and low certainty of evidence).

Conclusions

Among the most robust dietary trials in IBD currently available, certainty of evidence remains very low or low. Nonetheless, emerging data suggest potential benefit with PEN for induction and maintenance of remission in CD. Reduction of red meat and refined carbohydrates might not reduce risk of CD relapse. As more dietary studies become available, the certainty of evidence could improve, thus allowing for more meaningful recommendations for patients.

### Dietary interventions for induction and maintenance of remission in inflammatory bowel disease [^116f4X1G]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprised of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is characterized by chronic mucosal inflammation, frequent hospitalizations, adverse health economics, and compromised quality of life. Diet has been hypothesised to influence IBD activity.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dietary interventions on IBD outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP from inception to 31 January 2019. We also scanned reference lists of included studies, relevant reviews and guidelines.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of dietary manipulations to other diets in participants with IBD. Studies that exclusively focused on enteral nutrition, oral nutrient supplementation, medical foods, probiotics, and parenteral nutrition were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently performed study selection, extracted data and assessed bias using the risk of bias tool. We conducted meta-analyses where possible using a random-effects model and calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

The review included 18 RCTs with 1878 participants. The studies assessed different dietary interventions for active CD (six studies), inactive CD (seven studies), active UC (one study) and inactive UC (four studies). Dietary interventions involved either the consumption of low amounts or complete exclusion of one or more food groups known to trigger IBD symptoms. There was limited scope for data pooling as the interventions and control diets were diverse. The studies were mostly inadequately powered. Fourteen studies were rated as high risk of bias. The other studies were rated as unclear risk of bias. The effect of high fiber, low refined carbohydrates, low microparticle diet, low calcium diet, symptoms-guided diet and highly restricted organic diet on clinical remission in active CD is uncertain. At 4 weeks, remission was induced in: 100% (4/4) of participants in the low refined carbohydrates diet group compared to 0% (0/3) of participants in the control group (RR 7.20, 95% CI 0.53 to 97.83; 7 participants; 1 study; very low certainty evidence). At 16 weeks, 44% (23/52) of participants in the low microparticle diet achieved clinical remission compared to 25% (13/51) of control-group participants (RR 3.13, 95% CI 0.22 to 43.84; 103 participants; 2 studies; I² = 73%; very low certainty evidence). Fifty per cent (16/32) of participants in the symptoms-guided diet group achieved clinical remission compared to 0% (0/19) of control group participants (RR 20.00, 95% CI 1.27 to 315.40; 51 participants; 1 study; very low certainty evidence) (follow-up unclear). At 24 weeks, 50% (4/8) of participants in the highly restricted organic diet achieved clinical remission compared to 50% (5/10) of participants in the control group (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.53; 18 participants; 1 study; very low certainty evidence). At 16 weeks, 37% (16/43) participants following a low calcium diet achieved clinical remission compared to 30% (12/40) in the control group (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.29; 83 participants; 1 study; very low certainty evidence). The effect of low refined carbohydrate diets, symptoms-guided diets and low red processed meat diets on relapse in inactive CD is uncertain. At 12 to 24 months, 67% (176/264) of participants in low refined carbohydrate diet relapsed compared to 64% (193/303) in the control group (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.25; 567 participants; 3 studies; I² = 35%; low certainty evidence). At 6 to 24 months, 48% (24/50) of participants in the symptoms-guided diet group relapsed compared to 83% (40/48) participants in the control diet (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.01; 98 participants; 2 studies; I² = 54%; low certainty evidence). At 48 weeks, 66% (63/96) of participants in the low red and processed meat diet group relapsed compared to 63% (75/118) of the control group (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.26; 214 participants; 1 study; low certainty evidence). At 12 months, 0% (0/16) of participants on an exclusion diet comprised of low disaccharides / grains / saturated fats / red and processed meat experienced clinical relapse compared to 26% (10/38) of participants on a control group (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.76; 54 participants; 1 study; very low certainty evidence). The effect of a symptoms-guided diet on clinical remission in active UC is uncertain. At six weeks, 36% (4/11) of symptoms-guided diet participants achieved remission compared to 0% (0/10) of usual diet participants (RR 8.25, 95% CI 0.50 to 136.33; 21 participants; 1 study; very low certainty evidence). The effect of the Alberta-based anti-inflammatory diet, the Carrageenan-free diet or milk-free diet on relapse rates in inactive UC is uncertain. At 6 months, 36% (5/14) of participants in the Alberta-based anti-inflammatory diet group relapsed compared to 29% (4/14) of participants in the control group (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.70; 28 participants; 1 study; very low certainty evidence). Thirty per cent (3/10) of participants following the carrageenan-free diet for 12 months relapsed compared to 60% (3/5) of the participants in the control group (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.64; 15 participants; 1 study; very low certainty evidence). At 12 months, 59% (23/39) of milk free diet participants relapsed compared to 68% (26/38) of control diet participants (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.15; 77 participants; 2 studies; I² = 0%; low certainty evidence). None of the included studies reported on diet-related adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

The effects of dietary interventions on CD and UC are uncertain. Thus no firm conclusions regarding the benefits and harms of dietary interventions in CD and UC can be drawn. There is need for consensus on the composition of dietary interventions in IBD and more RCTs are required to evaluate these interventions. Currently, there are at least five ongoing studies (estimated enrollment of 498 participants). This review will be updated when the results of these studies are available.

### YouTube as a source of information for food, diet-related items, and advisory comments for the management of inflammatory bowel disease [^112DJhN4]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises a spectrum of chronic, debilitating disorders of the gastrointestinal tract including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). While the cause of IBD remains unknown, nutritional epidemiology and evidence from animal experiments implicate dietary ingredients and patterns including a diet high in fat, protein (mainly of animal origin), and ultra-processed food and low in fiber as important environmental factors in IBD onset.

Currently, the only well-established dietary treatment in IBD is exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN), which is used for induction of remission mostly in pediatric CD. Over the past 2 decades, several food-based exclusion diets have been suggested as potential treatments for CD and UC, some of which demonstrated promising efficacy signals such as the CD-TREAT (Crohn's disease treatment with eating) diet and the CDED (Crohn's disease exclusion diet). Nonetheless, current societal guidelines do not recommend the use of any solid food–based exclusion diet as a treatment option for the induction or maintenance of clinical remission in IBD.

Although the use of EEN as a primary induction treatment is well established in children, and recently has become so in adults with active CD, patients often believe that some healthcare professionals may disregard the role of diet in the management of IBD. In turn, this may prompt patients to modify their diet to self-manage their symptoms and control their disease. Such dietary modifications may range from the exclusion of specific foods perceived to provoke symptomsto the use of dietary complementary and alternative therapies.

Due to its ease of use and readily accessible information, the Internet and its social media and communication platforms have now become prominent sources of health-related information for patients and their families. In 2 previous surveys, the Internet and advice from gastroenterologists were the most frequent sources of health-related information for patients with IBD. In another survey, the use of the Internet as a source of IBD-related information was positively associated with disease severity, potentially suggesting that patients with treatment-refractory disease are more likely to seek alternative treatment options beyond those provided by their healthcare providers.

### Management of ulcerative colitis [^115TyGXe]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Medical management of UC

The treatment recommendations are based on the guidelines produced by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the joint guidelines produced by the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) and European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN). These guidelines provide very useful and comprehensive algorithms, which cover most common clinical eventualities.

Most patients with UC can be treated on an outpatient basis, but with hospitalisation necessary for ASC. The main aim of treatment of UC in children is to achieve maximum possible symptomatic control with minimal side effects, while allowing children to function as normally as possible. The target for treatment increasingly is also looking at intestinal healing beyond simple symptomatic control to try and reduce the risk of long-term complications and surgery. Treatments can be broadly considered as those used to induce remission (at diagnosis or for a subsequent flare), such as 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) agents, corticosteroids and biologics, and those used for long-term maintenance of remission such as 5-ASA agents, biologics and thiopurines.

### French national consensus clinical guidelines for the management of ulcerative colitis [^111ssH5W]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of multifactorial etiology that primarily affects the colonic mucosa. The disease progresses over time, and clinical management guidelines should reflect its dynamic nature. There is limited evidence supporting UC management in specific clinical situations, thus precluding an evidence-based approach.

Aim

To use a formal consensus method - the nominal group technique (NGT) - to develop a clinical practice expert opinion to outline simple algorithms and practices, optimize UC management, and assist clinicians in making treatment decisions.

Methods

The consensus was developed by an expert panel of 37 gastroenterologists from various professional organizations with experience in UC management using the qualitative and iterative NGT, incorporating deliberations based on the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation recommendations, recent reviews of scientific literature, and pertinent discussion topics developed by a steering committee. Examples of clinical cases for which there are limited evidence-based data from clinical trials were used. Two working groups proposed and voted on treatment algorithms that were then discussed and voted for by the nominal group as a whole, in order to reach a consensus.

Results

A clinical practice guideline covering management of the following clinical situations was developed: (i) moderate and severe UC; (ii) acute severe UC; (iii) pouchitis; (iv) refractory proctitis, in the form of treatment algorithms.

Conclusions

Given the limited available evidence-based data, a formal consensus methodology was used to develop simple treatment guidelines for UC management in different clinical situations that is now accessible via an online application.

### Role of diet in prevention versus treatment of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis [^113Xq5Ng]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Diet is a modifiable risk factor for disease course and data over the past decade have emerged to indicate its role in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). However, literature is riddled with misinterpretation of data, often leading to unexpected or conflicting results. The key understanding is that causative factors in disease development do not always proceed to an opportunity to change disease course, once established. Here, we discuss the data on dietary influences in three distinct disease states for CD and UC-predisease, active disease and quiescent disease. We appraise the literature for how our dietary recommendations should be shaped to prevent disease development and if or how that differs for CD and UC induction therapy and maintenance therapy. In UC, principles of healthy eating are likely to play a role in all states of disease. Conversely, data linking dietary factors to CD prevention and treatment are paradoxical with the highest quality evidence for CD treatment being exclusive enteral nutrition, a lactose, gluten and fibre-free diet comprising solely of ultraprocessed food-all dietary factors that are not associated or inversely associated with CD prevention. High-quality evidence from dietary trials is much awaited to expand our understanding and ultimately lead our dietary recommendations for targeted patient populations.

Environmental and lifestyle factors play an important role in the natural history of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. A group of international experts from the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases voted on a series of consensus statements to inform the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The recommendations include avoiding traditional cigarette smoking in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, screening for symptoms of depression, anxiety, and psychosocial stressors at diagnosis and during flares (with referral to mental health professionals when appropriate), and encouraging regular physical activity as tolerated. Patients using dietary approaches for treatment of their IBD should be encouraged to adopt diets that are best supported by evidence and involve monitoring for the objective resolution of inflammation. We recommend formal assessment for obesity and nutritional deficiencies, and patients should be encouraged to maintain a normal body-mass index. A shared decision-making approach to contraception should include the consideration of IBD-related factors, and risk factors for venous thromboembolism. Long-term or frequent use of high-dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided. For primary prevention of disease in the offspring of patients with IBD, we recommend avoiding passive exposure to tobacco, using antibiotics judiciously, and considering breastfeeding when able.

Regardless of the therapeutic choices made, it is also essential to ensure optimal patient engagement and compliance, which in turn will lead to a better recognition of flare symptoms and self-management. Additionally, monitoring everyday life aspects and disease burden, such as nutritional status and diet, is crucial. Several emerging studies are investigating the role of diet in patients with IBD and the potential benefits of nutritional counseling in UC management. Future clinical research is needed to evaluate the impact of dietary recommendations on therapeutic outcomes and maintain adequate nutrition(Figure 1).

UC, ulcerative colitis.

Another relevant aspect in current and future UC management is the potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on clinical practice. As infrastructure evolves, AI-powered disease measurement tools may enable procedures to be performed locally and analyzed via cloud-based platforms, enhancing standardization and objectivity of care. Recent advancements have seen AI replicate expert endoscopic interpretation with efficiency and near-perfect reproducibility. Moreover, AI holds promise for histologic interpretation of remission and provides real-time histologic information to IBD endoscopists without the need for biopsy.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aim

Acute severe colitis (ASC) is one of the few emergencies in pediatric gastroenterology. Tight monitoring and timely medical and surgical interventions may improve outcomes and minimize morbidity and mortality. We aimed to standardize daily treatment of ASC in children through detailed recommendations and practice points which are based on a systematic review of the literature and consensus of experts.

Methods

These guidelines are a joint effort of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) and the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN). Fifteen predefined questions were addressed by working subgroups. An iterative consensus process, including 2 face-to-face meetings, was followed by voting of the national representatives of ECCO and all members of the Paediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Porto group of ESPGHAN (43 voting experts).

Results

A total of 24 recommendations and 43 practice points were endorsed with a consensus rate of at least 91% regarding diagnosis, monitoring, and management of ASC in children. A summary flowchart is presented based on daily scoring of the Paediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index. Several topics have been altered since the previous 2011 guidelines and from those published in adults.

Discussion

These guidelines standardize the management of ASC in children in an attempt to optimize outcomes of this intensive clinical scenario.

### Nutrition in inflammatory bowel disease [^111NHhAu]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

The diet of industrialized nations may contribute to the pathogenesis of both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn disease (CD). Malnutrition is relatively unusual in UC, but in CD, which often affects the small intestine, it is frequent and may be severe. Nutrition support is therefore frequently indicated. First principles of artificial nutrition can be applied effectively using the gut whenever possible. Parenteral nutrition is generally required only in those with short bowel syndrome. An increasing literature (especially in pediatrics) favors the use of defined exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) in the primary treatment of active CD. Controlled trials are, however, lacking, and recommendations are accordingly not of the highest rank. It appears that in this context, simple polymeric regimens are usually sufficient, and there is currently insufficient evidence to make a strong recommendation for disease-specific feeds. In the maintenance of remission in CD, controlled data demonstrate that defined EN reduces the risk of relapse requiring steroid treatment. There are no data in support of primary nutrition therapy in UC either in management of the acute flare or in maintenance. In conclusion, nutrition therapy in adults with inflammatory bowel disease is probably both undervalued and underused, but the evidence base needs to be strengthened to confirm its efficacy, determine better those patients most likely to benefit, and optimize the regimens to be employed.

### Management of paediatric ulcerative colitis, part 1: ambulatory care-an updated evidence-based consensus guideline from the European society of paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation [^116WiLpP]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objectives

Despite advances in the management of ambulatory paediatric ulcerative colitis (UC), challenges remain as many patients are refractory to therapy and some require colectomy. The aim of these guidelines is to provide an update on optimal care for UC through detailed recommendations and practice points.

Methods

These guidelines are an update to those published in 2018 and are a joint effort of the Paediatric IBD Porto group of European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation. An extensive literature search with subsequent evidence appraisal using the Oxford methodology was performed, followed by three online voting sessions and a consensus face‐to‐face meeting. Thirty‐nine recommendations and 77 practice points were endorsed by the 25 experts with at least an 84% consensus rate.

Results

Robust evidence‐based recommendations and detailed practice points are provided. In addition to reemphasising and updating the role of more 'traditional' UC therapies, these guidelines outline optimising the use of antitumour necrosis factor therapies and integrating newer biologics and small molecules, as well as supportive therapy, to improve outcomes and provide an updated management algorithm. Measurement and monitoring tools and decision aids are provided, and additional aspects, including nutritional support, extraintestinal manifestations, pouchitis, inflammatory bowel disease‐unclassified and patient support, are discussed. Some aspects, including surgery and thromboprophylaxis, are covered in the acute severe UC guidelines.

Conclusions

These guidelines serve as an aid in managing children with UC through a combination of evidence‐based recommendations and more practical practice points in the ambulatory setting.

### Diet and inflammatory bowel disease: review of patient-targeted recommendations [^115kwFte]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Patients have strong beliefs about the role of diet in the cause of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and in exacerbating or alleviating ongoing symptoms from IBD. The rapid increase in the incidence and prevalence of IBD in recent decades strongly suggests an environmental trigger for IBD, one of which may be dietary patterns. There are several pathways where diet may influence intestinal inflammation, such as direct dietary antigens, altering the gut microbiome, and affecting gastrointestinal permeability. However, data that altering diet can change the natural history of IBD are scarce, and evidence-based dietary guidelines for patients with IBD are lacking. Patients, therefore, seek nonmedical resources for dietary guidance, such as patient support groups and unverified sources on the Internet. The aim of this review is to identify patient-targeted dietary recommendations for IBD and to critically appraise the nutritional value of these recommendations. We review patient-targeted dietary information for IBD from structured Internet searches and popular defined diets. Patient-targeted dietary recommendations focus on food restrictions and are highly conflicting. High-quality dietary intervention studies are needed to facilitate creation of evidence-based dietary guidelines for patients with IBD.

### Diet in the pathogenesis and treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases [^116sgjfK]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Some of the most common symptoms of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD, which include ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) are abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. It is therefore not surprising that clinicians and patients have wondered whether dietary patterns influence the onset or course of IBD. The question of what to eat is among the most commonly asked by patients, and among the most difficult to answer for clinicians. There are substantial variations in dietary behaviors of patients and recommendations for them, although clinicians do not routinely endorse specific diets for patients with IBD. Dietary clinical trials have been limited by their inability to include a placebo control, contamination of study groups, and inclusion of patients receiving medical therapies. Additional challenges include accuracy of information on dietary intake, complex interactions between foods consumed, and differences in food metabolism among individuals. We review the roles of diet in the etiology and management of IBD based on plausible mechanisms and clinical evidence. Researchers have learned much about the effects of diet on the mucosal immune system, epithelial function, and the intestinal microbiome; these findings could have significant practical implications. Controlled studies of patients receiving enteral nutrition and observations made from patients on exclusion diets have shown that components of whole foods can have deleterious effects for patients with IBD. Additionally, studies in animal models suggested that certain nutrients can reduce intestinal inflammation. In the future, engineered diets that restrict deleterious components but supplement beneficial nutrients could be used to modify the luminal intestinal environment of patients with IBD; these might be used alone or in combination with immunosuppressive agents, or as salvage therapy for patients who do not respond or lose responsiveness to medical therapies. Stricter diets might be required to induce remission, and more sustainable exclusion diets could be used to maintain long-term remission.

### Patient satisfaction in the management of mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis: results of a Delphi study among patients and physicians [^112592n4]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Goals

To determine factors contributing to satisfaction with treatment in mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) from both the patients and the physicians perspectives.

Background

Despite the impact of UC on different aspects of daily life, patient's and physician's satisfaction with clinical management has been poorly evaluated.

Study

A Delphi study involving 22 patients and 20 clinicians was conducted. The patient's questionnaire included 285 items regarding diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up, whereas the physician's questionnaire added 32 specific items for clinicians. Relevance of items was scored from 1 (not at all important) to 9 (very important). Recommendations were based on very highly rated items.

Results

Most items were rated consistently by patients and physicians with some exceptions. Patients emphasized the choice of moderate flare-ups to be followed at the hospital setting rather than in primary care as well as to be informed on aspects, such as diet and impact of UC on their health and lifestyle. Treatment-related efficacy, safety, and improved quality of life were relevant for both patients and physicians. Physicians believed that to reduce pill burden was a crucial aspect to improve patient's satisfaction. Patients preferred oral administration treatment over rectal treatment.

Conclusions

The study identified specific aspects related to the management of mild-to-moderate UC that both patients and physicians considered to be highly relevant for patient satisfaction. Recommendation based on these factors would be important at the time of designing and implementing strategies targeting satisfaction in UC patients.

### Working to answer the effectiveness of nutrition in IBD: still a ways to Go [^115tKhhV]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The Specific Carbohydrate diet (SCD) is an exclusion diet widely popular among patients with IBD, which restricts carbohydrates and processed foods. Two recently concluded controlled studies PRODUCE (Personalized Research on Diet in Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease) and DINE-CD (The Diet to Induce Remission in Crohn's disease) confirm efficacy of SCD on symptom control but fail to demonstrate a sustained anti-inflammatory response. These dietary studies are a welcome addition to a poorly understood field of dietary management of IBD, we explore some practical challenges including trial designs, recruitment, and retention in long term dietary intervention studies. Future dietary intervention studies should, therefore, incorporate endoscopic end points to establish a true anti-inflammatory response to elimination diets, preferably with detailed multi-omics analysis to understand mechanism of action.

### Diet as a treatment for inflammatory bowel disease: is it ready for prime time? [^115ofuaL]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diet remains an important topic for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), yet few guidelines for dietary recommendations exist. There is a growing interest in the use of diet as treatment or adjuvant therapy for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Here, we highlight the latest evidence on the use of diet for treatment of symptoms, active disease and maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

Recent Findings

The Crohn's Disease Exclusion Diet (CDED) and the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) are studied diets that have gained popularity, but there is growing interest in the use and efficacy of less restrictive diets such as the Mediterranean diet. Recent data suggest healthful dietary patterns alone, with an emphasis on whole foods that are high in vegetable fibre and that promote less consumption of ultra-processed foods may also help achieve remission in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.

Summary

In this review, we summarize the literature on diet as treatment for IBD. We highlight the latest clinical dietary studies, randomized clinical trials, as well as new and emerging diets for the treatment of IBD.

### Fiber in the treatment and maintenance of inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^1164pbpR]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Dietary fiber may favorably influence fermentation, gastrointestinal inflammation, and disease progression in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis (UC), and pouchitis and offer an attractive therapeutic addition to pharmacological treatment. This systematic review appraised data from randomized controlled trials of fiber in the management of inflammatory bowel disease.

Methods

The review followed Cochrane and PRISMA recommendations. Seven electronic databases were searched along with hand searching and contacting experts. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials of the effects of fiber on clinical endpoints (primarily disease activity for treatment or maintenance) or physiological outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

Results

In total, 23 randomized controlled trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria (UC, 10; Crohn's disease, 12; and pouchitis, 1) recruiting 1296 patients. In UC, 3/10 studies reported fiber supplementation to benefit disease outcomes. In Crohn's disease, 0/12 studies and in pouchitis 1/1 study reported a benefit on disease activity. Despite this, a number of studies reported favorable intragroup effects on physiological outcomes including fecal butyrate, fecal calprotectin, inflammatory cytokines, microbiota, and gastrointestinal symptom indices. Meta-analysis was not possible.

Conclusions

There is limited weak evidence for the efficacy of fiber in improving disease outcomes in UC and pouchitis. The potential antiinflammatory role of fiber is intriguing and merits further investigation in adequately powered clinical trials. Excluding overt gastrointestinal obstruction, there was no evidence that fiber intake should be restricted in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

### Dietary guidance from the international organization for the study of inflammatory bowel diseases [^1136Fj65]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Recent evidence points to a plausible role of diet and the microbiome in the pathogenesis of both Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC). Dietary therapies based on exclusion of table foods and replacement with nutritional formulas and/or a combination of nutritional formulas and specific table foods may induce remission in CD. In UC, specific dietary components have also been associated with flare of disease. While evidence of varying quality has identified potential harmful or beneficial dietary components, physicians and patients at the present time do not have guidance as to which foods are safe, may be protective or deleterious for these diseases. The current document has been compiled by the nutrition cluster of the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IOIBD) based on the best current evidence to provide expert opinion regarding specific dietary components, food groups and food additives that may be prudent to increase or decrease in the diet of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases to control and prevent relapse of inflammatory bowel diseases.

Consider preferring enteral nutrition using formulas or liquids over parenteral nutrition unless completely contraindicated.

### Nutrition and diet in inflammatory bowel disease [^113mEmCx]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diet is known to have a major role in the expression of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The role of dietary interventions and enteral nutrition in the management of IBD remains unelucidated. This study was to review the current evidence for dietary risk factors for the development of IBD and the efficacies of dietary and enteral interventions.

Recent Findings

High dietary intakes of total fats, polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, and meat are associated with an increased risk of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Further prospective studies are required to confirm these observations. Among various dietary interventions, none has shown striking efficacy. Meta-analyses have shown enteral nutrition to be inferior to corticosteroids in adults with active Crohn's disease. However, in children, a meta-analysis has shown no significant difference in the remission rates between enteral nutrition and corticosteroid therapy. Although the evidence level is not striking, enteral nutrition may be useful for maintaining remission in patients with quiescent Crohn's disease.

Summary

Dietary risk factors for IBD and the therapeutic benefit of dietary and enteral interventions need to be confirmed by further well designed studies in large cohorts of patients.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the management of mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis [^1177Whfv]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

AGA mild–moderate ulcerative colitis — Recommendation 1 indicates that in patients with extensive mild–moderate ulcerative colitis (UC), "the AGA recommends using either standard-dose mesalamine (2–3 g/d) or diazo-bonded 5-ASA rather than low-dose mesalamine, sulfasalazine, or no treatment", with "Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence", and it comments that "Patients already on sulfasalazine in remission or patients with prominent arthritic symptoms may reasonably choose sulfasalazine 2–4 g/d if alternatives are cost-prohibitive, albeit with higher rate of intolerance".

### Management of pediatric ulcerative colitis: joint ECCO and ESPGHAN evidence-based consensus guidelines [^116KUR4R]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) shares many features with adult-onset disease but there are some unique considerations; therefore, therapeutic approaches have to be adapted to these particular needs. We aimed to formulate guidelines for managing UC in children based on a systematic review (SR) of the literature and a robust consensus process. The present article is a product of a joint effort of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN).

Methods

A group of 27 experts in pediatric IBD participated in an iterative consensus process including 2 face-to-face meetings, following an open call to ESPGHAN and ECCO members. A list of 23 predefined questions were addressed by working subgroups based on a SR of the literature.

Results

A total of 40 formal recommendations and 68 practice points were endorsed with a consensus rate of at least 89% regarding initial evaluation, how to monitor disease activity, the role of endoscopic evaluation, medical and surgical therapy, timing and choice of each medication, the role of combined therapy, and when to stop medications. A management flowchart, based on the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI), is presented.

Conclusions

These guidelines provide clinically useful points to guide the management of UC in children. Taken together, the recommendations offer a standardized protocol that allows effective, timely management and monitoring of the disease course, while acknowledging that each patient is unique.
