## Question

Can subcutaneous ICD and cardiac contractility Modulation device can interfere with each other's function

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD) and a cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) device can interfere with each other's function, and how to manage that risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the device mechanisms and potential sources of interaction. Then, I should review clinical evidence for interference and how often it occurs. Next, I will examine the mechanisms of interference and whether they are predictable. After that, I should outline practical mitigation strategies used in studies and practice. Finally, I will synthesize a bottom-line answer and provide a cautious, clinically actionable recommendation with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the device fundamentals so I don't jump to conclusions. The S-ICD uses a subcutaneous lead and generator to detect ventricular tachyarrhythmias via surface ECG vectors and deliver high-energy shocks without intravascular leads, relying on morphology and rate discrimination rather than intracardiac electrograms, which inherently makes it sensitive to surface signal quality and artifacts [^113SWoMj] [^116QftA3]. CCM delivers non-excitatory biphasic pulses to the right ventricular septum during the absolute refractory period via transvenous leads to enhance contractility, and it requires precise sensing to time those pulses correctly, so any noise or sensing perturbation could theoretically impair therapy delivery or safety [^116qAVdH] [^115p92hX].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical evidence before assuming interference is common. Multiple series report successful combined use of S-ICD and CCM with structured testing and follow-up, generally showing no clinically significant interference when protocols are followed. In a 20-patient cohort with mean 34-month follow-up, intraoperative crosstalk testing, S-ICD testing with CCM active, and postoperative bicycle ergometry found no double counting or T-wave oversensing, and all spontaneous VT/VF episodes were appropriately detected and terminated, suggesting reliable coexistence with proper testing [^112WtfyQ] [^1177NdL2]. A separate single-center series of 10 patients similarly reported no adverse device interactions with combined S-ICD and CCM over a mean 17-month follow-up using comparable testing workflows [^116uwQXJ]. But hold on, I should also note exceptions: a case report documented S-ICD misannotation of QRS complexes and T waves during CCM activation that resolved with CCM reprogramming, indicating that interference can occur and is manageable [^113fxdHA].

> I need to check the mechanisms of interference so I can anticipate when problems arise. The most plausible mechanism is electrical signal contamination of the S-ICD's surface sensing vectors by high-energy CCM pulses delivered to the ventricular septum, which can mimic or distort QRS/T morphology and trigger oversensing or misclassification, particularly if the S-ICD's automatic vector selection suboptimally includes a noisy channel [^113fxdHA] [^116QftA3]. Let me consider electromagnetic interference as well: CCM devices can be susceptible to environmental EMF at power frequencies, and while this is not a direct CCM-to-S-ICD crosstalk issue, it reinforces the principle that sensing integrity is vulnerable and that programming sensitivity and environmental exposure matter for reliable device behavior [^114NDENC] [^114iaqqL].

> Next, I should review the mitigation strategies that have proven effective in practice. I will now examine the testing protocols used in the clinical series: intraoperative crosstalk testing with both devices active, induced VF testing with CCM on to ensure timely detection and shock delivery, and early postoperative bicycle ergometry with real-time vector monitoring to unmask exercise-related oversensing or double counting, with manual vector selection if needed [^1177NdL2] [^115FwHVF]. Hold on, I should verify programming principles too: using dual-zone detection with discrimination in the conditional zone and careful vector selection reduces inappropriate shocks in S-ICD systems and is prudent when CCM is present, and if oversensing persists, CCM parameter adjustments can eliminate the offending signal signature while preserving CCM benefit [^112iQVg4] [^113fxdHA].

> Let me synthesize the bottom line, but I should double-check that I'm not overstating certainty. Yes, S-ICD and CCM can interfere with each other, but clinically meaningful interference appears uncommon and is largely preventable with standardized testing and programming; when it does occur, it is typically due to S-ICD oversensing of CCM-related signal artifacts and is correctable by vector optimization or CCM reprogramming, without compromising arrhythmia detection or CCM efficacy in reported series [^112WtfyQ] [^116uwQXJ] [^113fxdHA]. I should confirm guideline context as well: contemporary guidance supports S-ICD use in ICD-indicated patients who do not require pacing or CRT, and CCM is considered in selected HFrEF patients not eligible for CRT, so the combination is clinically appropriate in the right phenotype when precautions are taken [^113wLDAC] [^116qAVdH].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical recommendation is precise and safe. For patients with indications for both devices, proceed with combined implantation using a protocolized approach: perform intraoperative crosstalk testing and VF testing with CCM active, select the cleanest S-ICD sensing vector with stable baseline and high QRS/T ratio, program dual-zone detection with discrimination in the lower zone, and complete early postoperative exercise testing with real-time vector surveillance to detect latent oversensing. If interference appears, prioritize vector optimization first and consider CCM parameter adjustments if needed, documenting any changes and arranging close early follow-up [^1177NdL2] [^115FwHVF] [^112iQVg4]. Hold on, I should verify one more thing: avoid over-sensitivity settings on CCM when possible to reduce susceptibility to environmental EMI, and counsel patients to report unusual device behaviors promptly, as this aligns with broader EMI safety principles for CCM systems in daily life [^114NDENC] [^114iaqqL].

---

In rare cases, S-ICD and CCM can interfere, most often due to **EMI from CCM pulses** causing S-ICD oversensing or T-wave misclassification, potentially triggering inappropriate shocks or therapy delays [^113fxdHA]. This risk is minimized by **careful device programming** and **intraoperative crosstalk testing** [^113SGiEs]; when interference is detected, reprogramming CCM parameters or selecting an alternative S-ICD vector usually resolves the issue [^113fxdHA]. Routine post-implant exercise testing with both devices active is recommended to detect latent interactions [^113SGiEs]. Overall, with proper testing and programming, combined S-ICD and CCM therapy is safe and effective [^112WtfyQ].

---

## Mechanisms of interference

Interference between S-ICD and CCM is rare but can occur via **electromagnetic interference (EMI)** and **signal overlap**:

- **EMI from CCM pulses**: CCM delivers high-energy, non-excitatory pulses during the absolute refractory period, which can generate EMI that the S-ICD may interpret as noise or arrhythmia, causing oversensing or T-wave misclassification [^113fxdHA].

- **Signal overlap and oversensing**: CCM pulses may temporally overlap with S-ICD sensing windows, leading to double counting, T-wave oversensing, or misclassification of supraventricular tachycardia as ventricular arrhythmia [^113fxdHA].

- **Vector selection and lead positioning**: S-ICD sensing relies on subcutaneous vectors; CCM leads in the right ventricle can alter local electrical fields, potentially degrading S-ICD sensing quality and increasing oversensing risk [^115FwHVF].

---

## Clinical evidence of interference

Clinical studies and case reports document rare but clinically significant interference:

- **Case report**: A patient with ischemic cardiomyopathy and S-ICD developed S-ICD misannotation of QRS complexes and T waves during CCM activation; reprogramming CCM resolved the issue without compromising S-ICD function [^113fxdHA].

- **Clinical series**: In a cohort of 20 patients with combined S-ICD and CCM, intraoperative crosstalk testing revealed "noise" on S-ICD vectors in 11 patients when CCM was active, but no patient had double counting or inappropriate shocks after optimization; all ventricular arrhythmias were appropriately detected and treated [^1177NdL2].

- **Exercise testing**: Post-implant bicycle ergometry with both devices active detected no double counting or T-wave oversensing in any patient, suggesting that routine provocative testing helps identify latent interactions [^1177NdL2].

---

## Clinical consequences of interference

When interference occurs, potential consequences include:

- **Inappropriate shocks**: Oversensing or T-wave misclassification can trigger unnecessary shocks, causing patient discomfort, anxiety, and device battery depletion [^116w72ZL].

- **Delayed or missed therapy**: Undersensing or detection delays during true arrhythmias can postpone or miss life-saving therapy, though this has not been reported in clinical series [^1177NdL2].

- **Reduced device efficacy**: Persistent interference may necessitate device reprogramming or, rarely, device deactivation, potentially compromising therapy delivery [^113fxdHA].

---

## Strategies to minimize interference

Effective strategies to prevent or manage interference include:

- **Intraoperative crosstalk testing**: Perform systematic crosstalk testing during implantation of the second device to identify and mitigate interference early [^113SGiEs].

- **Careful device programming**: Adjust CCM signal timing, amplitude, and polarity; select optimal S-ICD sensing vectors; and use dual-zone programming with discrimination algorithms to reduce oversensing [^112iQVg4].

- **Post-implant exercise testing**: Routine bicycle ergometry or other provocative testing with both devices active helps detect latent interactions that may not be apparent at rest [^116uwQXJ].

- **Vector selection and lead positioning**: Optimize S-ICD vector selection and CCM lead placement to minimize signal overlap and EMI [^115FwHVF].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize careful patient selection and standardized testing protocols. S-ICD is recommended for patients with **ICD indications** who do not require pacing or CRT, particularly those at high infection risk or with limited vascular access [^113wLDAC] [^113pUeda]. CCM is indicated for **symptomatic HFrEF** patients with normal QRS duration who are not CRT candidates, and may be combined with S-ICD when pacing is not required [^116qAVdH] [^113SGiEs]. Combined implantation should follow established protocols, including **intraoperative crosstalk testing** and post-implant exercise testing, to ensure safe coexistence [^113SGiEs].

## Summary of evidence

| **Study** | **Findings** | **Recommendations** |
|-|-|-|
| Clinical series (20 patients) | - Noise on S-ICD vectors in 11 patients <br/> - No inappropriate shocks after optimization <br/> - All arrhythmias appropriately treated | - Intraoperative crosstalk testing <br/> - Post-implant exercise testing [^113SGiEs] |
| Case report | S-ICD misannotation during CCM activation; resolved with CCM reprogramming | - Careful programming <br/> - Vector selection [^113fxdHA] |
| Expert consensus | S-ICD and CCM can coexist safely with proper testing and programming | - Standardized testing protocols <br/> - Routine follow-up [^113SGiEs] |

---

## Conclusion

S-ICD and CCM can rarely interfere, typically via EMI causing S-ICD oversensing or T-wave misclassification; with careful device programming, intraoperative crosstalk testing, and post-implant exercise testing, these interactions are usually preventable or correctable. When interference occurs, **reprogramming CCM parameters or selecting an alternative S-ICD vector** typically resolves the issue, allowing safe, effective combined therapy [^113fxdHA].

Multiple randomized, multicenter trials have established the role of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in the treatment and prevention of sudden cardiac death. However, transvenous ICD leads have significant short- and long-term complications, offsetting some of the benefit of this therapy. This has led to the development of the entirely subcutaneous ICD. This system is safe and effective, avoiding the need for intravascular leads. It is best suited for patients at low risk for pacing and increased risk for transvenous lead complications. Ongoing randomized and long-term registries will help identify the optimal role of this device in clinical practice.

### Nonexcitatory, cardiac contractility modulation electrical impulses: feasibility study for advanced heart failure in patients with normal QRS duration [^114yHpWj]. Heart Rhythm (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac contractility modulation signals are associated with acutely improved hemodynamics, but chronic clinical impact is not defined.

Objectives

The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, pilot study was to determine the feasibility of safely and effectively delivering cardiac contractility modulation signals in patients with heart failure.

Methods

Forty-nine subjects with ejection fraction < 35%, normal QRS duration (105 ± 15 ms), and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV heart failure despite medical therapy received a cardiac contractility modulation pulse generator. Patients were randomized to have their devices programmed to deliver cardiac contractility modulation signals (n = 25, treatment group) or to remain off (n = 24, control group) for 6 months. Evaluations included NYHA class, 6-minute walk, cardiopulmonary stress test, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, and Holter monitoring.

Results

Although most baseline features were balanced between groups, ejection fraction (31.4% ± 7.4% vs 24.9% ± 6.5%, P = 0.003), end-diastolic dimension (52.1 ± 21.4 mm vs 62.5 ± 6.2 mm, P = 0.01), peak VO(2) (16.0 ± 2.9 mL O(2)/kg/min vs 14.3 ± 2.8 mL O(2)/kg/min, P = 0.02), and anaerobic threshold (12.3 ± 2.5 mL O(2)/kg/min vs 10.6 ± 2.4 mL O(2)/kg/min, P = 0.01) were worse in the treatment group than in the control group. Nevertheless, one death occurred in the control group, and more patients in the treatment group were free of hospitalization for any cause at 6 months (84% vs 62%). No change in ectopy was observed. Compared with baseline, 6-minute walk (13.4 m), peak VO(2) (0.2 mL O(2)/kg/min), and anaerobic threshold (0.8 mL O(2)/kg/min) increased more in the treatment group than in control. None of these differences were statistically significant (small sample size). NYHA and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire changed similarly in the two groups.

Conclusion

Despite a sicker population in the treatment group, no specific safety concerns emerged with chronic cardiac contractility modulation signal administration. Further study is required to definitively define the safety and efficacy of cardiac contractility modulation signals.

### Cardiac amyloidosis treated with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator and subcutaneous array lead system: report of a case and literature review [^115VRYSu]. Clinical Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Preventing ventricular arrhythmias in patients with cardiac amyloidosis is challenging since the amyloid protein deposition in the myocardium may interfere with the normal cardiac electric excitation. Most of these patients succumb to either progressive congestive heart failure, or sudden cardiac death (SCD). Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) offers a near sure means of preventing SCD.

Hypothesis

Myocardial infiltration with amyloid results in elevated defibrillation threshold (DFT). Intra-operative strategies may fail to lower DFT during implantation.

Methods

We present a case of a 64-year-old female who had cardiac amyloidosis, and was successfully treated with an ICD and a subcutaneous array lead system.

Conclusion

A subcutaneous array lead system is useful in reducing the DFT, and can terminate ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation by allowing more energy delivery and efficient defibrillation.

Heart Rhythm (2018). Medium credibility.

AHA/ACC/HRS ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death guideline — table of contents overview — outlines scope across concepts, evaluation, treatments, disease-specific management, populations, devices, and cross-cutting care. Topics include general concepts such as premature ventricular complexes and nonsustained VT, VT and VF during ACS, and sustained VT and VF not associated with ACS, as well as sudden cardiac death with incidence and population subgroups and risk prediction. Evaluation content covers history and physical examination; noninvasive evaluation including 12-lead ECG and exercise testing, ambulatory electrocardiography, implanted cardiac monitors, noninvasive cardiac imaging, biomarkers, and genetic considerations; and invasive testing including invasive cardiac imaging (cardiac catheterization or CT angiography) and electrophysiological study for VA. Therapies addressed include medication therapy, preventing SCD with HF medications, surgery and revascularization procedures in patients with ischemic heart disease with surgery for arrhythmia management, and autonomic modulation, plus acute management of specific VA. Ongoing management relates to specific disease states including ischemic heart disease and nonischemic cardiomyopathy with secondary and primary prevention of SCD and treatment of recurrent VA. Additional disease-focused sections include arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, cardiac sarcoidosis, heart failure (HF with reduced ejection fraction; left ventricular assist device; ICD use after heart transplantation), neuromuscular disorders, and cardiac channelopathies with specific cardiac channelopathy syndromes. The guideline also covers VA in the structurally normal heart (outflow tract and atrioventricular annular VA, papillary muscle VA, interfascicular reentrant VT, idiopathic polymorphic VT/VF), PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, and special populations (pregnancy, older patients with comorbidities, medication-induced arrhythmias, adult congenital heart disease). Device sections include subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and wearable cardioverter-defibrillator, and cross-cutting topics include special considerations for catheter ablation, postmortem evaluation of SCD, terminal care, shared decision-making, cost and value considerations, quality of life, and evidence gaps and future research needs.

### Type 2 diabetes is independently associated with all-cause mortality secondary to ventricular tachyarrhythmias [^11694nsW]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Study patients, design and data collection

The present study included retrospectively all patients presenting with ventricular tachyarrhythmias from 2002 until 2016 at one institution. All relevant clinical data related to the index event was documented using patients' files, daily records, documentation from diagnostic examinations and laboratory values, electrocardiograms (ECG), device recordings, and all further information derived from the electronic hospital information system.

Ventricular tachyarrhythmias comprised ventricular tachycardia (VT) and fibrillation (VF), as defined by current international guidelines. Sustained VT was defined by VT with a duration of more than 30 s or additional hemodynamic collapse within 30 s. Non-sustained VT are defined by less than 30 s. VT comprised wide QRS complexes (≥ 120 ms) at a rate greater than 100 beats/min. Ventricular tachyarrhythmias were documented by 12-lead ECG, ECG tele-monitoring and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD). In case of unstable course or during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) documentation was performed by external defibrillator monitoring. Documented VF was treated by external defibrillation and in case of prolonged instability with additional intravenous anti-arrhythmic drugs during CPR.

Further documented data contained baseline characteristics, prior medical history, prior medical treatment, length of index stay, detailed findings of laboratory values at baseline, data derived from all non-invasive or invasive cardiac diagnostics and device therapies. These included coronary angiography, electrophysiological examination, prior or newly implanted ICDs, pacemakers or cardiac contractility modulators (CCM), which were already implanted at index or at follow-up. Imaging modalities comprised echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI). The overall presence of an activated ICD summarizes the total sum of all patients with either a prior implanted ICD before admission, those undergoing new ICD implantation at index stay, as well as those with ICD implantation at the complete follow-up period after index hospitalization, referring to sole ICD, subcutaneous-ICD (s-ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillator function (CRT-D). Pharmacological treatment was documented according to the discharge medication of patients surviving index hospitalization. Rates of overall ICDs and of pharmacological therapies are referred to the number of surviving patients being discharged from index hospitalization.

Methods

Study Patients, Design, and Data Collection

The present study retrospectively included all consecutive patients presenting with ventricular tachyarrhythmias or SCA on hospital admission from 2002 until 2016 at the First Department of Medicine, University Medical Centre Mannheim, Germany. Using the hospital information system, all relevant clinical data related to the index event was documented. The data, analytic methods, and study materials will be made available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the procedure on reasonable personal request to the corresponding author.

Ventricular tachyarrhythmias comprised VT and VF, as defined by current international guidelines. 8, 9 Sustained VT was defined by duration of > 30 seconds or causing hemodynamic collapse within 30 seconds, and non‐sustained VT by duration of < 30 seconds both characterized by wide QRS complexes (≥ 120 ms) at a rate greater than 100 beats per minute. Ventricular tachyarrhythmias were documented by 12‐lead electrocardiogram (ECG), ECG tele‐ monitoring, implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or in case of unstable course or during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by external defibrillator monitoring. Documented VF was treated by external defibrillation and in case of prolonged instability with additional intravenous anti‐arrhythmic drugs during CPR. Onset of VT was stratified into VT occurring < 48 hours and ≥ 48 hours of AMI onset. High‐risk criteria in the setting of AMI comprised the presence of life‐threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias, aborted cardiac arrest, hemodynamic instability, or cardiogenic shock. 10

Further data being documented contained baseline characteristics, prior medical history, prior medical treatment, length of index stay, detailed findings of laboratory values at baseline, data derived from all non‐invasive or invasive cardiac diagnostics and device therapies, such as coronary angiography, electrophysiological examination, ICD, pacemaker or cardiac contractility modulation, as well as imaging modalities, such as echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. The overall presence of ICDs comprised the total sum of all patients with either a prior implanted ICD before admission, those undergoing new ICD implantation at index stay, as well as those with ICD implantation at the complete follow‐up period after index hospitalization, referring to conventional ICD, subcutaneous‐ICD (s‐ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillator function (CRT‐D). Pharmacological treatment was documented according to the discharge medication of patients surviving index hospitalization. Rates of overall ICDs and of pharmacological therapies are referred to the number of surviving patients being discharged from index hospitalization.

Overview of cardiac rhythm management devices and evolving techniques

Implantable cardioverter‐defibrillators

An ICD may be implanted alone or in combination with a CRT. Five types of commercially available implantable ICDs exist, characterized by the position of the ICD lead within the body (Figure 2). The subcutaneous ICD was created to avoid inserting the ICD lead into the venous system and the complications it can induce. The subcutaneous ICD eliminates the risk of device‐associated endocarditis and substantially reduces the incidence of lead dysfunction, thereby addressing two weaknesses of the transvenous ICD. Furthermore, the development of a modular pacing‐defibrillator system comprising a leadless pacemaker in wireless communication with a subcutaneous ICD has demonstrated that a subcutaneous ICD may safely provide antitachycardia and bradycardia pacing. The extravascular ICD has an ICD lead implanted in the substernal space just behind the sternum and connected to a pulse generator located in the lateral chest wall, and can provide shocks, antitachycardia pacing, and cardiac pacing in case of cardiac pause – but not in the context of continuous bradycardia – without an intracardiac lead. A wearable cardioverter‐defibrillator may be used for a temporary ICD indication or as a bridge to definitive ICD implantation.

Figure 2
Overview of implantable cardioverter‐defibrillators (ICD).

Cardiac physiological pacing

Cardiac physiological pacing refers to any form of cardiac pacing intended to restore or preserve ventricular synchronicity; it encompasses CRT with biventricular (BiV) pacing and conduction system pacing (CSP) (Figure 3).CRT with BiV pacing has been extensively studied in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the treatment of patients with HFrEF and prolonged QRS duration, and is most effective for patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB). However, not all patients with HFrEF and a wide QRS complex achieve improvement of electrical ventricular dyssynchrony. In addition, approximately 12% of patients with right ventricular pacemakers may develop pacing‐induced cardiomyopathy. Therefore, there has been a search for a more physiological solution to pace patients who need a conventional pacemaker and those who need a CRT device.

Figure 3

Ideally, physiological pacing should engage the intrinsic conduction system, activating the ventricles in a more normal and synchronous manner. CSP involves recruitment of the intrinsic conduction fibres, for example by His bundle pacing or left bundle branch area pacing, providing a more physiological approach to pacing.

Implantable cardioverter defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy

In patients with arrhythmias and HF, implantation of a cardiac device is associated with a significant survival benefit and improvement in functional capacity, depending on the type of device. Because of technological advancements over the last two decades, there is a wide range of implantable cardiac device alternatives for a wide range of clinical conditions and indications.

In general, all old trials on implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) are consistently showing an improvement in MLHFQ after implantation. More specifically, the ANXIETY‐CHF study investigated heart‐focused anxiety, general anxiety, depression, and QoL in patients with HF.

Psychological measures were assessed before and up to 2 years after the implantation of an ICD.

In this interesting report, total anxiety and related fear and attention and QoL improved significantly after device implantation. On the contrary, depression and HF‐related avoidance of physical activity remained unchanged. As expected, HF‐related anxiety seems to be more pronounced after defibrillator interventions and, therefore, psychological counselling in these patients is required not only to reduce anxiety but, also, to increase physical activity.

Cardiac contractility modulation

Cardiac contractility modulation (CCM), consisting of non‐excitatory electrical signals delivered to the heart during the absolute refractory period, is considered safe, improves exercise tolerance but not QoL (MLHFQ) in patients with NYHA functional class III or IV, QRS duration < 130 ms and LVEF ≥ 25% and ≤ 45%.

Cardiac contractility modulation is delivered by a two‐lead system allowing CCM therapy even in patients with atrial fibrillation, and it seems to exert more favourable effects on exercise tolerance in patients with mildly reduced LVEF with an adequate safety profile with respect to more severe left ventricular function.

Carotid baroreflex activation therapy

Baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) represents a promising therapeutic modality, offering better functional capacity, better QoL, and lower natriuretic peptide levels according to the multicentre, prospective, randomized, controlled BeAT‐HF trial.

But, again, well‐powered studies with longer follow‐up and diverse populations are needed before BAT can be incorporated in the HF guidelines and, therefore, in routine clinical practice.

### ACC / AHA / ASE / HFSA / HRS / SCAI / SCCT / SCMR 2025 appropriate use criteria for implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy, and pacing [^112LSVhm]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD) indications and contraindications — For patients who meet implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) criteria but have inadequate vascular access or high infection risk and in whom pacing for bradycardia, ventricular tachycardia (VT) termination, or cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is neither needed nor anticipated, a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is recommended; this is a Class I recommendation (Level of Evidence [LOE] B-nonrandomized [NR]). The choice for an S-ICD is reasonable when pacing (for bradycardia, VT termination, CRT) is neither needed nor anticipated (Class IIa, LOE B-NR), whereas an S-ICD should not be implanted and can cause harm if there is an indication for bradycardia pacing, CRT, or if antitachycardia pacing for VT termination is required (Class III: Harm, LOE B-NR).

Heart failure and cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) — assumptions and context note that clinicians should assume it is feasible to implant additional hardware if ICD is in place and assume QRS duration < 130 ms, with use considered on optimal medical therapy (GDMT) for HF and considered separate from ICD indication. Despite FDA approval, the text states postapproval clinical experience remains very limited at most centers. CRT is described as effective for systolic HF with prolonged QRS duration (≥ 120 ms), yet many patients have a QRS duration < 120 ms and do not meet criteria for CRT. CCM is described as nonexcitatory, high-voltage, biphasic electrical pulses delivered to the RV septum during the absolute refractory period; despite the high voltage, these pulses do not initiate contraction because they are delivered 30 to 40 ms after local myocardial activation, and studies suggest CCM may enhance contraction via changes in calcium flux or gene expression.

### Cardio-microcurrent device treatment for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: results from the C-MIC II open-label randomized controlled trial [^111rGare]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

An additional limitation is that patients with implanted cardiac devices — such as ICDs, CRTs, pacemakers, and cardiac contractility modulation systems — were excluded from this study (with the exception of ICDs with single‐coil leads) due to the potential for electrical interaction with the continuous direct microcurrent delivered by the C‐MIC system. As a result, the findings may not be generalizable to the broader heart failure population with such devices, and further testing is needed to confirm safety and compatibility.

The study population consisted of patients with a relatively short history of heart failure (1–5 years), which may have contributed to the favourable treatment response. Patients in earlier stages of disease may retain greater myocardial adaptability, allowing for more pronounced restorative effects. As such, these findings may not fully extend to patients with longer standing or more advanced heart failure, underscoring the need for further studies in broader populations.

Additionally, the trial was not powered to determine if the C‐MIC device would reduce morbidity and mortality events. However, data from recent ambulatory registry cohorts have shown improvements in LVEF in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction patients are associated with better outcomes, which support the rationale for larger, event‐driven studies in the future. Furthermore long‐term data to confirm durability of the C‐MIC device are currently lacking. A 2‐year follow‐up study is currently underway (NCT05189860).

Another limitation is the absence of core laboratory analysis for CPET data which may have introduced variability in data acquisition and interpretation across sites. Data on exercise capacity at the anaerobic threshold were missing in approximately one‐third of patients, further limiting the robustness of conclusions drawn from this parameter. Dedicated studies on CPET are better suited for such outcomes than larger‐scale clinical trial focusing on general outcomes.

Finally, the trial was conducted exclusively at sites in Eastern Europe. While this may raise questions about the broader applicability of the findings, current evidence does not clearly demonstrate significant differences in heart failure phenotypes or treatment responses between Eastern and Western European populations. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that geographic, genetic, and healthcare system‐related factors may influence outcomes. Further studies involving more diverse populations are therefore needed to confirm the generalizability of these results.

### Device interaction between cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) and subcutaneous defibrillator (S-ICD) [^113fxdHA]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Combined implantation of cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) with subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD) appears a suitable option to reduce the amount of intracardiac leads and complications for patients. Here we report on a patient with ischemic cardiomyopathy carrying an S-ICD in which a CCM device was implanted. During crosstalk testing post-CCM implantation, the S-ICD misannotated QRS complexes and T waves. The problem was solved through reprogramming the CCM, while preserving S-ICD functionality and improving heart failure symptoms. In conclusion, S-ICD combined with CCM seems to be a good and safe option for patients when device interference is being ruled out.

### The subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in review [^112z5gyh]. American Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

The subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD) is a completely extrathoracic device that has recently been FDA approved for the prevention of sudden cardiac death in select populations. Although the transvenous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (TV-ICD) has a proven mortality benefit in multiple patient populations, there are significant risks both with implantation and years after its placement. The S-ICD may help prevent some of these complications. Currently, the S-ICD is typically implanted in patients with prior device infection or at an increased risk for an infection, younger patients with difficult venous access related to either hemodialysis or difficult cardiac anatomy, patients who live active lifestyles, and those who may outlive the TV-ICD leads. There is an absolute contraindication for S-ICD implantations for patients who need pacing either for ventricular tachycardia or bradycardia because this device cannot perform these functions. To date, there are no randomized controlled trial (RCT) data evaluating the safety and efficacy of this relatively new device. Observational studies of both the S-ICD alone and in comparison with the TV-ICD have showed promising results, including a decrease in lead-related and periprocedural complications as well as a high level of effectiveness at terminating ventricular arrhythmias. These analyses over time may have contributed to the evolution and comfortability with the S-ICD system, as physicians are more often referring for and/or implanting this device for patients with appropriate indications. Furthermore, inappropriate shock rates with the S-ICD have decreased over time especially with dual zone programming. This review summarizes the results of a multitude of observational studies with respect to patient selection for the S-ICD, complication rates, appropriate and inappropriate shock rates, and programming. This review also tackles current ongoing randomized trials. Although the results of ongoing trials will be helpful, there is still a continued need to evaluate the efficacy of the S-ICD in broader patient populations including patients with several comorbidities and older patients so that more patients can be considered for this potentially lifesaving device.

### An entirely subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator [^113SWoMj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Excellent credibility.

Background

Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) prevent sudden death from cardiac causes in selected patients but require the use of transvenous lead systems. To eliminate the need for venous access, we designed and tested an entirely subcutaneous ICD system.

Methods

First, we conducted two short-term clinical trials to identify a suitable device configuration and assess energy requirements. We evaluated four subcutaneous ICD configurations in 78 patients who were candidates for ICD implantation and subsequently tested the best configuration in 49 additional patients to determine the subcutaneous defibrillation threshold in comparison with that of the standard transvenous ICD. Then we evaluated the long-term use of subcutaneous ICDs in a pilot study, involving 6 patients, which was followed by a trial involving 55 patients.

Results

The best device configuration consisted of a parasternal electrode and a left lateral thoracic pulse generator. This configuration was as effective as a transvenous ICD for terminating induced ventricular fibrillation, albeit with a significantly higher mean (± SD) energy requirement (36.6 ± 19.8 J vs. 11.1 ± 8.5 J). Among patients who received a permanent subcutaneous ICD, ventricular fibrillation was successfully detected in 100% of 137 induced episodes. Induced ventricular fibrillation was converted twice in 58 of 59 patients (98%) with the delivery of 65-J shocks in two consecutive tests. Clinically significant adverse events included two pocket infections and four lead revisions. After a mean of 10 ± 1 months, the device had successfully detected and treated all 12 episodes of spontaneous, sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia.

Conclusions

In small, nonrandomized studies, an entirely subcutaneous ICD consistently detected and converted ventricular fibrillation induced during electrophysiological testing. The device also successfully detected and treated all 12 episodes of spontaneous, sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia. (ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT00399217 and NCT00853645.)

Results

Study enrolment and baseline characteristics

From January 2020 to November 2022, TP was applied in 822 out of 1170 procedures conducted across the 4 study centers (Fig. 1). One center limited TP usage to procedures deemed high-risk (PADIT score > 6), so that 348 procedures without TP were not recruited. After observing infections in two low-risk patients who did not receive TP, this center transitioned to using TP for all subsequent patients. Our study was specifically designed to assess procedures utilizing TP exclusively, aiming to estimate the infection rate in our standard of care. Furthermore, implementing a clear algorithm (i.e. TP for all patients) ensured adherence to procedural steps, thus minimizing omissions. Patient, procedure, and device characteristics for procedures with complete 12-month follow-up are detailed in Table 1. Figure S1 illustrates the distribution of risk factors for CIED infection within our cohort. Complete data for the entire follow-up duration and for the 3-month follow-up are provided in Tables S1 and S2 in the online appendix.

### Electromagnetic interference from left ventricular assist devices in patients with subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillators [^1156AVCP]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Interactions of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) with transvenous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator systems (ICDs) have been widely reported. However, less is known regarding the impact of electromagnetic interference (EMI) from LVADs on subcutaneous ICD function.

Methods and Results

A comprehensive literature search was performed on PubMed, Cochrane central registry, and Google Scholar using the search terms "subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and left ventricular assist devices", "electromagnetic interference, LVAD, and subcutaneous ICD", "EMI and S-ICD", and "inappropriate shocks, LVAD, and ICD". Demographic and programming data were extracted from the reports and authors as needed. A total of seven cases of EMI in LVAD patients with subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD) devices were found. In addition three previously unreported cases from our center were included. All cases involved either a heartware ventricular assist device or HeartMate III LVAD with a pre-existing S-ICD. In all patients, both the primary and secondary vectors had inappropriate sensing due to EMI. Three patients were reprogramed to the alternate vector with appropriate sensing. The S-ICD was either inactivated or replaced with a transvenous device in six patients. A single patient was left sensing in the alternate vector. There were no reports of inability to interrogate S-ICD systems in patients with LVADs.

Conclusion

The risk of inappropriate shocks from LVADs should be considered in pre-existing patients with S-ICD, particularly when the heartware ventricular assist device or HeartMate III LVAD device is present. Reprogramming of the sensing vector can occasionally avoid this issue but often the S-ICD needs to be inactivated.

2 METHODS

2.1 Patients

Twenty patients with symptomatic HF and reduced LVEF (≤ 35%) received CCM implantation in our tertiary university HF center between March 2009 and May 2016. Patients were required to be on stable guideline‐directed medical therapy for HF, including a β‐blocker, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor and/or angiotensin receptor blocker, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. This study was approved by the local ethics committee.

Each of these 20 patients also received an S‐ICD. In 14 cases, the S‐ICD was implanted as the first ICD device, with CCM implanted during follow‐up. In 6 cases, a formerly implanted transvenous ICD was replaced by the S‐ICD system. After implantation of CCM, patients were followed per standard clinical practice at 3‐ to 4‐month intervals. At each follow‐up visit, clinical assessments were obtained, including NYHA class, quality of life (MLWHFQ), 12‐vector electrocardiogram recordings, and NT‐proBNP levels. In addition, transthoracic echocardiograms were performed every 6 months. Frequency of procedural complications or revisions, programming changes, and incidence of appropriate or inadequate device detections as well as clinical data and therapies were recorded.

2.2 CCM device description and implantation procedure

In 14 patients, the Optimizer IVs system (Impulse Dynamics Inc. Orangeburg, NJ) was implanted. Six patients received the prior model, the Optimizer III. The implantation procedure has been described in detail. 2 Briefly, the Optimizer device is implanted into the pectoral region in a minimally invasive procedure utilizing 3 bipolar pacemaker leads that are introduced into the right side of the heart via the subclavian vein (Tendril STS; St. Jude Medical/Abbott, St. Paul, MN). One of these leads is placed into the right atrium to detect the electrical activity as part of the algorithm for timing CCM delivery. CCM signal delivery occurs through the remaining 2 leads, positioned at the ventricular septum, after electrical activity is sensed in those leads. Active CCM treatment is typically programmed for 5 or 7 segments of 1 hour spread equally throughout the day.

For subcutaneous ICD, "Program therapies off (1)" or "No intervention required; have magnet available (1)", and "A subcutaneous ICD does not currently provide pacing". Magnet handling notes include, "A magnet, if used, should be secured with adhesive tape", and for subcutaneous ICD a confirmation tone indicates correct placement; "If the tone is not audible, reprogramming is necessary".

Appropriate use criteria for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), cardiac contractility modulation, leadless pacing, and conduction system pacing — developed by the American College of Cardiology with specialty and subspecialty societies — cover 335 clinical scenarios across ICD indications and device indications related to CRT, conduction system pacing, leadless pacing, cardiac contractility modulation, and ICD therapy in the setting of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). Indications were scored by a separate independent rating panel on a scale of 1 to 9 with categories "Appropriate" (median 7 to 9), "May Be Appropriate" (median 4 to 6), and "Rarely Appropriate" (median 1 to 3), and final ratings reflect the median score of the 17 rating panel members. In general, Appropriate designations were assigned when clinical trial evidence and/or clinical experience supported device implantation; May Be Appropriate applied when evidence was limited or implantation seemed reasonable for extenuating or practical reasons; and Rarely Appropriate applied when data showed harm or no data were available and device therapy was deemed illadvised, with comorbidities such as reduced life expectancy related to noncardiac conditions or severe cognitive decline potentially precluding device implantation or influencing device choice.

### Device-device interaction between cardiac implantable electronic devices and continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices [^112YXqQu]. Heart Rhythm (2023). Medium credibility.

The current design of an innovative left ventricular assist device (LVAD) makes use of magnetic levitation technology, which enables the rotors of the device to be completely suspended by magnetic force, reducing friction and blood or plasma damage. However, this electromagnetic field can result in electromagnetic interference (EMI), which can interfere with proper functioning of another cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) in its direct proximity. Approximately 80% of patients with an LVAD have a CIED, most frequently an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Several device-device interactions have been reported, including EMI-induced inappropriate shocks, inability to establish telemetry connection, EMI-induced premature battery depletion, undersensing by the device, and other CIED malfunctions. Unfortunately, additional procedures, including generator exchange, lead adjustment, and system extraction, are frequently required because of these interactions. In some circumstances, the additional procedure might be preventable or avoidable with appropriate solutions. In this article, we describe how EMI from the LVAD impacts the functionality of the CIED and provide possible management options, including manufacturer-specific information, for the current CIEDs (eg, transvenous and leadless pacemakers, transvenous and subcutaneous ICDs, and transvenous cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemakers and ICDs).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Patient population

Baseline characteristics of the 20 CCM patients are given in Table 2. Mean age at CCM implant was 54.3 ± 11.5 years, and mean baseline LVEF was 24.4% ± 8.1%. Thirty‐five percent of patients had ischemic cardiomyopathy.

Table 2
Characteristics of the study population before CCM implantation

In the course of their treatment all 20 patients received an S‐ICD (Figure, A). In 14 patients, the S‐ICD was the first implanted ICD device. Thirteen of these 14 patients had a primary preventive ICD indication because LVEF was ≤ 35% for ≥ 3 months of optimal medical treatment. One of these 14 patients had a secondary preventive ICD indication because he had a history of life‐threatening sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias in addition to LVEF ≤ 35%. These 14 patients received their S‐ICDs before CCM implantation.

Subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD) detection and discrimination — Candidates for the S-ICD must initially be screened with a modified 12-lead surface electrocardiogram; if the screening is not satisfactory for at least one of the three vectors in the supine and standing, an S-ICD should not be implanted. Detection of VT or VF by the S-ICD is programmable using a single or dual zone; in the single zone configuration, shocks are delivered for detected heart rates above the programmed rate threshold: the 'shock zone', and in the dual-zone configuration, arrhythmia discrimination algorithms are active from the lower rate: the 'conditional shock zone'. If rhythms are classified as supraventricular arrhythmias or non-arrhythmic oversensing, therapy is withheld. The conditional shock zone uses morphology analysis with a QRS–T wave template that uses up to 41 fiduciary points to reconstruct morphology for the template as well as the programmed targeted heart rate zones.

### Long-term results of combined cardiac contractility modulation and subcutaneous defibrillator therapy in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction [^114ySWSN]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) is an electrical-device therapy for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35% also have indication for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and in some cases subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD) is selected.

Hypothesis

CCM and S-ICD can be combined to work efficaciously and safely.

Methods

We report on 20 patients with HFrEF and LVEF ≤ 35% who received CCM and S-ICD. To exclude device interference, patients received intraoperative crosstalk testing, S-ICD testing, and bicycle exercise testing while CCM was activated. Clinical and QOL measures before CCM activation and at last follow-up were analyzed. S-ICD performance was evaluated while both CCM and S-ICD were active.

Results

Mean follow-up was 34.3months. NYHA class improved from 2.9 ± 0.4 to 2.1 ± 0.7 (P < 0.0001), Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire score improved from 50.2 ± 23.7 to 29.6 ± 22.8 points (P < 0.0001), and LVEF improved from 24.4% ± 8.1% to 30.9% ± 9.6% (P = 0.002). Mean follow-up time with both devices active was 22months. Three patients experienced a total of 6 episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia, all successfully treated with first ICD shock. One case received an inappropriate shock unrelated to the concomitant CCM. One patient received an LVAD, so CCM and S-ICD were discontinued.

Conclusions

CCM and S-ICD can be successfully combined in patients with HFrEF. S-ICD and CCM remain efficacious when used together, with no interference affecting their function.

2.3 S‐ICD device description, implantation procedure, and device testing

The S‐ICD system (Emblem; Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) and its implantation procedure have been described in detail. 2, 17, 18 The lead is positioned parallel to the sternum (normally 1 to 2 cm to the left) and the pulse generator is positioned in the left axillary region at the level of the sixth rib. The 2 sensing electrodes of the subcutaneous lead and the IPG itself represent 3 vector projections of electrical conduction through the heart. The S‐ICD automatically selects an optimal vector for adequate rhythm sensing and to avoid T‐wave oversensing or double QRS counting. A conditional shock zone incorporating a feature‐extraction technique can be programmed between rates of 170 and 250 bpm. S‐ICD therapy within conditional shock zone and shock zone consists of an 80‐J shock, with the potential for temporary transthoracic backup pacing for 30 seconds.

At the end of each S‐ICD implantation procedure, device testing is performed. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is induced by a high‐voltage 50‐Hz signal. During S‐ICD testing, VF is terminated by a 65‐J shock to ensure a margin of safety.

Every patient implanted with an S‐ICD receives routine bicycle ergometer testing 1 to 7 days postoperatively. Subsequently, different provocation maneuvers are performed, which have been described previously. 17 The 3 sensing vectors of the S‐ICD are monitored in real time during these tests to exclude oversensing or double counting that occurs during exercise or sinus tachycardia. In case of an unclear signal, oversensing, or double counting during exercise or provocation maneuvers, the automatically selected sensing vector can be changed manually to select the clearest signal. Characteristics of a clear signal are a stable baseline, high signal amplitude, and a high QRS/T ratio.

2.4 Combining CCM and S‐ICD

Three tests were performed upon insertion of the second device (either CCM or S‐ICD) to exclude device interactions (Table 1).

Leadless PM use with subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (S-ICDs) — Leadless PMs are not absolutely contraindicated with S-ICDs, but potential interactions include challenges with sensing, including increased risks of T-wave oversensing with intermittent pacing due to changes in QRS complexes and R-R ratio; therefore, careful attention to S-ICD sensing is needed to avoid oversensing and undersensing of ventricular fibrillation (VF). For those with LVEF ≥ 50% and anticipated pacing burden < 40%, use is Appropriate and May Be Appropriate in those with worse LV function. Early data from the MODULAR ATP trial showed effective wireless communication between the leadless PM and S-ICD exceeding prespecified performance goals during implant and 6-month follow-up.

### Current status of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator [^1126BfCR]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Clinical trials have established the superiority of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) over antiarrhythmic drug therapy in survivors of sudden cardiac death and in high-risk patients with coronary artery disease. The ICD has evolved to overcome the limitation of earlier devices that required thoracotomy for implantation and were fraught with inappropriate shock delivery. Current ICDs are implanted in a similar manner to cardiac pacemakers and incorporate sophisticated rhythm-discrimination algorithms to prevent inappropriate therapy. Managing the patient with an ICD requires an understanding of the multiprogrammable features of modern devices. Drug interactions and potential sources of electromagnetic interference may adversely affect ICD function. Driving restrictions may be necessary under certain conditions. The cost-effectiveness of ICD therapy appears favorable, given the marked survival benefit seen in randomized trials relative to antiarrhythmic drug treatment. The growing number of ICD recipients necessitates an understanding of the specialized features of the modern ICD and the role of device therapy in clinical practice.

### Process mapping strategies to prevent subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator infections [^116BSUw8]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The subcutaneous implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator (S‐ICD) offers a beneficial choice for ICD‐indicated patients, providing safety and efficacy comparable to transvenous (TV)‐ICDs without the risks inherent to vascular leads. AHA/ACC/HRS guidelines published in 2017 include a Class I recommendation for S‐ICD use in patients who are at high risk for infection, and in whom pacing for bradycardia or ventricular tachycardia termination or as part of cardiac resynchronization therapy is neither needed nor anticipated. While the use of the S‐ICD reduces the risk of life‐threatening complications, such as bloodstream infection and infective endocarditis due to the lack of vascular exposure, infections still occur. The size, location, and additional incisions and surgical tunneling required for implantation of the S‐ICD harbor an increased risk for infection, which, while generally nonsystemic and safer to extract compared to TV lead infections, still require additional medical care with an increased financial burden.

Current practices for the treatment of S‐ICD infections tend to follow recommendations for TV‐ICD infections, which stipulate complete device and lead extraction once the infection is confirmed, yet there has been no clinical data published to guide best practices specifically for the prevention and management of S‐ICD infection. The unique S‐ICD implantation technique and its nonvascular location present a different risk potential for both the development and treatment of infection. As the number of S‐ICD implantations increases to involve more patients and close to 100 000 S‐ICD implanted, it is important to establish best practices for both S‐ICD implantation as well as postimplant patient management to minimize the risk of device infection to assure optimal device efficacy and patient safety.

### Cardiac contractility modulation in the treatment of heart failure: initial results and unanswered questions [^111mMyQY]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Despite advances in our understanding of the pathology of heart failure modern conventional pharmacological therapies have proved insufficient. The application of electrical impulses during the refractory period of the cardiac contractile cycle, so-called cardiac contractility modulation (CCM), presents a new therapeutic approach with promising results demonstrated in clinical trials to date. The mechanism by which CCM exerts its effects remains inconclusive with conflicting reports. This article provides a concise review of the experimental and clinical CCM studies conducted to date with particular focus on areas of controversy and unexplored avenues of interest with this novel electrical therapy.

### Reappraisal on pharmacological and mechanical treatments of heart failure [^112Q8uHW]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In the past half-century, significant progress has been made in the prevention, diagnosis, and management of cardiovascular diseases. Cardiovascular mortality in developed countries has been reduced by 2/3. The mortality of people with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), valvular, and congenital heart disease, arrhythmia and hypertension has been significantly reduced, with the exception of heart failure (HF). HF is a clinical syndrome that mainly manifests as pulmonary congestion and vena cava congestion, resulting from abnormal cardiac structure and/or function. HF is not an independent disease, but a terminal stage in the development of heart disease. Many diseases can cause HF. In addition to cardiomyopathy and valvular heart disease, cardiogenic diseases also include endocardial or pericardial abnormalities and heart rate (HR) or rhythm disorders. The 2016 guidelines update the classification of HF according to ejection fraction values, including HF with preserved (HFpEF), mid-range (HFmrEF) and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). HF has become a global health burden and affects an estimated 26 million individuals worldwide with a prevalence of approximately 1–2%. The lifetime risk of developing HF is approximately one in five for a 40-year-old in Europe and North America. A total of 74% of HF patients have at least one complication, and such patients are more likely to develop further deterioration of the disease, leading to high hospitalization for HF (HHF) rates and mortality. There is no controversy that HF is currently becoming a preventable and curable disorder based on evidence-based findings. However, the prognosis of advanced HF is worse than that of partial solid tumours and myocardial infarction (MI). There is growing appreciation that the choice of therapy creates exciting new opportunities to improve overall and personalized care, to the individual patient. This review about the reappraisal on pharmacological and mechanical treatments of HF tries to give a compact overview of novel and/or vital trials (Fig. 1) to contribute to a more comprehensive knowledge of this disease.

Within the last decade, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) systems with non-transvenous leads were developed in order to minimize complications related to the cardiovascular position of transvenous ICD leads. This national expert consensus gives an overview of potential indications for the implantation of non-transvenous ICD systems, and provides specific recommendations for implantation, follow-up, and complication management in patients with subcutaneous ICD. Regarding particular issues like the necessity for shock efficacy testing, or the clinical outcome as compared to transvenous ICD, randomized data are expected in the near future.

### The implantable cardioverter defibrillator [^114PmK37]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) have evolved from the treatment of last resort to the gold standard therapy for patients at high risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmias. High-risk patients include those who have survived life-threatening arrhythmias, and individuals with cardiac diseases who are at risk for such arrhythmias, but are symptomless. Use of an ICD will affect the patient's quality of life. Some drugs can substantially affect defibrillator function and efficacy, and possible drug-device interactions should be considered. Patients with ICDs may encounter cell phones, antitheft detectors, and many other sources of potential electromagnetic Interference. In addition to treating ventricular tachyarrhythmias, new defibrillators provide full featured dual chamber pacing, and could treat atrial arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure by means of biventricular pacing.

### A novel screening tool to unmask potential interference between S-ICD and left ventricular assist device [^1145jPyD]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In patients with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), the subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD) can be an alternative to transvenous ICD systems due to reduced risk of systemic infection, which could lead to extraction of the ICD as well as the LVAD. S-ICD eligibility is lower in patients with LVAD than in patients with end-stage heart failure without LVAD. Several reports have shown inappropriate S-ICD therapy in the coexistence of LVAD and S-ICD. The aim of the present study was to evaluate S-ICD eligibility in patients with LVAD using the established electrocardiogram (ECG)-based screening test as well as a novel device-based screening test to identify potentially inappropriate S-ICD sensing in this specific patient cohort.

Methods and Results

The present study included 115 patients implanted with an LVAD. The standard ECG-based screening test and a novel device-based screening test were performed in all patients. Eighty patients (70%) were eligible for S-ICD therapy with the standard ECG-based screening test. Performance of the novel device-based screening test identified device-device interference in 14 of these 80 patients (12%).

Conclusion

Using a novel extended device-based S-ICD screening method, a small number of patients with LVAD deemed eligible for S-ICD with the standard ECG-based screening test exhibit device-device interference. Careful S-ICD screening should be performed in patients with LVAD, who are candidates for S-ICD therapy, to prevent inappropriate sensing or ICD therapy.

### In vivo study of electromagnetic interference with cardiac contractility modulation devices at power frequency [^114NDENC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The study design was approved by the Ethics Committee at the Rhenish‐Westphalian Technical University of Aachen Faculty of Medicine (Identifier NCT01626261). Inclusion/exclusion criteria and the detailed study design were described elsewhere.

Fifteen patients were included (10 Optimizer III and 5 Optimizer IV s, Impulse Dynamics; 10 male/5 female; 9 ischemic cardiomyopathy/6 dilated cardiomyopathy; mean ejection fraction, 29.6 ± 6.3%, all initial New York Heart Assocation Class III). All gave written informed consent.

No device defects or software resets were seen because of EMF exposure. All implanted electricals remained unchanged after the test. Eight CCMs showed interference in the tested field range at nominal sensitivity, while all 15 devices could be disturbed at maximum programmed sensitivity. All observed sensing failures were related to constructive or destructive superposition of intracardiac signals and EMFs (Figure [C and D]). In the 8 patients with EMI when programmed to nominal sensitivity 14 interferences were detected at different field strengths (RA: 5x noise, 1x short AV; RV: 3x PVC, 1x noise, 1x oversensing; LS: 3x inhibit). At maximum sensitivity all CCMs were disturbed with 56 registered artifacts (RA: 16x noise, 11x short‐AV, 6x long‐AV; RV: 10x PVC, 3x noise, 2x oversensing; LS: 4x inhibit, 4x alert) (Figure [E]). Lowest interference thresholds (nominal and maximum sensitivity depicted by "/") were determined at 18/2.4 kVm −1 in single electric fields, 0.57 mT/0.1 mT in single magnetic fields, and 9 kVm −1 +1.02 mT/1.8 kVm −1 +0.13 mT in combined EMFs. Regarding the 2 device generations (Optimizer III and IV s) no differences in EMF sensing could be observed. In vitro benchmark tests confirm this result as both devices have nearly the same interference threshold in the tested frequency range (Figure [F]). With respect to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers standard C95.1‐2019 only 2 patients programmed to nominal sensitivity values showed interference within the exposure range for general public (Figure [G]). When CCMs were programmed to maximum sensitivity 13 patients exhibited EMI in the exposure range for general public (Figure [H]). Thus, our data indicate little interferences for CCMs programmed to nominal sensitivity with daily life EMFs. However, when CCMs were programmed to maximum sensitivity and/or exposed to strong EMF — as it may occur in an occupational environment — inappropriate sensing was frequently detected.

ICD system selection and subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD) detection zones: It is reasonable to choose single-chamber ICD therapy in preference to dual-chamber ICD therapy if the sole reason for the atrial lead is SVT discrimination, unless a known SVT exists that may enter the VT treatment zone, to reduce both lead-related complications and the cost of ICD therapy. For the S-ICD, it is reasonable to programme 2 tachycardia detection zones: 1 zone with tachycardia discrimination algorithms from a rate of ≥ 200 bpm and a second zone without tachycardia discrimination algorithms from a rate of ≥ 230 bpm, to reduce avoidable shocks.

### Cardiac implantable electronic devices in pediatric and congenital populations [^1154iHCi]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Pediatric patients and children and adults with congenital heart disease often will require implantation of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) for management of a variety of cardiac rhythm pathologies. The safe and effective use of CIEDs in these patients requires an awareness of important differences between this special population and the adult populations for whom these devices were primarily developed and in whom they have been most thoroughly studied. These include issues of body size and growth, anticipated lifespan, anatomical issues related to implantation and the epidemiology of underlying rhythm issues. In this paper, we discuss these issues in the context of the current state of the art in pediatric and congenital heart disease patients with respect to implant and lead extraction strategies, physiological cardiac pacing and resynchronization, ICD indications and use of transvenous and subcutaneous devices, and the use of implantable monitoring devices.

Subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD) with LVAD support — use, risks, and peri-implant management: S-ICD "can be used as an alternative to transvenous implantable defibrillators in patients who do not require pacing and are at risk for intravascular infections", but in LVAD patients concomitant use "raises concerns for electromagnetic interference that can lead to problems with sensing and increase the risk of inappropriate shocks". Data are limited; "In a recent multicenter study of 20 patients with LVADs and S-ICDs in the United States, the concomitant use of these devices was reported to be feasible, and only one S-ICD had to be disabled due to difficulties with sensing". Reports describe "undersensing or oversensing by the S-ICD due to electromagnetic interference from the LVAD resulting in inappropriate shocks". S-ICDs "need to be reprogrammed after LVAD implantation to identify the most effective vector", and "we are unable to make a recommendation for or against the use of S-ICDs in patients with LVADs". For those with a preexisting S-ICD, "we recommend that the device be turned off during the LVAD implant surgery and following the implant the S-ICD should be reprogrammed", and "it may be reasonable to disable and/or explant the S-ICD to avoid inappropriate shocks". Replacement with a transvenous ICD "would depend on prior history of spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias and individual infectious risk".

### Development of an entirely subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator [^111hSTiX]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The recent advent of an entirely subcutaneous implantable defibrillator (ICD) has provided a relevant contribution to the debate concerning the use of ICD therapy in patients at high risk for death. Although conventional transvenous ICDs have proven very effective during the past 23 years, they still appear to be limited by nontrivial acute and long-term complications. This study delineates some of the historical and current issues characterizing the advent of the subcutaneous ICD system in daily clinical practice. Subcutaneous ICDs have proven effective in more than 1100 patients worldwide and appear to be competitive with transvenous ICD in all clinical conditions not requiring antibradycardia, antitachycardia, or cardiac resynchronization pacing.

### Quality and safety in health care, part XLIV: cardiac resynchronization therapy and subcutaneous defibrillator implantable devices [^113SWm6f]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

This article discusses 2 specialized implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) devices. A special type of implantable device is available for cardiac resynchronization therapy, which can also have a defibrillator, in which case it is called a CRT-D device. In patients who meet guidelines for eligibility, a CRT-D will diminish the number of significant cardiac events including death. A subcutaneous ICD device does not need any leads placed in the vascular system and therefore does not have some of the complications that may be seen with transvenous ICDs. Also, there are patients who are not candidates for a typical ICD implantation. On the other hand, there are important disadvantages to the subcutaneous ICD.

### In vivo study of electromagnetic interference with cardiac contractility modulation devices at power frequency [^115Gjaje]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

While under nominal sensitivity settings EMI only led to (inadequate) therapy withhold, under maximum sensitivity settings additionally oversensing in the LS alert window was seen 4x. LS‐alert episodes may initiate inappropriate therapy delivery; although high energy pulse train delivery in the vulnerable phase of the heart cycle is unlikely but cannot be excluded; thus, indicating that in most cases EMIs in CCM devices do not pose a significant patient risk but may lead to therapy withhold and subsequent impaired effectiveness of the intended heart failure therapy.

If devices have to be programmed to higher sensitivity (eg, because of low‐amplitude intracardiac signals), EMI has to be considered. For power lines or certain electrical machines (eg, hair dryers), EMF emissions were reported with a maximum field strength of 7.5 kVm −1 at the groundand 2 mT at the surface, respectively. Those field strengths lie above the interference threshold of the tested CCM devices even with nominal sensitivity resulting in device malfunctioning. To reduce the risk of EMI with CCM, optimization to a maximal intraoperative electrical signal amplitude is crucial, thus, allowing programming to higher sensitivity values. In addition, a previous study with 160 pacemakers and patients with implantable cardioverter‐defibrillators suggested that a more horizontal orientation of the lead tip and a lead tip position near the center of the body may reduce EMI. Moreover, implementation of memories for noise episodes or dedicated error memories would help to estimate the influence of EMI on the functioning of CCMs and optimize therapy delivery.

### Long-term results of combined cardiac contractility modulation and subcutaneous defibrillator therapy in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction [^113SGiEs]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

S‐ICD and CCM can be successfully combined to work efficaciously and safely in HFrEF patients who do not require cardiac pacing. A careful intraprocedural crosstalk test and postoperative exercise testing with both devices activated is recommended to identify and abate any functional interactions between the 2 devices.

With the long‐term follow‐up, it can be concluded that S‐ICD therapy and CCM therapy can be safely used together, thereby decreasing risk by reducing the number of intracardiac leads implanted. A future device that combines CCM and ICD functions is desirable.

### Rationale and design of the PRAETORIAN trial: a prospective, RAndomizEd comparison of subcuTaneOus and tRansvenous implANtable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy [^116zksd4]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are widely used to prevent fatal outcomes associated with life-threatening arrhythmic episodes in a variety of cardiac diseases. These ICDs rely on transvenous leads for cardiac sensing and defibrillation. A new entirely subcutaneous ICD overcomes problems associated with transvenous leads. However, the role of the subcutaneous ICD as an adjunctive or primary therapy in patients at risk for sudden cardiac death is unclear.

Study Design

The PRAETORIAN trial is an investigator-initiated, randomized, controlled, multicenter, prospective 2-arm trial that outlines the advantages and disadvantages of the subcutaneous ICD. Patients with a class I or IIa indication for ICD therapy without an indication for bradypacing or tachypacing are included. A total of 700 patients are randomized to either the subcutaneous or transvenous ICD (1:1). The study is powered to claim noninferiority of the subcutaneous ICD with respect to the composite primary endpoint of inappropriate shocks and ICD-related complications. After noninferiority is established, statistical analysis is done for potential superiority. Secondary endpoint comparisons of shock efficacy and patient mortality are also made.

Conclusion

The PRAETORIAN trial is a randomized trial that aims to gain scientific evidence for the use of the subcutaneous ICD compared with the transvenous ICD in a population of patients with conventional ICD with respect to major ICD-related adverse events. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with trial ID NCT01296022.

3.2 Operation results

S‐ICD and CCM implantations were successfully performed in all patients.

At the time of implantation of the second device (either CCM or S‐ICD), intraoperative crosstalk testing was performed. No patient had double counting due to a concomitant CCM. In 9 patients, ≥ 1 of the 3 S‐ICD vectors showed "noise‐free" ventricular sensing during active CCM therapy. In 11 patients, "noise" was recognized in all 3 S‐ICD sensing vectors when CCM was activated. Nevertheless, during the S‐ICD testing with CCM activated, the CCM signal delivery stopped immediately during ventricular tachycardia (VT)/VF, and the S‐ICD properly recognized the arrhythmia with no undersensing or undue delay (Figure, B, C). In all cases VF was terminated by the first ICD shock and within an adequate time window (time to shocks, 12 to 20 seconds).

During the ergometric testing with activated CCM therapy, none of the 20 patients showed double counting or T‐wave oversensing. Therefore, both devices could be activated appropriately in all 20 patients.

Other than postimplantation and postergometry configuration, no reprogramming of the S‐ICD device was required. Later follow‐up processes were routinely done as with any other ICD and/or CCM device cases.

3.3 Complications

One patient had postoperative wound‐healing delay of the S‐ICD pocket that required a prolonged hospital stay. One patient suffered from thrombosis of the subclavian vein after implantation of CCM, requiring oral anticoagulation for 3 months.

With regard to long‐term complications, 3 patients required lead‐revision procedures of CCM ventricular leads at a mean follow‐up of 30 months. One patient with a body mass index of 40 kg/m 2 and a history of recurrent skin infections had a skin abscess on the thoracic wall that affected the tip of the subcutaneous lead, requiring temporary removal of the subcutaneous ICD at 22 months. The device was successfully re‐implanted 3 months later.

### Potential interference of spinal cord and sacral stimulators with cardiac implantable electronic devices: a systematic review [^114M6g8w]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) are neuromodulation therapies increasingly used for treatment-resistant chronic pain and urinary or fecal incontinence. Despite their benefits, concerns remain regarding their potential interference with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), including permanent pacemakers (PPMs) and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), potentially leading to inappropriate pacing or shocks. This systematic review aimed to assess documented interactions between these devices to guide clinical decision-making and enhance patient safety. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science was conducted for studies published up to November 2024. Eligible studies included adult patients with both SCS or SNS and CIEDs. Due to methodological heterogeneity, findings were summarized descriptively, and meta-analysis was not performed. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools. A total of 30 studies involving 119 participants were included. Among 107 patients with SCS, two instances of interference (1.86%) were reported: one with unipolar and one with bipolar configurations. In both cases, the interference was successfully managed through adjustments of stimulation parameters. No interference or adverse cardiac events were reported in 12 patients with concurrent SNS and CIEDs. The risk of interactions between SCS/SNS and ICDs/PPMs appears to be low and manageable with appropriate device programming and monitoring. Nevertheless, the absence of standardized monitoring protocols and methodological heterogeneity limits the generalizability of findings. Future research should focus on developing standardized protocols for assessing device compatibility to ensure safe integration of neuromodulation and cardiac therapies. Clinical trial number Not applicable.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator supportive evidence and procedural considerations — The device was designed to avoid the need for venous access and complications of transvenous leads (pneumothorax, hemothorax, and cardiac tamponade), and difficulties in achieving venous access can prolong implantation and occasionally result in failed ICD implantation, particularly in patients with limited venous access such as those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In a study of 27 patients with ESRD, the subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was not associated with an increased risk of procedural complications or inappropriate shocks, and the risk of infection appears to be lower with subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillators than with transvenous ICDs. These recommendations supplant, but do not nullify, the need for waiting periods and other requirements to be satisfied for ICD/CRT implantation specified elsewhere in the document.

### Long-term results of combined cardiac contractility modulation and subcutaneous defibrillator therapy in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction [^113qVj9T]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) is an electric device therapy that applies a nonactivating electrical impulse to the cardiac muscle during the absolute refractory period. 1 Indications for CCM include patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and normal or slightly prolonged QRS duration, thus filling a therapeutic gap among the two‐thirds of patients with heart failure (HF) who do not meet criteria for cardiac resynchronization therapy. 2, 3

Two prospective, randomized, multicenter studies have demonstrated significant improvements of New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, quality of life indexed by Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLWHFQ), and peak oxygen uptake during cardiopulmonary exercise testing in patients with symptomatic HF with reduced LVEF (HFrEF). 4, 5, 6 Although current data show improvements in symptoms and functional cardiopulmonary capacity, data on cardiovascular outcome are limited. Randomized controlled trials were not powered to detect statistically significant changes of cardiovascular mortality. 4, 5 A recent meta‐analysis of published data found that CCM did not lower the risk of severe cardiovascular adverse events 7; nevertheless, retrospective observations suggest that mortality rates in patients treated with CCM, especially in those with normal QRS and with moderate disease stage, were lower than estimated by the Meta‐analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure (MAGGIC) model, by the Seattle Heart Failure Model (SHFM) model risk scores, or by a control group. 8, 9, 10 Recently, in the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines on Acute and Chronic Heart Failure (2016), it was stated that CCM may be considered in selected patients with HF. 3

Cardiac Contractility Modulator

The cardiac contractility modulator (CCM) is an implantable therapeutic device capable of improving myocardial contractility and cardiac function while reversing cardiac remodeling in HF patients. The only clinically used type is the Optimizer Smart System (Impulse Dynamics) with Food and Drug Administration approval from the United States, which includes a pulse generator that can be recharged and 2 right ventricular active fixation electrodes. By subcutaneous implantation of the extracorporeal programmer and charger device in the chest, the wire is inserted into the right ventricular septum. The basis of this therapy originated from studies in the 1970s that demonstrated that stimulation during the absolute refractory period can stimulate subsequent contractility. After years of clinical trials to identify its clinical effectiveness and safety, CCM and the theory that it can lower hospital admission rates and enhance exercise tolerance, New York Heart Association functional class and quality of life during follow-up for up to 2 years have been demonstrated in patients with HFrEF. – A breakdown of the FIX-HF-5 (Safety and Efficacy Assessment of Optimizer Systems in Subjects with Heart Failure) results per subgroup, the largest clinical trial on CCM to date, found no significant clinical benefit from CCM use in patients with EF < 25%, despite the absence of harm, compared with a greater effect in EF > 35% to 45%, which may suggest the potential feasibility of its use in patients with HFpEF to improve prognosis. Plus, there is a newly published pilot study that includes 47 patients with preserved ejection fraction, showing it is a promising therapy for the apparent improvement in health status with no influence on safety. Currently, a cohort study is being conducted to assess the safety and effectiveness of CCM with HFpEF. and is expected to be completed in December 2023 (NCT03240237), offering more support for the clinical application of CCM in HFpEF patients.

### State-of-the-art consensus on non-transvenous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy [^111LQsNM]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Within the last decade, implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator (ICD) systems with non‐transvenous leads were developed in order to minimize complications related to the cardiovascular position of transvenous ICD leads. This national expert consensus gives an overview of potential indications for the implantation of non‐transvenous ICD systems, and provides specific recommendations for implantation, follow‐up, and complication management in patients with subcutaneous ICD. Regarding particular issues like the necessity for shock efficacy testing, or the clinical outcome as compared to transvenous ICD, randomized data are expected in the near future.

### Long-term results of combined cardiac contractility modulation and subcutaneous defibrillator therapy in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction [^112WtfyQ]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) is an electrical‐device therapy for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35% also have indication for an implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator (ICD), and in some cases subcutaneous ICD (S‐ICD) is selected.

Hypothesis

CCM and S‐ICD can be combined to work efficaciously and safely.

Methods

We report on 20 patients with HFrEF and LVEF ≤ 35% who received CCM and S‐ICD. To exclude device interference, patients received intraoperative crosstalk testing, S‐ICD testing, and bicycle exercise testing while CCM was activated. Clinical and QOL measures before CCM activation and at last follow‐up were analyzed. S‐ICD performance was evaluated while both CCM and S‐ICD were active.

Results

Mean follow‐up was 34.3 months. NYHA class improved from 2.9 ± 0.4 to 2.1 ± 0.7 (P < 0.0001), Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire score improved from 50.2 ± 23.7 to 29.6 ± 22.8 points (P < 0.0001), and LVEF improved from 24.4% ± 8.1% to 30.9% ± 9.6% (P = 0.002). Mean follow‐up time with both devices active was 22 months. Three patients experienced a total of 6 episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia, all successfully treated with first ICD shock. One case received an inappropriate shock unrelated to the concomitant CCM. One patient received an LVAD, so CCM and S‐ICD were discontinued.

Conclusions

CCM and S‐ICD can be successfully combined in patients with HFrEF. S‐ICD and CCM remain efficacious when used together, with no interference affecting their function.

### Subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator: first single-center experience with other cardiac implantable electronic devices [^116uwQXJ]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD) is an implantable device for antiarrhythmic therapy with no intravascular leads.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to describe the technical feasibility of combining the S-ICD with other cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), including pacemakers with transvenous or epicardial electrodes. We also provide the first experience of combining an S-ICD with catheter-based therapies, including cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) and vagus nerve stimulation.

Methods

Between July 2011 and November 2014, 6 patients received a CCM device and S-ICD, 3 patients with a single-chamber pacemaker using either transvenous or epicardial pacing electrodes received and S-ICD, and 1 patient with an implanted S-ICD received vagus nerve stimulation. In all patients, intraoperative S-ICD testing, crosstalk tests, and postoperative ergometric testing were performed.

Results

In all 10 patients, device implantations were successfully performed without complications. S-ICD therapy was shown to be technically feasible with concomitant CIED. Mean follow-up was nearly 17 months. S-ICD testing and crosstalk testing before and during exercise enabled device programming across a broad range of test conditions and was associated with no subsequent evidence of adverse device interaction. None of the devices required permanent inactivation or removal, and no patient received an inappropriate shock.

Conclusion

In suitable patients, combining an S-ICD with CCM or pacemaker may provide an acceptable means to reduce the number of transvascular leads. S-ICD appeared safe with CCM over an intermediate follow-up period. Additional prospective randomized controlled trials examining S-ICD in conjunction with CIEDs are warranted.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — rationale for subcutaneous systems notes that the subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was designed to avoid venous access and complications of transvenous leads, including pneumothorax, hemothorax, and cardiac tamponade.

Section 6 — Subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD) assumptions state that it is assumed that all patients considered for S-ICD implantation already meet standard indications for ICD implantation, and that because currently available technology does not include standard bradycardia backup pacing or cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), it is assumed that patients considered for S-ICD implantation do not have bradycardia or CRT pacing indications.

Regarding specific circumstances for perioperative cardiac risk management for noncardiac surgery, more specifically with respect to patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices, ACC/ACS/AHA/ASNC/HRS/SCA/SCCT/SCMR/SVM 2024 guidelines recommend to consider reprogramming the device or using a magnet to temporarily disable tachytherapies in patients with subcutaneous ICDs undergoing noncardiac or nonthoracic surgery with anticipated electromagnetic interference above the groin.

3.4 Follow‐up

During a median follow‐up of 21 months (13‐29), two (2%) patients required device explantation because of inappropriate shocks (n = 1) or unsuccessful defibrillation (n = 1). Neither local or systemic device‐related infection nor migration of pulse generator was observed. Ten patients (9.9%) received a total of 31 appropriate and successful shock for ventricular arrhythmias (VA; range, 1‐11; Figure 1). Of the 10 patients who received appropriate shocks, two patients did not undergo DT postimplantation due to the physician's indication. Three (2.9%) patients experienced five inappropriate shocks (range, 1‐3). One patient had dilated cardiomyopathy and experienced inappropriate shocks for oversensing of cardiac signal (SVT). The problem was solved with catheter ablation and increasing the threshold of conditioned intervention from 200 to 220 beats per minute (bpm; Figure 2). The second patient had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and experienced inappropriate shock for oversensing of noncardiac signal (artifacts) due to postural change (while bending the chest downward; Figure 3). The patient's history of shock led us to change the sensing vector from alternative to secondary. Finally, the third patient, who had a history of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), had inappropriate shocks due to a combination of cardiac and noncardiac signals (noise and TWOS). At the follow‐up the patient underwent device explantation and opted for transvenous ICD. No electromagnetic interferences were observed. No patient had the device removed because of a perceived need for antitachycardia pacing (ATP). Two (2%) patients experienced pocket hematoma that did not require surgical revision. Six patients (6%) died during follow‐up (four patients died because of refractory heart failure, one patient died due to systemic infection, and one patient experienced sudden death), and two patients received a heart transplantation (one patient received a paracorporeal LV assistance device as bridge to the heart transplantation, see Figure 4).

### Long-term results of combined cardiac contractility modulation and subcutaneous defibrillator therapy in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction [^114EM1ka]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Because many patients receiving CCM have an LVEF ≤ 35%, an implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator (ICD) is also indicated. In most of these cases, a separate implantation procedure is performed using intracardiac defibrillation leads and a separate implantable pulse generator, as no device currently combines CCM and ICD capabilities into a single device. As a result, CCM has been extensively studied in combination with intracardiac ICDs, revealing little interference between devices. However, the need for 2 devices, both with intracardiac leads, poses the risk of additional adverse events because the cumulative risk of electrode complications, such as systemic infections or thrombosis of central venous lines, increases with the number of implanted intracardiac leads. 11

The subcutaneous implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator (S‐ICD) was developed as an alternative to the transvenous ICD without the need to implant transvenous leads. 12, 13 Its safety and effectiveness have been established, 14, 15 and the therapy has been included in current guidelines for the management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death. 15, 16

In this present study, we analyzed the long‐term clinical outcome of patients in whom both CCM and S‐ICD were implanted.

### Anaesthesia and cardiac contractility modulation [^111KpsRs]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2007). Low credibility.

Chronic heart failure is known to be an important risk factor for adverse perioperative outcome in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. A promising new form of electric therapy is currently being used in a phase III trial in patients with severe chronic heart failure (cardiac contractility modulation). Cardiac contractility modulation is a non-pharmacological approach to improve Ca2+ effect on cardiac myofilaments using electric currents. The cardiac contractility modulation system used at present (OPTIMIZER III, Impulse Dynamics, Orangeburg, NY, USA) consists of a subcutaneously implanted pulse generator and three electrodes. As far as we know, cardiac contractility modulation therapy is a safe and feasible way of improving the systolic function of the heart in congestive heart failure patients. No pro-arrhythmic effects of this new therapy have been reported. The technique shows promise as an additive treatment for severe chronic heart failure. The perioperative and intraoperative management of patients should follow current cardiac pacemaker/implantable cardioverter defibrillator guidelines.

### Successful defibrillation verification in subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator recipients by low-energy shocks [^115Miooj]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

The subcutaneous implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator (S‐ICD) is an effective alternative to the transvenous one. Defibrillation efficacy depends on maximum device output and on the optimal device location at device implantation.

Hypothesis

We sought to investigate the defibrillation safety margin in real life clinical practice.

Methods

We sought to understand what is the efficacy of induced ventricular fibrillation (VF) termination at S‐ICD implantation using lower energies than the recommended 65 J.

Results

Sixty‐four consecutive S‐ICD recipients underwent VF termination attempts at implantation with energies ranging from 20 to 50 J. Overall, VF termination occurred in 84% of patients with ≤ 40 J, in 88% with 45 J, and in 100% with 60 J. Intermuscular S‐ICD placement was associated with 94% VF termination at ≤ 40 J. An ejection fraction < 35% was associated to higher energy requirement for defibrillation; however, an intermuscular S‐ICD placement conferred 90% defibrillation efficacy at 31 ± 5 J in this patients subset.

Conclusions

This is a hypothesis‐generating observation that prompts a methodologically correct investigation to prove that a 60 J output S‐ICD can provide an adequate safety margin to terminate VF in clinical practice. This would enable superior device longevity and/or device downsizing for pediatric/small size patients.

### Emerging implantable-device technology for patients at the intersection of electrophysiology and heart failure interdisciplinary care [^114mYUJx]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiac implantable electronic devices, including implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and therapy, are part of guideline-indicated treatment for a subset of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Current technological advancements in cardiac implantable electronic devices have allowed the detection of specific physiological parameters that are used to forecast clinical decompensation through algorithmic, multiparameter remote monitoring. Other recent emerging technologies, including cardiac contractility modulation and baroreflex activation therapy, may provide symptomatic or physiological benefits in patients without indications for cardiac resynchronization. Our goal in this state-of-the-art review is to describe the new commercially available technologies, their purported mechanisms of action, and the evidence surrounding their clinical roles, limitations and future directions. Finally, we underline the need for standardized workflow and close interdisciplinary management of this population to ensure the delivery of high-quality care.

### Long-term results of combined cardiac contractility modulation and subcutaneous defibrillator therapy in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction [^1164b3XX]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

In this study, we present the first long‐term results of combined CCM and S‐ICD devices. Using our established algorithm, the chances for detrimental crosstalk between CCM and S‐ICD can be minimized, allowing both devices to function properly and safely. All device implantations were successfully performed, even in those 6 patients who had suffered complications with prior transvenous ICDs. Postprocedural and long‐term complications were successfully handled. This group of patients showed significant improvements in HF symptoms and LVEF. S‐ICD shock delivery was effective during device testing. In 3 patients, 6 ventricular arrhythmias that occurred during follow‐up were terminated properly. No patient died of arrhythmia or of unknown reasons during a mean follow‐up of 22 months of combined therapy.

A major requirement for successfully combining CCM and S‐ICD is the absence of significant bradycardia requiring cardiac pacing (neither of the 2 devices has a pacing function). Furthermore, the S‐ICD has no antitachycardia pacing functions. Patients with HFrEF requiring ventricular pacing or patients with a wide QRS complex should receive cardiac resynchronization therapy. 3

The new‐generation Optimizer, the Optimizer Smart, includes an algorithm that does not require the implantation of an atrial lead (keeping the 2 ventricular leads only), thereby further simplifying the implantation procedure. The new mode also allows the delivery of CCM therapy in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation, which was considered a contraindication for the prior‐generation Optimizer device. 21 In a recent study, it was demonstrated that efficacy and safety of CCM were similar when the signal was delivered through either 1 or 2 ventricular leads. 22 These results support the potential future use of a single ventricular lead for delivery of CCM, further reducing device implantation–associated risk.

4.1 Study limitations

This study presents experience with the combination of CCM and S‐ICD in a small cohort of patients from a single site. It presents limited data on clinical outcome in a nonrandomized, noncontrolled manner. Further multicenter studies are needed to evaluate the long‐term impact of combining these 2 technologies in support of patients with HFrEF and LVEF ≤ 35%, who comprise a large segment of the chronic HF population.

### In vivo study of electromagnetic interference with cardiac contractility modulation devices at power frequency [^115p92hX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) has been Food and Drug Administration‐approved since March 2019 as a non‐excitatory stimulation therapy for symptomatic heart failure. CCM delivers high‐energy pulse trains via 1 or 2 ventricular septal leads (right ventricle [RV]/right ventricular local sense lead [LS]) in the absolute refractory period of the heart cycle leading to, i.a. increased calcium flux into cardiomyocytes. Therefore, appropriate sensing of intrinsic heart signals via right atrium (RA)/RV/LS lead for proper timing is of crucial importance to ensure safe and effective functioning as high energy pulse delivery in the vulnerable phase can cause arrhythmia.

In vivo studies from our group have shown that pacemakersand implantable cardioverter‐defibrillatorsare susceptible to electric and magnetic fields (EMF). Thus, electromagnetic interference (EMI) with cardiac electronic devices may pose risk to patients even under daily life EMF exposure at frequencies of 50Hz/60Hz, the worldwide power grid frequency. Still, hitherto nothing is known about EMI with CCM devices.

### First use of cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) in a patient failing CRT therapy: clinical and technical aspects of combined therapies [^1134gZLM]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2007). Low credibility.

Cardiac contractility modulating (CCM) signals delivered by the OPTIMIZER System are being investigated as a treatment for medically refractory heart failure. Previous chronic studies of CCM have excluded patients with prolonged QRS and a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device. However, symptoms persist in more than 25% of these CRT patients. CCM may offer a therapeutic option for these non-responders. Here we report the first use of CCM signals in a patient who did not respond to treatment with a CRT-D device. We show that the implantation is technically feasible, that the OPTIMIZER and CRT-D devices can coexist without interference and that acute haemodynamic and clinical improvements can be observed. The results suggest that systematic investigation of CCM treatment in CRT non-responders is warranted.

New technology — leadless pacemakers and subcutaneous ICD describes research focused on improving lead design and developing devices that do not require intravascular leads, resulting in the introduction of leadless pacemaker systems and the subcutaneous ICD. Two single-component leadless pacemakers implanted in humans are the Nanostim (Abbott) and the Micra Transcatheter Pacing System (TPS) (Medtronic); both devices are reportedly retrievable, but available data are very limited. An entirely subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD) prevents the inherent problems related to transvenous leads and consists of a pulse generator implanted in a left mid-axillary position connected to an entirely subcutaneous lead with a shocking coil electrode positioned in a parasternal position.

We therefore initiated a clinical in vivo provocation study and systematically exposed patients with CCMs (Figure [A and B]) to 50Hz‐EMF with strengths up to 30 kVm −1 and 2.55 mT considering worst‐case conditions (eg, whole‐body exposure, maximal inspiration). The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. We determined the interference thresholds, ie, the lowest field strength at which interference could be observed. Tests were performed with maximum and nominal sensitivity.

ICD programming and management in LVAD patients — The document notes that given relatively good tolerability of VT/VF post-LVAD, many cardiologists program ICDs to minimize shocks and maximize antitachycardia pacing; recommendations have been made to set the VF zone with high-rate cutoff (240–250 beats/min) with the longest programmable detection time available on the device; for the VT zone, multiple runs of ATP should be programmed because they can prevent or significantly delay ICD shock delivery; subcutaneous ICDs (S-ICDs) can also be considered in patients with LVADs because of potentially less risk of infection, although interference may create interrogation difficulties and no ATP is available with currently approved technology; and ICD inactivation may be considered at a patient's request if frequent shocks cannot be controlled by reprogramming or antiarrhythmic therapies.

ICD management in patients with DMCS — For primary prevention, Class IIa guidance states that in patients with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and no prior history of ventricular arrhythmias, it is reasonable to defer implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement if for primary prevention (Level of Evidence B [Modified]). For patients with LVAD and ICD, routine ICD management is appropriate, with interrogation every 3 months with re-programming as needed (Level of Evidence C [New]); routine generator change should be considered only if ICD is in place for secondary prevention (Level of Evidence C [New]). ICD programming in patients with LVAD should be conservative with the goal of maximizing anti-tachycardia pacing and minimizing shocks (Level of Evidence B [New]). In those with a subcutaneous ICD prior to LVAD implant, the device must be reprogrammed post LVAD implant to allow appropriate sensing and avoid inappropriate shocks (Level of Evidence C [New]). Inactivation of ICD should be considered in LVAD patients with frequent shocks if they are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic with sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) (Level of Evidence C [New]). For secondary prevention after LVAD implant, current generation subcutaneous ICDs are not recommended given concerns for electromagnetic interference and risk of inappropriate shocks (Class III; Level of Evidence C [New]). The guideline also lists Class I and Class IIa items as continuing approval without change.

### Defibrillation efficacy comparing a subcutaneous array electrode versus an "active can" implantable cardioverter defibrillator and a subcutaneous array electrode in addition to an "active can" implantable cardioverter defibrillator: results from active can versus array trials I and II [^113s5mJN]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2001). Low credibility.

Introduction

Placement of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) has been simplified by using the shell of a pectorally implanted ICD as a defibrillation electrode in combination with an endocardial right ventricular defibrillation lead. However, a sufficiently low defibrillation threshold (DFT) cannot be obtained in a few patients. Therefore, alternative approaches were systematically tested in the Active Can versus Array Trial (ACAT).

Methods and Results

In the first of two prospective randomized studies, the DFT of a subcutaneous left dorsolateral array anode introduced from a pectoral incision was compared to that of a standard active can anode in 68 patients. Intraoperatively, the DFT was determined twice in each patient using either the active can or, in patients with a subcutaneous array lead, once with all three fingers and once omitting the middle finger of the array. The second prospective randomized study included 40 patients. DFT also was determined twice in each patient using an active can in a left pectoral position as anode alone and combined with a left dorsolateral array electrode with two fingers. In ACAT I, stored energy at DFT decreased from 13.1 ± 7.7 J (active can) to 9.6 ± 6.1 J (three-finger array lead) (P = 0.04), impedance decreased from 53 ± 8 ohms to 40 ± 6 ohms (P < 0.0001). Omitting the middle finger of the array lead, stored energy at DFT increased by 0.9 J (P = 0.47) and impedance by 2 ohm (P < 0.0001). In ACAT II, DFT and impedance using an active can device were significantly lower when a two-finger array lead was added that decreased stored energy at DFT from 10.1 ± 5.2 J to 6.9 ± 3.9 J (P = 0.001) and impedance from 56 ± 5 1 to 42 ± 5 l (P < 0.0001).

Conclusion

In combination with a right ventricular defibrillation electrode, a left pectoral subcutaneous array lead improves defibrillation efficacy if used instead of, or in addition to, a left pectoral active can ICD device. Implantation of the array lead can be simplified by using two instead of three fingers, without a significant loss of defibrillation efficacy.

4 DISCUSSION

The major new finding from this study is that combination of CCM with S‐ICD in patients with an indication for both is feasible and that it was safe and successful in this study cohort during long‐term follow‐up. The benefit of CCM therapy, as demonstrated by improvements of NYHA class, quality‐of‐life scores, and echocardiographic parameters, seems consistent with prior publications in larger populations. 5, 8, 19

Recent retrospective single‐center observational studies have suggested prolonged survival of HF patients treated with CCM therapy. 8, 9, 10 In most of these studies, patients receiving CCM therapy had LVEF ≤ 35%; therefore, they also had ICD devices with intracardiac leads in place. To date there is no device combining CCM with ICD functions; thus, multiple intracardiac leads are required (for the CCM and for the ICD), raising the risk of lead‐ and implantation‐related adverse events. Although CCM has been studied with patients receiving intravenous ICD in multiple studies, 4, 5, 6, 8 and its safety, functionality, and efficacy were demonstrated, it is clearly also desired to have a future combined device to address this population with an integrated solution. The recent introduction of S‐ICD eliminates the need for intracardiac leads to deliver defibrillation shocks, and thus reduces the risk of lead‐related events.

Prior studies have reported successful combination of the S‐ICD with transvenous pacemakers 14 in patients with need for pacing after implantation of an S‐ICD. Recently, Tjong et al. reported that combined leadless pacing and S‐ICD therapy appeared feasible in animal experiments and in 1 human subject. 20 In a recent case series, we demonstrated that the S‐ICD can be combined with a variety of cardiac implantable electronic devices that require intracardiac or epicardial leads, including CCM, and that the devices can be programmed and tested to achieve efficacy and avoid interference when used in the same patient. 17 This testing includes postprocedural ergometry and provocative maneuvers with the concomitant device active, while monitoring sensing vectors in real time. This enables observation of interference or malfunction that might appear only during exercise or tachycardia.

3.6 Survival

For this patient population at the time of CCM implantation, the MAGGIC score estimated mean 1‐year and 3‐year death rates of 13.2% and 30.2%, respectively. The SHFM score predicted mean 1‐year, 2‐year, and 5‐year death rates of 5.1%, 10.1%, and 24.6%, respectively, for this same group of subjects. At the time of last follow‐up, 19 of the 20 patients were alive. No patient died while being treated with CCM. One 54‐year‐old female patient had received a left ventricular assist device after 14 months of follow‐up due to progressive HF; thus, CCM and S‐ICD were switched off. That patient died subsequently of postoperative complications.
