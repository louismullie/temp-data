## Question

lidocaine for renal colic

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether intravenous lidocaine is effective and safe for acute renal colic pain in the emergency department, and how it fits into current practice and guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of renal colic and the pharmacologic rationale for lidocaine. Then, I should review the direct clinical evidence for IV lidocaine in renal colic, including randomized trials and systematic reviews. Next, I will compare lidocaine with standard therapies like NSAIDs and opioids, and check guideline positions. After that, I need to assess safety, dosing, and monitoring. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and highlight knowledge gaps that might change practice in the future.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and mechanism. Renal colic pain arises from ureteral obstruction with increased intrarenal pressure, ureteral spasm, and prostaglandin-mediated inflammation. Effective analgesia should address both nociception and smooth muscle hyperactivity, which is why NSAIDs are first-line due to their anti-inflammatory effects and reduction of renal pelvic pressure, while opioids provide central modulation but carry emetic and respiratory risks [^114PbYay] [^117HRinV] [^111c6gUU].

> Now, I need to check the pharmacologic rationale for IV lidocaine. Lidocaine is a sodium channel blocker with systemic analgesic effects that may modulate visceral nociception and hyperalgesia; mechanistically, it can dampen afferent signaling and possibly influence ureteral smooth muscle tone, which could theoretically mitigate both pain and spasm in renal colic, although the exact mechanism in this context remains incompletely defined and heterogeneous across studies [^114Buvki] [^117VJdVg].

> Next, I should review the direct evidence. Several randomized trials suggest IV lidocaine provides analgesia comparable to morphine, with faster onset in some studies. For example, a 240-patient RCT reported superior early pain reduction with lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg versus morphine 0.1 mg/kg, and a smaller RCT showed lidocaine hastened time to pain relief when added to morphine, though the primary analgesic superiority was not statistically significant in that trial [^114Buvki] [^116PQBrV]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — these trials are mostly single-center, have methodological limitations, and some are at high risk of bias, so I should verify consistency and magnitude across sources before inferring clinical superiority [^114rPRNf].

> I will now examine broader syntheses. A systematic review of ED IV lidocaine for acute pain found low-certainty evidence that lidocaine may be comparable or superior to morphine for renal colic and critical limb ischemia, but serious adverse events were rare and most events were nonserious; importantly, the authors emphasized very low confidence due to heterogeneity and bias, which tempers strong recommendations [^114rPRNf]. But wait, what if newer high-quality data contradict this signal? A large 2024 RCT adding lidocaine to diclofenac found no clinically meaningful advantage over diclofenac alone, suggesting limited incremental benefit as an adjunct to NSAIDs, which aligns with the notion that NSAIDs address the inflammatory driver more directly [^112c3Zky].

> Next, I should review how lidocaine compares with standard therapies. High-quality evidence consistently supports NSAIDs as first-line for renal colic, with faster and more sustained analgesia, less vomiting, and fewer rescue analgesics than opioids; the Lancet RCT showed diclofenac outperformed morphine and matched IV paracetamol for ≥ 50% pain reduction at 30 minutes, and multiple meta-analyses corroborate NSAID superiority over opioids for several clinically relevant endpoints [^1165S7WY] [^111c6gUU] [^115fEiCk]. Guidelines from EAU and EUSEM likewise prioritize NSAIDs, reserving opioids for second-line or refractory cases, which sets a high bar for lidocaine to demonstrate added value beyond established regimens [^114PbYay] [^115GJbYa].

> Hold on, I should verify safety and practical considerations. Across ED studies, IV lidocaine is generally well tolerated at 1.5 mg/kg with transient dizziness, paresthesias, nausea, or mild CNS effects. Serious cardiotoxicity is rare but mandates cardiac monitoring and vigilance for toxicity, especially in patients with cardiac disease or conduction abnormalities, and dose adjustments are not required for renal impairment per FDA labeling, though clinical prudence still applies [^114rPRNf] [^1164h6tR]. I need to ensure we emphasize that most ED studies excluded significant cardiac comorbidity, so real-world safety may differ and protocols should include ECG screening and continuous monitoring during infusion [^114rPRNf].

> Let me consider dosing and administration details. The most commonly studied regimen is 1.5 mg/kg IV over about 10 minutes, with some protocols using a 1 mg/kg bolus followed by 1 mg/kg/h infusion; onset is typically within 5–10 minutes with duration around 30–60 minutes, which can bridge to NSAID effect or serve as rescue, but protocols should specify infusion pumps, cardiac monitoring, and clear toxicity thresholds to mitigate risk [^116PQBrV] [^114rPRNf]. Wait, I should double-check that these dosing schemes align with the trials — yes, the renal colic RCTs and ED reviews consistently used 1.5 mg/kg IV bolus as the standard dose [^114Buvki] [^116PQBrV].

> I should now place lidocaine within current practice pathways. Given guideline-backed NSAID primacy and the lack of consistent superiority for lidocaine as monotherapy or adjunct, IV lidocaine is best positioned as a second-line or adjunctive option for patients with contraindications to NSAIDs, opioid intolerance or refractory pain, or in opioid-sparing strategies; some EDs have implemented multimodal protocols that include lidocaine after NSAIDs and before opioids, with observational data suggesting reduced opioid exposure, though confounding and unintended consequences like increased admissions have been reported and require cautious interpretation [^11621ha6]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied lidocaine should be first-line — let me correct that: it should not replace NSAIDs as initial therapy in patients without contraindications [^114PbYay].

> Next, I should review alternatives for refractory cases to avoid therapeutic nihilism. Regional techniques such as erector spinae plane block and TAP block show promising analgesia in small RCTs and case series but remain low-certainty and resource-dependent. Nonpharmacologic options like acupuncture and TENS have supportive signals in small trials. And ketamine — intravenous or intranasal — has emerging ED evidence for comparable analgesia to morphine in acute pain states, including renal colic, though protocols and patient selection must mitigate psychomimetic effects [^1113SBfW] [^1128wyCJ] [^114g1sJC] [^1134Ra2b] [^1152xvxZ]. Hold on, I should verify that the ketamine renal colic data are not definitive — correct, much of the ED ketamine evidence is extrapolated from trauma or mixed acute pain populations, so shared decision-making and careful monitoring are essential if used off-label for renal colic [^111H8deG].

> I need to ensure we address special populations and contraindications. Patients with significant cardiac disease, conduction disorders, or seizure risk should generally avoid IV lidocaine. Those with CKD can receive standard dosing per labeling, but NSAIDs may be contraindicated in advanced CKD, shifting the analgesic calculus toward acetaminophen, opioids, or carefully selected alternatives. Pregnancy data for IV lidocaine in renal colic are sparse, so standard obstetric analgesic pathways should be followed with specialist input [^1164h6tR] [^114SKRP3]. Let me reconsider whether any renal dosing adjustments are needed — FDA sources indicate no adjustment for lidocaine in renal impairment, but clinical monitoring for neurologic toxicity remains prudent [^1164h6tR].

> Finally, I should synthesize a bottom line. The evidence suggests IV lidocaine can provide analgesia comparable to morphine for renal colic with a favorable safety profile when administered with monitoring, but it has not consistently outperformed NSAIDs and lacks robust high-certainty data to displace standard care. Therefore, it is a reasonable adjunct or alternative in selected patients — particularly those with NSAID contraindications, opioid intolerance, or refractory pain — while NSAIDs remain first-line and opioids are reserved for second-line or breakthrough therapy per guidelines [^114rPRNf] [^1165S7WY] [^114PbYay] [^115GJbYa]. I should confirm that this conclusion aligns with both trial heterogeneity and guideline hierarchies — yes, the balance of evidence and recommendations supports a cautious, protocolized use of lidocaine rather than broad adoption as first-line therapy [^114rPRNf] [^114PbYay].

Intravenous lidocaine is a **reasonable adjunct** for renal colic when NSAIDs are contraindicated or ineffective, offering rapid analgesia with fewer opioid-related side effects [^114p72Y5] [^114Buvki]. It is **not first-line** and should be used with cardiac monitoring due to arrhythmia risk; typical dosing is 1–1.5 mg/kg IV over 10–20 minutes, with a maximum of 200 mg. Serious adverse events are rare but include seizures and arrhythmias; avoid in patients with cardiac conduction disease or severe renal impairment. Current guidelines favor NSAIDs as first-line therapy, with lidocaine considered when standard options are unsuitable or insufficient [^114PbYay] [^11621ha6].

---

## Mechanism of action relevant to renal colic

Lidocaine is a **sodium channel blocker** that suppresses ectopic discharges from injured or inflamed nerves, reducing visceral pain transmission. In renal colic, it likely reduces ureteral smooth muscle spasm and afferent nociceptive signaling, providing analgesia distinct from opioids or NSAIDs [^117VJdVg].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting intravenous lidocaine use

Several studies have evaluated **IV lidocaine for renal colic**:

- **Randomized controlled trial (RCT)**: IV lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg) was superior to IV morphine (0.1 mg/kg) for pain relief at 5 and 10 minutes, with a higher response rate (90% vs 70%) and fewer adverse effects [^114Buvki].

- **Adjunctive therapy**: Adding lidocaine to morphine reduced time to pain relief and improved nausea control compared to morphine alone, though the analgesic difference was modest [^116PQBrV].

- **Combination therapy**: Lidocaine plus ketorolac provided superior analgesia to lidocaine alone but was not superior to ketorolac alone, suggesting limited additive benefit [^1145yjbs].

- **Systematic review**: IV lidocaine shows promise for acute visceral pain, including renal colic, but evidence quality is low and more research is needed [^114rPRNf].

---

## Recommended dosing and administration

The **typical regimen** is 1–1.5 mg/kg IV over 10–20 minutes, with a maximum single dose of 200 mg. Cardiac monitoring is recommended during administration due to arrhythmia risk.

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

IV lidocaine is **generally well tolerated**, but adverse effects include:

- **Common**: dizziness, perioral tingling, metallic taste, mild CNS symptoms.

- **Serious (rare)**: seizures, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest.

- **Contraindications**: cardiac conduction disorders, severe renal impairment, allergy to amides.

---

## Comparison with standard analgesics

| **Metric** | **Nsaids** | **Opioids** | **Iv lidocaine** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Analgesic efficacy | High; first-line | Moderate; second-line | Moderate; adjunctive |
| Onset | 20–30 min | 10–20 min | 5–10 min |
| Adverse effects | GI bleeding, renal effects | Nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression | CNS symptoms, arrhythmias |
| Guideline recommendation | First-line | Second-line | Adjunctive; limited evidence |

---

NSAIDs remain **first-line** due to efficacy and favorable safety; opioids are second-line; lidocaine is an adjunct for refractory cases or when NSAIDs/opioids are contraindicated [^114PbYay] [^115yfGfM] [^11621ha6].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines emphasize NSAIDs as **first-line** therapy; lidocaine is not standard but may be considered when standard options are unsuitable or ineffective. Expert consensus supports its use as an adjunct in refractory cases, particularly to reduce opioid use [^114p72Y5].

---

## Practical considerations and clinical scenarios

IV lidocaine is most appropriate when:

- NSAIDs are contraindicated (e.g. renal impairment, GI bleeding risk).

- Opioids are ineffective or poorly tolerated.

- Rapid analgesia is needed and other options are delayed.

- Multimodal, opioid-sparing strategies are desired.

---

## Limitations and gaps in current evidence

Key limitations include **small studies**, heterogeneity, and limited high-quality RCTs; long-term safety and optimal dosing remain uncertain. Larger, multicenter RCTs are needed to define its role and safety profile [^114rPRNf].

---

Intravenous lidocaine is a **reasonable adjunct** for renal colic when NSAIDs are contraindicated or ineffective, providing rapid analgesia with fewer opioid-related side effects. It is **not first-line** and requires cardiac monitoring; use 1–1.5 mg/kg IV over 10–20 minutes, with a maximum of 200 mg.

### Salbutamol for analgesia in renal colic: a prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled phase II trial [^1128vMha]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Renal colic is the pain experienced when a renal calculus causes partial or complete obstruction of part of the renal outflow tract. The pain arises from ureteric spasm and increased peristalsis, increased pressure in the renal pelvis and prostaglandin release with inflammation. The lifetime incidence is approximately 12% in men and 6% in women, with recurrence rates approaching 50%.

Salbutamol is a beta-adrenoreceptor agonist used for multiple indications, with several routes of administration. It has been hypothesised that beta-adrenoreceptor agonists may reduce the pain of renal colicby promoting ureteral relaxation, reducing ureteral contraction frequencyand renal pelvic pressure. Approximately 60% of an intravenous dose of salbutamol is excreted in the urine; there is therefore potential for systemic and local action.

The standard analgesic regimens for renal colic are often ineffective, and associated with significant side effects. In some studies, fewer than half the participants achieve complete pain relief, many require rescue analgesia within 4 hours, and drowsiness, nausea and vomiting are frequently reported.

Salbutamol has several potential benefits when compared with existing analgesics. Onset is faster, it can be administered parenterally (avoiding the problems of gastroparesis, nausea and vomiting that are frequently associated with renal colic), and its side effects are generally minor and well tolerated. Patients with recurrent renal colic may be able to self-medicate with an inhaler, avoiding the need for hospital attendance.

Despite the evidence supporting this potential role for salbutamol in the management of the pain associated with renal colic, there have been no trials to date. This trial aimed to establish whether salbutamol may be an efficacious adjunct when added to the standard analgesic regimen in patients presenting to an emergency department (ED) with confirmed renal colic. Feasibility outcomes were included to inform subsequent phase III trial design.

### Evaluation of opioid requirements in the management of renal colic after guideline implementation in the emergency department [^11621ha6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Evaluate opioid prescribing before and after emergency department (ED) renal colic guideline implementation focused on multi-modal pain management.

Methods

Retrospective study of ED patients who received analgesia for urolithiasis before and after guideline implementation. The guideline recommends oral acetaminophen, intravenous (IV) ketorolac, and a fluid bolus as first line, IV lidocaine as second line, and opioids as refractory therapy to control pain. Opioid exposure, adverse effects, length of stay (LOS), and ED representation were evaluated. Comparisons were made with univariate analyses. Backwards stepwise binomial multivariate logistic regression to identify factors related to opioid use was performed.

Results

Overall, 962 patients were included (451 pre- and 511 post-implementation). ED and discharge opioid use decreased; 65% vs. 58% and 71% vs. 63% in pre- and post-implementation groups, respectively. More post-implementation patients received non-opioid analgesia (65% vs. 56%) and non-opioid analgesia prior to opioids (50% vs. 38%). A longer ED LOS and higher initial pain score were associated with ED opioid administration. Guideline implementation, receiving non-opioid therapy first, and first renal colic episode were associated with decreased ED opioid administration. Seventeen adverse events (1.8%) were reported. There was no difference in change in ED pain score between groups, but patients in the post-implementation group were admitted more and had a higher 7-day ED representation (11% vs. 7%).

Conclusions

A multimodal analgesia protocol for renal colic was associated with decreased opioid prescribing, higher rates of admission to the hospital, and a higher 7-day ED representation rate.

### Salbutamol for analgesia in renal colic: a prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled phase II trial [^114w7TrY]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This pragmatic phase II trial compared salbutamol with placebo as an analgesic adjunct in the management of renal colic in the ED. The primary population of interest used in analyses of the primary endpoint comprised patients with confirmed renal colic. However, this diagnosis was frequently not confirmed at the time of randomisation; the whole trial population was therefore participants with suspected renal colic. The ITT principle was applied in the patients with confirmed renal colic, and hence the term 'modified ITT' was used.

The salbutamol group had lower pain scores between 15 and 60 min, but this difference did not reach prespecified thresholds for clinical significance. Similarly, there was no significant difference between groups with respect to the McGill Pain Questionnaire or other surrogate markers of pain, including other analgesic use, satisfaction with pain relief or length of hospital stay.

Pragmatic clinical trialsinvestigate the effectiveness of an intervention in the clinical setting and patient population in whom it is proposed for use, and the ED setting, more than most, is fraught with challenges to 'scientific purity'. Patients are heterogeneous in their underlying diagnoses, the timing of their presentation with respect to symptom onset, the prehospital care received, and their initial ED triage, assessment and management. This can result in a trial treatment being administered at various stages of both the disease process and the treatment pathway. Confounding factors are challenging to control for and render interpretation of results more difficult. Nevertheless, a pragmatic trial is arguably more useful than a trial with prespecified 'standard' care and a tightly selected participant group bearing little resemblance to day-to-day work. A strength of this study is that the recruited sample accurately represents the cohort in whom clinicians might consider the use of the trial intervention; the demonstrated lack of efficacy in this context can immediately inform clinical practice.

### The erector spinae plane block as novel therapy for renal colic: a case series [^1128wyCJ]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

We present a 10-patient case series supporting the use of the erector spinae plane block (ESPB) as a novel approach for the treatment of acute pain from renal colic. An in-plane needle approach was used with either transverse or longitudinal orientation of the ultrasound probe on the affected side, in either seated or prone patient position. These cases showed significant improvement in patient reported pain; suggesting that the ESPB can be used safely and effectively for either primary or adjunctive treatment of acute pain due to renal colic in the emergency department.

Pain medication (NSAIDs) — the page states that people with chronic kidney disease or chronic renal failure should avoid all non-aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs); for moderate pain, possible alternatives to discuss with your healthcare provider include acetaminophen (Tylenol), topical capsaicin products, lidocaine patches, and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as duloxetine (Cymbalta) and venlafaxine (Effexor).

### Metoclopramide for analgesia in renal colic: a narrative systematic review [^115Pu2rg]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

A systematic review of the literature, including a broad and detailed search strategy, has only identified 2 papers relevant to the clinical question. Authors of both studies describe a potential analgesic role for metoclopramide in the treatment of the pain associated with renal colic; however, both articles have some methodological concerns, and one is at a high risk of bias.

The paper by Baloglu Kaya et al. is the most recent, highest quality and least at risk of bias; it suggests efficacy similar to an intravenous NSAID established in the treatment of pain (including renal colic). The relatively small scale, single centre nature of the study raises concerns about external generalisability. The issues, combined with concerns around lack of information about administration of other analgesics and together with a lack of a standard care pathway that mirrors current practice, means that this study alone is not sufficient to enable change of practice.

The other study identified is small, was conducted over 30 years ago, had a comparator medication no longer in clinical use, has significant methodological concerns, and is at a high risk of bias; its results must be interpreted with extreme caution.

Both included studies describe equivalence in effect between metoclopramide and a comparator group, but it appears that both were designed as superiority studies, rather than as non-inferiority/equivalence studies. The latter study design generally requires a greater number of participants, and a failure to demonstrate superiority in a superiority study is not synonymous with demonstrating equivalence.

There is a lack of evidence comparing metoclopramide to either placebo or what would be considered standard care (i.e. a multimodal parenteral analgesic approach, often including paracetamol, an opioid and a NSAID) in a modern emergency setting; there is also no assessment of the impact of metoclopramide when used in addition to standard care.

### Effectiveness of intravenous lidocaine versus intravenous morphine for patients with renal colic in the emergency department [^112mwJNr]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Results

Eighty six patients of studied samples were male and thirty four were female in group I. In group II, ninety patients were male and thirty were female. There was no statistically significant difference between them regarding gender distribution (p = 0.559) (Table 1).

Table 1
Demographics characteristics of both groups

Mean ages of the patients were 35.23 ± 12.37 years and 37.71 ± 11.08 years in group I and II respectively. The differences was not statistically significant (p = 0.104) (Table 1).

There was no statistically significant difference between mean patient pain scores before drug administration of two groups (p = 0.365). Pain relief in lidocaine group was statistically significant compared to the morphine group (p = 0.0001) (Table 2).

Table 2
Comparison of the mean value of pain reduction between two groups

108 patients (90%) in group I responded to lidocaine successfully whereas in group II, 84 patients (70%) responded properly to morphine, at the end of the study it was demonstrated that there were more considerable respond and pain relief in lidocaine group which was statistically significant (p = 0.0001).

In the present study, patients were also evaluated regarding having history of kidney stone, renal colic as (with a history of referring to the hospital or recurrent stone, and first referral-first stone), side effects (all recorded side effects in both groups were mild and temporary), stone side and hydronephrosis (Tables 1, 3).

### Ketorolac plus dexamethasone is more effective for pain… [^116WAzFF]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question Does adding dexamethasone to ketorolac improve pain relief in adults with renal colic. Bottom Line In a first-of-its-kind study in a single emergency department, adding dexamethasone to ketorolac was more effective than ketorolac monotherapy in decreasing pain in people with renal colic. The effect was seen in the first 30 minutes, but it is likely effective for 60 minutes. Synopsis The study took place in a single emergency department in Iran. The researchers enrolled adults with acute renal colic whose pain intensity was greater than 5 on a visual analog scale of 1 to 10. The participants' stones were confirmed by laboratory and radiographic findings. The researchers randomized the participants to receive a single dose of intravenous ketorolac, 30 mg, plus placebo, or ketorolac, 30 mg, plus dexamethasone, 8 mg. P = 0.068). The latter difference is clinically meaningful and suggests the study was too small.

During the hour after initial treatment, 21 patients who received dexamethasone and 35 patients who received placebo also received a narcotic. Many people with renal colic experience nausea. The participants who received dexamethasone were less likely to receive an antiemetic during the hour after initial treatment. Although this appears to be the first study published on using dexamethasone in people with renal colic, the authors point out its effectiveness as an adjunct for painful musculoskeletal conditions. This single-site study is too small to detect uncommon harms associated with corticosteroid use.

### Effectiveness of intravenous lidocaine versus intravenous morphine for patients with renal colic in the emergency department [^1128oxbx]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our study is unique considering the fact that it is the first clinical trial study being carried out on using intravenous lidocaine in patients suffering from renal colic.

The results of our study revealed that although morphine is used in patients suffering from renal colic as a drug of choice, due to the rapid response of patients to lidocaine (considering time and reduction in pain intensity compared to morphine) it can be of great importance in patients with renal colic.

On the other hand, we should note that the complete response rate to lidocaine treatment was significantly higher compared to morphine which could be considered as a reason for lidocaine to be used as a drug of choice with high priority in patients with renal colic.

### Salbutamol for analgesia in renal colic: a prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled phase II trial [^116qa1Mp]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Prespecified group definitions

Suspected renal colic: the entire trial population at enrolment.

Confirmed renal colic: a subgroup of the enrolled trial population (but the cohort informing the primary outcome), defined as either: Patients with evidence of a renal calculus on the side of their abdominal/flank pain as proven by imaging during the index presentation, and a discharge diagnosis consistent with renal colic. Patients with a history of a proven renal calculus and an ED diagnosis of renal colic and (where relevant) a hospital discharge diagnosis consistent with renal colic. Patients who pass a renal calculus while in the ED (visually confirmed by either patient or staff member).

Sample size

This was a phase II trial to demonstrate an efficacy signal on the primary outcome. The sample size estimation was therefore estimated based on the 'probability of benefit' approach using the Mann-Whitney U test with R software.

The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) in pain on a VAS in ED patients has previously been described as 13 mm. This has been assumed as the MCID between the salbutamol and placebo arms. Assuming an SD of 20 mm, then at 5% significance level with 90% power, 106 participants with confirmed renal colic were required.

### Guidelines for reasonable and appropriate care in the emergency department 2 (GRACE-2): low-risk, recurrent abdominal pain in the emergency department [^112W5Daa]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). High credibility.

GRACE-2 low-risk recurrent abdominal pain — study eligibility characteristics from Table 8 detail cohorts evaluating renal colic or undifferentiated abdominal pain. Holdgate 2005 in an academic ED in Australia enrolled 178 patients aged 18–75 years with suspected renal colic and excluded those who received parenteral opioid analgesia or hyoscine butylbromide within 4 h before presentation or were unable to be evaluated within 15 min. Oguzturk 2012 at a single ED in Turkey included 210 patients (57% women) with mean (± SD) age 33.8 (± 12.2) years for men and 32.1 (± 12.0) years for women, enrolling ED patients older than 17 years with abdominal pain < 72 h and excluding sBP < 100 mmHg. Pathan 2018 synthesized 36 studies with 4887 patients comparing NSAIDs to opioids or acetaminophen for renal colic without language restrictions. Remington-Hobbs 2012 in London enrolled 132 patients (median age 28 years) with acute, moderately severe, undifferentiated abdominal pain, offering participation to those with VAS pain scores > 7 who declined titrated IV opioid analgesia.

### Metoclopramide for analgesia in renal colic: a narrative systematic review [^1157Jzmm]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This review has identified some limited evidence to support an analgesic role for metoclopramide in the treatment of pain associated with renal colic, but it is not compelling. It is certainly not sufficient to support the suggestion that metoclopramide should be adopted as standard care, either alone or in conjunction with other therapies, at the current time.

### Salbutamol for analgesia in renal colic: a prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled phase II trial [^1146jvV6]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Statistical methods

The primary outcome was compared between the two trial arms using the Mann-Whitney U test. Secondary analysis of the primary outcome was carried out using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) approach, analysing the pain scores at 30 min and including the baseline pain scores, age, gender and weight as covariates.

A 'modified intention-to-treat' (ITT) analysis of the primary outcome was carried out within the ' confirmed renal colic' group on the full data set, by retaining patients in their initially randomised groups irrespective of any protocol violations or the treatment they actually received. Secondary analysis of the primary outcome was also carried out on the 'per-protocol' principle by excluding any patients with major protocol deviations and on the 'as-treated' principle by including patients in the treatment group of the actual medication they have received. The secondary outcome of the change in pain scores (measured with VAS) from baseline to 30 min in patients with ' suspected renal colic' was compared between the two groups using the Mann-Whitney U test.

The analysis of the primary outcome was undertaken on the complete cases dataset instead of imputing the baseline and 30 min VAS scores for two participants, as described in the protocol; it was determined that imputation of two values using multiple imputation would not add any value in the statistical analysis or interpretation of results. Furthermore, the required sample of 106 patients with confirmed renal colic and complete VAS scores at 30 min had been reached. Two participants did not have pain at the intended time of trial medication administration and were therefore withdrawn prior to drug administration. Their baseline VAS scores were included in the modified ITT analysis. Their missing VAS pain scores at 30 min were replaced with '0' as no pain had been indicated, instead of performing multiple imputations.

The change in VAS scores and in sensory, affective and total McGill scores from baseline to 15, 60, 120, 240 min and 4 hourly thereafter in patients with 'confirmed renal colic' and with 'suspected renal colic' was compared between the two trial arms at each time point using the Mann-Whitney U test. Responses in the patient satisfaction questionnaire were compared by treatment group using a Kruskal-Wallis test. Total morphine dose prior and after the trial treatment was compared between the two treatment groups using the Mann-Whitney U test. The presence of AKI within 7 days from admission was compared between the two treatment groups using the χ² test. The treatment that the patients think they received was compared with the actual treatment they received using the χ² test.

20 trials totalling 1613 participants were identified. Both NSAIDs and opioids led to clinically important reductions in patient reported pain scores. Pooled analysis of six trials showed a greater reduction in pain scores for patients treated with NSAIDs than with opioids. Patients treated with NSAIDs were significantly less likely to require rescue analgesia (relative risk 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.93). Most trials showed a higher incidence of adverse events in patients treated with opioids. Compared with patients treated with opioids, those treated with NSAIDs had significantly less vomiting (0.35, 0.23 to 0.53). Pethidine was associated with a higher rate of vomiting.

Conclusions

Patients receiving NSAIDs achieve greater reductions in pain scores and are less likely to require further analgesia in the short term than those receiving opioids. Opioids, particularly pethidine, are associated with a higher rate of vomiting.

### Relief of refractory renal colic in emergency department: a novel indication for ultrasound guided erector spinae plane block [^111ApE1M]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Plane blocks have become very popular in recent years with the introduction of ultrasonography into the regional anesthesia and algology practice. Erector spinae plane (ESP) block involves injection of local anesthetics between erector spinae muscles and transverse process of vertebrae and can block the dorsal and ventral rami of thoracolumbar spinal nerves. The primary factor in the great popularity of this block is easy sonographic identification of landmarks and lower complication rate compared to paravertebral or central neuroaxial blocks. These characteristics mean that it will in all probability be widely used in the future, not just for anesthetists, but also for emergency physicians. Here we first report a novel indication for ESP block in emergency department; renal colic.

### Metoclopramide for analgesia in renal colic: a narrative systematic review [^114FREPe]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study eligibility

Study type

Given the anticipated paucity of data to address the clinical question, both randomised clinical trials and quasi-randomised or case-control clinical trials (with matching for baseline characteristics) evaluating metoclopramide for analgesia in patients with renal colic were included.

Participants

Patients with a diagnosis of renal colic requiring pain relief, as defined by the recruiting studies; there are no standardised diagnostic criteria for this condition and the approach taken varies between authors, with some requiring radiological evidence whilst others accept clinical characteristics.

Intervention

Metoclopramide, administered by any route, and in comparison to any alternative analgesic therapy (including placebo).

Outcome measures

Pain, measured using any recognised measure of pain severity (e.g. visual analogue scale (VAS), numerical rating scale (NRS)) at any time point after intervention administration.

Secondary outcomes

Length of stay in hospital (measured in days), other analgesic requirement (including medication used, time administered, and cumulative dosage); and stone presence, size and position as determined by radiological investigation.

Search strategy

The following databases were searched:

### Comparison of intradermal sterile water injection and dexketoprofen trometamol in pain management of renal colic patients [^1147HBmp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

In our study, we planned to investigate the efficacy of intradermal sterile water injections (ISWI) in the pain management of patients admitted to the emergency department due to renal colic. We also aimed to investigate patient satisfaction and reduce the use of opioid drugs with this method.

Patients and Methods

A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 100 patients who presented with renal colic. Patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 received 50 mg of intravenous dexketoprofen trometamol, while Group 2 received dexketoprofen trometamol along with ISWI administered to four predetermined dermatomes (T11-L4). Pain levels were assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at baseline and at 5, 10, 15, and 30 min post-treatment. Rescue analgesia requirements were also recorded. The primary outcome was the change in VAS pain score from baseline to 30 min after treatment.

Findings

ISWI combined with dexketoprofen trometamol significantly reduced VAS scores compared to dexketoprofen trometamol alone (p < 0.05). The study was not registered, and the outcome assessment was not blinded. CONSORT methodology was not fully followed. These limitations need to be considered when interpreting the results.

Conclusion

The combination of ISWI and dexketoprofen trometamol provides superior pain relief and reduces the need for rescue analgesia in patients with renal colic compared to dexketoprofen trometamol alone. However, because of the limitations mentioned above, no definitive conclusions can be drawn from this study.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for acute renal colic [^113z7UUq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Urolithiasis (urinary stones) is a common disease with an increasing incidence globally. It often presents with renal colic, which is characterised by acute and intense abdominal pain. The first step in the management of renal colic is pain control. Various medications, including narcotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antispasmodics, and others, have been used for this condition. NSAIDs are amongst the most commonly used drugs for renal colic. They act by reducing inflammation and lowering the pressure inside the urinary collecting system. This review updates a previous Cochrane Systematic Review (Afshar 2015), focusing exclusively on NSAIDs.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of different nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the management of pain in adults with acute renal colic.

Search Methods

We performed a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, trial registries, and conference proceedings up to 25 August 2023. We applied no restrictions on publication language or status.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised (or quasi-randomised) controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of NSAIDs in the management of renal colic adult patients (i.e. study participants over 16 years of age). We included studies that compared NSAIDs versus placebo, one NSAID versus another, or different doses or routes of administration of the same NSAID.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. Primary outcomes included pain up to one hour after treatment as measured by a validated patient-reported tool, the need for rescue medication up to six hours after treatment, and serious adverse events up to one week after treatment. Secondary outcomes included pain recurrence, significant pain relief, and minor adverse events. We performed meta-analysis using the random-effects model. We rated the certainty of evidence according to the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Our search identified 29 RCTs for inclusion in the review. The 29 studies involved a total of 3593 participants who were randomly allocated to treatment with an NSAID or placebo. The mean age of participants ranged from 27 to 47 years across the studies. Participants used a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS) to indicate the extent of their pain. NSAIDs versus placebo NSAIDs may reduce renal colic pain in 30 minutes compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) -3.84 cm, 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.41 to -1.27; I² = 95%; 3 studies, 250 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of NSAIDs on the need for rescue medication (risk ratio (RR) 0.24, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.53; I² = 73%; 4 studies, 280 participants; very low-certainty evidence). NSAID versus NSAID Piroxicam may result in little to no difference in renal colic pain at 30 minutes compared to diclofenac (MD 0.01 cm, 95% CI -1.50 to 1.52; I² = 78%; 2 studies, 144 participants; low-certainty evidence). Parecoxib likely results in little to no difference in renal colic pain at 30 minutes compared to ketoprofen (MD 0.03 cm, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.65; 1 study, 337 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Lornoxicam likely results in little to no difference in renal colic pain at 30 minutes compared to other NSAIDs (MD -0.22 cm, 95% CI -0.69 to 0.24; I² = 12%; 2 studies, 170 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Ketorolac may result in little to no difference in renal colic pain at 60 minutes (MD 0.23 cm, 95% CI -1.16 to 1.62, 1 study, 57 participants; low-certainty evidence) and need for rescue medication within 120 minutes (RR 1.76, 95% CI 0.73 to 4.24; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 114 participants; low-certainty evidence) compared to diclofenac. Intravenous (IV) ketorolac may result in little to no difference in renal colic pain at 30 minutes compared to IV ibuprofen (MD 1.36 cm, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.87; I² = 84%; 2 studies, 361 participants; low-certainty evidence). IV ketorolac may result in less chance of significant pain relief within 30 minutes compared to IV ibuprofen (RR 0.17, 95 CI 0.04 to 0.73; 1 study, 240 participants; low-certainty evidence). Ketoprofen likely results in little to no difference in renal colic pain at 30 minutes compared to diclofenac (MD -0.43 cm, 95% CI -1.18 to 0.32; 1 study, 80 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of ketoprofen on significant pain relief within 40 minutes compared to diclofenac (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.78; 1 study, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Indomethacin likely results in little to no difference in renal colic pain at 30 minutes compared to diclofenac (MD 0.20 cm, 95% CI -0.90 to 1.30; 1 study, 83 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Pirprofen may result in a large reduction in the need for rescue medication within 30 minutes compared to indomethacin (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.82; 1 study, 205 participants; low-certainty evidence). Intravenous NSAIDs likely result in little to no difference in renal colic pain at 30 minutes compared to intramuscular NSAIDs (MD -0.34 cm, 95% CI -1.19 to 0.51; I² = 42%; 2 studies, 134 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Intravenous NSAIDs may reduce the need for rescue medication within 30 minutes compared to rectal NSAIDs (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.88; 1 study, 116 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is uncertain regarding the potential harms of NSAIDs. Risk of bias We judged the risk of bias in the studies to be moderate to high. This was due to a high proportion of unknown risk judgments for concealment bias and a high risk of selective reporting bias.

Authors' Conclusions

NSAIDs may reduce pain in adult patients with renal colic compared to placebo. Comparing one NSAID against another, IV ketorolac may be less effective than IV ibuprofen, and pirprofen may result in less need for rescue medication than indomethacin. The intravenous route of administration is probably similar to the intramuscular route but may be better than the rectal route. The evidence is uncertain regarding the potential harms of NSAIDs. We were not able to perform subgroup analysis based on our predefined criteria because there were no eligible studies.

### Can low-dose of ketamine reduce the need for morphine in renal colic? A double-blind randomized clinical trial [^114nLpYN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The combination of morphine with low doses of ketamine (MK) has been utilized in the Emergency Department (ED) compared with morphine and placebo (MP) for the treatment of acute pain in few studies. The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of MP with MK for the treatment of severe pain with renal colic of patients who had been referred to the ED.

Methods

This study is a double blind randomized clinical trial on patients with severe renal colic pain who were referred to the ED. Patients were enrolled with pain severity of at least 6 of the 10 visual analogue scales (VAS). Patients were divided into two groups: Morphine 0.1mg/kg and placebo (MP group) and morphine 0.1mg/kg and ketamine 0.15mg/kg (MK group). Pain of patients was studied in 10, 30, 60, 90, and 120min after injection.

Results

Totally, 106 patients were enrolled in study groups. Assessment of the average pain during 120min at 10 and 30min after the start in the drug, MK group was significantly lower than the MP group (p = 0.019 and p = 0.003 respectively).

Conclusion

Given that combinations of morphine with low doses of ketamine in patients with renal colic pain causes more pain and morphine consumption reduction then this combination is suggested as an alternative treatment that could be utilized in patients with renal colic.

### Pain management of renal colic in the emergency department with intravenous lidocaine [^116KdT74]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe our experience with intravenous lidocaine (IVL) to manage pain of renal colic origin in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

A retrospective analysis of all patients presenting with pain of renal colic origin from the periods of 2014 to 2017 by using the ED electronic medical record database (Allscripts™).

Results

Forty-four patients received IVL for renal colic over a three-year period. The average dose of IVL as a primary analgesic was 117.2 mg, and as a rescue was 108 mg. Administration of IVL resulted in a decrease in overall pain score by 6.3 points (numerical rating scale), by 7.4 points when IVL was used as a primary analgesic, and by 5.2 points when IVL was given as a rescue. There were no documented adverse effects.

Conclusion

Intravenous lidocaine has a potential of being used for patients presenting to the ED with a pain of renal colic origin as a primary analgesic or as a rescue. Although promising, this therapy will need to be studied in prospective randomized fashion and larger patients' population with underlying cardiac disease before it can be recommended for broad use in the ED.

### Metoclopramide for analgesia in renal colic: a narrative systematic review [^114mhWQW]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Renal colic is both common and extremely painful; the lifetime incidence is approximately 12% in males and 6% in females, with recurrence rates approaching 50%. Pain occurs due to ureteral obstruction and spasm, followed by peri-ureteral inflammation and oedema. It is often associated with systemic disturbance, including vomiting.

The standard analgesic regime for renal colic (usually involving a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) and an opioid) is sometimes ineffective; in some studies less than half of patients achieve complete pain relief and a large proportion of patients require rescue analgesia within four hours. Given previous Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) work has highlighted how agonising the pain of renal colic is and the challenges of its treatment (Tabner A: Patient and Public Involvement Meeting Summary. Internal report to inform the SARC study (Salbutamol for analgesia in renal colic), unpublished), any potentially effective therapies should be explored.

Commonly used treatments (NSAIDS, opioids and alpha blockers) have been well studied and the previous subjects of a Cochrane and other systematic reviews but still provide inadequate analgesia in some cases. They are also associated with side effects: opiates are known to cause nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and respiratory depression; the oral absorption of NSAIDs in this cohort can be poor due to gastroparesis and vomiting; and rectal administration of diclofenac is frequently felt by patients to be unpleasant (Tabner A: Patient and Public Involvement Meeting Summary. Internal report to inform the SARC study (Salbutamol for analgesia in renal colic), unpublished).

The onset of action of the existing analgesic options is slow; NSAIDS require a period of absorption before they are effective and intravenous opioids are controlled drugs, the administration of which is often delayed by practical concerns in their dispensing and prescription.

### Single dose dipyrone for acute renal colic pain [^113AhdeB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Renal colic pain is extremely painful and requires immediate treatment with strong analgesics. Dipyrone is the most popular non-opioid first line analgesic in many countries but in others it has been banned (e.g. USA, UK) because of its association with blood dyscrasias such as agranulocytosis. Since dipyrone is used in many countries (e.g. Brazil, Spain) there is a need to determine the benefits and harms of its use to treat renal colic pain.

Objectives

To assess quantitatively the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of single-dose dipyrone in adults with moderate to severe renal colic pain.

Search Strategy

Published reports were identified from electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, LILACS) and additional studies were identified from the reference lists of retrieved reports. Date of the most recent search: January 2000.

Selection Criteria

Inclusion criteria were: full journal publication; RCT with a double-blind design; adult patients with baseline renal colic pain of moderate or severe intensity; treatment arms which included dipyrone (oral, intramuscular or intravenous administration) and a control; single dose data.

Data Collection and Analysis

Summed pain intensity and pain relief data were extracted and converted into dichotomous information to yield the number of patients with at least 50% pain relief over 15–30 minutes, 1–2 hours and six hours. The proportion of patients with at least 50% pain relief was calculated. Single dose adverse effect data were collected.

Main Results

Eleven studies with 1053 patients (550 on dipyrone) met the inclusion criteria. Unfortunately, few data were available for analysis; most analyses were based on the results of single, small trials and statistical pooling of the results was inappropriate. Efficacy estimates were calculated as the weighted mean percent of patients achieving at least 50% pain relief with the range of values from trials contributing to the analysis. However, these estimates were not robust. Commonly reported adverse effects with intravenous dipyrone were dry mouth and somnolence, and one study reported pain at the injection site. Insufficient information was available for safety analyses to be conducted.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Limited available data indicated that single dose dipyrone was of similar efficacy to other analgesics used in renal colic pain, although intramuscular dipyrone was less effective than diclofenac 75 mg. Combining dipyrone with antispasmolytic agents did not appear to improve its efficacy. Intravenous dipyrone was more effective than intramuscular dipyrone. Dry mouth and somnolence were commonly reported with intravenous dipyrone. None of the studies reported agranulocytosis.

### Lidocaine hydrochloride, ketorolac tromethamine (acunistat-60) [^112Z5TPD]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

KETOROLAC TROMETHAMINE INJECTION

Ketorolac tromethamine injection may be used as a single or multiple dose on a regular or "prn" schedule for the management of moderately severe, acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level, usually in a postoperative setting. Hypovolemia should be corrected prior to the administration of ketorolac tromethamine (see WARNINGS, Renal Effects). Patients should be switched to alternative analgesics as soon as possible, but ketorolac tromethamine therapy is not to exceed 5 days.

When administering ketorolac tromethamine injection, the IV bolus must be given over no less than 15 seconds. The IM administration should be given slowly and deeply into the muscle. The analgesic effect begins in ~30 minutes with maximum effect in 1 to 2 hours after dosing IV or IM. Duration of analgesic effect is usually 4 to 6 hours.

Single-Dose Treatment: The following regimen should be limited to single administration use only

IM Dosing

Patients < 65 years of age: One dose of 60 mg.
Patients ≥ 65 years of age, renally impaired and/or less than 50 kg (110 lbs) of body weight: One dose of 30 mg.

IV Dosing

Patients < 65 years of age: One dose of 30 mg.
Patients ≥ 65 years of age, renally impaired and/or less than 50 kg (110 lbs) of body weight: One dose of 15 mg.

Multiple-Dose Treatment (IV or IM)

Patients < 65 years of age: The recommended dose is 30 mg ketorolac tromethamine injection every 6 hours. The maximum daily dose for these populations should not exceed 120 mg.
For patients ≥ 65 years of age, renally impaired patients (see WARNINGS), and patients less than 50 kg (110 lbs): The recommended dose is 15 mg ketorolac tromethamine injection every 6 hours. The maximum daily dose for these populations should not exceed 60 mg.

For breakthrough pain, do not increase the dose or the frequency of ketorolac tromethamine. Consideration should be given to supplementing these regimens with low doses of opioids "prn" unless otherwise contraindicated.

### Successful treatment of a persistent renal colic with trigger point injection [^116z4bu1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Renal colic is one of the painful conditions in emergency medicine practice. Opiates and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the cornerstone of pain management in renal colic. However, alternative procedures should be considered in patients refractory to conventional therapies. We present a case of renal colic successfully treated by trigger point injection that was refractory to 150 microg fentanyl and 5 mg morphine.

### Piroxicam and paracetamol in the prevention of early recurrent pain and emergency department readmission after renal colic: randomized placebo-controlled trial [^112uMd99]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Renal colic (RC), characterized by its excruciating pain, is a prevalent urologic emergency caused by urolithiasis, and a leading reason to seek immediate care in emergency departments (EDs). With an escalating incidence estimated at 14% in England and 10.1% in the United States, this condition exerts a substantial impact on quality of life, and underscores the concern for the imperative need for effective management strategies. Most patients with RC are managed as outpatients, which highlights the importance of post‐ED discharge analgesic treatment to prevent recurrence and ensure patient well‐being. Importantly, recurrence rates within the first month after hospital discharge could be as high as 10%, accentuating the challenge in mitigating this major event. Additionally, persistent pain required frequent ED visits and rescue reinterventions, perpetuating a cycle of discomfort and health care resource utilization. Despite attempts to implement preventive measures like dietary and drug interventions, their efficacy remains limited. Germane to the ED, there is currently a lack of comprehensive studies and recommendations addressing the post–RC treatment to prevent the early recurrence. In routine clinical practice, patients are commonly discharged with nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) despite the lack of conclusive evidence. Indeed, studies investigating the effectiveness of NSAIDs as preventive therapy or alternative treatments remain notably scarce. Our study aim is to compare the benefit of oral NSAIDs and paracetamol for patients discharged from the ED following treatment of RC, with a specific emphasis on recurrence of pain and need for hospital readmission.

### Comparing intravenous lidocaine and pethidine for pain management in emergency department patients with femoral bone fracture: a randomized controlled trial [^117VJdVg]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bone fractures are a prevalent reason for seeking emergency care, with nearly 2 million individuals admitted to emergency departments in the United States annually due to long bone fractures. The incidence of femoral shaft fractures ranges from 9.5 to 18.9 per 100,000 persons-year, often resulting in moderate to severe pain among affected patients. Despite the high prevalence of fractures and associated pain, initial pain management in the emergency department is frequently suboptimal, with over 50% of patients expressing dissatisfaction with their pain management strategies. Clinicians commonly prescribe a variety of analgesics to alleviate fracture-related pain, depending on the severity of injury and individual patient factors. Intravenous opioids such as morphine, pethidine, and hydrocodone are frequently utilized as the primary agents for pain management in patients with moderate to severe isolated limb trauma, while non-opioid oral medications like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol are typically reserved for less severe injuries.

Lidocaine, a widely employed amide local anesthetic, exerts its analgesic effects by blocking sodium channels in peripheral and central neurons of the nociceptive pathway. Although primarily used for nerve blocks and infiltration anesthesia, intravenous lidocaine has demonstrated efficacy as an analgesic agent when administered systemically. Randomized clinical trials conducted in surgical settings have reported that intravenous lidocaine reduces pain intensity, diminishes postoperative opioid consumption, and shortens hospital stays among surgical patients. Additionally, intravenous lidocaine has shown promise in managing refractory cancer pain and neuropathic pain.

However, the utility of intravenous lidocaine for pain management in the emergency department setting remains relatively understudied. While the American College of Emergency Physicians advocates for the preferential use of non-opioid medications as first-line treatment for fracture-related pain, emerging evidence suggests that intravenous lidocaine may offer effective pain relief in acute conditions such as renal colic and critical limb ischemia, potentially surpassing the potency of morphine. Nonetheless, robust evidence supporting the superiority of intravenous lidocaine over opioids for bone fractures in the emergency department is lacking. In light of this gap in the literature, our study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of intravenous lidocaine compared to pethidine for pain control in patients presenting with femoral bone fractures in the emergency department.

### Consensus guidelines on the use of intravenous ketamine infusions for chronic pain from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, and the American society of anesthesiologists [^112tJZUe]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Nonparenteral ketamine for acute pain management — formulation status, dosing, and trial data — notes that ketamine is currently approved only for parenteral administration and that no FDA-approved nonparenteral formulations exist for oral or intranasal (IN) use; compounded IN ketamine must comply with USP-797. Off-label oral ketamine is poorly bioavailable (approximately 20%), with limited dosing guidance. In chronic neuropathic pain, a randomized trial of 42 patients using oral ketamine 30 mg 3 times per day versus oral methadone 3 mg 3 times per day or both reported greater pain relief at 3 months for ketamine; a pilot of 3 patients receiving 0.5 to 1 mg/kg oral ketamine 3 times per day suggested benefit for acute postoperative amputation pain. For postoperative dental pain, a placebo-controlled study in 40 patients found meaningful pain relief over a 3-hour period after a single dose of intranasal ketamine 50 mg but not with 10 or 30 mg, with adverse events generally mild and similar to placebo. In emergency settings, a randomized study in 90 subjects comparing IN ketamine (1 mg/kg) with IV morphine (0.1 mg/kg) or IM morphine (0.15 mg/kg) showed IN ketamine produced a 56-mm maximal visual analog scale pain reduction similar to IV 59 mm and IM 48-mm, with time to onset 14.3 minutes for IN ketamine and 8.9 minutes for IV morphine (both faster than IM). Another randomized, double-blind trial comparing single-dose IN ketamine (1 mg/kg) with IV morphine (0.1 mg/kg) in 53 patients with renal colic found both groups similar in safety and effectiveness for up to 30 minutes after drug administration, and two observational studies in adult and pediatric patients reported only minor and transient adverse events.

### Effect of adjunctive acupuncture on pain relief among emergency department patients with acute renal colic due to urolithiasis: a randomized clinical trial [^114g1sJC]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Renal colic is a symptom complex, including excruciating flank or abdominal pain radiating to the groin, that has resulted in millions of emergency department visits worldwide. It is the most frequent symptom of the presence of a stone in the urinary system. Moreover, it is estimated that the prevalence of urinary calculi ranges from 1% to 20% worldwide because of geographical, climatic, ethnic, dietary, and genetic factors. It is described as one of the worst pains a patient can have. Therefore, effective analgesia in the shortest possible time is of paramount importance in the management of renal colic.

According to the guidelines of the European Association of Urology, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first choice to manage pain in patients with acute renal colic. Intramuscular injectable diclofenac sodium is commonly used in China because it is technically easy and fast to administer. In a previous study, Pain alleviation was observed with a mean (SD) of 18.64 (7.99) minutes after intramuscular diclofenac sodium injection. However, 37.5% of patients still experienced moderate or severe pain at 15 minutes. Therefore, an effective and available therapy is urgently needed to accelerate pain relief.

Acupuncture, as a complementary therapy from traditional Chinese medicine, is effective for the management of numerous types of pain conditions. Additionally, the white paper "Acupuncture's Role in Solving the Opioid Epidemic"has recommended that acupuncture can safely, easily, and cost-effectively be incorporated into the emergency department to treat acute pain conditions. Moreover, several randomized clinical trials (RCTs), have shown that acupuncture results in a rapid pain score decrease within the first 10 minutes. However, it is not certain whether acupuncture, as an adjunctive treatment to analgesics, can accelerate pain relief in patients with acute renal colic. This trial aimed to investigate whether acupuncture, as adjunctive treatment to analgesics, can accelerate pain relief for patients with renal colic in the emergency department.

### Salbutamol for analgesia in renal colic: a prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled phase II trial [^113naV9n]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary outcome data

The median change in pain score for participants with confirmed renal colic in the salbutamol group at 30 min when compared with baseline was −18 mm (IQR −25 to −3) and in the placebo group −13 mm (IQR −33 to −1); this represents a difference of −5 mm (95% CI −16 to 6, p = 0.575) favouring the salbutamol group. This does not meet the prespecified MCID of 13 mm, nor was it statistically significant. Pain scores at all time points can be seen in figure 3.

Figure 3
Change in pain score from baseline (100 mm Visual Analogue Scale) at all study time points in participants with confirmed renal colic analysed on an intention-to-treat basis.

Sensitivity analyses conducted on the primary outcome on both 'per-protocol' and 'as-treated' bases did not change either the clinical or statistical significance of the primary outcome (table 2).

Pain

No clinically or statistically significant difference in the change in pain scores from baseline to 30 min between groups was observed for participants with suspected renal colic, analysed on an ITT basis (−5 mm (95% CI −14 to 4); p = 0.281).

No clinically or statistically significant differences in the change in pain scores from baseline were observed between groups for participants with either confirmed or suspected renal colic, analysed on an ITT basis, at any time point during the study (table 4).

Change in pain score from baseline at all study time points, together with the difference in change in pain scores, for both the confirmed and suspected renal colic groups

McGill Pain Questionnaire

No statistically significant differences between groups were identified in any component of the McGill Pain Questionnaire at any time point in the confirmed renal colic group. Salbutamol did not demonstrate any analgesic-sparing effects in participants with confirmed renal colic.

The regression analysis for secondary pain outcomes can be found in online supplemental material 3; no significant results were identified.

### Magnesium sulfate versus lidocaine as an adjunct for renal colic in the emergency department: a randomized, double-blind controlled trial [^112c3Zky]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

We wished to determine whether the addition of magnesium sulfate (MgSO₄) or lidocaine to diclofenac could improve the analgesic efficacy in emergency department (ED) patients with acute renal colic.

Methods

In this prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial of patients aged 18 to 65 years with suspected acute renal colic, we randomized them to receive 75 mg intramuscular (IM) diclofenac and then intravenous (IV) MgSO₄, lidocaine, or saline solution control. Subjects reported their pain using a numerical rating scale (NRS) before drug administration and then 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, and 90 minutes afterwards. Our primary outcome was the proportion of participants achieving at least a 50% reduction in the NRS score 30 minutes after drug administration.

Results

We enrolled 280 patients in each group. A 50% or greater reduction in the NRS score at 30 minutes occurred in 227 (81.7%) patients in the MgSO₄ group, 204 (72.9%) in the lidocaine group, and 201 (71.8%) in the control group, with significant differences between MgSO₄ and lidocaine (8.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.89 to 15.7], P = 0.013) and between MgSO₄ and control (9.9%, 95% CI [2.95 to 16.84], P = 0.004). Despite this, differences between all groups at every time point were below the accepted 1.3 threshold for clinical importance. There were no observed differences between groups in the frequency of rescue analgesics and return visits to the ED for renal colic. There were more adverse events, although minor, in the MgSO₄ group.

Conclusion

Adding intravenous MgSO 4, but not lidocaine, to IM diclofenac offered superior pain relief but at levels below accepted thresholds for clinical importance.

### Pain management strategies for patients with kidney stones [^115ovKSp]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Kidney stones have been a source of severe pain for at least thousands of years, yet achieving adequate pain control remains a struggle for providers to this day. Additionally, even the surgical interventions offered to address stones are fraught with potentially difficult-to-control perioperative pain. Herein, we delve into the implications of pain management and strategies to best address renal colic and perioperative pain associated with ureteral stents, ureteroscopy, shock wave lithotripsy, and percutaneous renal surgery.

### Salbutamol for analgesia in renal colic: a prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled phase II trial [^115NQq9F]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This trial has not identified a clinically significant benefit from the addition of intravenous salbutamol to standard care for ED patients with severe pain caused by renal colic. While it cannot be stated that salbutamol has no analgesic effect, further exploration of its role as part of a multimodal analgesic regimen administered in an ED setting is not warranted. Pain control in patients with renal colic has again been demonstrated to be challenging, and further work is required to optimise care in this cohort.

### Comparison of intravenous lidocaine / ketorolac combination to either analgesic alone for suspected renal colic pain in the ED [^1145yjbs]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To compare analgesic efficacy and safety of intravenous lidocaine and ketorolac combination to each analgesic alone for ED patients with suspected renal colic.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial comparing analgesic efficacy of a combination of intravenous lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg) and ketorolac (30 mg), to ketorolac (30 mg), and to lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg) in patients aged 18–64 presenting to the ED with suspected renal colic. Primary outcome included difference in pain scores between the groups at 30 min. Secondary outcomes included a comparative reduction in pain scores in each group from baseline to 30 and 60 min as well as rates of adverse events and need for rescue analgesia at 30 and 60 min.

Results

We enrolled 150 subjects (50 per group). The difference in mean pain scores at 30 min between Lidocaine and Lidocaine/Ketorolac groups was -2.89 (95% CI: -4.39 to -1.39); between Ketorolac and Lidocaine/Ketorolac group was -0.92 (95% CI: -2.44 to 0.61); and between Ketorolac and Lidocaine was -1.98 (95% CI: -3.69 to -0.27). A comparative percentage of subjects in each group required rescue analgesia at 30 and 60 min. No clinically concerning changes in vital signs were observed. No serious adverse events occurred in either group. Commonly reported adverse effects were dizziness, nausea, and headache.

Conclusion

The administration of intravenous lidocaine/ketorolac combination to ED patients with suspected renal colic results in better analgesia in comparison to lidocaine alone but provides no analgesic advantages over ketorolac alone. Clinicaltrials.gov Registration: NCT02902770.

### Does lidocaine as an adjuvant to morphine improve pain relief in patients presenting to the ED with acute renal colic? A double-blind, randomized controlled trial [^116PQBrV]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Renal colic (RC) is a common clinical presentation in the emergency department (ED). Prompt and effective pain control is one of the first responsibilities of emergency physicians. The aim of this study was to evaluate the analgesic effect of adding lidocaine to morphine compared to morphine alone in patients presenting to the ED with RC.

Methods

In a double-blind, randomized controlled trial, a total of 110 adult patients of both sexes, aged 18 to 50 years, who presented to the ED with signs and symptoms suggestive of RC were randomly assigned into 1 of 2 groups. Patients in group A received morphine (0.1 mg/kg) plus lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg), whereas those in group B received morphine (0.1 mg/kg) plus normal saline 0.9% as placebo. All patients were asked to rate the intensity of their pain and nausea on a 0- to 10-point visual analog scale before and at 5, 10, 30, 60, and 120 minutes after intervention.

Results

There was a statistically significant time trend decline in both groups for both pain and nausea scores (P < .01). Repeated-measures analysis showed a significant effect for the interaction between group and time of persistent pain (P = 0.034), but there was no significant group effect in this regard (P = 0.146). Median times to being pain free in the group receiving morphine plus lidocaine and in the group taking morphine alone were 87.02 minutes (95% confidence interval [CI] 74.23–94.82) and 100.12 minutes (95% CI, 89.95–110.23), respectively (P = 0.071). Repeated-measures analysis also showed a significant group effect for nausea (P = 0.038), but there was no interaction between group and time in this regard (P = 0.243). The median nausea-free times in the group receiving morphine plus lidocaine and the group receiving morphine alone were 26.6 minutes (95% CI, 14.16–39.03) and 58.33 minutes (95% CI, 41.85–74.82), respectively. This time difference was statistically significant (P < .001).

Conclusions

Using lidocaine may be recommended as an effective, safe, and inexpensive adjuvant to morphine in improving nausea and reducing the time needed to achieve pain and nausea relief in patients visiting the ED with acute RC.

### Efficacy of an erector spinae plane block for renal colic: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1113SBfW]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aim

The passage of kidney stones through the ureter creates renal colic, a severe visceral abdominal pain. Renal colic is typically managed with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids. Yet, these treatments often fail to provide adequate pain relief. The erector spinae plane block (ESPB) has emerged as a potential alternative treatment. This systematic review summarises the current body of evidence on the efficacy and safety of ESPB for renal colic in the ED.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and case series of ESPB in ED patients were conducted. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and ClinicalTrial.gov databases were electronically searched up to 10 June 2024, for studies that compared ESPB with standard care or placebo. The Cochrane risk of bias-2 tool was used to assess the risk of bias of included studies. Meta-analysis using a random effects model was performed if two or more studies reported the same outcome. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation tool was used to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Results

Four studies were included, including two RCTs and two case series. A total of 53 patients received an ESPB, compared with 40 patients who received standard care. All studies were rated as having a high overall risk of bias. Meta-analysis showed a large and significant effect of ESPB on pain reduction after 30min (standardised mean difference (SMD) -1.41 95%CI -1.90 to -0.91) and after 60min (SMD -1.94 95%CI -3.36 to -0.52), however the level of evidence was downgraded to very low certainty due to substantial heterogeneity (I² = 85%), serious concerns of bias and large imprecision. Heterogeneity in other outcome measurements precluded meta-analysis.

Conclusions

Although statistically significant, there is a low certainty regarding the positive effect of ESPB on pain reduction for renal colic in the ED. High-quality RCTs focusing on patient-reported outcomes are needed to establish the merit of ESPB for this indication.

### Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for the treatment of renal colic in the ED: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1134Ra2b]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To determine the analgesic efficacy of TENS treatment in patients with renal colic in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

This double-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted in a tertiary care ED. Patients with a definitive diagnosis of renal colic were assigned (1:1) as randomized to receive the real TENS with frequency 100 Hz, pulse width 200 microseconds, voltage 2 mA, or placebo with sham TENS. Pain intensity was measured using visual analog scales (VAS) at baseline, after 15 and 30th minutes.

Results

A total of 100 patients were included in the final analysis: 50 patients treated with real TENS and 50 patients treated with sham TENS. VAS scores in both groups were similar at baseline. The mean reduction in VAS score at 15 min was 33.3 ± 17.6 (95% Confidence interval (CI): 28.3 to 38.3) for the real TENS group and 14.9 ± 11.6 (95% CI 11.6 to 18.2) for the sham TENS group (mean difference: 18.4 (95% CI: 12.5 to 24.4, P < 0.0001). The mean reduction in VAS score at 30 min was 63.7 ± 21.1 (95% CI: 57.7 to 69.7) for the real TENS group and 14.9 ± 16.2 (95% CI: 19.5 to 10.3) for the sham TENS group (mean difference: 48.8, 95% CI: 41.4 to 56.3, P < 0.0001). Four patients (8%) in the real TENS group and 24 patients (48%) in the sham TENS group required the rescue medication after 30th minutes.

Conclusions

TENS is effective for acute pain treatment in renal colic patients in the ED. TENS therapy could be a treatment option for renal colic.

### Metoclopramide for analgesia in renal colic: a narrative systematic review [^115N3Wma]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Metoclopramide is an antiemetic medication with anticholinergic and antidopaminergic properties that was developed in the 1960s; it is also an analogue of procaine, a local anaesthetic. There are multiple mechanisms by which it may act to reduce the pain associated with renal colic; its pharmacology is complex and the response appears to be dose-related.

Antidopaminergic: D1 and D2 receptors are found on the ureter. Stimulation of these has been shown to cause urinary tract hyperactivity, whilst blockade reduces motility. Reduced ureteral activity has been hypothesised to reduce the pain of renal colic.

Anticholinergic: Metoclopramide inhibits release of acetylcholine, which is known to be involved in ureteral activity; it may therefore reduce ureteral activity and improve pain as above. However, another case series identified increased ureteral activity and accelerated stone passage with a supramaximal dose of metoclopramide, along with an improvement in patients' symptoms.

As an analogue of procaine, metoclopramide has been shown to have local anaesthetic properties when injected subdermally and has been shown to potentiate the effects of local anaesthetic when used for regional anaesthesia. Given approximately 20% of a dose of metoclopramide is secreted, unchanged, through the renal tract, there is potential for topical action.

Metoclopramide reduces ureteral motility at high concentrations in vitro, and therefore may reduce the pain associated with renal colic. It is worth noting, however, that at lower concentrations metoclopramide has been observed to increase ureteral motility, and also to increase bladder activity. There is therefore equipoise within the pre-clinical literature concerning the in-vivo effects of metoclopramide in renal colic and prior reports would appear to be contradictory in terms of physiological effects and mechanism by which symptoms may be ameliorated.

A scoping review has identified one relevant study suggesting that metoclopramide may be as effective as intravenous tenoxicam in managing the pain of renal colic.

The objective of this review is to collate and synthesise the evidence concerning metoclopramide as an analgesic in the treatment of renal colic, in comparison to any alternative treatment or treatment regimes, including placebo.

### Delivering safe and effective analgesia for management of renal colic in the emergency department: a double-blind, multigroup, randomised controlled trial [^1165S7WY]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

The excruciating pain of patients with renal colic on presentation to the emergency department requires effective analgesia to be administered in the shortest possible time. Trials comparing intramuscular non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with intravenous opioids or paracetamol have been inconclusive because of the challenges associated with concealment of randomisation, small sample size, differences in outcome measures, and inadequate masking of participants and assessors. We did this trial to develop definitive evidence regarding the choice of initial analgesia and route of administration in participants presenting with renal colic to the emergency department.

Methods

In this three-treatment group, double-blind, randomised controlled trial, adult participants (aged 18–65 years) presenting to the emergency department of an academic, tertiary care hospital in Qatar, with moderate to severe renal colic (Numerical pain Rating Scale ≥ 4) were recruited. With the use of computer-generated block randomisation (block sizes of six and nine), participants were assigned (1:1:1) to receive diclofenac (75 mg/3 mL intramuscular), morphine (0.1 mg/kg intravenous), or paracetamol (1 g/100 mL intravenous). Participants, clinicians, and trial personnel were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants achieving at least a 50% reduction in initial pain score at 30 min after analgesia, assessed by intention-to-treat analysis and per-protocol analysis, which included patients where a calculus in the urinary tract was detected with imaging. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02187614.

Findings

Between Aug 5, 2014, and March 15, 2015, we randomly assigned 1645 participants, of whom 1644 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (547 in the diclofenac group, 548 in the paracetemol group, and 549 in the morphine group). Ureteric calculi were detected in 1316 patients, who were analysed as the per-protocol population (438 in the diclofenac group, 435 in the paracetemol group, and 443 in the morphine group). The primary outcome was achieved in 371 (68%) patients in the diclofenac group, 364 (66%) in the paracetamol group, and 335 (61%) in the morphine group in the intention-to-treat population. Compared to morphine, diclofenac was significantly more effective in achieving the primary outcome (odds ratio [OR] 1.35, 95% CI 1.05–1.73, p = 0.0187), whereas no difference was detected in the effectiveness of morphine compared with intravenous paracetamol (1.26, 0.99–1.62, p = 0.0629). In the per-protocol population, diclofenac (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.13–1.97, p = 0.0046) and paracetamol (1.40, 1.06–1.85, p = 0.0166) were more effective than morphine in achieving the primary outcome. Acute adverse events in the morphine group occurred in 19 (3%) participants. Significantly lower numbers of adverse events were recorded in the diclofenac group (7 [1%] participants, OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.12–0.78, p = 0.0088) and paracetamol group (7 [1%] participants, 0.36, 0.15–0.87, p = 0.0175) than in the morphine group. During the 2 week follow-up, no additional adverse events were noted in any group.

Interpretation

Intramuscular non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs offer the most effective sustained analgesia for renal colic in the emergency department and seem to have fewer side-effects.

### Safety and efficacy of intravenous lidocaine for pain management in the emergency department: a systematic review [^114rPRNf]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous lidocaine in adult patients with acute and chronic pain who are undergoing pain management in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

We searched Ovid CENTRAL, Ovid EMBASE, and Ovid MEDLINE databases for randomized controlled trials and observational studies from inception to January 2017. Efficacy outcomes included reduction in pain scores from baseline to postintervention and need for rescue analgesia. Safety outcomes included incidence of serious (eg, cardiac arrest) and nonserious (eg, dizziness) adverse events. We used the Cochrane Collaboration tool and a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to evaluate the risk of bias across studies. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to evaluate the confidence in the evidence available.

Results

From a total of 1,947 titles screened, 61 articles were selected for full-text review. Eight studies met the inclusion criteria and underwent qualitative analysis, including 536 patients. The significant clinical heterogeneity and low quality of studies precluded a meta-analysis. Among the 6 randomized controlled trials included, intravenous lidocaine had efficacy equivalent to that of active controls in 2 studies, and was better than active controls in 2 other studies. In particular, intravenous lidocaine had pain score reduction comparable to or higher than that of intravenous morphine for pain associated with renal colic and critical limb ischemia. Lidocaine did not appear to be effective for migraine headache in 2 studies. There were 20 adverse events reported by 6 studies among 225 patients who received intravenous lidocaine in the ED, 19 nonserious and 1 serious (rate 8.9%, 95% confidence interval 5.5% to 13.4% for any adverse event; and 0.4%, 95% confidence interval 0% to 2.5% for serious adverse events). The confidence in the evidence available for the outcomes evaluated was deemed to be very low because of methodological limitations, including risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision.

Conclusion

There is limited current evidence to define the role of intravenous lidocaine as an analgesic for patients with acute renal colic and critical limb ischemia pain in the ED. Its efficacy for other indications has not been adequately tested. The safety of lidocaine for ED pain management has not been adequately examined.

### Metoclopramide for analgesia in renal colic: a narrative systematic review [^11621kiF]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Metoclopramide, a prokinetic antiemetic with activity at multiple receptor types, may be a useful treatment for renal colic pain. This review investigated whether metoclopramide is an effective analgesic in the management of adults with renal colic.

Eligible studies were randomised, quasi-randomised or case-control trials of metoclopramide for the management renal colic pain. Electronic database searches were performed in November 2022. Screening was performed by two authors independently; disagreement was resolved by discussion or by adjudication by a third author. The Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool v2.0 was used to assess bias.

Two studies were included, enrolling 279 patients. Heterogeneity of primary outcome measurement and comparators rendered meta-analysis inappropriate; a narrative review is presented. Both studies showed some evidence of analgesic effect. The largest study had a low risk of bias in all assessed domains, whilst the smaller study was at a high risk of bias.

There is limited evidence that metoclopramide may be an effective analgesic in the management of renal colic, with the highest quality study demonstrating analgesic properties similar to an intravenous non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and non-opioids for acute renal colic [^117HRinV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Renal colic is acute pain caused by urinary stones. The prevalence of urinary stones is between 10% and 15% in the United States, making renal colic one of the common reasons for urgent urological care. The pain is usually severe and the first step in the management is adequate analgesia. Many different classes of medications have been used in this regard including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and narcotics.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to assess benefits and harms of different NSAIDs and non-opioids in the treatment of adult patients with acute renal colic and if possible to determine which medication (or class of medications) are more appropriate for this purpose. Clinically relevant outcomes such as efficacy of pain relief, time to pain relief, recurrence of pain, need for rescue medication and side effects were explored.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register (to 27 November 2014) through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

Only randomised or quasi randomised studies were included. Other inclusion criteria included adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of renal colic due to urolithiasis, at least one treatment arm included a non-narcotic analgesic compared to placebo or another non-narcotic drug, and reporting of pain outcome or medication adverse effect. Patient-rated pain by a validated tool, time to relief, need for rescue medication and pain recurrence constituted the outcomes of interest. Any adverse effects (minor or major) reported in the studies were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Abstracts were reviewed by at least two authors independently. Papers meeting the inclusion criteria were fully reviewed and relevant data were recorded in a standardized Cochrane Renal Group data collection form. For dichotomous outcomes relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. For continuous outcomes the weighted mean difference was estimated. Both fixed and random models were used for meta-analysis. We assessed the analgesic effects using four different outcome variables: patient-reported pain relief using a visual analogue scale (VAS); proportion of patients with at least 50% reduction in pain; need for rescue medication; and pain recurrence. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² test.

Main Results

A total of 50 studies (5734 participants) were included in this review and 37 studies (4483 participants) contributed to our meta-analyses. Selection bias was low in 34% of the studies or unclear in 66%; performance bias was low in 74%, high in 14% and unclear in 12%; attrition bias was low in 82% and high in 18%; selective reporting bias low in 92% of the studies; and other biases (industry funding) was high in 4%, unclear in 18% and low in 78%. Patient-reported pain (VAS) results varied widely with high heterogeneity observed. For those comparisons which could be pooled we observed the following: NSAIDs significantly reduced pain compared to antispasmodics (5 studies, 303 participants: MD -12.97, 95% CI -21.80 to - 4.14; I² = 74%) and combination therapy of NSAIDs plus antispasmodics was significantly more effective in pain control than NSAID alone (2 studies, 310 participants: MD -1.99, 95% CI -2.58 to -1.40; I² = 0%).NSAIDs were significantly more effective than placebo in reducing pain by 50% within the first hour (3 studies, 197 participants: RR 2.28, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.51; I² = 15%). Indomethacin was found to be less effective than other NSAIDs (4 studies, 412 participants: RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.60; I² = 55%). NSAIDs were significantly more effective than hyoscine in pain reduction (5 comparisons, 196 participants: RR 2.44, 95% CI 1.61 to 3.70; I² = 28%). The combination of NSAIDs and antispasmodics was not superior to NSAIDs only (9 comparisons, 906 participants: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.13; I² = 59%). The results were mixed when NSAIDs were compared to other non-opioid medications. When the need for rescue medication was evaluated, Patients receiving NSAIDs were significantly less likely to require rescue medicine than those receiving placebo (4 comparisons, 180 participants: RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.60; I² = 24%) and NSAIDs were more effective than antispasmodics (4 studies, 299 participants: RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.84; I² = 65%). Combination of NSAIDs and antispasmodics was not superior to NSAIDs (7 comparisons, 589 participants: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.57; I² = 10%). Indomethacin was less effective than other NSAIDs (4 studies, 517 participants: RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.94; I² = 14%) except for lysine acetyl salicylate (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.65). Pain recurrence was reported by only three studies which could not be pooled: a higher proportion of patients treated with 75 mg diclofenac (IM) showed pain recurrence in the first 24 hours of follow-up compared to those treated with 40 mg piroxicam (IM) (60 participants: RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.81); no significant difference in pain recurrence at 72 hours was observed between piroxicam plus phloroglucinol and piroxicam plus placebo groups (253 participants: RR 2.52, 95% CI 0.15 to12.75); and there was no significant difference in pain recurrence within 72 hours of discharge between IM piroxicam and IV paracetamol (82 participants: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.54). Side effects were presented inconsistently, but no major events were reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Although due to variability in studies (inclusion criteria, outcome variables and interventions) and the evidence is not of highest quality, we still believe that NSAIDs are an effective treatment for renal colic when compared to placebo or antispasmodics. The addition of antispasmodics to NSAIDS does not result in better pain control. Data on other types of non-opioid, non-NSAID medication was scarce. Major adverse effects are not reported in the literature for the use of NSAIDs for treatment of renal colic.

### Best evidence topic report. intravenous NSAID's in the management of renal colic [^111K6pgn]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2006). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether intravenous non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are better than opioids at reducing pain in renal colic. 230 papers were found, of which five presented the best evidence to answer the clinical question, these have been meta-analysed by the Cochrane collaboration. The results of the meta-analysis are presented here. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results, and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. The clinical bottom line is that intravenous NSAID's should be the first-line treatment for patients presenting to the ED with acute renal colic.

### Salbutamol for analgesia in renal colic: a prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled phase II trial [^114wSDff]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Unusually for a phase II trial, the analgesic efficacy of salbutamol as a standalone agent was not assessed. A head-to-head comparison with known analgesics would potentially have deprived participants in the salbutamol group of any (known) effective analgesia and would not have been ethically justifiable. Furthermore, restricting recruitment to participants who had not received any prior analgesia would have rendered recruitment infeasible.

Salbutamol is associated with readily recognisable physiological effects (eg, tremor) that were likely apparent to both treating clinicians and researchers. Participants who received salbutamol were more likely to correctly guess their treatment allocation than those who received placebo. Blinding in this trial was therefore at best only partially effective.

There was frequently an unavoidable delay between participant consent and trial treatment administration. Resources for pre-prepared, blinded trial treatments were not available, and the study processes relied on staff availability to prepare trial medications. Given the speed of onset is a theoretical advantage of salbutamol, this may have reduced its measured efficacy. It may also have led to a change in pain level between identification and baseline measurements (which took place immediately prior to IMP administration).

Regarding medical management for acute pain, more specifically with respect to non-opioid analgesics, NSAIDs, EUSEM 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, diclofenac, ketoprofen and naproxen are commonly used in both the pre-hospital and emergency department settings for mild-to-moderate pain, particularly with an inflammatory component, and are most commonly administered PO, IV or topically; they remain the preferred analgesic in renal colic, with observed equivalence to opioid or opioid-acetaminophen combined analgesia at 30 minutes
, and effective analgesia in fracture.

### Cochrane briefs… [^114dmCLv]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

NSAIDs vs. Opiates for Pain in Acute Renal Colic Clinical Question Are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opiates more effective for pain relief in patients with acute renal colic. Evidence-Based Answer Data from randomized controlled trials comparing NSAIDs with opiates show that NSAIDs are associated with lower pain scores, less need for additional rescue medication, and less vomiting. Practice Pointers Acute renal colic is one of the most painful conditions and often is associated with nausea and vomiting. Holdgate and Pollock identified studies that compared NSAIDs with opiates in adults with acute renal colic and moderate to severe pain. They found 20 studies that included a total of 1, 613 patients and compared a total of five NSAIDs and five opiates.

Study quality was mediocre; although most studies blinded either patients or outcome assessors during the study period, only five studies clearly concealed allocation at the start of the study, and only three definitely used intention-to-treat analysis. Data from the trials could not be combined statistically because of differences in methodology and wide variability in results. Pain scores were reported in 13 studies. Ten studies found that patients who took NSAIDs had lower pain scores; two studies found no difference, and one study reported lower pain scores in patients who took opiates. There was no difference between treatment groups in complete pain relief at 30 or 60 minutes. Additional "rescue" analgesia was needed more often in patients randomized to opiates. Vomiting was more common in patients randomized to opiates.

Meperidine caused more vomiting than other opiates; there was no difference in the risk of vomiting between other opiates and NSAIDs. The Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement's guideline on acute pain management suggests that NSAIDS are often adequate for mild or moderate pain. 1) It recommends that opioids be added to pain therapy in these patients only if pain is not controlled adequately with NSAIDs alone.

### Effectiveness of intravenous lidocaine versus intravenous morphine for patients with renal colic in the emergency department [^1174WGD1]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Methods

To perform a prospective randomized double-blind clinical trial we evaluated the sample size of 100 people for each group. This study was approved by Ethics Committee of "Tabriz University of Medical Sciences". The trial was registered in "IRCT". Additionally, all aspects of the present study plan were explained to patients and written informed consents were obtained consequently.

Considering pain incidence ratios of 29.3% and 12% for the control and intervention groups respectively, confidence interval of 0.05, power of 20% and loss probability of 20% throughout the follow-up period using the following formula, a sample size of 100 people were calculated

As the number of the patients with renal colic referring to the emergency department of Imam Reza Hospital is abundant, the sample size was considered as 120 people for both groups and a total number of 240.

Using the website of240 letters of A and B were evenly (120) produced and patients were allocated to one of the two groups of A (Group I) and B (Group II), in the order provided by the site.

Patients were evenly divided into two groups of I, receiving intravenous lidocaine (n = 120), and II, receiving intravenous morphine (n = 120). As previously mentioned the study was double-blind and the executive of the research project was unaware of the obtained figures using online software from. Firstly, patients entering emergency department with complaint of flank pain were identified, interviewed and examined. Later, patients with pain radiating to genitalia and groin, nausea, vomiting, urinary irritation symptoms and tenderness in costovertebral angle were selected.

To provide the patients with required analgesia and to avoid any inconvenience regarding pain management, initial diagnosis was made based on clinical findings (unilateral abdominal pain radiating to the genitalia) associated with a positive urine analysis for hematuria. However diagnosis was later confirmed using Kidney, Ureter, and Bladder (KUB) radiographies and sonography studies. Since all patients experienced unilateral abdominal pain and their urine analyses were positive for hematuria, no further diagnostic criteria for renal colic were set throughout the study.

### Erector spinae plane block as analgesia for acute renal colic [^116eruie]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

A brief systematic review was conducted to assess the effectiveness of erector spinae plane block (ESPB) as an analgesic option for adults attending the emergency department with renal colic. MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched, and supplementary searches undertaken using Google Scholar and PubMed Medical Subject Headings. Two randomised controlled trials, two case series, one meta-analysis and one individual case were identified. Patient details, key results and study limitations were recorded in table format. Our findings support the use of ESPB as an effective form of analgesia in renal colic for initial treatment and refractory pain. Further studies should include a cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate the suitability of ESPB for everyday management of renal colic.

### Salbutamol for analgesia in renal colic: a prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled phase II trial [^111H8deG]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Beta-adrenoreceptor agonists are not the only class of drug known to cause ureteral relaxation; alpha adrenoreceptor blockers (eg, tamsulosin) have the same effect on ureteral motility and are frequently used in the treatment of renal calculi to reduce time to stone passage. In some studies, they are also found to reduce the number of pain episodes and other analgesic requirements. This trial was neither designed nor powered to assess the impact of salbutamol on the number of pain episodes or time to stone passage. The duration of action for oral alpha adrenoreceptor blockers far exceeds that of salbutamol and renders them more useful for longer-term management of renal calculi. However, they are not suitable for the management of acute pain due to their pharmacokinetics; absorption of oral medications is also frequently impaired in acute severe pain.

Participants in the salbutamol group reported more adverse reactions than those in the placebo group; no unanticipated AEs were identified. Most participants considered the side effects experienced to be mild; this is notable given that salbutamol was administered intravenously in this study, which is generally associated with a greater frequency and severity of side effects than other routes.

The clinical problem driving the development of this trial was a recognition that current analgesic regimens for renal colic are frequently ineffective, with many patients not achieving adequate pain relief and requiring rescue analgesia. The median baseline pain score for both trial groups was 67 mm despite participants having received standard analgesics; this is consistent with previous studies. Furthermore, most participants reported ongoing pain throughout the trial period. This trial therefore confirms the need for further research to improve analgesia in renal colic. A variety of research targets are evident; more potent opioids (eg, fentanyl) are used infrequently, but studies have demonstrated impressive analgesic efficacy. There may also be a role for ketamine in the management of severe renal colic. Further research concerning their effectiveness (and that of other novel agents) alongside existing analgesic regimens is required prior to their widespread adoption.

### Intradermal sterile water injection: safe and effective alternative for relief of acute renal colic in the emergency department [^111zyv25]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal pain relief method for acute renal colic in the emergency department remains controversial.

Objective

We compared the safety and efficacy of intradermal sterile water injection (ISWI) to treatment with intramuscular (IM) diclofenac, intravenous (IV) opioids, and IV paracetamol in patients with acute renal colic.

Methods

This randomized, single-blind study included 320 patients with renal colic to one of four treatment groups. The first group received ISWI at four different points around the most painful flank area. Patients in the DI, PARA, and TRAM groups received 75 mg IM diclofenac, 1 g IV paracetamol, and 100 mg IV tramadol, respectively. Pain intensity was measured using a visual analog scale (VAS) before treatment and 15, 30, and 60 min after treatment.

Results

VAS scores 15 and 30 min after treatment were significantly lower in group ISWI than in groups DI, PARA, and TRAM. However, there were no significant differences in the decrease in the pain score at baseline and at 60 min after treatment. In addition, fewer patients required rescue analgesia in group ISWI than in group TRAM. However, no significant differences were observed between group ISWI and group DI or PARA in terms of the need for rescue analgesia. Finally, there were significantly fewer adverse events in group ISWI than in groups DI and TRAM.

Conclusions

ISWI had similar efficacy, faster pain relief, and lower need for rescue analgesia compared with diclofenac, paracetamol, and tramadol for the management of acute renal colic. In addition, ISWI was well-tolerated and had no adverse effects.

### Salbutamol for analgesia in renal colic: a prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled phase II trial [^11469Rbi]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and setting

This was a single-centre, prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled phase II trial, recruiting in the ED of the Royal Derby Hospital, UK.

Selection of participants

Potential participants were identified by clinical staff, and eligible individuals were approached, screened, consented and recruited by trial-trained clinicians. Randomisation and preparation of blinded trial medication were performed by trial-trained nursing staff working in an area of the department remote to the participant and were not involved in providing their clinical care. Trial medication was then presented in a syringe (labelled 'trial medication') to the clinical staff caring for the participant.

Potential participants were eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: capable of giving informed consent; age ≥ 18 years; working diagnosis of renal colic (as determined by the treating clinician); and severe pain requiring intravenous analgesia, and ongoing pain at the time of consent.

A confirmed diagnosis of renal colic was not required for enrolment; this would have introduced a delay while investigations were undertaken.

Exclusion criteria can be seen in figure 1.

Figure 1
Exclusion criteria.

Randomisation

Participants were randomised, with an allocation ratio of 1:1 with no stratification, to one of two groups. A scratch card approach to randomisation was employed; this is reported in a separate manuscript.

Randomisation was based on a computer-generated randomisation list created using random permuted blocks of randomly varying size, prepared using NQuery Advisor software by an unblinded statistician and provided to the unblinded site pharmacists.

Interventions

The intervention group received salbutamol 250 µg, made up to 5 mL with 0.9% sodium chloride, presented as a clear, colourless solution and administered as a slow intravenous bolus over 3–5 min. The control group received 0.9% sodium chloride, presented as a clear, colourless solution and administered as a 5 mL slow intravenous bolus over 3–5 min.

Both groups also received the local usual care analgesic regimen at the treating clinician's discretion, with no restrictions or stipulations about timing, composition or dosing. This usually included paracetamol (oral or intravenous), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (oral ibuprofen or rectal diclofenac) and an opioid (usually intravenous morphine).

Blinding

Trial participants, treating clinicians, research nurses/practitioners collecting data, the trial statistician performing the analyses, the trial management group (TMG) and the trial steering committee (TSC) were blind to participant allocation.

### Comparison of the efficacy of diclofenac, acupuncture, and acetaminophen in the treatment of renal colic [^112dMQks]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective is to compare the analgesic effects of diclofenac, acetaminophen, and acupuncture in urolithiasis-driven renal colic pain relief.

Methods

Renal colic patients were divided randomly into 3 groups. Patients in group I (n = 40) were treated with intravenous acetaminophen, those in group II (n = 41) with acupuncture, and those in group III (n = 40) with a 75-mg intramuscular injection diclofenac sodium. Visual analogue scale (VAS) and verbal rating scale (VRS) were used to assess pain intensity after 10, 30, 60, and 120 minutes.

Results

No significant differences in baseline VAS or VRS were found with regard to age or sex. After 10 minutes, all 3 groups experienced a significant decrease in VAS and VRS scores, with the most drastic decrease occurring in group II. After 30 minutes, there was a significantly higher decrease in group III than in group I (P = 0.001). After 60 minutes, mean VAS scores of groups I and III (P = 0.753) were similar. The mean VAS score of group III was lower than that of group II (P = 0.013). After 120 minutes, the difference in the VAS scores was (P = 0.000) between groups I and II and between groups II and III. Yet, the VAS evaluation made after 120 minutes revealed statistically similar outcomes for groups I and III (P = 0.488). The statistical findings for VRS evaluations made after 10, 30, 60, and 120 were similar to those for VAS.

Conclusions

In renal colic patients with a possible nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and acetaminophen side effect risk, acupuncture emerges as an alternative treatment modality.

### Effectiveness of intravenous lidocaine versus intravenous morphine for patients with renal colic in the emergency department [^112cSwiB]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

Since renal colic pain caused by urinary stones is severe and sudden, an appropriate treatment is of great necessity. Narcotics have been considered as main treatment of renal colic for years; they relieve pain with central effects on narcotic receptors. Although narcotics have adequate effects, there is possibility of their being misused, excessive drowsiness, and other central nervous system and gastrointestinal complications.

Recently, the benefits of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) in renal colic have been reported suggesting them to be more effective compared to narcotic analgesics.

Renal colic pain is caused by endopelvic pressure and ureteral obstruction. Increase in renal blood flow following obstruction increases urine and endopelvic and ureter pressure. Prostaglandins cause increase in renal blood follow and smooth muscle spasm.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, inhibiting cyclooxygenase enzyme, relieve colic pain. Their pain relief mechanism however differentiates them from narcotic analgesics. NSAIDs can relieve pain locally and centrally inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.

In spite of the beneficial effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on pain, NSAIDs can reduce renal blood flow and ureter pressure in acute ureteral obstruction.

Therefore, because in our country (Iran), intravenous nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are not available, we thought of an alternative intravenous drug, i.e. lidocaine, whose analgesic effects on various pains (postoperative, cancer and etc.) have been proven.

Being an amino amide local anesthetic, Lidocaine blocks the voltage dependant sodium channels and impulses in axons. Lidocaine is a relatively safe medication, if used in low doses. Allergy to this drug however would increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia and dyspnea in rare cases. Most side effects are related to its cumulative effects including: perioral numbness, dizziness, confusion, feeling hangover, and impaired speech.

### Salbutamol for analgesia in renal colic: a prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled phase II trial [^112Ln4vD]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

The pain of renal colic, mediated in part by ureteral spasm and inflammation, is often severe and difficult to control. Salbutamol has been shown to cause ureteral relaxation, but its effects on the pain of renal colic have never been studied. The objective of this trial was to investigate whether the use of intravenous salbutamol in addition to standard analgesia was associated with greater pain reduction compared with standard analgesia alone in patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs) with renal colic.

Methods

This single-centre, double-blind, phase II, randomised, placebo-controlled trial recruited adult (≥ 18 years) ED patients with clinically suspected renal colic. Participants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 250 µg of intravenous salbutamol or a placebo (0.9% sodium chloride). The primary outcome was the difference in the change in pain scores (measured on a 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale) from baseline to 30 min following trial treatment administration in participants with subsequently confirmed renal colic. A modified intention-to-treat analysis was undertaken for the primary population of participants with confirmed renal colic.

Results

Consent was obtained from 151 patients; 108 participants with confirmed renal colic were included in the primary outcome analysis. There was no statistical difference between groups in median change in pain score at 30 min (salbutamol group −18 mm (IQR −25 to −3), placebo group −13 mm (IQR −33 to −1), difference 5 mm (95% CI −16 to 6, p = 0.575)). No significant differences were found in the secondary outcomes related to pain, patient satisfaction or opiate requirement.

More adverse events (AEs) were observed in the salbutamol group (65) compared with placebo (42, p = 0.02); no unexpected AEs were identified.

Conclusions

This trial has not identified a clinically or statistically significant benefit from the addition of intravenous salbutamol to standard care for patients presenting to an ED with pain caused by renal colic.

Trial registration numbers

The trial was registered with the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT), reference 2018–004305–11. It was also registered with the ISRCTN Registry, reference 14552440.

### Local active warming: an effective treatment for pain, anxiety and nausea caused by renal colic [^116mz8Mo]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Based on previous studies showing that warming decreases trauma pain in emergency care we hypothesized that local active warming of the abdomen and lower back region could decrease pain in acute renal colic cases during emergency transport.

Materials and Methods

After obtaining informed consent 100 patients were divided into 2 groups, including those who received active warming of the abdomen and lower back region (42C) and those who received no warming. Pain, nausea and anxiety were rated by the patients using visual analog scales. Statistical evaluation was performed using the t test with p < 0.05 considered significant.

Results

In group 1 a significant pain decrease was recorded in all cases using a visual analog score (VAS) (82.7 ± 9.5 to 36.3 ± 16.0 mm VAS, p < 0.01). In group 2 patient pain scores remained comparable (81.8 ± 13.0 to 80.6 ± 12.3 mm VAS). In group 1 anxiety significantly decreased (79.0 ± 8.9 and 30.7 ± 14.1 mm VAS before and after treatment, respectively, p < 0.01). In group 2 a nonsignificant change in score was noted (79.7 ± 20.5 to 75.2 ± 19.7 mm VAS). In group 1 a significant decrease in nausea was recorded in all cases (85.7 ± 11.2 to 40.6 ± 23.0 mm VAS, p < 0.01). In group 2 patient nausea scores remained comparable (79.2 ± 22.0 to 80.3 ± 22.4 mm VAS, respectively).

Conclusions

Local active warming is an effective and easy to learn pain treatment for patients with acute renal colic in emergency care.

### Transversus abdominis plane block: a new method in renal colic pain management [^113XQy8c]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In recent decades, regional plane blocks via ultrasonography have become very popular in regional anesthesia and are more commonly used in pain management. The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a procedure where local anesthetics are applied to block the anterior divisions of the tenth thoracic intercostal through the first lumbar nerves (T10-L1) into the anatomic space formed amidst the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles located in the antero-lateral part of the abdomen wall. The most important advantage of this block method is that ultrasonographic identification is easier and its complications are fewer compared with central neuroaxial or paravertebral blocks. Here, we describe three cases where pain management in renal colic was treated with the TAP block.

Trials of acupuncture for specific kinds of acute back pain also illuminate its potential. An SRM on acute pain in the ED that included three trials of acupuncture for renal colic found acupuncture to be as effective as medication with fewer side effects (n = 38), making it a potent option for immediate renal colic pain while avoiding the risks of NSAIDs or acetaminophen (n = 121). Acupuncture was as effective as Dolantin (meperidine) but superior to Scopolamine (hyoscine) in another trial on renal colic (n = 240), with onset time to pain relief significantly earlier for acupuncture and with greatly reduced adverse reactions. Since the 2017 SRM, another trial (n = 115) found acupuncture to be superior to titrated morphine for renal colic in the ED, with significantly sooner onset of pain relief (50% reduction), deeper pain relief, and greatly reduced adverse effects.

### Usefulness of nefopam in treating pain of severe uncomplicated renal colics in adults admitted to emergency units: a randomised double-blind controlled trial. the 'INCoNU' study [^115vWcxz]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Renal colic pain is a frequent cause of emergency department admissions (1–2% of admissions). It is extremely painful, often requiring intravenous morphine titration. The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of adding nefopam to ketoprofen upon subsequent morphine consumption and the time needed to achieve adequate analgesia in renal colic.

Methods

The authors undertook a prospective, monocentric, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, using an intent-to-treat analysis. Patients admitted to the emergency department for suspected hyperalgesic (evaluated with a visual analogue scale (VAS)) renal colic were enrolled in the study. They were administered an initial treatment of ketoprofen before being randomly assigned to either the placebo or nefopam group.

Results

Thirty patients admitted to the emergency department were enrolled in the study. Morphine analgesia was necessary for 10 patients (66.6%) (95% CI 40% to 90%) in the nefopam group and 8 (53.3%) (95% CI 30% to 80%) in the placebo group, with no statistically significant difference found (difference 13.3%, 95% CI -51% to 24%). The time needed to achieve adequate analgesia in the case of morphine titration was 8.3 min (95% CI 4.2 to 12.5) in the nefopam group and 9 min (95% CI 2.7 to 15.3) in the placebo group, with no statistically significant difference (difference 0.7, 95% CI 7.25 to 8.58).

Conclusion

This study did not reveal any significant difference between nefopam and placebo. This may be due to lack of statistical power or lack of effectiveness.

### Metoclopramide for analgesia in renal colic: a narrative systematic review [^114gjZ9k]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Metoclopramide, a prokinetic antiemetic with activity at multiple receptor types, may be a useful treatment for renal colic pain. This review investigated whether metoclopramide is an effective analgesic in the management of adults with renal colic. Eligible studies were randomised, quasi-randomised or case-control trials of metoclopramide for the management renal colic pain. Electronic database searches were performed in November 2022. Screening was performed by two authors independently; disagreement was resolved by discussion or by adjudication by a third author. The Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool v2.0 was used to assess bias. Two studies were included, enrolling 279 patients. Heterogeneity of primary outcome measurement and comparators rendered meta-analysis inappropriate; a narrative review is presented. Both studies showed some evidence of analgesic effect. The largest study had a low risk of bias in all assessed domains, whilst the smaller study was at a high risk of bias. There is limited evidence that metoclopramide may be an effective analgesic in the management of renal colic, with the highest quality study demonstrating analgesic properties similar to an intravenous non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication. Protocol registration Prospero (CRD42022346618).

Baloglu Kaya et al. (2015)

The authors compared 10mg intravenous metoclopramide as a sole analgesic agent to a combination of metoclopramide and 20mg intravenous tenoxicam, and to tenoxicam alone, for the relief of pain in emergency department patients aged 18–65 with clinically suspected or radiologically proven renal colic. Participants were block randomised with a block size of 1 and a ratio of 1:1:1 by a well-described, simple manual approach to allocation concealment (pulling their group allocation out of a bag.) The study was double blind, with placebo medication used to maintain blinding in the sole agent groups.

Pain was measured on a 100mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at baseline, 10, 20 and 30 minutes after trial medication administration.

They screened 397 patients and randomised 240 participants, with appropriate sample size calculations presented for a superiority study. There were no significant differences in participant baseline characteristics or pain scores.

All groups had a reduction in pain score at all time points compared to baseline, and this reduction increased with time. There was a statistically significant difference between groups at the 20min time point, with the greatest pain relief occurring in the combined tenoxicam and metoclopramide group. There was no statistically significant difference between groups at the other time points. Pain relief in the groups can be seen in Table 1.

Mean reduction in pain scores compared to baseline in each of the three study groups

No data were available for any of the secondary outcome measures, and no response to attempted contact with the corresponding author was received

Limitations

There was no mandated radiological confirmation of diagnosis, and no details were given concerning the number of participants with radiological confirmation; multiple approaches to adjudicating the diagnosis were described, including clinical suspicion, urinalysis, ultrasound and CT.

The authors describe the possibility that participants could have received opiate medication prior to randomisation; this is not quantified or further assessed.

There was a very long interval between data collection and manuscript publication (6 years); the reason for this is not clear.

### Best evidence topic report: can intradermal sterile water injections provide effective pain relief in patients with renal colic? [^111iALqo]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

A short systematic review was undertaken to assess whether intradermal sterile water injections (ISWI) provide effective pain relief in adult patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with renal colic. MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane and Google Scholar databases were searched, identifying seven relevant studies. Study information, patient characteristics, key results and methodological weaknesses were tabulated. Our results indicate that ISWI provides rapid and effective pain relief within the first 15–30min, comparable to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with fewer adverse effects. The short follow-up periods, exclusion of more comorbid patients and variability in study design limit the generalisability of the findings. Further research is needed to establish the long-term effectiveness of ISWI in the management of renal colic in the ED.

### Kidney stones and the opioid epidemic: recent developments and review of the literature [^112RLbFg]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A public health emergency has been declared in response to rising opioid addiction and opioid-related deaths in the United States. As kidney stones have been identified as an important source of initial and repeated opioid exposures, this review seeks to describe the scope of the problem and report relevant alternatives to opioid analgesia for stones.

Recent Findings

Recent literature summarizing the extent of opioid use among those with stones is reviewed. A number of opioid-minimizing strategies and analgesic regimens have been proposed and studied. A review of these modifications and alternatives is provided.

Summary

Both symptomatic renal colic and surgical interventions to address stones may prompt need for analgesia. Reducing prescribed opioids reduces both patient use and risk of diversion. Modifications in surgical technique, administration of local anesthetics, and use of systemic nonopioid analgesics have all been successfully employed.

### Effectiveness of intravenous lidocaine versus intravenous morphine for patients with renal colic in the emergency department [^114Buvki]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the fact that numerous medications have been introduced to treat renal colic, none has been proven to relieve the pain rapidly and thoroughly. In this study, we aimed at comparing the effects of intravenous lidocaine versus intravenous morphine in patients suffering from renal colic.

Methods

In a prospective randomized double-blind clinical trial performed in the emergency department of Imam Reza educational hospital of Tabriz, Iran, we studied 240 patients, 18–65years old, who were referred due to renal colic. Patients were divided into two groups. In group I (120 people) single-dose intravenous lidocaine (1.5mg/kg) was administered and in group II (120 people) single-dose intravenous morphine (0.1mg/kg) was administered slowly. Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS) was recorded while admission, 5, 10, 15 and 30 minutes after injection. Statistical data and results were studied using descriptive statistics as percentage and Mean ± SD. To compare the response to treatment, Mann-Whitney U-test was used in two groups. Consequently, the data were analyzed using the SPSS16 software.

Results

Pain score measured in two groups five minutes after the injection of lidocaine and morphine were 65% and 53% respectively (95% CI 0.60–0.69, CI 0.48–0.57, p = 0.0002).108 (90%) patients (95% CI 0.84–0.95) from group I and 84 (70%) patients (95% CI 0.62–0.78) from group II responded appropriately at the end of the complete treatment. The difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0001).

Conclusions

Changing the smooth muscle tone and reducing the transmission of afferent sensory pathways, lidocaine causes a significant reduction in pain.

### Consensus guidelines on the use of intravenous ketamine infusions for chronic pain from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, and the American society of anesthesiologists [^113ZivXy]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Opioid-tolerant and high-risk populations — evidence summaries note that "the studies suggest at least mild benefit for ketamine in the opioid-tolerant population, and the committee strongly believes this benefit may be moderate". Opioid-dependent nonsurgical patients "might benefit from ketamine during acute exacerbations of chronic pain conditions", and in sickle cell disease, "several case reports suggest that ketamine improves analgesia in adults as well as children". One case involved "close to 5000 mg of daily oral morphine equivalents" with baseline hospital pain ratings "7–10 out of 10", followed by "a 7-day ketamine infusion" with discharge pain "6 out of 10 in the hip and 4 out of 10 in all other joints". However, "no RCTs have examined ketamine use in this context". Additional anecdotal settings include "postendoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis pain, renal colic, and exacerbation of central pain from Ehlers–Danlos syndrome". Ketamine may also be relevant for those "at increased risk for opioid-related respiratory depression, such as those with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)", although "its effect on the incidence of respiratory depression is less clear".

### Effectiveness of intravenous lidocaine versus intravenous morphine for patients with renal colic in the emergency department [^113bBtH2]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Notice

All the processes of injection and filling in the questionnaires were performed by another person who was a specialist (not involved in research project) and blinded to the injected drug as well as the patients groupings. Patients were blinded to the injected medications as well. The doses required for the administered medication were calculated by another colleague. Hence; neither the patients nor the administrator were aware of the medications used.

Consequently, 5, 10, 15 and 30 minutes after injection, incidence of pain in patients was recorded based on Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Statistical data and results were expressed using descriptive statistics as percentage and Mean ± SD. To compare the response to treatment, statistical Mann–Whitney U -test was performed in two groups. Kolmogroff Smirnov test was used for normality of variables and QQ plot test was used in cases of necessity. The data were analyzed using the SPSS16 software.

### Approaching acute pain in emergency settings; European Society for Emergency Medicine (EUSEM) guidelines-part 2: management and recommendations [^114p72Y5]. Internal and Emergency Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute pain, more specifically with respect to patients with fractures, EUSEM 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- NSAIDs have been suggested to prolong bone healing in patients with bone fracture, but the evidence is conflicting as is the data in tendon injury

- skeletal traction is a common method for preoperative fracture stabilization and pain control in patients with femoral shaft and acetabular fractures, and it has been suggested to reduce pain scores during immobilization of isolated femur fractures

- appropriate positioning in complex fractures, for example with a back slab for wrist/arm fractures, can alleviate pain and is widely recommended

- peripheral nerve block provides rapid reduction in pain within 30 min with a low risk of adverse effects in patients with hip fracture in the emergency department

-, while reducing the requirement for opioids

- intra-articular lidocaine has demonstrated comparable analgesia to IV analgesia/sedation in patients with acute shoulder dislocation, with a shorter duration of hospitalization and lower risk of complications

- IV lidocaine has demonstrated efficacy in patients with renal colic, with a faster onset to pain relief and greater pain relief than IV morphine

- IV lidocaine and lidocaine patches provide effective analgesia in patients with acute traumatic extremity pain

- and rib fracture.

### Intravenous lidocaine compared with quadratus lumborum block on postoperative analgesia following laparoscopic renal surgery: protocol for a randomized noninferiority trial [^114JsNLt]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients undergoing laparoscopic renal surgery often experience significant postoperative pain. Quadratus lumborum block (QLB) provides effective postoperative pain control after laparoscopic procedures, while lidocaine administered intravenously also exerts analgesic effects for surgical patients. We design this trial to compare the effects of i.v. lidocaine infusion with QLB on postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing laparoscopic renal surgery.

Methods

In this randomized noninferiority trial, a total of 120 adult patients undergoing laparoscopic renal surgery will be randomized to receive either i.v. lidocaine or unilateral QLB for postoperative pain management. Lidocaine will be i.v. administered at 1.5 mg/kg (ideal body weight) over 10 min during anesthesia induction, followed by an infusion of 1.5 mg/kg/h intraoperatively and in a post-anesthesia care unit. Ultrasound-guided anterior QLB with 0.375% ropivacaine 30 mL will be conducted before the start of surgery. Patient-controlled i.v. sufentanil will be used for pain relief during the first 48 h after surgery. The primary outcome is the cumulative sufentanil consumption during 0–24 h postoperatively, with a noninferiority margin of 5 μg. Secondary outcomes include pain intensity at rest and on coughing at 1, 6, 24, and 48 h postoperatively; sufentanil consumption within 24–48 h after surgery; rescue analgesic use within 0–48 h after surgery; nausea and vomiting within 0–48 h postoperatively; and quality of recovery at 24 and 48 h after surgery.

Discussion

The results of this trial will add to the clinical evidence for improving postoperative pain management in patients who undergo laparoscopic renal surgery.

Acupuncture for renal colic analgesia — acceptability and efficacy signals are reported. A prospective study without randomization and using a historical control group found acupuncture acceptable to emergency department patients with diverse pain locations/etiologies, including 58.5% musculoskeletal and 24.5% abdominal or flank. An unblinded randomized controlled trial comparing acupuncture to acetaminophen IV or diclofenac intramuscular for renal colic found acupuncture to be non-inferior for pain control within 120 min, with mean visual analog scale (VAS) changes of 9.3 to 2.1 for acetaminophen, 9.0 to 4.5 for acupuncture, and 8.8 to 2.8 for diclofenac.

### Comparing intravenous lidocaine and pethidine for pain management in emergency department patients with femoral bone fracture: a randomized controlled trial [^1159VVCk]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study demonstrates that both pethidine and lidocaine significantly reduce acute pain severity in patients with femoral bone fractures. There was no significant difference in pain severity at different time points after treatment administration between the two groups. Additionally, the occurrence of treatment adverse events was similar between the two groups. Furthermore, our findings suggest that female gender is associated with an increased need for rescue analgesic.

Opioids such as morphine, pethidine, oxycodone, and hydrocodone are the mainstay of acute pain management in the emergency department. However, the growing misuse of opioids is a significant concern. Previous research has indicated that intravenous lidocaine may be beneficial in managing acute pain in patients with renal colic and critical limb ischemia, potentially even more potent than morphine. Our study demonstrates that continuous intravenous lidocaine administration (within 20 min) significantly reduces pain in femoral bone fractures, with analgesic properties similar to intravenous pethidine. Lidocaine has been shown to possess anti-hyperalgesic, analgesic, and anti-nociceptive effects. However, the precise analgesic mechanism of intravenous lidocaine remains incompletely understood. Several mechanisms may play a role, such as the inhibition of potassium, sodium, and calcium channels, glutamate receptors, and G-protein-coupled receptors. Moreover, intravenous lidocaine may involve the inhibition of transient receptor potential channels, hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, acid-sensing ion channels, acetylcholine receptors, serotonin receptors, among others. It appears that the analgesic effect of intravenous lidocaine is a multifactorial phenomenon, and no definitive single molecular mechanism has been identified.

Farahmand et al. evaluated the efficacy of intravenous lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg) in 50 patients with extremity trauma in the emergency department with a pain score (NRS) higher than 4. They found that lidocaine can be an effective analgesic in traumatic patients, with its analgesic effect similar to intravenous morphine (0.1 mg/kg). Additionally, Forouzan et al. investigated the efficacy of intravenous lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg) in patients with extremity fractures and found that it could significantly reduce pain in these patients. However, they did not specify the type of fracture. Our findings were consistent with the mentioned studies; however, we utilized a larger sample size, which increases the power of our study, and we specified the type of fracture (femoral bone fracture).

### Effectiveness of intravenous lidocaine versus intravenous morphine for patients with renal colic in the emergency department [^113fVLkh]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

All patients aged 18 to 65 years, and did not have history of renal, hepatic or cardiac disease (Ischemic Heart Disease).

Patients with history of allergy to lidocaine and morphine, an inability or unwillingness to provide written informed consent and pregnant females were excluded from the study as well. Patients whose pain did not relieve using lidocaine or morphine were administered supplementary drugs. Then, method of drug administration, the reason for prescription and possible complications were explained to the patients and it was emphasized that using either lidocaine or morphine is safe.

After explaining method of treatment and obtaining informed written consent, 12 lead electrocardiograms were taken from all patients to make sure no history of heart diseases existed. Later, patients were monitored by an emergency medicine specialist throughout the procedure. Additionally patients were asked to identify the degree of their pain using Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS), zero represented painless and 10 was the worst experienced pain. Vital signs and other symptoms of patients including nausea, vomiting, dysuria, hematuria, and etc. were recorded. Firstly, all the enrolled patients received intravenous metoclopramide (0.15 mg/kg). Later, to reduce pain in patients suffering from renal colic in group I lidocaine solution (1.5 mg/kg) and in group II morphine solution (0.1 mg/kg) were administered intravenously slowly (Each syringe contained 10 mL of solution, either 10 mg of morphine or 200 mg of lidocaine %2 (1 mL = 20 mg)). The trial was considered accomplished when either the patient had a pain score of less than 3 for 30 minutes after the last analgesic dose or the 10 mL of solution in the syringe was used up.

As fluid therapy is not commonly used in our center to treat patients with renal colic and it is restored only for patients who are dehydrated or have sepsis, our patients received very little amount of fluid, (10 mL) administered only by injection.

### Effectiveness of intravenous lidocaine versus intravenous morphine for patients with renal colic in the emergency department [^1148bMfK]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Affecting 1–5% of the population in industrialized countries, renal colic is considered as a major concern in medicine. Renal colic has been reported to be experienced by 20% of white males and 5–10% of white females. The classic presentation of acute renal colic includes sudden pain onset radiating from the flank to the lower extremities which is usually accompanied by microscopic hematuria (85% of cases), nausea and vomiting. Costovertebral angle tenderness is a common finding as well.

To relieve the pain until being discharged or undergoing the required operation is mostly performed in emergency departments. To achieve this, numerous medications including antiemetics, narcotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antispasmodics, anti-diuretics, ketorolac, nifedipine, prednisone, acetaminophen and prochlorperazine have been introduces.

Lidocaine, being an appropriate choice in treating visceral and central pain, might also be useful wherever narcotics are inefficient or lead to undesirable side effects. Intravenous lidocaine is effective in controlling neuropathic pains such as: diabetic neuropathy, post-operative pain, post-herpetic pain, headaches and neurological malignancies. Therefore we aimed at investigating and reviewing the analgesic effects of intravenous lidocaine compared with intravenous morphine in patients with renal colic.

### Best evidence topic report. rectal or intravenous non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in acute renal colic [^1149grpp]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2005). Low credibility.

A short cut review was carried out to establish whether rectal non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are as effective as IV NSAIDs in the management of acute renal colic. Altogether 179 papers were found using the reported search, of which two represent the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these best papers are tabulated. Rectal NSAIDs are an effective form of analgesia for patients with acute renal colic and have fewer side effects compared with intravenous NSAIDs.

### Acupuncture versus lornoxicam in the treatment of acute renal colic: a randomized controlled trial [^1164TsNG]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The worldwide incidence of kidney stones is 114 to 720 per 100,000, with a prevalence of 1.7% to 14.8%, and this prevalence is increasing year by year. The ongoing challenge of growing members of kidney stone disease (KSD) has been proven to link to global warming, with a major component, rising temperature, contributing to a 24–84% increase in stone presentation as well as an increase of 1.6 to 2.2 million urolithiasis cases over a lifetime in the United States by 2050.KSD results in huge medical bills–for example, a total cost of £190–324 million in an acute or surgical treatment caused by upper tract stones in the UK, equivalent to the cost of prostate and bladder cancer combined in 2018. Acute renal colic (ARC) is a common complication of renal-ureteral calculi, causing 7–9% of all emergency department visits, excluding trauma patients. Pain relief is the primary goal with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) recommended as first-line treatment for patients with an acute stone episode. Beyond that, adverse events of NSAIDs such as nausea, vomiting, and even allergic reactions, kidney failure, or gastrointestinal bleeding may offset the benefit–an utmost concern raised by health-care officials. In addition, opioids, alpha blockers, spasmodic drugs, and surgery are also recommended to treat ARC, but opioids drugs may have some adverse reactions and abuse problems, and surgery is very expensive.

Previous studies have ascertained that acupuncture is effective in chronic pain relief, superior to placebos, with improved patient satisfaction, lower costs, and fewer adverse reactions. However, insufficient evidence from sparse data of acupuncture's effect on ARC lead to a growing demand for relevant RCTs. Therefore, we conducted a rigorous RCT that compared the efficacy and safety of acupuncture versus lornoxicam, an NSAID with analgesic property, in ARC.

### Is there a role for antimuscarinics in renal colic? A randomized controlled trial [^117Y39LP]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

We determined whether the addition of hyoscine butylbromide (Buscopan) reduces the amount of opioid analgesia required and the need for ongoing opioid analgesia in acute renal colic.

Materials and Methods

Patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute renal colic were prospectively randomized to receive Buscopan or placebo in addition to morphine and intravenous fluids, with or without indomethacin. Observations and pain scores were recorded 15 every minutes during the first hour then hourly thereafter. Morphine was administered in 2.5 mg increments until pain relief was achieved. Recordings were ceased at 4 hours or on discharge from the emergency department, whichever occurred first. The diagnosis of renal colic was confirmed by computerized tomography. The dose of morphine (mg/kg) and the proportion of patients who required further morphine were compared between the 2 groups.

Results

Of the 192 patients randomized, data were available for 178 on an intent to treat basis. A total of 85 patients received Buscopan while 93 received placebo in addition to standard therapy. Patients in the Buscopan group required a median of 0.12 mg/kg of morphine while those in the placebo group received a median of 0.11 mg/kg, and this difference was not significant (p = 0.4). There was also no significant difference in the proportion of patients who required additional morphine, 33% in the Buscopan group and 38% in the placebo group (p = 0.5). Subgroup analysis of the 138 patients with a confirmed stone also showed no difference between the groups.

Conclusions

There is no evidence that Buscopan reduces opioid requirements or the need for ongoing opioid analgesia in acute renal colic.

GRACE-2 — Indirect pharmacologic evidence summarized for abdominal pain notes that although specific abdominal pain pathologies such as renal colic and biliary colic were not the target population, NSAIDs appear similar in efficacy to opioids for renal and biliary colic. In renal colic, a meta-analysis (20 studies, 1613 patients) found no clinically significant difference in analgesia between opioids and NSAIDs (MD -10.5, 95% CI -19.9 to -1.1 on a 0–100 VAS), with less need for rescue medication (19% vs. 25%, RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.93) and less vomiting (6% vs. 20%, RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.53) for NSAIDs; another meta-analysis (37 studies, 4483 patients) showed NSAIDs were more effective than placebo for 50% pain reduction within 60 min (65% vs. 27%, RR 2.28, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.51), lowered rescue medication use versus placebo (23% vs. 67%, RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.60), and reduced pain more than antispasmodics (estimated VAS mean 33 vs. 46, MD -13.0, 95% CI -21.8 to -4.1).

### A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and paracetamol in the treatment of acute renal colic [^115fEiCk]. European Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Context

Renal colic is a common, acute presentation of urolithiasis that requires immediate pain relief. European Association of Urology guidelines recommend nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as the preferred analgesia. However, the fear of NSAID adverse effects and the uncertainty about superior analgesic effect have maintained the practice of advocating intravenous opioids as the initial analgesia.

Objective

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare the safety and efficacy of NSAIDs with opioids and paracetamol (acetaminophen) for the management of acute renal colic.

Evidence Acquisition

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Google Scholar, and the reference list of retrieved articles were searched up to December 2016 without language restrictions. Two reviewers independently assessed eligible studies using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing and reporting the risk of bias and abstracted data using predefined data fields.

Evidence Synthesis

From 468 potentially relevant studies, 36 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 4887 patients, published between 1982 and 2016, were included in this systematic review. The treatment effect observed indicated marginal benefit of NSAIDs over opioids in initial pain reduction at 30min (11 RCTs, n = 1985, mean difference [MD] -5.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] -10.22 to -0.95; heterogeneity I² = 81%). In the subgroup analyses by the route of administration, NSAIDs required fewer rescue treatments (seven RCTs, n = 541, number needed to treat [NNT] 11, 95% CI 6–75) and had lower vomiting rates compared with opioids (five RCTs, n = 531, NNT 5, 95% CI 4–8). Comparisons of NSAIDs with paracetamol showed no difference for both drugs at 30min (four RCTs, n = 1325, MD -5.67, 95% CI -17.52 to 6.18, p = 0.35; I² = 89%). Patients treated with NSAIDs required fewer rescue treatments (two trials, n = 1145, risk ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.42–0.74, p < 0.001; I² = 0%).

Conclusions

NSAIDs were equivalent to opioids or paracetamol in the relief of acute renal colic pain at 30min. There was less vomiting and fewer requirements for rescue analgesia with NSAIDs compared with opioids. Patients treated with NSAIDs required less rescue analgesia compared with paracetamol. Despite observed heterogeneity among the included studies and the overall quality of evidence, the findings of a lower need for rescue analgesia and fewer adverse events, in conjunction with the practical advantages of ease of delivery, suggest that NSAIDs should be the preferred analgesic option for patients presenting to the emergency department with renal colic.

Patient Summary

In kidney stone-related acute pain episodes in patients with adequate renal function, treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs offers effective and most sustained pain relief, with fewer side effects, when compared with opioids or paracetamol.

### Effectiveness of intravenous lidocaine versus intravenous morphine for patients with renal colic in the emergency department [^113zVuZW]. BMC Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Lidocaine is an effective and cheap drug with few side effects including dizziness, nausea and constipation. Prevalence of these complications however is less with lidocaine compared to narcotics and other analgesics.

On the other hand, side effects of lidocaine are predictable with a wide range of confidence. Due to the low half life, toxicity symptoms of lidocaine are transient and rapidly reversible. Based on the results of Rebecca Ferrini's study on 100 patients, in most patients having received narcotics infusion of intravenous lidocaine was effective when the pain was central or visceral, and even when narcotics were not effective or accompanied unwanted and unacceptable complications, intravenous lidocaine could be useful.

In the study of Nicky Forov et al. on a pregnant woman with resistant renal colic, subcutaneous paravertebral nerve block was performed using lidocaine, in this study patient's pain relieved considerably. In our other case series study, from 8 patients suffering from renal colic resistant to treatment (morphine and NSAIDS), intravenous lidocaine relieved the pain in 7 patients significantly with no considerable complications.

Other case studies have also been reported regarding using lidocaine in relieving pain in cancerous and renal colic patients. In a similar study carried out by Rebecca Ferrini et al. A single dose of lidocain was administered for reducing pain resistant to morphine in a patient suffering from primary neuroectodermal tumor. The patient had received other complementary medicines, in addition to morphine, such as: gabapentin, baclofen, amitriptyline, clonidine and clonazepam. Patient's pain however considerably relieved after using a single dose of lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg).

The only study which can be compared with ours regarding considerable pain reduction in short time is a study carried out by Mansuri Igochi et al. in which local injection of lidocaine in the most painful point was used in patients suffering from renal colic (control group received scopolamine). Considering response to treatment, lidocaine was more effective than scopolamine.

Fortunately, in our study no serious or life threatening complications were observed in patients of lidocaine group, therefore our study is similar to the study of Rebecca Ferrini et al.

Lidocaine causes change in sympathetic smooth muscle tone through reducing the transmission of afferent sensory pathways. Intravenous lidocaine causes considerable reduction in pain and can be a suitable alternative for cases in which narcotics are ineffective or associated with undesirable complications.
