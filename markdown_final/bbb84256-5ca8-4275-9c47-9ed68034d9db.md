## Question

Explain to patient TSH is low normal and doesn't require higher dose TSH 0.46 free t41.8 when he is conplaining of weight gajn and hugher glhcose

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to explain to a patient that thyroid labs showing TSH 0.46 mIU/L (low-normal) and free T4 1.8 ng/dL do not warrant a higher levothyroxine dose, and to address the patient's concerns about weight gain and higher blood sugar. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to interpret these thyroid tests and define euthyroidism in treated hypothyroidism. Then, I should verify the risks of pushing the dose higher, including subclinical hyperthyroidism and its downstream consequences. Next, I will examine whether dose escalation affects weight or metabolic outcomes. After that, I should consider glycemic control and whether it responds to thyroid dose changes in the euthyroid range. I will also reflect on the concept of an individual thyroid set point and how that guides personalized targets. Finally, I will outline practical next steps and monitoring that prioritize safety and evidence-based care.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical status. A TSH of 0.46 mIU/L sits at the low end of the common reference interval, and a free T4 of 1.8 ng/dL is at the upper end of typical assay ranges; wait, let me verify the specific lab's reference limits, but assuming these values are within that lab's normals, the pattern indicates biochemical euthyroidism on replacement, and in treated primary hypothyroidism, TSH remains the single best biomarker to titrate levothyroxine because of the log-linear TSH–fT4 relationship and guideline targets anchored to the population reference interval [^111Wrp1V] [^111cpkBq].

> Hold on, I should verify the treatment goal. Contemporary guidance recommends adjusting levothyroxine to achieve a TSH within the population reference range and cautions against fine, frequent dose "tweaks" once the target TSH is achieved, because such adjustments have not been shown to improve quality of life or body weight; I need to ensure I am not conflating unusual scenarios like central hypothyroidism where TSH is unreliable, but in primary hypothyroidism TSH targeting remains appropriate here [^111cpkBq].

> Now, I will examine the risk side if we increase the dose. If levothyroxine is increased and TSH drifts below 0.1 mIU/L, that meets criteria for subclinical hyperthyroidism, which is linked to higher risks of atrial fibrillation, reduced bone mineral density, fractures, and cardiac dysfunction; wait, let me double-check thresholds and outcomes — multiple reviews consistently associate TSH < 0.1 mIU/L with these adverse endpoints, so the risk signal is clinically meaningful and not just biochemical [^111CgtxG] [^116SUZCg] [^116xmsiu].

> Next, I should review whether a higher levothyroxine dose helps with weight. The evidence does not support levothyroxine dose escalation as a weight-loss strategy once TSH is normal; randomized dose-adjustment data show that shifting TSH across low-normal to higher-normal (and even mildly elevated) ranges yields no clinically important changes in energy expenditure or body composition, and guidelines explicitly advise that micro-adjustments after reaching target TSH do not improve body weight or QoL; in fact, professional guidelines advise against using thyroid hormone to treat obesity in euthyroid patients, which aligns with the mechanistic and clinical data here [^116SQwNu] [^111cpkBq] [^1169dWir].

> Let me consider the common misconception about "undertreatment" when weight is hard to control. Patients often regain weight after transitioning from hyperthyroidism to euthyroidism, and cohort data show an increased risk of obesity after hyperthyroidism treatment, reflecting return toward premorbid weight rather than inadequate replacement; I should confirm not to over-interpret these observations for all hypothyroid contexts, but they reinforce that weight trajectories are multifactorial and not reliably altered by pushing LT4 above what physiology requires [^113YxfFr].

> I should now address glucose control. In the euthyroid range, altering levothyroxine dosing has minimal impact on energy expenditure and related metabolic endpoints, and there is no reliable evidence that raising LT4 within or just below the normal TSH range improves glycemia; therefore, hyperglycemia warrants its own work-up and management pathway, rather than thyroid dose escalation — let me be clear that obesity and metabolic syndrome guidelines also discourage manipulating thyroid hormones to address weight or metabolic risk in euthyroid individuals, which supports separating the diabetes evaluation from thyroid dosing decisions [^116SQwNu] [^116KaxmC].

> But wait, what if this TSH 0.46 mIU/L is "too low" for this particular patient's set point. I need to think about individual variability: there is inter-individual diversity in thyroid axis set points and in the interpretation of population reference intervals, so the mantra "treat patients, not numbers" applies, provided we stay within evidence-based safety bounds; still, because TSH here is within the reference interval and fT4 is not frankly elevated, the balance of evidence favors maintaining the current replacement dose rather than chasing symptom relief with supraphysiologic dosing [^1117izyA] [^111Wrp1V].

> Next, I should review practical steps that are safer and more likely to help. I need to check for transient assay or absorption confounders and, if any changes are suspected, retest before altering dose; if clinically stable, recheck thyroid function in several months, not weeks, to confirm persistence; in parallel, address weight and glycemia with standard approaches, including nutrition, physical activity, medication review that might promote weight gain or dysglycemia, and appropriate diabetes screening, all of which are recommended over manipulating LT4 in a euthyroid patient; I should confirm levothyroxine administration technique and interacting agents as well, since dose creep without need can increase adverse risk without metabolic benefit [^113AV4mB] [^114VwJPF] [^116KaxmC].

> In summary, the current labs indicate biochemical euthyroidism on replacement, and increasing levothyroxine would be unlikely to improve weight or blood sugar while increasing the risk of subclinical hyperthyroidism with cardiovascular and skeletal harms; maintaining the present dose and shifting focus toward targeted evaluation of non-thyroid drivers of weight and glycemic control is the evidence-based and safer course, and I should double-check and monitor over time rather than making unnecessary dose changes now [^111cpkBq] [^111CgtxG] [^116SQwNu].

Your thyroid labs show a **TSH of 0.46** and **free T4 of 1.8**, both within the normal range [^116uLLpr], meaning your thyroid is working properly and does not explain weight gain or higher glucose. Increasing thyroid hormone when TSH is already low-normal can cause **harm**, including heart rhythm problems and bone loss [^111CgtxG], without proven benefit for weight [^1169dWir] or glucose control. Your symptoms are likely due to **other factors** such as diet, activity, or insulin resistance, so we should address those directly [^116KaxmC].

---

## Interpretation of thyroid function tests

A TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) of 0.46 mIU/L falls within the typical reference range (0.4–4.0 mIU/L) and indicates normal thyroid function. A free T4 (thyroxine) of 1.8 ng/dL is also normal (0.8–2.0 ng/dL), confirming adequate thyroid hormone levels. Together, these results indicate **euthyroidism** — normal thyroid function [^114JMDmQ].

---

## Relationship between thyroid function and weight gain

- **Thyroid hormones and metabolism**: Thyroid hormones regulate metabolism, and hypothyroidism can cause weight gain [^111oVG6n]. However, your normal thyroid levels mean your thyroid is not causing your weight gain.

- **Evidence from clinical studies**: Research shows that in patients with normal thyroid function, thyroid hormone therapy does not significantly affect weight or metabolism [^116SQwNu].

- **Guideline recommendations**: Guidelines advise against using thyroid hormones [^1169dWir] to treat obesity or weight gain in patients with normal thyroid function [^111cpkBq].

---

## Relationship between thyroid function and glucose metabolism

Although thyroid hormones influence glucose metabolism, normal thyroid levels make them an unlikely cause of higher glucose. There is no evidence that thyroid hormone therapy improves glucose control in euthyroid patients, and guidelines **do not recommend** its use for this purpose.

---

## Risks of increasing thyroid hormone dosage unnecessarily

- **Cardiovascular risks**: Excess thyroid hormone can cause heart rhythm problems, including atrial fibrillation and palpitations [^116SUZCg].

- **Bone health risks**: Excess thyroid hormone can cause bone loss and increase fracture risk [^111CgtxG].

- **Other risks**: Excess thyroid hormone can cause anxiety, insomnia, and other hyperthyroid symptoms [^116xmsiu].

---

## Alternative explanations for weight gain and higher glucose levels

Diet, physical inactivity, and stress can contribute to weight gain and elevated glucose. A common underlying driver in patients with normal thyroid function is **insulin resistance**. Certain medications can also promote weight gain and hyperglycemia [^116KaxmC].

---

## Recommended next steps

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Focus on healthy eating, regular physical activity, and weight management [^116KaxmC].

- **Glucose monitoring**: Regularly monitor glucose levels and discuss management strategies with your healthcare provider.

- **Further evaluation**: Consider evaluation for insulin resistance or other metabolic conditions that may explain your symptoms [^116KaxmC].

---

Your thyroid function is normal, so your symptoms are likely due to other factors. Increasing thyroid hormone is **not recommended** and could cause harm. Let's focus on lifestyle changes and evaluating other causes to address your weight and glucose concerns [^111cpkBq].

### Subclinical thyroid disease [^111CgtxG]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is characterized by an abnormal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level, with a reference range of 0.45 to 4.50 microU per mL, while free thyroxine and triiodothyronine levels remain within their reference ranges. The management of subclinical thyroid dysfunction is controversial. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism is approximately 4 to 8.5 percent and may reach as high as 20 percent in women over the age of 60. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is present in about 2 percent of the population.

Most national organizations recommend against routine screening of asymptomatic patients, though screening is advised for high-risk populations. There is strong evidence linking subclinical hypothyroidism with progression to overt disease. Patients with a TSH level exceeding 10 microU per mL exhibit a higher incidence of elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. However, evidence for other associations is lacking. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that treating subclinical hypothyroidism is beneficial.

A TSH level below 0.1 microU per mL is associated with progression to overt hyperthyroidism, atrial fibrillation, reduced bone mineral density, and cardiac dysfunction. Early treatment shows little evidence of altering the clinical course.

### ETA guidelines for the use of levothyroxine sodium preparations in monotherapy to optimize the treatment of hypothyroidism [^111cpkBq]. European Thyroid Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, particularly with respect to levothyroxine therapy and maintenance dosing, ETA 2025 guidelines recommend adjusting the dose of levothyroxine in patients with primary hypothyroidism to aim for a serum TSH level within the population reference interval. Once the target TSH is achieved, complicated regimens and minute adjustments of the levothyroxine dose should be avoided, as they are not useful for improving quality of life (QoL) or modulating body weight.

- **Reverse T3 measurements**: Unlike the active T4 metabolite T3, reverse T3 (rT3) is an inactive metabolite of T4 as it does not bind or compete with T3 at the T3 receptor. Measurement of rT3 is widely cited in the lay press as a potential marker to guide T4 or T3 therapy; however, there is currently no evidence to support this application. Serum rT3 typically rises as T3 falls during nonthyroidal illness; consequently, measurement of rT3 adds little to this diagnosis unless nonthyroidal illness is confounding the diagnosis of central hypothyroidism.

	- However, as rT3 assays are not widely available, measurement of T3 is more practical, cheaper, and as effective as measuring rT3 if nonthyroidal illness syndrome is suspected. Other uses of rT3 analysis and the calculation of the serum rT3/T3 ratio are confined to diagnosing rare genetic thyroid conditions and the diagnosis of the rare consumptive hypothyroidism syndrome due to the overexpression of deiodinase enzyme 3. Except for these three uncommon situations, there is no need to measure rT3 in routine clinical practice.

### Serum thyroid hormone balance in levothyroxine monotherapy-treated patients with atrophic thyroid after radioiodine treatment for Graves' disease [^114shraW]. Thyroid (2019). Low credibility.

In athyreotic or atrophic thyroid patients on LT4 after thyroidectomy or radioiodine treatment, patients with normal TSH levels had relatively low serum fT3 levels, whereas patients with mildly suppressed TSH levels had normal serum fT3 levels. The question arises as to which of these two patient groups is in a euthyroid condition. The extensive literature on "subclinical hyperthyroidism" has demonstrated an increased risk of atrial fibrillation, as well as low bone density and fractures in patients who have low TSH levels while receiving LT4.

Moreover, in athyreotic patients with normal TSH and low T3 levels, the relatively higher serum T4 levels that accompany LT4 monotherapy seem to result in normal T3 receptor occupancy and TSH in pituitary thyrotrophs. On the other hand, in peripheral tissues, the relatively higher serum T4 levels could impair intracellular T3 production via downregulation of D2. In fact, an animal study has shown that LT4 alone administered to thyroidectomized rats at doses to normalize plasma TSH levels does not normalize T3 contents in some tissues.

In another study of rats, Werneck et al. reported that a combination of high serum T4 and low serum T3 levels during T4 monotherapy had consequences for thyroid hormone action, as reflected in the brain, liver, and skeletal muscle, all of which exhibited indications of hypothyroidism despite normal serum TSH levels. In a previous study conducted in humans, we compared serum levels of lipoproteins, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and bone metabolic markers before and after thyroidectomy.

### Reference intervals in the diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction: Treating patients not numbers [^1117izyA]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

Although assigning a diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction appears quite simple, this is often not the case. Issues that make it unclear whether thyroid function is normal include transient changes in thyroid parameters, inter-individual and intra-individual differences in thyroid parameters, age-related differences, and ethnic variations. In addition, a statistically calculated distribution of thyroid analytes does not necessarily coincide with intervals or cutoffs that have predictive value for beneficial or adverse health outcomes. Based on clinical trial data, it is unclear which individuals with mild thyroid-stimulating hormone elevations will benefit from levothyroxine treatment. For example, only a small number of patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone values of more than 10 mIU/L have been studied in a randomized manner. Even if therapy is initiated for abnormal thyroid function, not all treated individuals are maintained at the desired treatment target and therefore might still be at risk. The consequence of this is that each patient's thyroid function needs to be assessed on an individual basis with the entire clinical picture in mind. Monitoring also needs to be vigilant, and the targets for treatment reassessed continually.

### Use of liothyronine (T3) in hypothyroidism: Joint British Thyroid Association/Society for Endocrinology consensus statement [^1155V2B7]. Clinical Endocrinology (2023). Low credibility.

Persistent symptoms in patients treated for hypothyroidism are common. Despite more than 20 years of debate, the use of liothyronine for this indication remains controversial, as numerous randomized trials have failed to show a benefit of treatment regimens that combine liothyronine (T3) with levothyroxine over levothyroxine monotherapy. This consensus statement attempts to provide practical guidance to clinicians faced with patients who have persistent symptoms during thyroid hormone replacement therapy. It applies to non-pregnant adults and is focused on care delivered within the UK National Health Service, although it may be relevant in other healthcare environments.

The statement emphasizes several key clinical practice points for patients dissatisfied with treatment for hypothyroidism. Firstly, it is important to establish a diagnosis of overt hypothyroidism; patients with persistent symptoms during thyroid hormone replacement but with no clear biochemical evidence of overt hypothyroidism should first have a trial without thyroid hormone replacement. In those with established overt hypothyroidism, levothyroxine doses should be optimized aiming for a TSH in the 0.3–2.0 mU/L range for 3 to 6 months before a therapeutic response can be assessed. In some patients, it may be acceptable to have serum TSH below the reference range (e.g. 0.1–0.3 mU/L), but not fully suppressed in the long term.

### Congenital hypothyroidism: Screening and management [^111aNfht]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of congenital hypothyroidism, particularly concerning levothyroxine, the treatment goals outlined in the AAP 2023 guidelines recommend maintaining serum TSH within the age-specific reference range after initial normalization. Serum fT4 levels should be maintained in the upper half of the age-specific reference range, unless doing so would result in a TSH level lower than the reference range.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^114Mf3dw]. Thyroid (2023). Low credibility.

Conclusions - Over the past five decades, testing for TSH and TH (T4 and T3) has evolved from manual radioisotopic immunoassays performed in individual assay tubes to nonisotopic IMA tests made on highly automated immunoassay systems that provide substantial clinical utility. Analytes of interest can be quantified if appropriate reference measurement systems and certified standard materials are used. Within- and between-laboratory proficiency testing methods can provide insight into the performance of a particular method if commutable samples are used. Unfortunately, these basic prerequisites are not yet implemented or regularly used.

Physicians and laboratorians must understand the limitations of TH measurement to properly order and interpret thyroid tests. There is a need for a stronger laboratory–clinician interface. In most geographic areas, the laboratory receives a test request containing information related to patient identification that is missing clinical and pharmacological information, as well as the circumstances prompting the test request. It can be critical for the laboratory to have this missing information given the various idiosyncratic analytical interferences that affect thyroid test reliability, as discussed in this review. For their part, the laboratory should educate physicians regarding test limitations and interferences.

Furthermore, given the persistence of between-method differences, the laboratory should notify physicians before changing methods and reference ranges. The strengths and limitations of the major thyroid tests continue to be a significant focus in improving clinical practices.

### Optimal free thyroxine levels for thyroid hormone replacement in hypothyroidism [^116VJdoJ]. Endocrine Practice (2008). Low credibility.

To determine whether a difference exists in the free thyroxine level required to achieve a normal thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone or TSH) level between patients with primary hypothyroidism and euthyroid control subjects, and to compare the free thyroxine levels in patients with primary and secondary hypothyroidism receiving thyroid hormone replacement, a retrospective assessment was conducted.

- **Methods**: The study involved 58 patients with primary hypothyroidism and 78 euthyroid control subjects, all of whom underwent thyroid function tests. Additionally, free thyroxine values were obtained from medical records for 23 patients with central hypothyroidism who were receiving stable levothyroxine replacement therapy.

- **Results**: The mean free thyroxine level was significantly higher in patients with primary hypothyroidism compared to euthyroid control subjects (1.36 ± 0.201 ng/dL versus 1.10 ± 0.155 ng/dL, respectively; P ≤ .0001), while the corresponding mean TSH concentrations did not differ significantly (1.60 ± 1.183 mIU/L versus 1.73 ± 0.792 mIU/L; p = 0.46). Similarly, the mean free thyroxine value was significantly higher in patients with central hypothyroidism compared to euthyroid control subjects (1.31 ± 0.278 ng/dL versus 1.10 ± 0.155 ng/dL, respectively; P ≤ .0001). No significant difference was noted between patients with primary and central hypothyroidism (1.36 ng/dL versus 1.31 ng/dL; p = 0.60).

- **Conclusion**: Patients with hypothyroidism require a higher level of serum free thyroxine to achieve a normal TSH value.

### ETA guidelines for the use of levothyroxine sodium preparations in monotherapy to optimize the treatment of hypothyroidism [^113AV4mB]. European Thyroid Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of hypothyroidism, specifically in relation to levothyroxine therapy (maintenance dosing), the ETA 2025 guidelines recommend acknowledging that an altered thyroid function test in previously well-controlled hypothyroid patients treated with levothyroxine may result from transient interference by specific foods or a change in dietary habits. It is advised to obtain a retest of thyroid function in non-pregnant patients before increasing the dose of levothyroxine.

### Is a normal TSH synonymous with "euthyroidism" in levothyroxine monotherapy [^117Ff6Bw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy is the standard of care for hypothyroidism. The study aimed to determine whether LT4 at doses that normalize serum TSH is associated with normal markers of thyroid status.

Cross-sectional data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2001–2012) was used to evaluate 52 clinical parameters. LT4 users were compared to healthy controls and controls matched for age, sex, race, and serum TSH. Regression analysis was employed to evaluate correlations with T4 and T3 levels. A total of 9981 participants with normal serum TSH were identified; 469 were LT4-treated.

Participants using LT4 had higher serum total and free T4 and lower serum total and free T3 than healthy or matched controls. This translated to approximately 15–20% lower serum T3:T4 ratios in LT4 treatment, as shown in other cohorts. Compared to matched controls, LT4-treated participants had a higher body mass index despite reporting lower caloric intake per day per kilogram. They were more likely to be taking beta-blockers, statins, and antidepressants and reported lower total metabolic equivalents.

A serum TSH level below the mean in LT4-treated participants was associated with higher serum free T4 but similar free and total T3. Nevertheless, those with lower serum TSH levels exhibited higher serum high-density lipoprotein and lower serum low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and C-reactive protein. Age was negatively associated with the serum free T3:free T4 ratio in all participants, and caloric intake was positively associated.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^114G3g7R]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Over the past 70 years, improvements in the sensitivity and specificity of thyroid tests have led to advances in detecting and treating thyroid disorders. Basal metabolic rate and bioassays were used to measure thyroid function for decades before the 1950s. Clinical laboratory-based thyroid hormone (TH) measurement began in the 1950s with the measurement of protein-bound iodine, a method that indirectly estimated the total (free + protein-bound) thyroxine (T4) concentration, see Table 1.

- **History of thyroid testing**: There was early recognition that abnormal TH binding proteins (primarily thyroxine binding globulin, TBG), which distribute TH to target tissues including the brain, could distort the relationship between the total and the biologically active free TH. This complication arose during situations like pregnancy. As a result, indirect TBG assessments, known as uptake tests, were developed to adjust total T4 (TT4) to provide an indirect estimate of free T4 (free T4 index, fT4I = TT4 + T3 resin uptake [T3RU] test). Current "uptake" tests, now called TH binding ratios or "T-uptakes", mainly use automated immunological formulations and nonisotopic signals to assess available TBG binding sites relative to a "normal" reference that may be assigned a value of 1.00 or 40%, depending on the method.

Direct free T4 (fT4) assays employing equilibrium dialysis or ultrafiltration to isolate the small (0.03%) biologically active fT4 fraction became available in the 1960s, though they were technically complex and unsuitable to meet the increasing demand.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American thyroid association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^116uLLpr]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

The clinical utility of TH measurements complements the interpretation of the primary parameter TSH. Serum TSH concentration is the single best biomarker to confirm a diagnosis and the magnitude of primary thyroid disease due to the log-linear TSH–fT4 relationship. Although not necessary for the diagnosis of primary disease, T4 (and for specific constellations also T3) measurements are often added when TSH values fall outside the reference interval. This allows classification of thyroid disease into overt or subclinical and can direct therapeutic options accordingly.

TH measurement is also required to complement TSH measurement in several clinical situations, such as pregnancy and inter-illness when TSH can be suppressed (the nonthyroidal illness syndrome), and during the initial treatment of hypo- or hyperthyroidism, as the response of the pituitary-thyroid axis can be delayed following a change in thyroid status.

While the term "thyroid function test" is commonly used, it is only relevant to the untreated patient. This term is widely used to describe TSH and TH tests even though determinations of these parameters are often employed to monitor hypothyroid patients on levo-T4 therapy with no innate thyroid function, patients with hypothalamic or pituitary disease (secondary hypothyroidism), or patients taking medications that affect the pituitary-thyroid axis.

### 2018 European Thyroid Association (ETA) guidelines on the diagnosis and management of central hypothyroidism [^115PsjSL]. European Thyroid Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for central hypothyroidism, specifically in terms of thyroid replacement therapy, the ETA 2018 guidelines recommend initiating levothyroxine at doses of 3.0–5.0 or 2.0–2.4 mcg/kg body weight/day in forms of central hypothyroidism diagnosed during childhood or adolescence, respectively.

### SPL drug information for levothyroxine sodium [^1179PXFb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Levothyroxine sodium PO (also known as Synthroid) is generally acceptable for use in pregnant patients across all trimesters. Clinical experience suggests no adverse fetal effects when thyroid hormones, such as levothyroxine, are administered during pregnancy. It is important that thyroid replacement therapy for hypothyroid women should not be discontinued during pregnancy, as thyroid hormones undergo minimal placental transfer.

- **Thyroid hormone monitoring**: Measure TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at a minimum, during each trimester to gauge the adequacy of thyroid replacement dosage. During pregnancy, thyroid requirements may increase. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range.

- **Postpartum management**: Immediately after obstetric delivery, return the dosage to the pre-pregnancy dose. Monitor thyroid function tests, specifically TSH, at 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to assess for needed adjustments.

### European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology consensus guidelines on screening, diagnosis, and management of congenital hypothyroidism [^113URcQs]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

- **Evidence**: The rapid normalization of thyroid hormone levels within the first two weeks after treatment initiation, and the maintenance of relatively higher FT4 concentrations during the first year of life, lead to a better intellectual outcome. Frequent monitoring of TSH and FT4 levels is required to ensure this and to prevent prolonged periods of supraphysiological thyroid hormone levels. Following adjustment to L-T4 dosage, it is appropriate to recheck thyroid function, with a recommended interval of 4–6 weeks in alignment with the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines. Adequate treatment of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) minimizes the risk of treatment-related adverse effects. Neurological and cardiac complications, described primarily in patients with inadequate T4 treatment, suggest that patients with pre-existing health conditions or a very late diagnosis may require special attention during treatment.

- **Criteria for re-evaluating the thyroid axis**: To distinguish between permanent CH and transient increases in TSH concentration, and for treatment withdrawal in children with a normally sited gland.

	- **Recommendations**: We recommend re-evaluation of the thyroid axis in cases where no etiological diagnostic assessment was carried out during early infancy and/or when treatment was started in the context of the infant being ill (e.g. preterm). Re-evaluation is also mandatory when initial evaluation has shown a normally located gland, with or without goiter, in neonates.

### Levothyroxine sodium [^116MejNb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Clinical pharmacology**

- **Mechanism of action**: Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through the control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine (T3) and levothyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins. The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues.

- **Pharmacodynamics**: Levothyroxine sodium is a synthetic T4 hormone that exerts the same physiologic effect as endogenous T4, thereby maintaining normal T4 levels when a deficiency is present.

- **Pharmacokinetics**:
	- **Distribution**: Circulating thyroid hormones are greater than 99% bound to plasma proteins, including thyroxine binding globulin (TBG), thyroxine binding prealbumin (TBPA), and albumin (TBA), whose capacities and affinities vary for each hormone. The higher affinity of both TBG and TBPA for T4 partially explains the higher serum levels, slower metabolic clearance, and longer half-life of T4 compared to T3. Protein-bound thyroid hormones exist in reverse equilibrium with small amounts of free hormone. Only unbound hormone is metabolically active. Many drugs and physiologic conditions affect the binding of thyroid hormones to serum proteins [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Thyroid hormones do not readily cross the placental barrier [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### A case of macro-TSH masquerading as subclinical hypothyroidism [^116Nc1JN]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 47-year-old man was commenced on levothyroxine following a diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism with nonspecific symptoms. Despite increasing doses of levothyroxine, his thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) remained elevated, and he was referred for further assessment as he was unable to tolerate further titration. On assessment, his thyroid function demonstrated an elevated TSH and elevated free-T4. The initial impression was of iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis, with possible underlying thyroid hormone resistance, TSHoma, or assay interference. After the discontinuation of levothyroxine, free-T4 normalized, but TSH remained elevated. There was a normal response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) testing. T3 suppression testing demonstrated free-T4 reduction but persistently high TSH. THRβ sequencing was normal. TSH measurement by alternative assays revealed discrepant results. Gel filtration chromatography revealed the presence of a high-molecular-weight TSH variant alongside normal TSH. Macro-TSH is a rare phenomenon with spuriously elevated TSH and may mimic subclinical hypothyroidism. Recognition of macro-TSH avoids misdiagnosis and prevents inappropriate treatment.

### Clinical review: Central hypothyroidism: pathogenic, diagnostic, and therapeutic challenges [^115D3Sp4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). High credibility.

Central hypothyroidism is a condition that can present alongside various other disorders and symptoms. It is associated with diabetes insipidus, excessive sweating, pituitary apoplexy, adrenal insufficiency, and a decrease in serum free T4 levels. Patients may also experience weight gain and issues such as traumatic brain injury and hypothyroidism itself. Other related conditions include a decrease in thyrotropin-releasing hormone, muscle cramps, hemochromatosis, and stroke.

- **Potential causes and symptoms**: Radiation therapy to the head area may lead to central hypothyroidism, along with hypopituitarism, headaches, and Sheehan's syndrome. Additional potential causes include pituitary tumors, decreased serum TSH, hypogonadism, fatigue, growth hormone deficiency (GHD), and acromegaly. Patients may also experience cold intolerance, decreased serum free T3 levels, and the presence of a pituitary mass.

### SPL drug information for levothyroxine sodium [^115v7TfK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of levothyroxine sodium IV (also known as Synthroid) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: it is generally acceptable for use. Clinical experience at the time of writing does not indicate any adverse fetal effect when thyroid hormones, such as levothyroxine, are administered during pregnancy. Thyroid replacement therapy should not be discontinued in hypothyroid women during pregnancy. Thyroid hormones undergo minimal placental transfer.

Measure TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at a minimum, during each trimester to gauge the adequacy of thyroid replacement dosage, as thyroid requirements may increase during pregnancy. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every four weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range.

Immediately after obstetric delivery, the dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy level. Monitor thyroid function tests, specifically TSH, at four to eight weeks postpartum to assess for needed adjustments.

### The relationship between serum TSH and free T4 in older people [^114uTfVm]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

The frequency distribution of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) shows a skewed pattern that may change with age. The set point of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis for an individual is thought to be genetically determined and has been described as a log-linear relationship of serum TSH to free thyroxine (T4); however, the validity of this hypothesis has yet to be established in older people. The aim of the study was to describe the relationship between serum TSH and free T4 in older people and to define factors influencing this relationship. We conducted a cross-sectional, observational study of thyroid function in a community population of older subjects over 65 years of age.

The relationship between serum TSH and free T4 was not linear as previously described but is best described as a fourth-order polynomial. Both gender and smoking status affected the relationship. This suggests that more complex modeling is required when investigating the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.

### Patients treated for hyperthyroidism are at increased risk of becoming obese: Findings from a large prospective secondary care cohort [^113YxfFr]. Thyroid (2019). Low credibility.

The most commonly reported symptom of hyperthyroidism is weight loss; however, successful treatment often leads to weight gain. This weight gain is widely considered a reaccumulation of premorbid weight, although many patients feel there is a significant weight "overshoot" attributable to the treatment. We aimed to determine if the weight gain following treatment for hyperthyroidism represents simply a replenishment of premorbid weight or an "overshoot" beyond expected regain. Additionally, we explored whether any excessive weight gain is associated with the treatment modality applied.

- **Methods**: We calculated the risk of becoming obese (body mass index [BMI] > 30 kg/m²) following treatment for hyperthyroidism by comparing the BMI of 1,373 patients with overt hyperthyroidism seen in a secondary care setting with the age- and sex-matched background population (Health Survey for England, 2007–2009). Next, we investigated the effect of treatment with an antithyroid drug (ATD) alone versus ATD combined with radioactive iodine (¹³¹I) therapy. We modeled the longitudinal weight data in relation to the treatment pathway for thyroid function and the need for long-term thyroxine replacement.

- **Results**: During treatment for hyperthyroidism, men gained an average of 8.0 kg (standard deviation ± 7.5), while women gained 5.5 kg (± 6.8). At discharge, there was a significantly increased risk of obesity in male (odds ratio = 1.7 [95% confidence interval 1.3–2.2], p < 0.001) and female (1.3, 1.2–1.5, p < 0.001) patients with hyperthyroidism compared with the background population. Treatment with ¹³¹I was associated with…

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^113wgRe5]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Using the observed historical narrower therapeutic range for an individual patient, we note that the treatment targets may overlap for patients within a group. If that is true, the general assumption that maintaining TSH anywhere within its broad reference limits to routinely achieve a satisfactory outcome for each and every patient may be ill-advised. We have refuted the applicability of treatment targets based on the consideration of the reference ranges in the healthy population by demonstrating dissociations between FT3 and FT4, and FT3 and TSH in LT4-treated athyreotic patients, and documenting altered equilibria between the hormones on LT4 compared to the healthy state. Others have arrived at similar conclusions.

- **Laboratory diagnostics**: The high individuality of TSH and thyroid hormones has long been recognized since the pioneering work of Andersen and colleagues. However, this applies equally to the statistical analysis of associations involving thyroid parameters. Data clustering, whether in groups with similar properties or in subjects where multiple measurements are obtained over time, potentially masks the true relationship, abolishing the strong associations at the group level when the data are combined for analysis. This phenomenon, known as Simpson's paradox, is readily demonstrated with a fictitious random sample of two groups with a slightly shifted centre showing the same strong inverse correlation. Unlike the correct analysis by individual groups, a combined analysis of the total cohort artificially weakens the correlation.

### Subclinical hyperthyroidism: Controversies in management [^113MXEky]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is an increasingly recognized entity that is defined by normal serum free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels, with a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level suppressed below the normal range and usually undetectable. The TSH value is typically measured using a third-generation assay capable of detecting approximately 0.01 microU/mL (0.01 mU/L).

This condition may be a distinct clinical entity, related only in part to Graves' disease or multinodular goiter. Individuals with subclinical hyperthyroidism often do not present with the specific signs or symptoms associated with overt hyperthyroidism. A detailed clinical history should be obtained, along with a physical examination and thyroid function tests, as part of the assessment for subclinical hyperthyroidism. This evaluation also aims to assess the potential deleterious effects of excess thyroid hormone on end organs, such as the heart and bones.

A reasonable treatment option for many patients is a therapeutic trial of low-dose antithyroid agents for approximately six to twelve months, with the goal of inducing a remission. Further research into the etiology, natural history, pathophysiology, and treatment of subclinical hyperthyroidism is warranted.

### Levothyroxine replacement doses are affected by gender and weight, but not age [^116MHcEx]. Thyroid (2011). Low credibility.

Body weight (BW) and age have previously been shown to affect the dose of levothyroxine (LT(4)) that results in normalization of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in hypothyroid patients. Our objective was to determine whether gender, menstrual status, and ideal body weight (IBW) also affect the LT(4) dose required to achieve a serum TSH within the normal range.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients being treated for primary hypothyroidism who had TSH values within a normal range. We selected patients aged 18–85 years who were taking LT(4) without any confounding medications and who had no serious chronic conditions. Their LT(4) doses, referred to here as LT(4) dose requirements, based on both BW and IBW were documented. The relationship between gender, menstrual status, age, serum TSH concentrations, and the degree of overweight on LT(4) dose requirements were determined using multivariate analyses.

- **Results**: Women were significantly more overweight than men (ratio of BW/IBW was 1.35 for women vs. 1.17 for men, p < 0.0001). LT(4) requirements based on BW did not differ by gender when age was included in the model. However, when the degree of overweight was also included, men required lower LT(4) doses than both premenopausal women (1.34 μg/kg vs. 1.51 μg/kg, p = 0.038) and menopausal women (1.34 μg/kg vs. 1.49 μg/kg, p = 0.023). When examining IBW using a model incorporating age, men also required lower LT(4) doses than both premenopausal women (1.64 μg/kg vs. 1.92 μg/kg, p = 0.0033) and menopausal women (1.64 μg/kg vs. 1.90 μg/kg, p = 0.0024).

### How does thyroid hormone profile differ on and off replacement treatment [^116MtbCY]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism is estimated to affect around 3% of the population in Europe and is more common in certain groups such as females and older adults. Clinically, hypothyroidism presents with symptoms such as cold intolerance, fatigue, and weight gain. Biochemically, hypothyroidism is diagnosed through measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4), with increased TSH and decreased FT4 being the typical pattern seen in patients with overt hypothyroidism. Additionally, there exists a subset of the population with high TSH levels but normal FT4 and minimal symptoms; this is known as subclinical hypothyroidism.

The most prescribed treatment for hypothyroidism is levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy. This medication is converted into the more metabolically active thyroid hormone, triiodothyronine (T3), by deiodinases within the body. LT4 is a very widely prescribed drug, with 33.8 million prescriptions in the UK alone in 2022. Other thyroid hormone treatments, such as natural desiccated thyroid (NDT) and liothyronine (LT3), are available but are used much less commonly in modern practice.

The ideal therapeutic goal in hypothyroidism would be to restore clinical and biochemical euthyroidism via physiologic thyroid hormone replacement. While this concept may seem straightforward, there are subtleties that have only recently been recognized. In the majority of patients, LT4 treatment will both normalize TSH levels and lead to symptom resolution. However, it is estimated that around 5%–15% of patients taking LT4 still experience symptoms.

### Serum thyrotropin and triiodothyronine levels in levothyroxine-treated patients [^114z2paj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Small adjustments in levothyroxine (LT4) dose do not appear to provide clinical benefit despite changes in thyrotropin (TSH) levels within the reference range. We hypothesize that the accompanying changes in serum total triiodothyronine (T3) levels do not reflect the magnitude of the changes in serum TSH.

- **Objective**: This work aims to characterize the relationships of serum free thyroxine (FT4) vs T3, FT4 vs TSH, and FT4 vs the T3/FT4 ratio.

- **Methods**: This cross-sectional, observational study comprised 9,850 participants aged 18 years and older treated with LT4 from a large clinical database from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2019. Patients had been treated with LT4, subdivided by serum FT4 level. Main outcome measures included model fitting of the relationships between serum FT4 vs TSH, FT4 vs T3, and FT4 vs T3/FT4. Mean and median values of TSH, T3, and T3/FT4 were calculated.

- **Results**: The relationships T3 vs FT4 and TSH vs FT4 were both complex and best represented by distinct, segmented regression models. Increasing FT4 levels were linearly associated with T3 levels until an inflection point at an FT4 level of 0.7 ng/dL, after which a flattening of the slope was observed following a convex quadratic curve. In contrast, increasing FT4 levels were associated with steep declines in TSH following two negative sigmoid curves. The FT4 vs T3/FT4 relationship was fit to an asymptotic regression curve supporting less T4 to T3 activation at higher FT4 levels.

### Is excessive weight gain after ablative treatment of hyperthyroidism due to inadequate thyroid hormone therapy [^111EJp2x]. Thyroid (2000). Low credibility.

There is controversy about the correct dose and form of thyroid hormone therapy for patients with hypothyroidism. Despite the restoration of serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentrations to normal, many patients complain of excessive weight gain. We have compared weight at the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism with that when euthyroid, evidenced by a stable, normal serum TSH concentration, with or without thyroxine (T4) replacement therapy. This was assessed in patients treated with an 18-month course of antithyroid drugs (43 patients), surgery (56 patients), or 131I (34 patients) for Graves' disease. In addition, weights were recorded before and after the treatment of 25 patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma by total thyroidectomy, 131I, and long-term T4 suppressive therapy, resulting in undetectable serum TSH concentrations.

Mean weight gain in patients with Graves' disease who required T4 replacement therapy following surgery was significantly greater than in those of the same age, sex, and severity of hyperthyroidism rendered euthyroid by surgery (3.9 kg) or at the end of a course of antithyroid drugs (4.1 kg). Weight gain was similar in those requiring T4 replacement following surgery or 131I therapy (10.4 versus 10.1 kg). In contrast, ablative therapy combined with suppression of TSH secretion by T4 in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma did not result in weight gain. The excessive weight gain in patients becoming hypothyroid after destructive therapy for Graves' disease suggests that restoration of serum TSH to the reference range by T4 alone may constitute inadequacy in managing weight issues.

### Levothyroxine dosage is associated with stability of thyroid-stimulating hormone values [^114VwJPF]. The American Journal of Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In patients treated for hypothyroidism, the usual practice is to monitor thyroid-stimulating hormone values yearly once a therapeutic dosage of levothyroxine is determined. This study investigates whether there are any clinical predictors that could identify a subset of patients who might be monitored safely on a less frequent basis.

- **Methods**: With the use of a retrospective study design, 715 patients treated for hypothyroidism who had a normal (i.e. therapeutic) thyroid-stimulating hormone value in 2006 while taking levothyroxine were identified. All thyroid-stimulating hormone values were then obtained through December 31, 2012. By using a Cox proportional hazard model, gender, age, body mass index, history of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, initial thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and levothyroxine dose were analyzed for time to first abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone value.

- **Results**: Age, gender, history of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, and body mass index at the time of initial normal thyroid-stimulating hormone were not associated significantly with time to abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone value. Levothyroxine dose > 125 μg/day had an increased hazard ratio of 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.7–3.4; P < 0.05) compared to doses < 125 μg/day.

### Growth hormone replacement improves thyroxine biological effects: Implications for management of central hypothyroidism [^114xkWYH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

The biological significance of GH-induced changes in serum TH concentrations is unknown. It has been suggested that serum free T(4) (FT(4)) should be targeted at the high-normal range during GH replacement. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of GH replacement on T(4) biological effects. The hypothesis was that if GH modulates thyroxine biological effects, serum FT(4) should be targeted accordingly.

- **Design and setting**: We conducted observational (study 1) and interventional (studies 2 and 3)/outpatient studies.

- **Patients**: Thirty-two GH-deficient patients (13 off GH; 22 on l-T(4)) participated in the study.

- **Interventions**: In study 2, levothyroxine was administered to increase FT(4) (> 1.0 ng/dl). In study 3, GH was administered or withdrawn.

- **Main outcome measures**: We measured FT(4), total T(3) (TT(3)), myocardial isovolumic contraction time (ICT), and resting energy expenditure (REE).

Results showed that in study 1, off-GH and on-GH groups had similar FT(4), but the off-GH group showed lower TT(3) (P < 0.01) and REE (P = 0.02), and higher ICT (P < 0.05) compared to on-GH and control groups. On GH, ICT and REE correlated only with TT(3) (r = -0.48; r = 0.58; P < 0.05). Off GH, ICT correlated only with FT(4) (P < 0.01). In study 2, for the off-GH group, levothyroxine intervention increased FT(4) (P = 0.005) and TT(3) (P = 0.012), decreased ICT (P = 0.006), and increased REE (P = 0.013); changes in ICT and FT(4) correlated (r = -0.72; P = 0.06). For the on-GH group, levothyroxine increased FT(4) (P = 0.0002), TT(3) (P = 0.014), and REE (P = 0.10), and decreased ICT (P = 0.049); changes in REE and TT(3) correlated (r = 0.60; P < 0.05).

### Time for a reassessment of the treatment of hypothyroidism [^113irk8e]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Despite a historically late start in its recognition as a disease entity, hypothyroidism has remarkably become one of the most frequently diagnosed diseases in the Western world, and levothyroxine one of the most frequently used drugs worldwide.

How could a condition that had been overlooked throughout the centuries of human culture rise to such prominence in such a short time period? Clearly, this was related to the convenient and sensitive measurement of serum TSH, which has achieved a pre-eminent position in defining primary hypothyroidism. Consequently, a new disease class of subclinical hypothyroidism was introduced, which is solely based on the presence of an elevated TSH while the thyroid hormones FT3 and FT4 remain within their respective reference ranges. This strategy has not remained unchallenged, and the deficiencies of this diagnostic approach have been reviewed elsewhere. In an attempt to scale back on the avalanche of purported thyroid diseases created by this strategy, the TSH threshold for treatment was raised in recent guidelines. In doing so, another problem was created by dissociating the TSH-based diagnosis of the disease from the requirement of therapeutic intervention. However, doctors and patients find it incomprehensible that a thyroid condition labelled as a disease would not therefore require suitable intervention. This questions the practical value of designation and appropriateness of the diagnostic entity of subclinical hypothyroidism.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^111Wrp1V]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

The clinical utility of TSH measurement: Serum TSH is one of the most frequently measured analytes in the outpatient setting. Thyroid disease is common and can, in most cases, be easily diagnosed based on using TSH measurement. In addition, the availability of high-quality, sensitive, specific, and inexpensive TSH assays makes screening for thyroid disease cost-effective. Because of the log-linear relationship of TSH to fT4, deviations of TSH concentrations from population-specific reference intervals represent the preferred initial test for evaluation of thyroid function.

Understanding the indications for and limitations of TSH measurement and the interpretation of TSH results is essential for the practice of high-quality, cost-effective medicine. TSH is used to screen newborns for primary congenital hypothyroidism and to screen adults at risk for thyroid disease. Note that primary congenital hypothyroidism is an endocrine emergency because delays in initiating treatment result in an irreversible loss of cognitive function. Accordingly, turnaround time from specimen collection to patient follow-up represents a major consideration in the implementation and quality assessment of newborn screening programs.

Interpreting the results for these apparently similar indications for TSH measurement is, however, very different. Patient age presents an important factor that must be considered when interpreting TSH results. For example, TSH concentrations in newborns less than 3 days of age are difficult to interpret due to the postnatal TSH surge.

### Thyroid function in critically ill patients [^117AhYKn]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) typically present with decreased concentrations of plasma tri-iodothyronine, low thyroxine, and normal range or slightly decreased concentration of thyroid-stimulating hormone. This ensemble of changes is collectively known as non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS). The extent of NTIS is associated with prognosis, but no proof exists for causality of this association. Initially, NTIS is a consequence of the acute phase response to systemic illness and macronutrient restriction, which might be beneficial.

The pathogenesis of NTIS in long-term critical illness is more complex and includes suppression of hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone, accounting for persistently reduced secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone despite low plasma thyroid hormone. In some cases, distinguishing between NTIS and severe hypothyroidism, which is a rare primary cause for admission to the ICU, can be difficult. Infusion of hypothalamic-releasing factors can reactivate the thyroid axis in patients with NTIS, inducing an anabolic response. Whether this approach has a clinical benefit in terms of outcome is unknown.

In this series paper, we discuss diagnostic aspects, pathogenesis, and implications of NTIS as well as its distinction from severe, primary thyroid disorders in patients in the ICU.

### Thyroid function variation in the normal range, energy expenditure, and body composition in L-T4-treated subjects [^1166KHbN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

It is not clear whether upper limits of the thyrotropin (TSH) reference range should be lowered. This debate can be better informed by investigation of whether variations in thyroid function within the reference range have clinical effects. Thyroid hormone plays a critical role in determining energy expenditure, body mass, and body composition, and therefore, clinically relevant variations in these parameters may occur across the normal range of thyroid function.

- **Methods**: This was a cross-sectional study of 140 otherwise healthy hypothyroid subjects receiving chronic replacement therapy with levothyroxine (L-T4) who had TSH levels across the full span of the laboratory reference range (0.34 to 5.6 mU/L). Subjects underwent detailed tests of energy expenditure (total and resting energy expenditure, thermic effect of food, physical activity energy expenditure), substrate oxidation, diet intake, and body composition.

- **Results**: Subjects with low-normal (≤ 2.5 mU/L) and high-normal (> 2.5 mU/L) TSH levels did not differ in any of the outcome measures. However, across the entire group, serum free triiodothyronine (fT3) levels were directly correlated with resting energy expenditure, body mass index (BMI), body fat mass, and visceral fat mass, with clinically relevant variations in these outcomes.

- **Conclusions**: Variations in thyroid function within the laboratory reference range have clinically relevant correlations with resting energy expenditure, BMI, and body composition in L-T4-treated subjects. However, salutary effects of higher fT3 levels on energy expenditure may be.

### European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology consensus guidelines on screening, diagnosis, and management of congenital hypothyroidism [^115KDSiz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

- **Recommendations on diagnosis**:
	- If a precise diagnosis is sought, L-T 4 should be phased out over a 4 to 6-week period (depending on the size of the maintenance dose) and a full re-evaluation carried out at the end of this period, with biochemical testing and thyroid imaging if hypothyroidism is confirmed.
	- If the clinician wishes to establish the presence or absence of primary hypothyroidism rather than to obtain an exact diagnosis, the L-T 4 dose may be decreased by 30% for 2 to 3 weeks. If an increase in TSH concentration to ≥ 10 mU/L is observed during this period, then continuing hypothyroidism can be assumed. By contrast, if thyroid function remains normal, the dose may be reduced further, followed by retesting.

- **Evidence**:
	- By the age of 2 to 3 years, the severity of thyroid impairment may be evident from a lower dose requirement or, if compliance has been imperfect, high TSH levels despite treatment.

- **Treatment and monitoring in pregnant women with CH**:
	- For women with CH who are planning a pregnancy, even greater efforts should be made to ensure that maternal thyroid hormones are optimal. In newly pregnant patients, we recommend an immediate increase in L-T 4 dose by 25 to 30% following a missed menstrual cycle or positive home pregnancy test.
	- TSH and FT4 (or TT4) levels should be evaluated as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, every 4 to 6 weeks during the pregnancy, and 4 weeks after every change in dose.
	- The goal of the treatment is to maintain TSH concentration below 2.5 mU/L in the first trimester.

Regarding medical management for hypothyroidism, specifically in relation to levothyroxine therapy (concerning indications and normal TSH levels), the AACE/ATA 2012 guidelines recommend considering initiating L-thyroxine therapy in female patients of childbearing age with serum TSH levels within the reference range for the local laboratory if:

- **Serum TSH is greater than 2.5 mIU/L**: This applies to patients planning a pregnancy in the immediate future, including those undergoing assisted reproduction.

- **Serum TSH is greater than 2.5 mIU/L during the first trimester of pregnancy**: This level indicates the need for initiating therapy.

- **Serum TSH is greater than 3.0 mIU/L during the second trimester of pregnancy**: Adjust therapy if levels are above this threshold.

- **Serum TSH is greater than 3.5 mIU/L during the third trimester of pregnancy**: Therapy considerations depend on these elevated levels.

### How should we treat patients with low serum thyrotropin concentrations [^116SUZCg]. Clinical Endocrinology (2010). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) is characterized by a low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration while maintaining normal levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3). It is useful to differentiate between patients with detectable but low TSH values, ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 mU/l (designated as grade I SH), and those with a fully suppressed TSH, defined as less than 0.1 mU/l (designated as grade II SH). These patterns of thyroid function tests occur in 1–3% of the elderly population and are linked to significant morbidity and mortality according to longitudinal epidemiological surveys.

A number of causes can contribute to this condition, including endogenous thyroid disease, drug effects, and concomitant non-thyroidal illness. Treatments that are typically used to manage thyrotoxicosis can effectively correct the biochemical abnormalities associated with SH but have not been proven to improve clinical outcomes or symptoms. There is a scarcity of high-quality evidence to guide the assessment or management of these patients. This review summarizes the clinical significance of SH and aims to provide guidance on whether to treat patients with low serum TSH concentrations.

### Liothyronine sodium [^114qZ1NE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **General principles of dosing**: The dose of Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP, for hypothyroidism or pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression depends on a variety of factors including the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food, and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3, 2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5), and Drug Interactions (7)]. Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors, and dose adjustments should be made based on a periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Administer Liothyronine Sodium Tablets, USP, orally once daily.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology position statement on thyroid dysfunction case finding [^113SKFsA]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can be readily diagnosed and treated in a safe, cost-effective manner. Professional organizations have provided guidance on how and when to use thyroid-stimulating hormone testing for detecting thyroid dysfunction. Most recently, the United States Preventive Services Task Force did not endorse screening for thyroid dysfunction due to a lack of proven benefit and the potential harm of treating those with subclinical thyroid disease.

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) is concerned that this stance may discourage physicians from testing for thyroid dysfunction when clinically appropriate. Given the lack of specificity of thyroid-associated symptoms, appropriate diagnosis of thyroid disease requires biochemical confirmation. The Thyroid Scientific Committee of the AACE has produced this White Paper to highlight the important difference between screening and case-based testing in clinical medicine. Thyroid dysfunction should frequently be considered as a potential etiology for many nonspecific complaints that physicians encounter daily.

The success of safe and effective interventions depends on an accurate diagnosis. Therefore, we advocate for an aggressive case-finding approach by identifying those individuals most likely to have thyroid disease, thereby benefiting from its treatment.

### How do you approach the problem of TSH elevation in a patient on high-dose thyroid hormone replacement [^114JDqUJ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2009). Low credibility.

Persistent elevation of TSH levels in patients under treatment for hypothyroidism is a relatively common clinical problem in endocrinology practice. The most common cause for this phenomenon is poor patient compliance with their thyroid hormone tablets. In compliant patients, however, multiple etiologies are possible, and a methodological and stepwise approach to the patient's problem can uniformly identify a cause or at least a resolution.

### 2018 European Thyroid Association (ETA) guidelines on the diagnosis and management of central hypothyroidism [^114pwFCV]. European Thyroid Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for central hypothyroidism, and more specifically with respect to the assessment of treatment response, the ETA 2018 guidelines recommend up-titrating the levothyroxine dose in the following conditions:

- **Pregnancy**: Adjust levothyroxine to accommodate increased thyroid hormone requirements.

- **Controlled ovarian stimulation**: Monitor and modify doses as necessary during assisted reproductive techniques.

- **Pubertal development**: As children progress through puberty, adjust dosages to match developmental needs.

- **Weight gain**: Address changes in body mass that affect hormone metabolism.

- **Retarded psychomotor and cognitive development in infants and children**: Ensure adequate thyroid hormone levels to support development.

- **Introduction of GH replacement therapy**: Adjust levothyroxine as growth hormone can alter thyroid hormone action.

- **Introduction of estrogen replacement therapy or oral contraceptives**: Consider hormonal interactions affecting thyroxine metabolism.

- **Introduction of treatments impacting levothyroxine absorption or thyroid hormone metabolism**: Reassess and adapt dosing regimens to maintain effective treatment levels.

### Approach to the patient with raised thyroid hormones and nonsuppressed TSH [^11385f4o]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Genuinely raised (Free) T4 and (Free) T3 with nonsuppressed TSH concentrations are observed after excluding confounding causes, such as measurement interference, effects of concomitant comorbidities, or drug therapies. Such raised levels are compatible with either a genetic condition, resistance to thyroid hormone beta (RTHβ), or an acquired condition like a TSH-secreting pituitary tumor or thyrotropinoma (TSHoma). RTHβ is a dominantly inherited disorder caused by approximately 230 known heterozygous mutations in the thyroid hormone receptor β gene (THRB), with over 900 families recorded worldwide.

The higher prevalence of TSHomas, at 2.8 per million, is likely mediated by increased detection rates when compared to previous records. The age, gender, and the magnitude or pattern of elevation in free thyroid hormones or TSH concentrations do not distinguish between RTHβ and TSHoma. Although genetic testing for RTHβ and pituitary imaging for TSHoma are theoretically definitive, diagnostic difficulties can still arise.

Possibly due to earlier detection, a higher proportion (25–30%) of TSHomas now present as microadenomas. Some pituitary lesions are not discernible using standard magnetic resonance imaging and are associated with minimal or absent hyperthyroid signs and symptoms. Conversely, clinical features of hyperthyroidism can be present in RTHβ, and incidental abnormalities on pituitary imaging are found in a significant proportion (20%) of genetically-proven RTHβ cases.

### Rationalizing thyroid function testing: Which TSH cutoffs are optimal for testing free T4 [^113KVT47]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Thyroid function testing often uses thyrotropin (TSH) measurement first, followed by reflex testing for free thyroxine (T4) if TSH is outside the reference range. The utility of different TSH cutoffs for reflex testing is unknown.

- **Objective**: To examine different TSH cutoffs for reflex free T4 testing.

- **Design, setting, and patients**: We analyzed TSH and free T4 results from 120,403 individuals from a single laboratory in Western Australia (clinical cohort) and 4,568 Busselton Health Study participants (community cohort).

- **Results**: In the clinical cohort, restricting free T4 measurement to individuals with TSH of 5.0 mU/L resulted in a 22% reduction in free T4 testing compared with a TSH reference range of 0.4 to 4.0 mU/L; using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L resulted in a 34% reduction in free T4 testing. In the community cohort, the corresponding effect was less: 3.3% and 4.8% reduction in free T4 testing. In the clinical cohort, using TSH cutoffs of 0.2 and 6.0 mU/L, elevated free T4 would go undetected in 4.2% of individuals with TSH levels of 0.2 to 0.4 mU/L. In most, free T4 was marginally elevated and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hyperthyroidism. Low free T4 would go undetected in 2.5% of individuals with TSH levels of 4 to 6 mU/L; in 94%, free T4 was marginally reduced and unlikely to indicate clinically relevant hypothyroidism.

- **Conclusions**: Setting TSH cutoffs at 0.1 to 0.2 mU/L less than and 1 to 2 mU/L greater than the reference range for reflex testing of free T4 would reduce the need for free T4 testing, with minimal effect.

### European society for paediatric endocrinology consensus guidelines on screening, diagnosis, and management of congenital hypothyroidism [^114BKbC3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Further research is required to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology and management of this heterogeneous disorder. Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in early neurodevelopment so that untreated severe congenital hypothyroidism (CH) results in neurological and psychiatric deficits, including intellectual disability, spasticity, and disturbances of gait and coordination. CH is one of the most common preventable causes of mental retardation.

Screening programs, which have been in operation over the last 30 years in most industrialized countries, have led to the successful early detection and treatment of infants with CH and have eliminated the severe neurodevelopmental deficits resulting from late diagnosis. Studies on cognitive function in patients with CH treated soon after birth have shown that normal development can be achieved in most patients, although some may have subtle neurocognitive deficits.

Estimates of the prevalence of CH vary according to the method of ascertainment: about 1 in 2000 to 3000 live births in countries with neonatal screening versus about 1 in 6700 live births before the screening era. Recent reports have indicated that the incidence of primary CH may be increasing in some countries, particularly for cases with a normally located (eutopic) thyroid gland and milder dysfunction. The reasons for this remain unclear but may relate to changes in screening thresholds.

The results from neonatal screening programs have also helped to identify a broad spectrum of thyroid dysfunctions with different underlying etiologies. CH can be classified according to site.

### Optimal levothyroxine dosing strategy for immune checkpoint inhibitor-related hypothyroidism: A retrospective study [^1163XWD9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related hypothyroidism is mostly irreversible, making prompt thyroid hormone replacement therapy crucial, especially for patients undergoing neoadjuvant immunotherapy.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to propose a novel titration strategy for ICI-related hypothyroidism, evaluate levothyroxine (LT4) dose differences between hypothyroidism patterns, and develop a predictive equation for the optimal LT4 dose.

- **Design**: Retrospective study.

- **Setting**: Tertiary academic hospital.

- **Patients**: 109 patients with ICI-related hypothyroidism.

- **Interventions**: Rapid versus conventional titration strategy.

- **Main outcome measures**: The time to achieve normal free thyroxine (FT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels.

- **Results**: Patients with transient thyrotoxicosis followed by overt hypothyroidism (Toxic-OHypo) required higher LT4 doses to achieve a euthyroid state compared to isolated overt hypothyroidism, with a mean difference of 0.23 μg/kg/day (95% confidence interval, 0.08–0.38). In patients with ICI-related overt hypothyroidism and no cardiac disease, who had elevated TSH levels within 4 weeks of the last documented low or normal TSH, a rapid titration strategy was implemented. This strategy significantly improved the cumulative incidence of achieving normal FT4 and TSH levels compared to the conventional titration strategy (hazard ratio [HR], 4.44; 95% CI, 2.24–8.82; HR, 4.11; 95% CI, 2.18–7.73, respectively), with a comparable safety profile. Predicted LT4 dose at euthyroid state (µg/kg/day) = (-0.016×body weight) + (0.109×baseline TSH level).

### A clinical and therapeutic approach to thyrotoxicosis with thyroid-stimulating hormone suppression only [^116xmsiu]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as normal serum free thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations and persistently suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations. The most common cause of subclinical hyperthyroidism is the use of suppressive doses of L-thyroxine for the treatment of hypothyroidism or, less commonly, diffuse nontoxic goiter or thyroid carcinoma (exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism). Endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism may be caused by a variety of thyroid disorders that result in overproduction and release of thyroid hormones from the gland with normal/high 24-hour thyroid radioiodine uptake or by inflammation in the thyroid, resulting in the release of excess thyroid hormones and low 24-hour thyroid radioiodine uptake.

Several groups have investigated whether persistent endogenous or exogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism, like overt hyperthyroidism, causes symptoms, adverse effects on the cardiovascular and skeletal systems, and increased mortality, whether endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism evolves to overt thyrotoxicosis, and whether or not it should be treated. The present report reviews the most important and recent studies of subclinical hyperthyroidism and attempts to draw conclusions based upon the literature and the authors' experience.

### Levothyroxine treatment for congenital hypothyroidism based on thyroid function: a 10-year clinical retrospective study [^113dyyPY]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

To explore the appropriate dosage of levothyroxine treatment for congenital hypothyroidism patients with different thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, a total of 116 patients, who were regularly followed up in our endocrine clinic from January 2010 to December 2020, were divided into four groups based on their thyroid function:

- **Group A**: TSH ≥ 100 mIU/L
- **Group B**: TSH ≥ 20 mIU/L
- **Group C**: TSH between 4.6 mIU/L and 6.6 pmol/L

The initial dosage of levothyroxine was individualized for each patient based on their TSH level and then adjusted according to their thyroid function at every follow-up time point. The levothyroxine dosage at each time point was compared between the groups. Additionally, thyroid function and physical and neurological development after treatment were also compared.

After individualized dosage adjustment, all patients achieved normal thyroid function. Although there were statistical differences in neurological development between the four groups (p < 0.05), development was within the normal range for all groups.

An individualized levothyroxine dosage can provide the same therapeutic effect compared to the recommended dosage. This strategy may also reduce the risk of a drug overdose.

### Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine): An American Thyroid Association-commissioned review of current clinical and laboratory status [^114yH4KX]. Thyroid (2023). High credibility.

Despite being the most performed laboratory endocrine investigation, the optimum use of thyroid tests — thyrotropin (TSH) and thyroid hormone (TH) measurement — is open to question, and the interpretation of the results from these tests can be ambiguous. The American Thyroid Association (ATA), with its expertise, supports the endeavors of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) to improve and maintain standardization and harmonization of thyroid testing. The ATA mandated an international interdisciplinary working group panel to survey the status of thyroid testing by reviewing the recent literature, to revise or update the criteria as needed in mutual agreement, and to inform clinical care.

- **Summary**: This review represents the conclusions on the clinical use of routine TSH and TH (thyroxine [T4] and triiodothyronine [T3]) assays, taking into account geographic differences in disease prevalence and clinical and laboratory practice among writing members. The interaction between physiological, pathophysiological, and pharmacological factors and thyroid assays can affect their measurements and confound result interpretation. These factors need to be considered in the clinical context of the patient for appropriate test ordering and result interpretation. Despite significant advances in laboratory methods over the past 50 years, routine thyroid assays remain susceptible to idiosyncratic analytical interference that may produce spurious results. Improved standardization is needed.

### Hypothyroidism: Diagnosis and treatment [^111oVG6n]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Clinical hypothyroidism affects one in 300 people in the United States, with a higher prevalence among female and older patients. Symptoms range from minimal to life-threatening, such as myxedema coma; more common symptoms include cold intolerance, fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, constipation, and voice changes. The signs and symptoms that suggest thyroid dysfunction are nonspecific and nondiagnostic, especially in the early presentation of the disease; therefore, a diagnosis is based on blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine.

There is no evidence that population screening is beneficial. Symptom relief and normalized thyroid-stimulating hormone levels are achieved with levothyroxine replacement therapy, started at 1.5 to 1.8 mcg per kg per day. Adding triiodothyronine is not recommended, even in patients with persistent symptoms and normal levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone.

- **Dosage guidance**: Patients older than 60 years or with known or suspected ischemic heart disease should start at a lower dosage of levothyroxine (12.5 to 50 mcg per day). Women with hypothyroidism who become pregnant should increase their weekly dosage by 30% up to nine doses per week (i.e. take one extra dose twice per week), followed by monthly evaluation and management.

- **Further considerations**: Patients with persistent symptoms after adequate levothyroxine dosing should be reassessed for other causes or the need for referral. Early recognition of myxedema coma and appropriate treatment are essential. Most patients with subclinical hypothyroidism do not benefit from treatment unless the thyroid-stimulating hormone level is greater than…

### Effects of altering levothyroxine dose on energy expenditure and body composition in subjects treated with LT4 [^116SQwNu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

It is unclear whether variations in thyroid status within or near the reference range affect energy expenditure, body mass, or body composition.

- **Methods**: 138 subjects treated with levothyroxine (LT4) for hypothyroidism with normal TSH levels underwent measurement of total, resting, and physical activity energy expenditure; thermic effect of food; substrate oxidation; dietary intake; and body composition. They were assigned to receive an unchanged, higher, or lower LT4 dose in a randomized, double-blind fashion, targeting one of three TSH ranges (0.34 to 2.50, 2.51 to 5.60, or 5.61 to 12.0 mU/L). The doses were adjusted every 6 weeks to achieve target TSH levels. Baseline measures were reassessed at 6 months.

- **Results**: At study end, the mean LT4 doses and TSH levels were 1.50 ± 0.07, 1.32 ± 0.07, and 0.78 ± 0.08 µg/kg (P < 0.001) and 1.85 ± 0.25, 3.93 ± 0.38, and 9.49 ± 0.80 mU/L (P < 0.001), respectively, in the three arms. No substantial metabolic differences in outcome were found among the three arms, although direct correlations were observed between decreases in thyroid status and decreases in resting energy expenditure for all subjects. The subjects could not ascertain how their LT4 dose had been adjusted, but they perceived the preferred LT4 dose to be higher (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Altering LT4 doses in subjects with hypothyroidism to vary TSH levels in and near the reference range did not have major effects on energy expenditure or body composition. Subjects treated with LT4 preferred the perceived higher LT4 doses despite a lack of objective effect.
