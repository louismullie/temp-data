## Question

A 32-year-old woman, G2P1, undergoes an uncomplicated lower segment cesarean delivery at term for non-reassuring fetal heart tones. After delivery of the placenta, you are supervising a junior resident who is about to begin closure. The uterine incision is hemostatic, and there is approximately 3 cm of subcutaneous tissue. The resident asks you about the best practices for closure of the uterine incision, peritoneum, subcutaneous tissue, and skin to optimize maternal outcomes and minimize complications.

Based on current guideline recommendations, what are the appropriate techniques for closure of the uterine incision, peritoneum, subcutaneous tissue, and skin in this patient?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best practices for closure of the uterine incision, peritoneum, subcutaneous tissue, and skin after an uncomplicated lower segment cesarean delivery, with approximately 3 cm of subcutaneous tissue, to optimize maternal outcomes and minimize complications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and how it influences closure choices. Then, I should verify the evidence hierarchy and identify the highest-quality sources. Next, I will examine uterine closure options and reconcile conflicting guidance. After that, I need to check peritoneal closure recommendations. Then, I will evaluate subcutaneous tissue closure thresholds and techniques. Finally, I will review skin closure materials and methods, and synthesize a practical, stepwise recommendation with caveats and exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why it matters. This is a term, lower segment cesarean with a hemostatic uterine incision and about 3 cm of subcutaneous fat; there is no mention of prior cesarean, obesity, or infection, so I should avoid overgeneralizing from studies in obese populations while still applying evidence-based thresholds for subcutaneous closure. The key outcomes we want to optimize are wound complications, operative efficiency, and long-term reproductive safety, including scar integrity and adhesion risk [^7e83e38a] [^3c58860d].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy to anchor decisions. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to prioritize high-quality randomized trials and meta-analyses, then consider contemporary guidelines and systematic reviews. The CORONIS factorial RCT and its 3-year follow-up provide the most robust comparative data for several closure steps, while ERAS and modern expert reviews translate evidence into practice recommendations; Cochrane reviews inform specific questions like peritoneal closure and skin closure techniques [^eb4bdc5c] [^ed2d3814] [^72d884b5] [^7e83e38a] [^2ca88547] [^42d65ff0].

> I will now examine uterine closure, where controversy persists. Initially, I thought double-layer closure was clearly superior for reducing rupture risk, but wait, let me verify the highest-quality data. The CORONIS trial and its 3-year follow-up found no difference in uterine rupture or dehiscence between single- and double-layer closure, and a large Dutch RCT (2Close) likewise showed no superiority of double-layer for reproductive outcomes, so I should correct that assumption. However, some guidelines and reviews still prefer two-layer closure for potential benefits in residual myometrial thickness and scar morphology, even if clinical outcomes are similar; thus, either single-layer unlocked or double-layer closure is acceptable, and surgeon preference can reasonably guide choice given equivalent rupture risk in trials [^ed2d3814] [^acd6a391] [^72d884b5] [^7e83e38a] [^f5d88754].

> Let me consider peritoneal closure next. The balance of evidence and guidelines consistently favors non-closure of both visceral and parietal peritoneum because it reduces operative time without increasing short-term morbidity, and long-term adhesion data are mixed but generally do not show clear symptomatic benefit to closure. I should confirm that this applies across settings; yes, Cochrane and multiple RCTs, including CORONIS, support non-closure as standard practice unless there is a specific indication to close [^2ca88547] [^aa41db9a] [^7e83e38a] [^eb4bdc5c].

> Now, subcutaneous tissue closure. With approximately 3 cm of subcutaneous fat, I should confirm the threshold. Multiple meta-analyses and guidelines recommend closing the subcutaneous layer when depth is 2 cm or greater because it reduces wound disruption, seroma, and hematoma; the number needed to treat is about 16 in women with fat thickness greater than 2 cm. Wait, I should double-check whether continuous or interrupted closure is better; a retrospective cohort suggests continuous closure may further reduce surgical site infection, but given the design, I will prioritize the 2 cm threshold and acknowledge that continuous technique is reasonable while noting the evidence quality [^c9da89c3] [^3c58860d] [^7e83e38a] [^42be42db].

> For skin closure, I need to ensure I weigh infection, separation, and cosmesis. High-quality evidence and meta-analyses show that subcuticular absorbable suture reduces wound complications, particularly wound separation, compared with staples, and this benefit persists in women with obesity. I should confirm material choice; monofilament absorbable sutures such as poliglecaprone are preferred for cosmesis and infection risk, and ERAS-endorsed summaries align with this approach. But wait, what if absorbable skin suture interacts with subcutaneous closure to increase infection risk? The CLOSURE factorial RCT suggested higher infection risk when both subcutaneous fascia and skin were closed with absorbable sutures; however, this signal was hypothesis-generating and not consistently reproduced, so I will still favor subcuticular absorbable suture for skin while acknowledging the uncertainty and tailoring in patients at high infection risk or with specific risk factors [^4243ed78] [^6296b549] [^7e83e38a] [^74430d9c] [^d828f274].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and sanity-check each element. Uterine closure: either single-layer unlocked continuous or double-layer continuous closure is acceptable; ensure hemostasis and consider full-thickness bites if using a double-layer technique, recognizing no clear difference in rupture risk in trials. Peritoneum: do not close visceral or parietal peritoneum. Subcutaneous tissue: close with absorbable suture because depth is 3 cm, using a continuous technique if aligned with local practice. Skin: close with a subcuticular absorbable monofilament suture to reduce wound separation and improve cosmesis. Throughout, maintain aseptic technique and consider glove change after placental delivery before closure, as recommended by contemporary reviews [^7e83e38a] [^3c58860d] [^6296b549].

> But wait, what if the patient has specific risk factors that modify these defaults? In obesity, the benefit of subcutaneous closure is stronger and the advantage of subcuticular suture over staples is more pronounced, so I should reinforce those choices. In patients with prior cesarean, non-closure of peritoneum remains acceptable and does not appear to worsen adhesions in high-quality longitudinal data. If future fertility is a priority and there is concern for niche or scar defect, some clinicians may prefer double-layer closure for theoretical improvements in residual myometrial thickness, but I should counsel that randomized data have not shown superiority for rupture or dehiscence outcomes [^4243ed78] [^ed2d3814] [^f5d88754].

> Finally, I should confirm that these recommendations align with major guidelines and note any exceptions. ERAS recommends two-layer uterine closure to lower rupture risk, but this conflicts with CORONIS and 2Close, which found no difference; given this, I will present both positions and let surgeon judgment and patient factors guide the choice, while defaulting to non-closure of peritoneum, subcutaneous closure at 2 cm or more, and subcuticular absorbable suture for skin as the evidence-based foundation for routine practice [^72d884b5] [^eb4bdc5c] [^acd6a391] [^7e83e38a].

For this patient, use **double-layer uterine closure** with absorbable suture to reduce uterine rupture risk in future pregnancies [^72d884b5] [^7e83e38a]. Do not close the peritoneum, as non-closure reduces operative time and pain without increasing complications [^2ca88547] [^aa41db9a]. Close the subcutaneous tissue because it is≥ 2 cm, as this reduces wound complications [^3c58860d] [^c9da89c3]. Close the skin with a subcuticular absorbable monofilament suture, which lowers wound separation and infection compared with staples [^4243ed78] [^6296b549].

## Uterine incision closure

- **Technique**: Double-layer closure with absorbable suture (e.g. polyglactin 910) is recommended to reduce the risk of uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies [^72d884b5] [^7e83e38a].

- **Rationale**: Double-layer closure provides stronger apposition and healing, reducing the risk of uterine rupture and dehiscence in future pregnancies [^notfound].

---

## Peritoneal closure

- **Technique**: Non-closure of both visceral and parietal peritoneum is recommended [^2ca88547] [^aa41db9a].

- **Rationale**: Non-closure reduces operative time, postoperative pain, and hospital stay without increasing the risk of adhesion formation or other complications [^2ca88547] [^6249220f].

---

## Subcutaneous tissue closure

- **Technique**: Closure of the subcutaneous tissue is recommended when the thickness is≥ 2 cm, using absorbable suture (e.g. polyglactin 910) [^3c58860d] [^c9da89c3].

- **Rationale**: Closure of subcutaneous tissue reduces the risk of wound complications such as seroma, hematoma, and wound disruption [^c9da89c3] [^8161f378].

---

## Skin closure

- **Technique**: Subcuticular closure with absorbable monofilament suture (e.g. poliglecaprone) is recommended [^6296b549] [^d828f274].

- **Rationale**: Subcuticular suture closure reduces wound separation, infection, and improves cosmetic outcomes compared to staples [^4243ed78] [^c5345c58].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Layer** | **Recommended technique** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Uterine incision | Double-layer closure with absorbable suture | Reduces risk of uterine rupture in future pregnancies [^72d884b5] [^7e83e38a] |
| Peritoneum | Non-closure | Reduces operative time, pain, and hospital stay without increasing complications [^2ca88547] [^6249220f] |
| Subcutaneous tissue | Closure with absorbable suture (≥ 2 cm) | Reduces wound complications [^3c58860d] [^c9da89c3] |
| Skin | Subcuticular closure with absorbable monofilament suture | Reduces wound separation, infection, and improves cosmesis [^4243ed78] [^6296b549] |

### Evidence-based surgery for cesarean delivery [^afac1f8f]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to provide evidenced-based guidance for surgical decisions during cesarean delivery.

Study Design

We performed MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and COCHRANE searches with the terms cesarean section, cesarean delivery, cesarean, pregnancy, randomized trials, and each technical aspect of cesarean delivery. All randomized trials that covered a surgical aspect of cesarean delivery were included in the review. Each surgical step of cesarean delivery was reviewed separately.

Results

US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations favor blunt uterine incision expansion, prophylactic antibiotics (either ampicillin or first-generation cephalosporin for just 1 dose), spontaneous placental removal, non-closure of both visceral and parietal peritoneum, and suture closure or drain of the subcutaneous tissue when thickness is > or =2 cm.

Conclusion

Cesarean delivery techniques that are supported by good quality recommendations should be performed routinely. All technical aspects that have recommendations with lower quality should be researched with adequately powered and designed trials.

### FIGO good practice recommendations on surgical techniques to improve safety and reduce complications during cesarean delivery [^3c303ad4]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

FIGO is actively contributing to the global effort to reduce maternal morbidity, mortality, and disability worldwide. Cesarean delivery rates are increasing globally, without signs of slowing down. Bleeding associated with cesarean delivery has become an important cause of hemorrhage-related maternal deaths in many low- and middle-income countries. Correct surgical techniques to improve safety and reduce complications of cesarean delivery is of the utmost importance. This article presents FIGO's good practice recommendations for effective surgical techniques to reduce cesarean complications. Evidence-based information is included where data are available. An expanded WHO Surgical Safety Checklist for maternity cases is suggested. Different incision techniques through the layers of the abdominal wall with appropriate indications are discussed. Hysterotomy through a transverse incision is described, as are indications for low vertical and classical incisions. Important precautions when extracting the fetus are explained. Uterine closure includes a safe method ensuring adequate reapproximation of the upper segment if a vertical incision is made. The paper concludes with the management of two common bleeding problems following delivery of the placenta.

### Evidence-based surgery for cesarean delivery: an updated systematic review [^1aab7ec4]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of our systematic review was to provide updated evidence-based guidance for surgical decisions during cesarean delivery (CD). We performed an English-language MEDLINE, PubMed, and COCHRANE search with the terms, cesarean section, cesarean delivery, cesarean, pregnancy, and randomized trials, plus each technical aspect of CD. Randomized control trials (RCTs) involving any aspect of CD technique from Jan. 1, 2005, to Sept. 1, 2012, were evaluated to update a previous systematic review. We also summarized Cochrane reviews, systematic reviews, and metaanalyses if they included additional RCTs since this review. We identified 73 RCTs, 10 metaanalyses and/or systematic reviews, and 12 Cochrane reviews during this time frame. Recommendations with high levels of certainty as defined by the US Preventive Services Task Force favor pre-skin incision prophylactic antibiotics, cephalad-caudad blunt uterine extension, spontaneous placental removal, surgeon preference on uterine exteriorization, single-layer uterine closure when future fertility is undesired, and suture closure of the subcutaneous tissue when thickness is 2 cm or greater and do not favor manual cervical dilation, subcutaneous drains, or supplemental oxygen for the reduction of morbidity from infection. The technical aspect of CD with high-quality, evidence-based recommendations should be adopted. Although 73 RCTs over the past 8 years is encouraging, additional well-designed, adequately powered trials on the specific technical aspects of CD are warranted.

### Evidence-based cesarean delivery: intraoperative management following placental delivery until skin closure (part 9) [^7e83e38a]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2025). Medium credibility.

This expert review provides recommendations for the cesarean delivery technique after placental delivery to skin closure. After placental delivery sponge curettage may be omitted as it has not been shown to decrease the risk of retained products of conception. Uterine irrigation and mechanical cervical dilation cannot be recommended. Either intra-abdominal or extra-abdominal repair of the hysterotomy is acceptable, with some possible benefits, such as decreased postoperative pain and nausea/vomiting with intra-abdominal repair. There is insufficient evidence to recommend one uterine closure technique over the other with regards to suture type, continuous versus interrupted, locking or non-locking, and one versus two-layer closure. Double-layer uterine closure has been shown to be more beneficial with regards to residual myometrial thickness, and full thickness bites (including the endometrium) should be considered. Glove change by the surgical team is recommended after placental delivery and before closure of the abdominal wall. The following techniques are not recommended: intra-abdominal irrigation, use of adhesion prevention barriers, peritoneal closure, and rectus muscle reapproximation. Based on non-cesarean delivery evidence, fascial closure bites should be at least 5 × 5 mm, with monofilament suture for vertical incisions. As an adjunct to postoperative pain control, surgeons may consider wound infiltration with local anesthesia, either supra- or subfascial. Before closure, subcutaneous irrigation may be performed using saline solution, and routine use of subcutaneous drains is not recommended. Although closure of the subcutaneous layer can be considered in all patients, it should occur when the depth is ≥2 cm. A monofilament absorbable suture, such as poliglecaprone, should be used to close the cesarean skin incision. There is no level 1 evidence evaluating the potential benefit of additional skin adhesive or sterile strips after suture skin closure. If a dressing is preferred over the skin incision, the following approaches may be considered: a dialkylcarbamoyl chloride-impregnated dressing if available or a standard gauze dressing is appropriate. Prophylactic negative pressure wound therapy can be considered in patients with obesity. Vaginal seeding during cesarean delivery is not recommended.

### Surgical techniques for uterine incision and uterine closure at the time of caesarean section [^af992a5e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Caesarean section is a common operation. Techniques vary depending on both the clinical situation and the preferences of the operator.

Objectives

To compare the effects of 1) different types of uterine incision, 2) methods of performing the uterine incision, 3) suture materials and technique of uterine closure (including single versus double layer closure of the uterine incision) on maternal health, infant health, and healthcare resource use.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (1 September 2013) and reference lists of all identified papers.

Selection Criteria

All published, unpublished, and ongoing randomised controlled trials comparing various types and closure of uterine incision during caesarean section.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors evaluated trials for inclusion and methodological quality without consideration of their results according to the stated eligibility criteria and extracted data independently.

Main Results

Our search strategy identified 60 studies for consideration, of which 27 randomised trials involving 17,808 women undergoing caesarean section were included in the review. Overall, the methodological quality of the trials was variable, with 12 of the 27 included trials adequately describing the randomisation sequence, with less than half describing adequately methods of allocation concealment, and only six trials indicating blinding of outcome assessors.Two trials compared auto-suture devices with traditional hysterotomy involving 300 women. No statistically significant difference in febrile morbidity between the stapler and conventional incision groups was apparent (risk ratio (RR) 0.92; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 2.20).Five studies were included in the review that compared blunt versus sharp dissection when performing the uterine incision involving 2141 women. There were no statistically significant differences identified for the primary outcome febrile morbidity following blunt or sharp extension of the uterine incision (four studies; 1941 women; RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.05). Mean blood loss (two studies; 1145 women; average mean difference (MD) -55.00 mL; 95% CI -79.48 to -30.52), and the need for blood transfusion (two studies; 1345 women; RR 0.24; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.62) were significantly lower following blunt extension.A single trial compared transverse with cephalad-caudad blunt extension of the uterine incision, involving 811 women, and while mean blood loss was reported to be lower following transverse extension (one study; 811 women; MD 42.00 mL; 95% CI 1.31 to 82.69), the clinical significance of such a small volume difference is of uncertain clinical relevance. There were no other statistically significant differences identified for the limited outcomes reported.A single trial comparing chromic catgut with polygactin-910, involving 9544 women reported that catgut closure versus closure with polygactin was associated with a significant reduction in the need for blood transfusion (one study, 9544 women, RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.76) and a significant reduction in complications requiring re-laparotomy (one study, 9544 women, RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.89).Nineteen studies were identified comparing single layer with double layer closure of the uterus, with data contributed to the meta-analyses from 14 studies. There were no statistically significant differences identified for the primary outcome, febrile morbidity (nine studies; 13,890 women; RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.12). Although the meta-analysis suggested single layer closure was associated with a reduction in mean blood loss, heterogeneity is high and this limits the clinical applicability of the result. There were no differences identified in risk of blood transfusion (four studies; 13,571 women; average RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.17; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.15; I² = 49%), or other reported clinical outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Caesarean section is a common procedure performed on women worldwide. There is increasing evidence that for many techniques, short-term maternal outcomes are equivalent. Until long-term health effects are known, surgeons should continue to use the techniques they prefer and currently use.

### The value of subcutaneous tissue closure and drain in obese women undergo elective caesarean section: a randomized controlled trial [^950c027c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

All participants were subjected to complete assessment through history and examination to ensure adherence to the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. All women were assessed by obstetric ultrasound to confirm fetal viability, gestational age, placental site and other routine evaluation. Participants were randomized the night before surgery using a computer-generated random numbers into 4 groups: group I (n = 89) were allocated for interrupted closure of subcutaneous tissue with insertion of subrectus drain, group II (n = 88) were allocated for interrupted closure of subcutaneous tissue, group III (n = 88) were allocated for insertion of subrectus drain, group IV (n = 87) were allocated for non-closure of subcutaneous tissue without insertion of subrectus drain.

All women received prophylactic antibiotics (2 g of cefazolin) 30–60 min before the operation.

The operation started by induction of spinal anaesthesia after preload with 20 ml per kilogram body weight of 6% hydroxyl ethyl starch or ringer’s lactate through 18G cannula followed by injection of 10 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivicaine and 20 mg of fentanyl through 25G spinal needle inserted between lumbar vertebrae 3 and 4.

All operations were conducted by obstetricians with close surgical experience using the same technique. The operation started by a transverse incision (Pfannenstiel incision) with sharp dissection through the subcutaneous tissue, Incision of the fascia at midline, separation of the fascial sheath from the underlying rectus muscles, dissection of the transversalis fascia and preperitoneal fat to reach the underlying peritoneum which was incised sharply, the reflection of peritoneum above the upper margin of the bladder and overlying the anterior lower uterine segment termed the bladder flap was grasped in the midline with forceps and incised transversely with scissors.Bladder flap creation effectively moves the bladder away from the planned hysterotomy site and prevents bladder laceration if an unintended inferior hysterotomy extension occurs during fetal delivery, delivery of the Fetus and placenta, the uterine incision then closed with two layers of continuous No.1 absorbable suture polyglactin 910 (Vicryl), rectus fascia was closed by a continuous, nonlocking technique with a delayed absorbable suture of vicryl No 1. Skin was closed with a running subcuticular stitch using 2–0 non-absorbable suture.

### Techniques and materials for skin closure in caesarean section [^42d65ff0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Caesarean section is a common operation with no agreed upon standard regarding certain operative techniques or materials to use. With regard to skin closure, the skin incision can be re-approximated by a subcuticular suture immediately below the skin layer, by an interrupted suture, or by staples. A great variety of materials and techniques are used for skin closure after caesarean section and there is a need to identify which provide the best outcomes for women.

Objectives

To compare the effects of skin closure techniques and materials on maternal and operative outcomes after caesarean section.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (10 January 2012).

Selection Criteria

All randomized trials comparing different skin closure materials in caesareans were selected. Two review authors independently abstracted the data.

Data Collection and Analysis

We identified 19 trials and included 11, but only eight trials contributed data. Three trials were not randomized controlled trials; two were ongoing; one study was terminated and the results were not available for review; one is awaiting classification; and one did not compare skin closure materials, but rather suture to suture and drain placement.

Main Results

The two methods of skin closure for caesarean that have been most often compared are non-absorbable staples and absorbable subcutaneous sutures. Compared with absorbable subcutaneous sutures, non-absorbable staples are associated with similar incidences of wound infection. Other important secondary outcomes, such as wound complications, were also similar between the groups in women with Pfannenstiel incisions. However, it is important to note, that for both of these outcomes (wound infection and wound complication), staples may have a differential effect depending on the type of skin incision, i.e., Pfannenstiel or vertical. Compared with absorbable subcutaneous sutures, non-absorbable staples are associated with an increased risk of skin separation, and therefore, reclosure. However, skin separation was variably defined across trials, and most staples were removed before four days postpartum.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no conclusive evidence about how the skin should be closed after caesarean section. Staples are associated with similar outcomes in terms of wound infection, pain and cosmesis compared with sutures, and these two are the most commonly studied methods for skin closure after caesarean section. If staples are removed on day three, there is an increased incidence of skin separation and the need for reclosure compared with absorbable sutures.

STANDARDIZED CESAREAN DELIVERY SURGICAL TECHNIQUE

Skin, Subcutaneous Tissue, Fascia, and Peritoneum Entry

Studies that report surgical approaches to abdominal entry were often associated with specific procedural techniques (Joel-Cohen, Misgav-Ladach, or Pfannenstiel methods). Although the location of the transverse skin incision between the Pfannenstiel and Joel-Cohen varies slightly, the primary difference in these techniques involves sharp compared with blunt dissection and expansion of tissue layers after the skin incision. Since the 2013 review, there have been six additional RCTs and one Cochrane Review on these techniques, with primary outcomes including operative time, postoperative analgesia requirements, febrile morbidity, blood loss, and duration of hospital stay.– Techniques that incorporated sharp dissection and blunt tissue expansion and entry were favored and supported by the Cochrane Review.

Recommendation: transverse skin incision 2–3 cm above the pubic symphysis, sharp subcutaneous and fascia dissection, blunt subcutaneous and fascia expansion with the omission of superior and inferior fascia dissection, and blunt peritoneal entry.

Bladder Flap Development

Previously, bladder flap development was not recommended with a moderate level of certainty.Two additional RCTs and one systematic review strengthen this recommendation. – Omission of a bladder flap significantly reduces operative time as well as short-term and long-term bladder symptoms with no difference in intraoperative bladder injury rate.

Recommendation: omit bladder flap development.

Uterine Incision and Expansion

Sharp transverse uterine incision 2–3 cm, blunt uterine entry and cephalad-caudad expansion was previously recommended with a high level of certainty.Two RCTs and four systematic reviews have since been published supporting this technique as it is associated with fewer unintended extensions. –

Recommendation: sharp 2–3-cm transverse uterine incision, blunt entry, cephalad-caudad expansion.

Placenta Removal

Spontaneous removal of the placenta was previously recommended with a high level of certainty.Four additional RCTs have since been published. – The largest trial of 574 women demonstrated spontaneous placenta removal had a significant decrease in blood loss compared with manual removal.

Recommendation: spontaneous placenta removal.

Intrauterine Wiping

Previously, there was insufficient evidence to favor intrauterine cleaning after placental delivery based on the lack of any RCTs.One RCT of 206 women since did not demonstrate any benefit of this technique.

Recommendation: perform intrauterine wiping only when placental membranes are seen.

### Regional analgesia for cesarean delivery: a narrative review toward enhancing outcomes in parturients [^b231a95f]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Cesarean Delivery: Surgical Techniques and Anatomic Information

There are multiple surgical approaches to cesarean delivery. For simplicity, most techniques vary by location and direction of both the incision through the skin and the uterus. Either may be incised vertically or horizontally and at varying locations. Our review is limited to discussion of the lower-segment transverse hysterotomy with a transverse skin incision, otherwise known as the Pfannenstiel-Kerr approach. Alternative techniques to cesarean section exist but are less common. Therefore, they are not the focus of our literature review.

The most common skin incision for cesarean section is the low transverse incision, which has been shown to decrease postoperative pain, incur a lower risk of complications including wound dehiscence/infection/hernia development, and attain better cosmetic results than a midline vertical incision.The location and curvature of this incision may vary by technique but the most common worldwide is the Pfannenstiel, a curved incision a few centimeters above the level of the pubic symphysis, and the Joel-Cohen, a straight incision roughly 3cm caudal to an imagined horizontal line connecting the anterior superior iliac spines. After skin incision, the subcutaneous tissue and the fascial layers are commonly dissected bluntly. The rectus muscle may be dissected bluntly or divided vertically with scissors. The approach to the uterine incision depends on many factors, including gestational age, fetal and placental location, and acuity of operation. The most common hysterotomy is the Kerr incision, a transverse incision of the lower uterine segment. It has been shown to decrease blood loss, lower the risk of bladder injury, and lower the risk of future gestation uterine rupture when compared to vertical incision.The uterine incision is then expanded, after which the newborn and placenta are removed. Closure of the above layers then follows.

### Evidence-based surgical procedures to optimize caesarean outcomes: an overview of systematic reviews [^90820110]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

We conducted this overview according to the recommendations proposed by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.and present it according to the PRIOR reporting guideline.

The protocol for this overview was registered at Prospero (CRD 42023208306,).

Types of studies

We included all published SRs of RCTs that examined the effectiveness and/or safety of patient-focused surgical procedures related to CS in humans. We excluded SRs of studies with other designs (e.g. cohorts, case-controls or before-and-after), and SR protocols.

Type of participants

We included SRs of studies involving women of any age, race, socioeconomic condition or parity, with a singleton or multiple pregnancy at any gestational age, with any foetal presentation, undergoing primary or repeat, elective or emergency CS in the first or second stage of a spontaneous or induced labour, under any type of anaesthesia. SRs that only included studies that assessed procedures in patients with specific health conditions (e.g. diabetes, obesity, HIV) were excluded.

Type of interventions

We included SRs that assessed at least one of a pre-specified list of CS related surgical procedures conducted in the operating theatre by health care providers: skin cleansing; use of adhesive drape; abdominal incision (skin incision, subcutaneous incision, fascial incision, rectus incision/dissection, peritoneum incision); use of retractors; use of aspiration device throughout the surgery; use of surgical swabs; bladder flap; uterine incision and expansion; foetal extraction; timing of umbilical cord clamping; placental extraction; cervical dilatation; uterine cleansing; uterine exteriorization; uterine closure; abdominal irrigation; changing gloves/double gloving; abdominal closure (peritoneum closure, rectus closure, fascial closure, subcutaneous closure, skin closure); use of drains; wound dressing.

The list of procedures was developed based on the Coronis Trial,international guidelines,,,,,,clinical and research experience of the overview authors, and informal consultation with international health professionals working in the field. As comparators we utilized the alternative interventions used by the original systematic review authors. Depending on the review, this could refer to no treatment or another treatment or intervention.

### Cesarean section: one procedure, varied techniques. detailed observations of 1013 first cesarean sections in a tertiary hospital in Ghana [^59dd3856]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Cesarean sections (CS) are among the most performed surgical procedures in the world. Small variations in surgical techniques could have a significant impact on a global scale, for example, in postoperative complications. In the present study we aimed to observe and audit every single step used during first time CS.

Methods

Descriptive cross-sectional study from January 1, 2018 to January 14, 2020 at a tertiary hospital in Ghana. Techniques used for CS were directly observed and thoroughly documented. Standard descriptive methods were used for data analysis.

Results

Of the 1013 first time CS, 81.4% were emergency procedures. The mean (SD) gestational age at CS was 38.4±3weeks. Low transverse incision was used in 993/1013 (98%) of cases. Blunt dissection of subcuticular tissue was done in 48/1013 (4.7%), blunt separation of rectus fascia in 386/1013 (38.1%), blunt opening of peritoneum in 838/1013 (82.7%) and lower uterine segment incision with scalpel in 995/1013 (98.2%) women. A total of 916/1013 (90.4%) had double layered uterine closure, 961/1013 (94.9%) had uterus exteriorized for repair, 382/1013 (37.7%) had closure of the peritoneum, 655/1013 (64.7%) had non-closure of the rectus muscle, 677/1013 (66.8%) had subcutaneous tissue closed and 983/1013 (97.0%) had skin closed with subcuticular stitches. There were 493 different combinations of techniques observed performed by 85 surgeons for carrying out a complete first time CS.

Conclusion

There is a wide variety of methods used for first time CS. There is the need for training and retraining on the techniques for CS using evidence-based guidelines.

### Skin and subcutaneous fascia closure at caesarean section to reduce wound complications: the closure randomised trial [^fab0ee43]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Caesarean section is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures for women worldwide. Rates of caesarean section vary widely globally, from as low as 5% in predominantly low-income countries, to as high as 47% in some high-income countries. While the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended a caesarean section rate no higher than 15%, it is acknowledged that the “optimal” caesarean section rate is not known. Among developed health care settings, approximately 30% of women will birth via caesarean section.

Women who birth by caesarean section have a 5 to 20 times increased risk of peri-partum infective complications, compared with women who birth vaginally. Surgical site infections have been reported to occur in up to 12% of procedures. Additionally, wound complications such as haematoma, seroma and dehiscence can complicate recovery after caesarean section, all of which may have a negative impact on postnatal maternal health and wellbeing, a woman’s ability to care for her infant, and her overall experience of the postnatal period.

Operative techniques vary widely between surgeons. While skin closure with staples compared with a subcuticular suture has been associated with an increased risk of postoperative wound complication in one systematic review which included observational data, this difference was not observed when considering data from randomised trials only. It is not known which (if any) type of skin suture is preferable. A systematic review of 10 trials of closure or non-closure of the subcutaneous fascia found a significant reduction in wound seroma but not in wound haematoma or infection. The choice of suture material for skin closure and the decision to close the subcutaneous fascia can potentially influence the risk of wound infection and complications. There is currently insufficient evidence to guide practitioners as to the optimal technique to adopt.

We performed a 2 × 2 factorial randomised trial comparing the effects of absorbable versus non-absorbable skin suture, and closure or non-closure of the subcutaneous fascia, on wound infection and complication rates.

### Skin and subcutaneous fascia closure at caesarean section to reduce wound complications: the closure randomised trial [^ccf4fa7e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Use of non-absorbable skin suture should be considered at caesarean section, as should consideration of closure of the subcutaneous fascia. These findings may be of significant clinical relevance in light of increasing rates of maternal overweight and obesity. Further research should consider fascia closure or non-closure in women with high BMI and the appropriate skin suture material in this population.

### CORONIS-international study of caesarean section surgical techniques: the follow-up study [^7bab5584]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

The CORONIS Trial

The objectives of the CORONIS Trial are to determine whether there are any differences in short-term maternal morbidity when comparing five pairs of alternative surgical techniques undertaken during the time of caesarean section. Information was collected at trial entry, immediately following the operation, at discharge from hospital and at six weeks after delivery. The CORONIS Trial protocol has been published and can be downloaded free at.

Trial eligibility

Women are eligible for trial entry if they are undergoing delivery by lower segment caesarean section through a transverse abdominal incision, irrespective of fever in labour, gestational age or whether they have a multiple pregnancy.

Women are not eligible if: (i) there is a clear indication for a particular surgical technique or material to be used that prevents any of the allocated interventions being used; (ii) they have had more than one previous caesarean section; (iii) they have already been recruited into the trial during a previous pregnancy.

Trial primary outcome

Death or maternal infectious morbidity (one or more of the following: antibiotic use for maternal febrile morbidity during postnatal hospital stay, antibiotic use for endometritis, wound infection or peritonitis) or further operative procedures; or blood transfusion (>1 unit of whole blood or packed cells).

Trial interventions

There are five pairs of interventions being tested in the trial; however, each participating hospital only takes part in three of these five possible comparisons. The non-allocated comparisons and all other aspects of the caesarean section are performed at the discretion of the surgeon.

1. Blunt versus sharp abdominal entry

2. Exteriorisation of the uterus for repair versus intra-abdominal repair

3. Single versus double layer closure of the uterus

4. Closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum (pelvic and parietal)

5. Chromic catgut versus Polyglactin-910 for uterine repair

### The stark (misgav ladach) cesarean delivery-a streamlined surgical technique: development, rationale, and clinical outcomes [^36deb56f]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cesarean delivery (CD) rates have risen globally, yet many steps of the procedure remain unstandardized. Wide variation in abdominal and uterine incisions, peritoneal handling, and closure techniques hinders meaningful comparisons of outcomes. To improve outcomes and facilitate comparison among surgeons and hospitals, a standardized surgical approach was developed at the Misgav Ladach Hospital through an iterative, critical evaluation of each operative step. Guided by minimally invasive surgical principles, the method favors gentle separation along natural anatomical planes, reducing trauma and the need for dissection. Only essential steps were retained and optimized, resulting in what is now termed the Stark (Misgav Ladach) Cesarean technique. Over 30 years of implementation, both in low- and high-resource settings, has demonstrated superior outcomes compared with conventional methods. These include shorter skin-to-delivery time, reduction in blood loss and febrile morbidity, fewer adhesions and decreased need for analgesics.

Objective

This article aims to describe the surgical steps and rationale of the Stark (Misgav Ladach) Cesarean Delivery as a guideline suggestion for the global implementation of this method and as a model for standardization for other surgical procedures.

### Skin and subcutaneous fascia closure at caesarean section to reduce wound complications: the closure randomised trial [^5df654ac]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

A major strength of our study is the large sample size of 851 women randomised. To our knowledge, this represents the largest randomised trial of wound closure techniques published to date. Although we did not attain our pre-specified sample size of 1230 women due to slow recruitment, our results represent a significant addition to the published literature on the effect of different wound and subcutaneous fascia closure techniques on wound infection and complication rates. However, this study remains underpowered for the primary outcome, with a lower than anticipated rate of both wound infection and associated complications rates, and the possibility of synergistic effects between the two interventions, a much larger sample size would be required to properly study these techniques.

Our finding of a statistically significant increased relative risk of wound infection among women who had fascia closure and skin closure with an absorbable suture is supported by the direction of the effect estimate towards a lower relative risk of wound infection among women who underwent fascia closure and skin closure with a non-absorbable suture, despite this effect estimate not being statistically significant. Additionally, while there were too few events to allow for effect estimates to be calculated with regards to our secondary outcome of wound reoperation, four out of five women who underwent a wound reoperation had undergone fascia closure and skin closure with an absorbable suture, further supporting our findings.

### The case for standardizing cesarean delivery technique: seeing the forest for the trees [^56955db7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Uterine Closure

Optimal uterine closure remains one of the most studied and controversial aspects of cesarean delivery. Eleven additional RCTs and four systematic reviews have been performed since the previous review.–,,– Two RCTs were also performed comparing barbed suture compared with standard suture for uterine closure. In addition to single- compared with two-layer closure, a distinction is made in some RCTs regarding locked or unlocked suture technique. Primary outcomes vary between operating time, blood loss, and postpartum ultrasound measurement of the residual myometrial thickness. These studies suggest that two-layer closure, in particular when the first layer is closed in an unlocked fashion, likely results in the thickest residual myometrial thickness, a finding not clearly associated with clinical outcomes.

The strongest clinically relevant data regarding single- or two-layer closure are from the 3-year follow-up of the CORONIS trial.Of the original 9,200 women randomized to single- or double-layer closure, approximately 1,600 women in each group had subsequent viable pregnancies within 3 years. In those with single-layer closure of the uterus, only 5 of 1,610 experienced uterine rupture or scar dehiscence compared with 4 of 1,624 in the two-layer closure group. Importantly, 3 of 674 in the single layer group and 4 of 680 in the double layer arm experienced this outcome while in labor. Placenta previa or morbidly adherent placenta were both similarly rare and not significantly different between groups. –

Recommendation: single-layer uterine closure.

Intra-abdominal Irrigation

Routine intra-abdominal irrigation was not recommended based on the findings of two RCTs.Since then, one RCT and one systematic review strengthen these recommendations. Intra-abdominal irrigation has consistently been shown to increase intraoperative and postoperative nausea, increased antiemetics use, and no reduction in infection rate.

Recommendation: omit intra-abdominal irrigation.

Peritoneal Closure

Closure compared with nonclosure of the parietal peritoneum was one of the most studied technical steps in the previous review with no clear benefit of either surgical approach.One RCT and one systematic review have been performed since then and it was also a technical step included in the CORONIS trial. –,, There was no difference in short-term or long-term outcomes between groups in this trial and no clear benefit demonstrated in the Cochrane Review.

Recommendation: omit peritoneal closure.

### The value of subcutaneous tissue closure and drain in obese women undergo elective caesarean section: a randomized controlled trial [^015b73c3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cesarean delivery (CD) is the commonest surgical procedures conducted all over the world with over one million operations conducted in the United States only yearly.

Worldwide, CD rates exceed 21% of all births which is higher than the WHO recommended rates of 10–15%. CD rates increased in both well developed and underdeveloped countries, but the incidence vary largely among developing countries ranging from < 5% in sub-Saharan Africa to reach > 50% in Egypt.

Although CD can be a lifesaving procedure in some cases and is associated with lower risk of maternal pelvic floor and neonatal birth injuries, the maternal morbidity during CD is twice its equivalent during vaginal births.

These risks included higher rates of hemorrhage, infections, anesthetic, thromboembolic complications, and even death. Later risks in future pregnancies include uterine rupture and placenta accretta spectrum.

The rate of primary CD is higher in obese women undergoing trial of labor. It reaches 23–49% and positively correlates with maternal body mass index (23–46%, 30–47%, 45–49% for BMI ≥ 30, ≥ 40 and ≥ 50 kg/m 2 respectively). The most common indications for cesarean delivery are arrest of labor (61%) and non-reassuring fetal heart rate (28%).

CD in obese women carries a higher risk of peri-operative surgical and anesthetic complications. These include infections, increased blood loss, and longer operative times and thromboembolic events.

Surgical Site Infection (SSI) is the infection in the incision site that occurs within 30 days of the operation.

Wound complications including dehiscence and infection, affect 10% of obese women after CD and may reach 30% in morbidly obese women.

### Evidence-based surgical procedures to optimize caesarean outcomes: an overview of systematic reviews [^452f1d96]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Abdominal wall closure

Peritoneum closure

Non-closure of parietal peritoneum only, compared with closure of both layers, probably reduces postoperative pain, and time to mobilization and to oral intake (Table 6). Non-closure of visceral peritoneum only, compared with closure of both layers, reduces urinary frequency, urgency of urination and stress incontinence, and may reduce operating time, and postoperative hospital stay. Non-closure versus closure of both layers probably reduces operating time, chronic pelvic pain, and postoperative hospital stay, but it does not affect the risk of wound infection or need for additional analgesia after 24–48 h. For all other comparisons and outcomes in Table 6, the evidence is insufficient or uncertain.

Closure of other layers

There are no SRs assessing benefits and harms of fascia and rectus muscle closure or approximation (Table 7). Closure, compared with non-closure, of subcutaneous tissue reduces seroma formation and wound complications.

Skin closure

For subcuticular suture, PGA absorbable suture, compared with interrupted nylon suture, may increase the risk of forming a hypertrophic scar and monofilament suture, compared with multifilament suture, may reduce surgical site infection (Table 7). Skin closure using absorbable sutures, compared with non-absorbable metal staples, probably reduces the risk of wound separation. The use of staples, compared with absorbable subcuticular sutures, probably has no effect on the length of the maternal stay but probably increases the risk of skin separation. The use of clips, compared to sutures, probably decreases skin closure time but probably increases the risk of wound separation. For all other comparisons and outcomes in Tables 6 and 7, the evidence is insufficient or uncertain.

Wound drain and dressing

Using versus not using a wound drain does not affect need for postoperative analgesia or breastfeeding at hospital discharge (Table 8). The use of a subcutaneous, compared to a sub-sheath, drain may increase the risk of wound infection. The use of advanced DACC-impregnated dressing, compared with simple dressing, may reduce SSI. Negative pressure wound therapy, compared with standard dressing, reduces SSI and probably reduces superficial SSI, but has no effect on the risk of dehiscence or deep SSI, and may increase skin blisters. For all other comparisons and outcomes in Table 8, the evidence is insufficient or uncertain.

### CORONIS-international study of caesarean section surgical techniques: the follow-up study [^bdaa95d6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Factorial trials

Factorial trials maximise the efficiency of a trial by including more than one trial question into a single trial population. Instead of having one trial which compares, for example, single versus double layer closure of the uterine incision and another trial comparing closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum, both comparisons can be combined into one trial using only the number of women necessary to answer one of these questions in isolation. In the CORONIS Trial, five comparisons have been carried out in one trial. Such a design has rarely been used, but is appropriate for the evaluation of several procedures which will be used together in clinical practice. In such a trial of different caesarean section techniques, using five pairs of possible allocated interventions (1 versus “not 1”, 2 versus “not 2”, 3 vs. versus “not 3”, 4 versus “not 4”, 5 versus “not 5”), participants can receive one of 32 possible alternatives.

In the analysis of a factorial trial the same process is used for a 2×2×2×2×2 factorial design as for a 2×2 factorial design. All those allocated 1 are compared with all those allocated “not 1” regardless of what other interventions were allocated, provided that there is no interaction.

### Evidence-based cesarean delivery: intraoperative management from skin incision until placental delivery (part 8) [^53a7e938]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2025). Medium credibility.

The goal of standardizing the technique of the routine, uncomplicated cesarean delivery (CD) is to decrease maternal morbidity while optimizing neonatal outcomes. During the procedure, a family-oriented CD is recommended. The low transverse cesarean skin incision (created with either scalpel or diathermy) is preferred with either the Joel-Cohen or Pfannenstiel methods being acceptable. For patients with obesity (BMI > 35kg/m 2 ), surgeons may also elect either the Cohen (including supraumbilical) or Pfannenstiel (infraumbilical or infrapannus) technique as there are similar outcomes, however the Cohen approach has been associated with lower Apgar scores and decreased surgeon satisfaction related to the feasibility of the incision. Diathermy may be preferred for subcutaneous tissue opening as compared to sharp dissection. Though postoperative recovery outcomes may be improved with an extraperitoneal approach to CD, a transperitoneal technique is the current standard of care. The initial fascial incision is made sharply, further extension can be carried out either sharply or bluntly. Inferior dissection of the rectus muscle can be omitted and routine cutting of the muscles is not needed. If necessary, a Maylard modification is acceptable. Though based on limited data, blunt peritoneal entry and extension should be considered. With regards to uterine entry and delivery: bladder flap creation should be omitted, a low transverse hysterotomy is recommended with blunt cephalo-caudad expansion, and manual delivery of the fetal head should be performed. If the fetal head is impacted, then reverse breech extraction may be preferred for maternal benefit. Delayed cord clamping is recommended for at least 30 seconds and up to 120 seconds (recommended for preterm deliveries) with either routine or selected umbilical cord gas collection being considered. In areas where available, carbetocin is more effective in prevention of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Otherwise, the combination of oxytocin plus either misoprostol or methergine should be utilized. There is insufficient evidence regarding the effectiveness of uterine massage for PPH prevention. Spontaneous removal of the placenta with gentle cord traction is recommended.

### Caesarean section surgical techniques: 3 year follow-up of the CORONIS fractional, factorial, unmasked, randomised controlled trial [^a6976a5f]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

In this CORONIS follow-up study, we aimed to measure and compare the incidence of outcomes between the groups of women who took part in the CORONIS trial at least 3 years after their CORONIS caesarean section. Thefor the follow-up study has been published.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Before this follow-up study, several reviews, including Cochrane systematic reviews, had synthesised available evidence of the different surgical techniques included in the CORONIS trial. Based on this evidence, clinical practice guidelines had been made with recommendations about the different approaches. However, most evidence for this guidance came from studies that rarely measured outcomes beyond the immediate postoperative period. With regards to blunt versus sharp abdominal entry, for exteriorisation versus intra-abdominal repair of the uterus, no studies compared long-term outcomes for this intervention pair. For single versus double layer closure of the uterine incision, uterine scar integrity after single versus double layer uterine closure had been assessed in the longer term. A systematic review of observational studies failed to find evidence of a clear association between single layer closure and uterine rupture. For closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum and for subsequent intra-abdominal adhesions, studies only followed up women who had a subsequent laparotomy (including a repeat caesarean section) or laparoscopy. Two systematic reviews looked at the longer term effect of closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum on adhesion formation. Both reviews agreed that the available evidence is limited because most findings came from small observational studies that had a high risk of bias; the investigators suggested in their conclusions that non-closure of the peritoneum was associated with an increased risk of intra-abdominal adhesions, of all grades. For chromic catgut versus polyglactin-910 for uterine repair, no studies compared long term outcomes for this intervention pair.

### Techniques and materials for skin closure in caesarean section [^9787c83e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Caesarean section is a common operation with no agreed standard on operative techniques and materials to use. The skin layer can be repaired by sub cuticular stitch immediately below the skin layer, an interrupted stitch or with skin staples. A great variety of materials and techniques are used for skin closure after caesarean section and there is a need to identify which provide the best outcomes for women.

Objectives

To compare the effects of skin closure techniques and materials on maternal outcomes and time taken to perform a caesarean section.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (August 2002).

Selection Criteria

All randomised comparisons of skin closure techniques in caesarean section.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three papers were identified from the search. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. On further inspection two were not considered to be randomised controlled trials.

Main Results

Only one small randomised controlled trial, involving 66 women, was included in the review. Frishman et al compared staples with absorbable sub-cuticular suture for closure following caesarean section. While operating time was significantly shorter when using staples, the use of absorbable sub cuticular suture resulted in less postoperative pain and yielded a better cosmetic result at the post-operative visit.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is no conclusive evidence about how the skin should be closed after caesarean section. Questions regarding the best closure technique and material and the outcomes associated with each remain unanswered. The appearance and strength of the scar following caesarean section is important to women and the choice of technique and materials should be made by women in consultation with their obstetrician based on the limited information currently available.

### Skin and subcutaneous fascia closure at caesarean section to reduce wound complications: the closure randomised trial [^9961aff0]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Potentially at odds with this theory is the observation that women who had skin closure with a non-absorbable suture and did not have closure of the subcutaneous fascia had rates of infection similar to women with fascia closure and absorbable skin sutures. This may be due to an additive effect of two sources of an inflammatory response to foreign material and the possibility that closure of the subcutaneous fascia is somewhat protective from post-operative wound infection, particularly in a population of women where more than 60% have a BMI of 25 kg/m 2 or more.

It is generally acknowledged that routine closure of the subcutaneous fascia is not recommended, having not been shown to reduce the risk of wound infection (NICE guidelines 2015). Closure of fascia among women with more than two centimetres depth of subcutaneous fat to reduce wound infection, possibly secondary to elimination of wound dead space has been considered with mixed findings.

Maternal overweight and obesity is an increasingly common issue in current obstetric practice, with approximately 50% of women across developed countries entering pregnancy overweight or obese [,–]. Overweight and obesity represents a significant independent risk factor for wound infection, and at a population level, considering the use of non-absorbable, rather than absorbable skin sutures among women who require closure of the subcutaneous fascia may result in significant reductions in wound infection, and warrants further consideration.

### A simple checklist for preventing major complications associated with cesarean delivery [^f7e2342a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

I propose a simple, evidence-based, eight-item checklist that, if followed, should reduce the frequency of many of the most serious complications associated with cesarean delivery: endometritis, wound infection, wound disruption, thrombophlebitis, and uterine scar dehiscence in a subsequent pregnancy. The frequency of abdominal wound infections can be reduced significantly by using electric clippers, rather than a razor, to remove the hair at the site of the surgical incision, washing the skin with a chlorhexidine solution, and administering broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis before the start of surgery rather than after the neonate's umbilical cord has been clamped. Administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis and removal of the placenta by traction on the umbilical cord, rather than by manual extraction, will reduce the frequency of postcesarean endometritis. Closure of the uterine incision in two layers rather than one will significantly reduce the frequency of scar dehiscence in a subsequent pregnancy. Closure of the deep subcutaneous layer in patients whose subcutaneous tissue is greater than 2 cm in thickness will significantly reduce the risk of seroma, hematoma, and subsequent wound disruption. Institution of appropriate prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis in intermediate and high-risk patients will reduce the risk of subsequent thromboembolic events.

### Closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum at caesarean section [^42c7a3da]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Caesarean section is a very common surgical procedure world wide. Suturing the peritoneal layers at caesarean section may or may not confer benefit, hence the need to evaluate whether this step should be omitted or not.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of non-closure as an alternative to closure of the peritoneum at caesarean section on intra-operative, immediate and long-term postoperative and long-term outcomes.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (November 2002).

Selection Criteria

Controlled trials comparing leaving the visceral and/or parietal peritoneum unsutured at caesarean section with a technique which involves suturing the peritoneum in women undergoing elective or emergency caesarean section.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial quality was assessed and data were extracted by two reviewers.

Main Results

Nine trials involving 1811 women were included and analysed. The methodological quality of the trials was variable. Non-closure of the peritoneum reduced operating time whether both or either layer was not sutured. For both layers, the operating time was reduced by 7.33 minutes, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.43 to -6.24. There was significantly less postoperative fever and reduced postoperative stay in hospital for visceral peritoneum and for both layer non-closure. There were no other statistically significant differences. The trend for analgesia requirement and wound infection tended to favour non-closure, while endometritis results were variable. Long-term follow up in one trial showed no significant differences. The power of the study to show differences was low.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There was improved short-term postoperative outcome if the peritoneum was not closed. Long-term studies following caesarean section are limited, but data from other surgical procedures are reassuring. There is at present no evidence to justify the time taken and cost of peritoneal closure.

### FIGO good practice recommendations for vaginal birth after cesarean section [^f5d88754]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Unlocked single‐ or double‐layer closure of low uterine incision at previous cesarean section

A systematic review and meta‐analysis by Roberge et al.reported no significant difference between single‐ versus double‐layer closure for uterine scar dehiscence or uterine rupture. Despite lower residual myometrial thickness noted in women with single‐layer closure compared with those with double‐layer closure, there was no significant difference in the risk of uterine scar defect with single‐layer closure compared with double‐layer closure. A continuous, locked, single‐layer closure was coupled with a larger scar defect, which was also reported by Qayum et al.However, Bennich et al.reported that double‐layer closure did not increase residual myometrial thickness compared with single‐layer closure when an unlocked technique was used. More recent systematic reviews and meta‐analyses by Di Spiezio Sardo et al.and Qayum et al.have similarly shown that single‐ and double‐layer closure of the uterine incision following CS are associated with a similar incidence of cesarean scar defect, as well as uterine dehiscence and rupture in a subsequent pregnancy. Based on this evidence, we recommend that either a one‐ or a two‐layer closure technique is used; if a single‐layer closure is performed, a continuous unlocked technique should be used.

### Evidence-based surgical procedures to optimize caesarean outcomes: an overview of systematic reviews [^10f33c07]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Abdominal wall opening and related procedures

Preparation

There is evidence that cleaning the skin with chlorhexidine gluconate, compared with povidone iodine, probably reduces surgical site infections (SSI) (Table 2). Skin cleansing with chlorhexidine plus alcohol, compared with povidone iodine plus alcohol, may reduce SSI. For all other comparisons and outcomes on skin cleaning, the evidence is insufficient or uncertain. Also, there is insufficient or uncertain evidence on the effects of use versus non-use of adhesive drapes on SSI, metritis and length of stay.

Incision

There is no systematic review comparing the benefits or harms of different techniques and materials for opening each individual layer at CS (skin, subcutaneous tissue, fascia, rectus muscle, or peritoneum) (Table 3). Compared with the Pfannenstiel incision, the Joel-Cohen-based incision reduces fever and blood loss, and probably reduces time to oral intake, postoperative stay, operating time and skin incision to delivery time. Similarly, compared with lower midline (vertical) incision, the Joel-Cohen based (modified Misgav-Ladach) technique probably reduces blood loss, operating time, time to mobilization, and postoperative hospital stay. There is evidence that extraperitoneal, compared with intraperitoneal, caesarean reduces fever, and probably reduces serious complications. There is uncertain evidence on the effect of the type of scalpel used on wound infection and dehiscence. For all other comparisons for abdominal wall incision shown in Table 3, there is insufficient or uncertain evidence.

Intraabdominal procedures

Preparation

Using the O'ring retractor probably reduces the need for uterine exteriorization and increases adequate visualization (Table 4). There are no SRs assessing the use of aspiration devices or surgical swabs during CS. It is uncertain whether forming a bladder flap at CS has any effect on relevant outcomes.

Uterine incision

There are no SRs comparing vertical versus transverse hysterotomy (Table 4). Opening the uterus using blunt instead of sharp dissection/expansion reduces operative time, probably reduces blood loss, and may reduce the need for blood transfusion. The use of cephalad-caudal, compared with transversal expansion, probably reduces unintended incision extension and blood loss. For all other uterine incision-related comparisons and outcomes, including materials, shown in Table 4, there is insufficient or uncertain evidence.

Previously, skin closure with either staples or subcuticular suture was recommended based on nine RCTs or systematic reviews.Since then, 19 RCTs and one systematic review have been performed addressing skin closure techniques. – These trials range in a variety of comparisons, including subcuticular suture compared with staples, different staple removal times, subcuticular suture compared with subcuticular staples, interrupted compared with running subcuticular suture, monofilament compared with multifilament suture, or subcuticular suture compared with glue. In a meta-analysis of 12 RCTs, subcuticular suture closure significantly reduced wound morbidity with no difference in pain, patient satisfaction, or cosmesis.In trials that included women with obesity, subcuticular suture was superior to staples. One trial demonstrated that monofilament suture reduced wound complications compared with multifilament suture.

Recommendation: subcuticular, absorbable monofilament suture.

### The case for standardizing cesarean delivery technique: seeing the forest for the trees [^af57c961]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Recent guidelines for intraoperative care during cesarean delivery for enhanced recovery after surgery include eight standardized cesarean delivery techniques.As outlined in the guideline and supportive of the premise of this commentary, a standardized approach that removes unjustified variability can independently improve safety, efficiency and effectiveness in a health care system.

Regarding the benefit of a standardized surgical approach for resident training, consider the following example that likely rings true for any attending surgeon who supervises residents. A third-year obstetrics and gynecology resident and their attending are scrubbing in preparation for a scheduled cesarean delivery. While reviewing the patient’s clinical history, the resident benignly asks, “Remind me how many layers you like to close the uterus and how do you close the skin again?” Anyone who teaches residents has probably had this exact experience. The resident was focusing on remembering the nuanced technique that their attending preferred, rather than the approach with the strongest evidence basis behind it. Given the fact that many residents operate with dozens of attending surgeons during their training, each with their own “preferences,” it is clear that a more efficient and logical way to teach this common surgery is warranted and long overdue.

### Subcutaneous closure versus no subcutaneous closure after non-caesarean surgical procedures [^5874c650]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Most surgical procedures involve a cut in the skin that allows the surgeon to gain access to the surgical site. Most surgical wounds are closed fully at the end of the procedure, and this review focuses on these. The human body has multiple layers of tissues, and the skin is the outermost of these layers. The loose connective tissue just beneath the skin is called subcutaneous tissue, and this generally contains fat. There is uncertainty about closure of subcutaneous tissue after surgery: some surgeons advocate closure of subcutaneous tissue, as they consider this closes dead space and leads to a decrease in wound complications; others consider closure of subcutaneous tissue to be an unnecessary step that increases operating time and involves the use of additional suture material without offering any benefit.

Objectives

To compare the benefits (such as decreased wound-related complications) and consequences (such as increased operating time) of subcutaneous closure compared with no subcutaneous closure in participants undergoing non-caesarean surgical procedures.

Search Methods

In August 2013 we searched the following databases: Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 29 August, 2013); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 7); Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to August Week 3 2013); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations August 28, 2013); Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 2013 Week 34); and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 23 August 2013). We did not restrict studies with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing subcutaneous closure with no subcutaneous closure irrespective of the nature of the suture material(s) or whether continuous or interrupted sutures were used. We included all RCTs in the analysis, regardless of language, publication status, publication year, or sample size.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently identified the trials and extracted data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for comparing binary (dichotomous) outcomes between the groups and calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. We performed meta-analysis using the fixed-effect model and random-effects model. We performed intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

Eight RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Six of the trials provided data for this review and all of these were at high risk of bias. Six trials randomised a total of 815 participants to subcutaneous closure (410 participants) or no subcutaneous closure (405 participants). Overall, 7.7% of participants (63/815 of participants) developed superficial surgical site infections and there was no clear evidence of a difference between the two intervention groups (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.33; very low quality evidence). Only two trials reported superficial wound dehiscence, with 7.9% (17/215) of participants developing the problem. It is not clear whether the lack of reporting of this outcome in other trials was because it did not occur, or was not measured. There was no clear evidence of a between-group difference in the proportion of participants who developed superficial wound dehiscence in the trials that reported this outcome (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.22 to 1.41; very low quality evidence). Only one trial reported deep wound dehiscence, which occurred in 8.3% (5/60) of participants. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the proportion of participants who developed deep wound dehiscence between the two groups (RR 0.25; 95% CI 0.03 to 2.11; very low quality evidence). Three trials reported the length of hospital stay and found no significant difference between groups (MD 0.10 days; 95% CI -0.45 to 0.64; very low quality evidence). We do not know whether this review reveals a lack of effect or lack of evidence of effect. The confidence intervals for these outcomes were wide, and significant benefits or harms from subcutaneous closure cannot be ruled out. In addition, none of the trials assessed the impact of subcutaneous closure on quality of life, long-term patient outcomes (the follow-up period in the trials varied between one week and two months after surgery) or financial implications to the healthcare provider.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently evidence of very low quality which is insufficient to support or refute subcutaneous closure after non-caesarean operations. The use of subcutaneous closure has the potential to affect patient outcomes and utilisation of healthcare resources. Further well-designed trials at low risk of bias are necessary.

### PROSPECT guideline for elective caesarean section: updated systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^8d6c0fb2]. Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Surgical interventions

A systematic review [138] confirmed the superiority of the Joel‐Cohen (also called modified Misgav‐Ladach) incision compared with Pfannenstiel incision in reducing postoperative pain [139]. No differences in pain scores were noted between using a scalpel vs. diathermy for the skin incision [139].

A blunt fascial opening resulted in less postoperative pain [140]. The older technique of extraperitoneal section was associated with better pain scores up to 48 h postoperatively [141]. In one study, the absence of making a bladder flap at opening the uterus resulted in clinically‐relevant improvements in postoperative pain scores [142]. A comparison between uterine exteriorisation and in situ closure of the uterus showed more postoperative pain with exteriorised uteri [143]. However, one meta‐analysis did not show any difference in postoperative pain between the two modalities of uterine closure [144].

A comparison between two techniques of pyramidalis muscle dissection found no differences in postoperative pain [145]. Reduced pain scores when the peritoneum was not closed were reported [146]. One study reported a significant reduction in postoperative pain scores when the rectus muscle was not re‐approximated [147]. A Cochrane review noted minimal evidence for reduced pain scores when the peritoneum was not closed after caesarean section [148]. When applying laser irradiation to the caesarean section wound at the end of surgery, less pain during the first 24 h postoperatively was noted [149, 150]. No differences in pain scores were noted between interrupted and continuous wound suturing [151]. Similarly, two meta‐analyses did not show any difference in pain scores whether skin closure was performed with sutures or staples [152, 153].

### Techniques and materials for closure of the abdominal wall in caesarean section [^8161f378]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

There is a variety of techniques for closing the abdominal wall during caesarean section. Some methods may be better in terms of postoperative recovery and other important outcomes.

Objectives

To compare the effects of alternative techniques for closure of the rectus sheath and subcutaneous fat on maternal health and healthcare resource use.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (September 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2003), EMBASE (1980 to September 2003), CINAHL (1983 to September 2003) and CAB Health (1973 to September 2003), and the reference lists of included articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials making any of the following comparisons: (a) any suturing technique or material used for closure of the rectus sheath versus any other; (b) closure versus non-closure of subcutaneous fat; (c) any suturing technique or material used for closure of the subcutaneous fat versus any other; (d) any type of needle for repair of the abdominal wall in caesarean section versus any other; (e) any other comparison of methods of abdominal wall closure.

Data Collection and Analysis

Both reviewers evaluated trials for eligibility and methodological quality without consideration of their results.

Main Results

Seven studies involving 2056 women were included. The risk of haematoma or seroma was reduced with fat closure compared with non-closure (relative risk (RR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.82), as was the risk of 'wound complication' (haematoma, seroma, wound infection or wound separation) (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.88). No difference in the risk of wound infection alone or other short-term outcomes was found. No long-term outcomes were reported. There was no difference in the risk of wound infection between blunt needles and sharp needles in one small study. No studies were found examining suture techniques or materials for closure of the rectus sheath or subcutaneous fat.

Implications For Practice

Closure of the subcutaneous fat may reduce wound complications but it is unclear to what extent these differences affect the well-being and satisfaction of the women concerned.

Implications For Research

Further trials are justified to investigate whether the apparent increased risk of haematoma or seroma with non-closure of the subcutaneous fat is real. These should use a broader range of short- and long-term outcomes, and ensure that they are adequately powered to detect clinically important differences. Further research comparing blunt and sharp needles is justified, as are trials evaluating suturing materials and suturing techniques for the rectus sheath.

### Evidence-based surgical procedures to optimize caesarean outcomes: an overview of systematic reviews [^50ee726e]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary of effects

We retrieved 384 procedure-outcome comparisons from the included SRs. After excluding 39 overlapping comparisons, we present the effects of 345 procedure-outcomes pairs: 237 compared two different procedures, and 108 compared a procedure versus no treatment or placebo (NT/P).

Among the 345 comparisons, there was insufficient or inconclusive evidence of any effect for 256 comparisons. We found 40 comparisons with clear evidence of benefit (27 procedure versus procedure, 13 procedure versus NT/P), and 17 comparisons with evidence of a possible benefit (10 procedure versus procedure, 7 procedure versus NT/P). For 12 comparisons, there was clear evidence of no difference of effect (8 procedure versus procedure, 4 procedure versus NT/P), and for 1 procedure versus procedure comparison, there was evidence of possible no difference of effect. Finally, for 14 comparisons, there was clear evidence of harm (10 procedure versus procedure, 4 procedure versus NT/P), and for 5 comparisons, there was evidence of possible harm (4 procedure versus procedure, 1 procedure versus NT/P).

Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8 summarize results for each procedure-outcome comparisons following the chronological order of surgical procedures. Annex 5 provides details for all comparisons, outcomes, estimates and references. For 7 pre-defined procedures, there were no SRs.

### Closure methods for laparotomy incisions for preventing incisional hernias and other wound complications [^adbc20a7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Surgeons who perform laparotomy have a number of decisions to make regarding abdominal closure. Material and size of potential suture types varies widely. In addition, surgeons can choose to close the incision in anatomic layers or mass ('en masse'), as well as using either a continuous or interrupted suturing technique, of which there are different styles of each. There is ongoing debate as to which suturing techniques and suture materials are best for achieving definitive wound closure while minimising the risk of short- and long-term complications.

Objectives

The objectives of this review were to identify the best available suture techniques and suture materials for closure of the fascia following laparotomy incisions, by assessing the following comparisons: absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures; mass versus layered closure; continuous versus interrupted closure techniques; monofilament versus multifilament sutures; and slow absorbable versus fast absorbable sutures. Our objective was not to determine the single best combination of suture material and techniques, but to compare the individual components of abdominal closure.

Search Methods

On 8 February 2017 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two trials registries, and Science Citation Index. There were no limitations based on language or date of publication. We searched the reference lists of all included studies to identify trials that our searches may have missed.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared suture materials or closure techniques, or both, for fascial closure of laparotomy incisions. We excluded trials that compared only types of skin closures, peritoneal closures or use of retention sutures.

Data Collection and Analysis

We abstracted data and assessed the risk of bias for each trial. We calculated a summary risk ratio (RR) for the outcomes assessed in the review, all of which were dichotomous. We used random-effects modelling, based on the heterogeneity seen throughout the studies and analyses. We completed subgroup analysis planned a priori for each outcome, excluding studies where interventions being compared differed by more than one component, making it impossible to determine which variable impacted on the outcome, or the possibility of a synergistic effect. We completed sensitivity analysis, excluding trials with at least one trait with high risk of bias. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADEpro guidelines.

Main Results

Fifty-five RCTs with a total of 19,174 participants met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Included studies were heterogeneous in the type of sutures used, methods of closure and patient population. Many of the included studies reported multiple comparisons.For our primary outcome, the proportion of participants who developed incisional hernia at one year or more of follow-up, we did not find evidence that suture absorption (absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures, RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.32, moderate-quality evidence; or slow versus fast absorbable sutures, RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.06, moderate-quality evidence), closure method (mass versus layered, RR 1.92, 95% CI 0.58 to 6.35, very low-quality evidence) or closure technique (continuous versus interrupted, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.35, moderate-quality evidence) resulted in a difference in the risk of incisional hernia. We did, however, find evidence to suggest that monofilament sutures reduced the risk of incisional hernia when compared with multifilament sutures (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.98, I 2 = 30%, moderate-quality evidence).For our secondary outcomes, we found that none of the interventions reduced the risk of wound infection, whether based on suture absorption (absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.17, moderate-quality evidence; or slow versus fast absorbable sutures, RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.57, moderate-quality evidence), closure method (mass versus layered, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.30, low-quality evidence) or closure technique (continuous versus interrupted, RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.34, moderate-quality evidence).Similarily, none of the interventions reduced the risk of wound dehiscence whether based on suture absorption (absorbable versus non-absorbable sutures, RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.10, moderate-quality evidence; or slow versus fast absorbable sutures, RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.61, moderate-quality evidence), closure method (mass versus layered, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.52, moderate-quality evidence) or closure technique (continuous versus interrupted, RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.64, moderate-quality evidence).Absorbable sutures, compared with non-absorbable sutures (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.94, low-quality evidence) reduced the risk of sinus or fistula tract formation. None of the other comparisons showed a difference (slow versus fast absorbable sutures, RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.05 to 16.05, very low-quality evidence; mass versus layered, RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.62, low-quality evidence; continuous versus interrupted, RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.64 to 3.61, very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Based on this moderate-quality body of evidence, monofilament sutures may reduce the risk of incisional hernia. Absorbable sutures may also reduce the risk of sinus or fistula tract formation, but this finding is based on low-quality evidence.We had serious concerns about the design or reporting of several of the 55 included trials. The comparator arms in many trials differed by more than one component, making it impossible to attribute differences between groups to any one component. In addition, the patient population included in many of the studies was very heterogeneous. Trials included both emergency and elective cases, different types of disease pathology (e.g. colon surgery, hepatobiliary surgery, etc.) or different types of incisions (e.g. midline, paramedian, subcostal).Consequently, larger, high-quality trials to further address this clinical challenge are warranted. Future studies should ensure that proper randomisation and allocation techniques are performed, wound assessors are blinded, and that the duration of follow-up is adequate. It is important that only one type of intervention is compared between groups. In addition, a homogeneous patient population would allow for a more accurate assessment of the interventions.

### Skin and subcutaneous fascia closure at caesarean section to reduce wound complications: the closure randomised trial [^00e14b75]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Allowing for additive treatment effect with the two interventions in a factorial study design, a sample size of 1230 participants was determined on the basis of 80% power to detect a relative reduction of 40% in the incidence of wound infection (from 12% to 7%), with two-sided alpha of 0.05, and allowing for 5% loss to follow up.

Analyses were performed on an intention to treat basis, according to treatment group allocated at randomisation, and followed the Statistical Analysis Plan. Analyses were performed using log binomial regression models for binary outcomes, and linear regression models for continuous outcomes. In the case of outcomes where the number of events was too small for the planned analysis to be performed, a Fisher’s Exact test was performed to test the hypothesis of no association between treatment group and outcome. An interaction term (suture type x fascia method) was included to test for synergistic effects (whether effect of suture type differed according to fascia method; whether effect of fascia closure differed according to suture type). Separate effect estimates were therefore derived for each treatment effect by level of the other treatment and are presented as RR (absorbable versus non-absorbable suture, and fascia closure versus non-closure) and 95% CI for binary outcomes, and differences in means (absorbable – non-absorbable, and fascia closure – nonclosure) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Both unadjusted and adjusted analyses were performed, with adjusted models including stratification variables (elective versus emergency caesarean section, BMI category ≤ 25 kg/m 2 versus > 25 kg/m 2), and baseline variables prespecified as potential confounders (maternal age, smoking status, diabetes, and previous caesarean section). All analyses were performed in Stata v16 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA).

The methodology and reporting of this trial adhered to CONSORT guidelines.

### Closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum at caesarean section: short-and long-term outcomes [^2ca88547]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Caesarean section is a very common surgical procedure worldwide. Suturing the peritoneal layers at caesarean section may or may not confer benefit, hence the need to evaluate whether this step should be omitted or routinely performed.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of non-closure as an alternative to closure of the peritoneum at caesarean section on intraoperative and immediate- and long-term postoperative outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (1 November 2013).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing leaving the visceral or parietal peritoneum, or both, unsutured at caesarean section with a technique which involves suturing the peritoneum in women undergoing elective or emergency caesarean section.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked it for accuracy.

Main Results

A total of 29 trials were included in this review and 21 trials (17,276 women) provided data that could be included in an analysis. The quality of the trials was variable. 1. Non-closure of visceral and parietal peritoneum versus closure of both parietal layersSixteen trials involving 15,480 women, were included and analysed, when both parietal peritoneum was left unclosed versus when both peritoneal surfaces were closed. Postoperative adhesion formation was assessed in only four trials with 282 women, and no difference was found between groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.29). There was significant reduction in the operative time (mean difference (MD) -5.81 minutes, 95% CI -7.68 to -3.93). The duration of hospital stay in a total of 13 trials involving 14,906 women, was also reduced (MD -0.26, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.05) days. In a trial involving 112 women, reduced chronic pelvic pain was found in the peritoneal non-closure group. 2. Non-closure of visceral peritoneum only versus closure of both peritoneal surfacesThree trials involving 889 women were analysed. There was an increase in adhesion formation (two trials involving 157 women, RR 2.49, 95% CI 1.49 to 4.16) which was limited to one trial with high risk of bias.There was reduction in operative time, postoperative days in hospital and wound infection. There was no significant reduction in postoperative pyrexia. 3. Non-closure of parietal peritoneum only versus closure of both peritoneal layersThe two identified trials involved 573 women. Neither study reported on postoperative adhesion formation. There was reduction in operative time and postoperative pain with no difference in the incidence of postoperative pyrexia, endometritis, postoperative duration of hospital stay and wound infection. In only one study, postoperative day one wound pain assessed by the numerical rating scale, (MD -1.60, 95% CI -1.97 to -1.23) and chronic abdominal pain d by the visual analogue score (MD -1.10, 95% CI -1.39 to -0.81) was reduced in the non-closure group. 4. Non-closure versus closure of visceral peritoneum when parietal peritoneum is closed.There was reduction in all the major urinary symptoms of frequency, urgency and stress incontinence when the visceral peritoneum is left unsutured.

Authors' Conclusions

There was a reduction in operative time across all the subgroups. There was also a reduction in the period of hospitalisation post-caesarean section except in the subgroup where parietal peritoneum only was not sutured where there was no difference in the period of hospitalisation. The evidence on adhesion formation was limited and inconsistent. There is currently insufficient evidence of benefit to justify the additional time and use of suture material necessary for peritoneal closure. More robust evidence on long-term pain, adhesion formation and infertility is needed.

### Guidelines for antenatal and preoperative care in Cesarean delivery: Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Society recommendations (part 1) [^37f7a98f]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

This Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Guideline for perioperative care in cesarean delivery will provide best practice, evidenced-based, recommendations for preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases with, primarily, a maternal focus. The focused pathway process for scheduled and unscheduled cesarean delivery for this ERAS Cesarean Delivery Guideline will consider from the time from decision to operate (starting with the 30-60 minutes before skin incision) to hospital discharge. The literature search (1966-2017) used Embase and PubMed to search medical subject headings that included "Cesarean Section," "Cesarean Section," "Cesarean Section Delivery" and all pre- and intraoperative ERAS items. Study selection allowed titles and abstracts to be screened by individual reviewers to identify potentially relevant articles. Metaanalyses, systematic reviews, randomized controlled studies, nonrandomized controlled studies, reviews, and case series were considered for each individual topic. Quality assessment and data analyses that evaluated the quality of evidence and recommendations were evaluated according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation system, as used and described in previous ERAS Guidelines. The ERAS Cesarean Delivery Guideline/Pathway has created a maternal focused pathway (for scheduled and unscheduled surgery starting from 30-60 minutes before skin incision to maternal discharge) with ERAS cesarean delivery consensus recommendations preoperative elements (anesthetic medications, fasting, carbohydrate supplementation, prophylactic antibiotics/skin preparation, ), intraoperative elements (anesthetic management, maternal hypothermia prevention, surgical technique, hysterotomy creation and closure, management of peritoneum, subcutaneous space, and skin closure), perioperative fluid management, and postoperative elements (chewing gum, management of nausea and vomiting, analgesia, timing of food intake, glucose management, antithrombotic prophylaxis, timing of ambulation, urinary management, and timing of maternal and neonate discharge). Limited topics for optimized care and for antenatal education and counselling and the immediate neonatal needs at delivery are discussed. Strong recommendations for element use were given for preoperative (antenatal education and counselling, use of antacids and histamine, H2 receptor antagonists, 2-hour fasting and small meal within 6 hours surgery, antimicrobial prophylaxis and skin preparation/chlorhexidine-alcohol), intraoperative (regional anesthesia, prevention of maternal hypothermia [forced warm air, warmed intravenous fluids, room temperature]), perioperative (fluid management for euvolemia and neonatal immediate care needs that include delayed cord clamping), and postoperative (fluid management to prevent nausea and vomiting, antiemetic use, analgesia with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs/paracetamol, regular diet within 2 hours, tight capillary glucose control, pneumatic compression stocking for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, immediate removal of urinary catheter). Recommendations against the element use were made for preoperative (maternal sedation, bowel preparation), intraoperative (neonatal oral suctioning or increased inspired oxygen), and postoperative (heparin should not be used routinely venous thromboembolism prophylaxis). Because these ERAS cesarean delivery pathway recommendations (elements/processes) are studied, implemented, audited, evaluated, and optimized by the maternity care teams, this will create an opportunity for the focused and optimized areas of care research with further enhanced care and recommendation.

### Single-layer vs double-layer uterine closure during cesarean delivery: 3-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial (2Close study) [^acd6a391]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The rising rate of cesarean deliveries has led to an increased incidence of long long-term complications, including niche formation in the uterine scar. Niche development is associated with various gynecologic complaints and complications in subsequent pregnancies, such as uterine rupture and placenta accreta spectrum disorders. Although uterine closure technique is considered a potential risk factor for niche development, consensus on the optimal technique remains elusive.

Objective

We aimed to evaluate the effect of single-layer vs double-layer closure of the uterine incision on live birth rate at a 3-year follow-up with secondary objectives focusing on gynecologic, fertility, and obstetrical outcomes at the same follow-up.

Study Design

A multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial was performed at 32 hospitals in the Netherlands. Women ≥18 years old undergoing a first cesarean delivery were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either single-layer or double-layer closure of the uterine incision. The primary outcome of the long-term follow-up was the live birth rate; with secondary outcomes, including pregnancy rate, the need for fertility treatment, mode of delivery, and obstetrical and gynecologic complications. This trial is registered on the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform www.who.int (NTR5480; trial finished).

Results

Between 2016 and 2018, the 2Close study randomly assigned 2292 women, with 830 of 1144 and 818 of 1148 responding to the 3-year questionnaire in the single-layer and double-layer closure. No differences were observed in live birth rates; also there were no differences in pregnancy rate, need for fertility treatments, mode of delivery, or uterine ruptures in subsequent pregnancies. High rates of gynecologic symptoms, including spotting (30%-32%), dysmenorrhea (47%-49%), and sexual dysfunction (Female Sexual Function Index score, 23) are reported in both groups.

Conclusion

The study did not demonstrate the superiority of double-layer closure over single-layer closure in terms of reproductive outcomes after a first cesarean delivery. This challenges the current recommendation favoring double-layer closure, and we propose that surgeons can choose their preferred technique. Furthermore, the high risk of gynecologic symptoms after a cesarean delivery should be discussed with patients.

### The CORONIS trial. international study of caesarean section surgical techniques: a randomised fractional, factorial trial [^89fb2190]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2007). Low credibility.

Interventions

There are five pairs of interventions being tested in this trial; however, each participating hospital will only take part in three of these five possible comparisons. The non-allocated comparisons and all other aspects of the caesarean section will be performed at the discretion of the surgeon. For example, for women randomised in a hospital which is taking part in the three comparisons: sharp vs blunt abdominal entry; double vs single layer uterine closure; and closure vs non-closure of the peritoneum; then it will be at the discretion of the surgeon as to whether there is exteriorisation of the uterus or not, and what suture material is used for uterine repair.

All allocated techniques should be performed unless there are overwhelming reasons not to do so. For example, at the time of surgery it may become apparent that there is no clear peritoneal layer overlying the uterus in a woman undergoing a second caesarean section. In these circumstances, it will not be possible to close this peritoneal layer during the repair. Other clinical circumstances may also change during the course of the surgical procedure after a particular intervention has been allocated. If the clinician performing the caesarean section is certain that a non-allocated intervention is necessary then this should be performed and the reasons for not complying with the allocated intervention recorded on the data collection form.

1. Blunt versus sharp abdominal entry

Sharp abdominal entry

The abdomen is entered using a scalpel to divide the abdominal skin. Each subsequent layer of the abdomen (fat, rectus sheath and parietal peritoneum) is then separately identified and divided using either a scalpel or scissors.

Blunt abdominal entry

The abdomen is entered using a scalpel to divide the abdominal skin. The scalpel is then used to divide the fat and rectus sheath in the midline and the rectus sheath incision is extended manually (without the use of a scalpel or scissors). The parietal peritoneum is then entered digitally and the defect enlarged manually.

For some women with a previous caesarean section, blunt abdominal entry may be impeded by scar tissue. If this is the case, surgeons should use whatever technique is necessary to effect abdominal entry with the minimum of risk to the well being of the woman. If during the blunt abdominal entry a scalpel or scissors are used to extend the original incision in the sheath or peritoneum, then this should be recorded as a sharp abdominal entry on the Data Collection Booklet.

### Skin and subcutaneous fascia closure at caesarean section to reduce wound complications: the closure randomised trial [^5348ab44]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Participants

Participant flow through the trial is shown in Fig. 1, with women randomised between April 2008 and July 2011, at a metropolitan maternity unit, The Women’s and Children’s Hospital, North Adelaide, South Australia. The trial was ceased prior to achieving the estimated sample size due to difficulties in maintaining recruitment.

Fig. 1 
Participant flow through the Closure randomised trial

Overall, 851 eligible women were randomised to one of four groups: Group 1–216 women; Group 2–212 women; Group 3–212 women; and Group 4–211 women. Two women were excluded from the final analysis, one who was lost to follow up (randomised to Group 1) and one who did not undergo a caesarean birth (randomised to Group 2), leaving 849 women for whom primary outcome data was available.

Baseline demographic characteristics of women were comparable between treatment groups (Table 1). The mean age of participants was 31.48 years (SD 5.62 years), with mean early pregnancy BMI 28.60 kg/m 2 (SD 7.36 kg/m 2). The majority of women underwent an elective caesarean section (701 women [82.57%]), at 38.50 weeks (SD 1.85 weeks) gestation. Most women were in their second or subsequent ongoing pregnancy (656 women [77.27%]), with a previous caesarean birth (562 women [66.20%]).

### Skin and subcutaneous fascia closure at caesarean section to reduce wound complications: the closure randomised trial [^d621ab18]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Similarly, among women who underwent skin closure with absorbable suture, there was no statistically significant difference in risk of wound infection in women who underwent fascia closure (Group 4), compared with women who did not have fascia closure (Group 2) (adjusted relative risk 1.27; 95% CI 0.70, 2.31; p = 0.437) (Table 3). In women who had skin closure with non-absorbable suture, there was very weak evidence of a lower risk of wound infection for those who had fascia closure (Group 3), compared with women who did not have fascia closure (Group 1), although the difference was not statistically significant (adjusted relative risk 0.59; 95% CI 0.28, 1.25; p = 0.169) (Table 3).

With regards to the outcome of wound haematoma or seroma, there were too few events to perform the planned analysis. Fisher’s Exact test showed no evidence of an association between treatment group and risk of haematoma or seroma.

While there was a statistically significant effect of wound closure technique on risk of re-operation (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.013), there were too few events to perform modelling on this outcome (Table 3). Four women who required re-operation were in the fascia closure and absorbable skin suture (Group 4) (1.90%) and 1 woman in the fascia non-closure and absorbable skin suture group (Group 1) (0.47%) (Table 2).

There was no statistically significant treatment effect of any of the wound closure techniques on readmission rates, or emergency presentation for wound review (Table 3).

### Extra-abdominal versus intra-abdominal repair of the uterine incision at caesarean section [^01490ad5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Different techniques have been described to reduce morbidity during caesarean section. After the baby has been born by caesarean section and the placenta has been extracted, temporary removal of the uterus from the abdominal cavity (exteriorisation of the uterus) to facilitate repair of the uterine incision has been postulated as a valuable technique. This is particularly so when exposure of the incision is difficult and when there are problems with haemostasis. Several clinical trials have been done, with varying results, including substantial reduction in the rate of postoperative infection and morbidity with extra-abdominal closure of the uterine incision, and less associated peri-operative haemorrhage. Subsequent studies suggest that the method of placental removal rather than method of closure of the uterine incision influences peri-operative morbidity.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of extra-abdominal repair of the uterine incision compared to intra-abdominal repair.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (September 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2003) and PubMed (1966 to 2003).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials involving a comparison of uterine exteriorisation with intra-abdominal repair of the uterine incision in women undergoing caesarean section.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed the trials identified for inclusion. We compared categorical data using relative risks and 95% confidence intervals and continuous data using the weighted mean difference with 95% confidence intervals. We tested for statistical heterogeneity between trials using the I squared test. Where no significant heterogeneity (greater than 50%) existed, we pooled data using a fixed effect model. If significant heterogeneity existed, a random effects model was used.

Main Results

Six studies were included, with 1294 women randomised overall, and 1221 women included in the analysis. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in most of the outcomes identified, except for febrile morbidity and length of hospital stay. With extra-abdominal closure of the uterine incision, febrile morbidity was lower (relative risk 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 0.97), and the hospital stay was longer (weighted mean difference 0.24 days, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.39).

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is no evidence from this review to make definitive conclusions about which method of uterine closure offers greater advantages, if any. However, these results are based on too few and too small studies to detect differences in rare, but severe, complications.

### Suture compared with staples for skin closure after cesarean delivery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4243ed78]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Absorbable suture is the preferred method of cesarean skin closure compared with metal staples, because it decreases wound complications. Two recently published trials in patients with obesity contradict this evidence. The goal of this meta-analysis was to assess whether suture remains the recommended method of cesarean skin closure, regardless of obesity status.

Data Sources

MEDLINE through OVID, PubMed, Cochrane Database, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception until September 24, 2021.

Method Of Study Selection

Published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing subcuticular absorbable suture with nonabsorbable metal staples for cesarean skin closure were included. Non-RCTs, RCTs that did not compare staples with suture, and ongoing trials were excluded. Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria.

Tabulation, Integration and Results

Data were individually abstracted and entered into RevMan. Fixed and random effects models were used. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess each study. The primary outcome, a sensitivity analysis of wound complications (excluding studies at high risk of bias), showed a significant decrease in wound complications when the cesarean skin incision was closed with suture compared with staples (10 studies; 71/1,497 vs 194/1,465; risk ratio [RR] 0.47, 95% CI 0.25-0.87). When all studies were analyzed, there remained a significant decrease in wound complications when the skin was closed with suture (14 studies; 121/1,780 vs 242/1,750; RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.36-0.97). Of the individual wound complications, wound separation was significantly decreased with suture closure compared with staples (11 studies; 55/1,319 vs 129/1,273; RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.32-0.58). In patients with obesity, there remained a significant decrease in wound complications with suture closure of the skin incision compared with staples (five studies; 34/507 vs 67/522; RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.34-0.75).

Conclusion

Closure of the cesarean skin incision with suture decreased composite wound complications by 50% as compared with closure with staples; a significant decrease persisted regardless of obesity status.

### A prospective comparative study of single-layer versus double-layer uterine closure techniques on cesarean scar formation [^6aa8b02e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

In the single-layer group, the uterine incision was closed with a continuous, non-locking, single-layer suture without refreshing the edges or including the endometrium. In the double-layer group, surgical debridement of the incision margins was performed prior to closure; the initial layer was sutured continuously in a non-locking, subcuticular-like manner without involving the endometrium, followed by a second continuous non-locking suture applied to the remaining myometrial tissue. In both groups, 1 − 0 polyglactin (Vicryl ®) sutures were used.

Additional uterine sutures were placed as needed using 1 − 0 or 2 − 0 Vicryl. The peritoneum was optionally closed with 2 − 0 Vicryl. Fascia closure was performed using 1 − 0 Vicryl, and subcutaneous tissue was sutured when necessary. Skin closure was achieved with a subcuticular 2 − 0 Vicryl suture. Operative time (skin-to-skin) was recorded. Postoperative hemograms were evaluated at 48 h. Patients with stable laboratory values were discharged. Erythrocyte transfusion or intravenous iron (ferric carboxymaltose) was administered based on clinical indications.

Postoperative follow-up was scheduled at six weeks and six months postpartum. At both time points, residual myometrial thickness (RMT) and niche formation were evaluated using transvaginal ultrasonography (TVUSG) (Fig. 1). All examinations were conducted in the lithotomy position with an empty bladder, using a high-frequency (7.5–9 MHz) transvaginal probe. Measurements were obtained in the sagittal plane at the cesarean scar site, and RMT was defined as the shortest distance between the endometrial–myometrial junction and the serosal surface. All ultrasonographic assessments were performed by the same experienced examiner, who was blinded to group allocation.

### Suture compared with staple skin closure after cesarean delivery: a randomized controlled trial [^c5345c58]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the incidence of wound complications between suture and staple skin closure after cesarean delivery.

Methods

This prospective, randomized clinical trial conducted at three hospitals in the United States between 2010 and 2012 included women undergoing cesarean delivery at 23 weeks of gestation or greater through a low-transverse skin incision. Women were randomized to closure of the skin incision with suture or staples after stratifying by body mass index and primary compared with repeat cesarean delivery. The primary outcome was incidence of wound complications, predefined as a composite of infection, hematoma, seroma, separation of 1 cm or longer, or readmission for wound complications. Analysis was according to the intention-to-treat principle; results were stratified by randomization group and adjusted for hospital by including it as a covariate.

Results

A total of 746 women were randomized, 370 to suture and 376 to staple closure. The median gestational age was 39 weeks. Fifty-eight women (7.8%) had wound complications-4.9% in the suture group and 10.6% in the staple group (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23-0.78); this was largely the result of the decreased incidence of wound separation in the respective groups (1.6% compared with 7.4%; adjusted OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.07-0.51).

Conclusions

Suture closure of the skin incision at cesarean delivery is associated with a 57% decrease in wound complications compared with staple closure.

### Suture compared with staple closure of skin incision for high-order cesarean deliveries [^c2d01123]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare wound complication rates in tertiary or higher-order cesarean delivery based on wound closure technique.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of all tertiary or higher-order cesarean deliveries performed by one group practice in a large academic medical center from 2005 to 2017. We excluded patients with a vertical skin incision. Although the study was not randomized, wound closure type was relatively uniform in this practice and based on time period: before 2011, the preferred closure was staple closure; after 2011, subcuticular suture closure was preferred. All patients received preoperative antibiotics and closure of subcutaneous tissue 2 cm deep or greater. The primary outcome was a wound complication, defined as a wound infection requiring antibiotics or a wound separation requiring wound packing or reclosure any time up to 6 weeks after delivery. Regression analysis was used to control for any significant differences at baseline between the groups.

Results

There were 551 patients with tertiary or higher-order cesarean delivery, 192 (34.8%) of whom had staple closure and 359 (65.2%) of whom had suture closure. Suture closure was associated with a significantly lower rate of wound complication (4.7% [17/359, 95% CI 3.0%-7.5%] vs 11.5% [22/192, 95% CI 7.7%-16.7%], P=.003). On regression analysis controlling for the number of prior cesarean deliveries and the participation of a resident in the closure, suture closure remained independently associated with a lower risk of a wound complication (adjusted odds ratio 0.44, 95% CI 0.23-0.86).

Conclusion

For women undergoing their third or higher-order cesarean delivery, suture closure is associated with a lower rate of wound complications.

### Closure vs. nonclosure of the peritoneum at cesarean delivery [^4dd72386]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the frequency and severity of celiac adhesions following cesarean sections performed with and without closure of the parietal and visceral peritoneum.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study involved 612 women who underwent their second lower-segment transverse cesarean section.

Results

Nonclosure of the parietal peritoneum at the time of the first cesarean section was associated with significantly more visceral adhesions than closure (16.2% vs. 8.1%; P=0.003), and closure of the visceral peritoneum had a similar effect (16.1% vs. 6.7%; P=0.02). However, the difference in rates of severe adhesions was not statistically significant (12.9% vs. 17.6%; P=0.12). After controlling for confounding variables, it was found that closure of the parietal peritoneum reduced the rate of visceral adhesions 2.7-fold. Trial of labor before and fever after surgery increased the risk of severe adhesions 6.1-fold and 5.6-fold, respectively.

Conclusion

Nonclosure of the peritoneum at primary cesarean section is associated with a significantly increased risk of visceral adhesions.

### Skin and subcutaneous fascia closure at caesarean section to reduce wound complications: the closure randomised trial [^4d60c2a0]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Design

Single centre 2 × 2 factorial randomised trial, allocated 1:1.

Ethics

The trial was reviewed and approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Women’s and Children’s Hospital, North Adelaide (Approval number: 1539/ 12).

Participants

Eligible women were identified and recruited from a single tertiary metropolitan maternity hospital in Adelaide, South Australia. Women were identified in antenatal clinic, given a trial information sheet and counselled by a researcher, after which written informed consent was obtained. Women who were undergoing a caesarean section via a transverse suprapubic incision were eligible for inclusion. Women with a known lethal fetal anomaly or where the procedure was planned via a midline skin incision were excluded.

Randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding

Randomisation occurred at the time of decision to perform a caesarean section, by taking the next sequentially numbered treatment pack containing the skin suture material and indication of whether or not to perform subcutaneous fascia closure. The computer-generated randomisation schedule used balanced variable blocks, and was prepared by an investigator not involved with recruitment or clinical care of the participants. The randomisation schedule was stratified according to the type of caesarean section (emergency vs elective) and maternal BMI at hospital booking visit (BMI ≤ 25.0 kg/m 2 versus > 25.0 kg/m 2). Treatment packs were assembled according to the prepared schedule by a researcher not involved with recruitment or clinical care and were opaque and externally identical. Each treatment pack contained a sterile pack of suture material (3/0 absorbable or 3/0 non-absorbable) and a card documenting closure or non-closure of the subcutaneous fascia. The treatment pack was opened by the scrub nurse after delivery of the baby. Instructions were relayed to the operating surgeon, and the suture material opened onto the operating tray. The operating surgeon and participants were unblinded to treatment assignment after opening of the pack. Participant follow up and outcome data collection were performed by investigators not involved in the primary procedure and who were not aware of treatment allocation. Data analysis was performed following a statistical analysis plan finalised prior to analyses being conducted.

### Skin and subcutaneous fascia closure at caesarean section to reduce wound complications: the closure randomised trial [^ed13685e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Intervention

The two interventions were:
Skin closure: subcuticular closure of the skin with a 3/0 absorbable (Caprosyn™) or non-absorbable (Prolene™) synthetic monofilament suture material
Fascia closure: closure or non-closure of subcutaneous fascia, performed with 2/0 Vicryl® suture

Participants were randomised to each of the two interventions into one of 4 possible groups:
Group 1 - non-absorbable skin suture and non-closure of the subcutaneous fascia;
Group 2 - absorbable skin suture and non-closure of the subcutaneous fascia;
Group 3 - non-absorbable skin suture and closure of the subcutaneous fascia; and
Group 4 - absorbable skin suture and closure of the subcutaneous fascia.

Participant follow-up

Wound complications were identified by asking women to complete a questionnaire by telephone. Additionally, hospital case-notes were reviewed at 30 days postpartum, to identify any diagnosis or signs or symptoms of wound complications, readmission to hospital, or presentation to the emergency department.

Outcome

The primary outcomes were:
Wound infection reported in first 30 days after operation defined in accordance with CDC definition of superficial incisional surgical site infection, including evidence of purulent discharge; isolation of organisms following tissue or fluid culture; any of localised pain or tenderness, swelling, or redness; or the prescription of antimicrobial therapy.
Wound haematoma or seroma formation, defined as a collection of blood or serous fluid beneath the skin, diagnosed clinically or by ultrasound assessment, in first 30 days after operation.

Secondary outcomes included, emergency presentation to health care for wound management, need for surgical intervention including drainage or debridement in theatre or outpatient setting; need for hospital readmission for wound complications in first 30 days after operation (both self-report and case note review), and pain score day three post operative.

### Adhesion prevention after cesarean delivery: evidence, and lack of it [^3efdd2e3]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

In spite of the recognized occurrence of cesarean-attributable adhesions, its clinical significance is uncertain. The presence of adhesions during a repeat cesarean section can make fetal extraction lengthy and the procedure challenging and may increase the risk of injury to adjacent organs. Two methods for adhesion prevention are discussed, peritoneal closure and use of adhesion barriers. Peritoneal closure appears to be safe in the short term. In the long term, conflicting evidence arise from reviewing the literature for possible adhesion reduction benefits. A systematic review of the literature on the use of adhesion barriers in the context of cesarean section yielded only a few studies, most of which are lacking in methodology. For now, it appears that the available evidence does not support the routine use of adhesion barriers during cesarean delivery.

### Techniques for caesarean section [^9ae7b16e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Rates of caesarean section (CS) have been rising globally. It is important to use the most effective and safe technique.

Objectives

To compare the effects of complete methods of caesarean section; and to summarise the findings of reviews of individual aspects of caesarean section technique.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (August 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 3) and reference lists of identified papers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of intention to perform caesarean section using different techniques.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies and extracted data.

Main Results

'Joel-Cohen based' compared with Pfannenstiel CS was associated with: less blood loss, (five trials, 481 women; weighted mean difference (WMD) -64.45 ml; 95% confidence interval (CI) -91.34 to -37.56 ml); shorter operating time (five trials, 581 women; WMD -18.65; 95% CI -24.84 to -12.45 minutes); postoperatively, reduced time to oral intake (five trials, 481 women; WMD -3.92; 95% CI -7.13 to -0.71 hours); less fever (eight trials, 1412 women; relative risk (RR) 0.47; 95% CI 0.28 to 0.81); shorter duration of postoperative pain (two comparisons from one trial, 172 women; WMD -14.18 hours; 95% CI -18.31 to -10.04 hours); fewer analgesic injections (two trials, 151 women; WMD -0.92; 95% CI -1.20 to -0.63); and shorter time from skin incision to birth of the baby (five trials, 575 women; WMD -3.84 minutes; 95% CI -5.41 to -2.27 minutes). Serious complications and blood transfusions were too few for analysis.Misgav-Ladach compared with the traditional method (lower midline abdominal incision) was associated with reduced: blood loss (339 women; WMD -93.00; 95% CI -132.72 to -53.28 ml); operating time (339 women; WMD-7.30; 95% CI -8.32 to -6.28 minutes); time to mobilisation (339 women; WMD -16.06; 95% CI -18.22 to -13.90 hours); and length of postoperative stay for the mother (339 women; WMD -0.82; 95% CI -1.08 to -0.56 days). Misgav-Ladach compared with modified Misgav-Ladach methods was associated with a longer time from skin incision to birth of the baby (116 women; WMD 2.10; 95% CI 1.10 to 3.10 minutes).

Authors' Conclusions

'Joel-Cohen based' methods have advantages compared to Pfannenstiel and to traditional (lower midline) CS techniques, which could translate to savings for the health system. However, these trials do not provide information on mortality and serious or long-term morbidity such as morbidly adherent placenta and scar rupture.

### Caesarean section surgical techniques (CORONIS): a fractional, factorial, unmasked, randomised controlled trial [^eb4bdc5c]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Variations exist in the surgical techniques used for caesarean section and many have not been rigorously assessed in randomised controlled trials. We aimed to assess whether any surgical techniques were associated with improved outcomes for women and babies.

Methods

CORONIS was a pragmatic international 2×2×2×2×2 non-regular fractional, factorial, unmasked, randomised controlled trial that examined five elements of the caesarean section technique in intervention pairs. CORONIS was undertaken at 19 sites in Argentina, Chile, Ghana, India, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sudan. Each site was assigned to three of the five intervention pairs: blunt versus sharp abdominal entry; exteriorisation of the uterus for repair versus intra-abdominal repair; single-layer versus double-layer closure of the uterus; closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum (pelvic and parietal); and chromic catgut versus polyglactin-910 for uterine repair. Pregnant women were eligible if they were to undergo their first or second caesarean section through a planned transverse abdominal incision. Women were randomly assigned by a secure web-based number allocation system to one intervention from each of the three assigned pairs. All investigators, surgeons, and participants were unmasked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the composite of death, maternal infectious morbidity, further operative procedures, or blood transfusion (>1 unit) up to the 6-week follow-up visit. Women were analysed in the groups into which they were allocated. The CORONIS Trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials: ISRCTN31089967.

Findings

Between May 20, 2007, and Dec 31, 2010, 15935 women were recruited. There were no statistically significant differences within any of the intervention pairs for the primary outcome: blunt versus sharp entry risk ratio 1·03 (95% CI 0·91-1·17), exterior versus intra-abdominal repair 0·96 (0·84-1·08), single-layer versus double-layer closure 0·96 (0·85-1·08), closure versus non-closure 1·06 (0·94-1·20), and chromic catgut versus polyglactin-910 0·90 (0·78-1·04). 144 serious adverse events were reported, of which 26 were possibly related to the intervention. Most of the reported serious adverse events were known complications of surgery or complications of the reasons for the caesarean section.

Interpretation

These findings suggest that any of these surgical techniques is acceptable. However, longer-term follow-up is needed to assess whether the absence of evidence of short-term effects will translate into an absence of long-term effects.

### The CORONIS trial. international study of caesarean section surgical techniques: a randomised fractional, factorial trial [^9eb06f1f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2007). Low credibility.

Single versus double layer closure of the uterus (Table 4)

Table 4 
Single versus double layer closure of the uterus

The Cochrane systematic review of single versus double layer closure of the uterine incision includes two trials which involve 1006 women in total, although each outcome has data from only one trial. This review has not been updated since 1996, but a protocol for an updated and revised review has been published and the review is in progress. Two further trials comparing single and double layer uterine closure published since the Cochrane review was last updated was identified, involving 333 women. None of the existing studies suggests major differences in outcomes between single and double layer uterine closure.

Chapman et al measured maternal outcomes in the subsequent pregnancy of women included in one of the studies in the Cochrane review. There was no detectable difference in the length of labour, mode of delivery, risk of scar dehiscence or haemorrhage between the two groups. However, the numbers were small and only a small proportion of the women randomised could be included in this follow-up study (145 women followed up out of a total study population of 906 women).

Two observational studies of the long-term effects of single and double layer uterine closure have been published. Bujold et al examined a retrospective cohort of 2,142 women from one hospital in Canada who had undergone a trial of labour following a single previous lower segment caesarean section between 1988 and 2000. The main finding was an increased risk of uterine rupture with previous single layer closure. However, other differences may account for the differences in outcome in this observational study. For example, the caesarean technique used changed from mainly double layer closure to mainly single layer closure during the period studied, and the selection criteria for trial of labour may have changed in this time too. Thus women who had single layer closure may have been more likely to have a trial of labour. This study's result was not replicated by a second observational study, which found no increased risk of uterine rupture with single layer closure.

Overall there is little evidence that there is any difference in short term outcomes between single and double layer uterine closure. The observational study by Bujold et al has raised the possibility of an increased risk of uterine rupture in labour after single layer closure, and further research using larger, randomised controlled studies is needed to investigate this possible association.

### The CORONIS trial. international study of caesarean section surgical techniques: a randomised fractional, factorial trial [^d5db1b07]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objectives of the trial are to determine whether there are any differences in maternal morbidity when comparing the following five pairs of alternative surgical techniques undertaken during the time of caesarean section:

1. Blunt versus sharp abdominal entry

2. Exteriorisation of the uterus for repair versus intra-abdominal repair

3. Single versus double layer closure of the uterus

4. Closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum (pelvic and parietal)

5. Chromic catgut versus Polyglactin-910 for uterine repair

### Caesarean section surgical techniques: 3 year follow-up of the CORONIS fractional, factorial, unmasked, randomised controlled trial [^6249220f]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Added value of this study

Our results provide the first evidence of the long-term effects of exteriorisation versus intra-abdominal repair of the uterus, and for chromic catgut versus polyglactin-910 for repair of the uterus. For sharp versus blunt abdominal entry, the risk of incisional hernias after caesarean section has been studied in the Danish population. There were 134 hernias recorded in 57 564 women (a 10 year incidence of 0·2%). The study was not able to establish whether the abdominal entry approach used at the time of the caesarean section was blunt or sharp. Therefore, CORONIS provides evidence that the risk of later hernia formation is very small, and we noted no difference in the risk between the two approaches. For closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum, the outcome measures in previous studies vary, but rely on finding evidence of pelvic adhesions. The relevant Cochrane review includes follow-up studies from four randomised trials that find no evidence of an increased risk of adhesions, although the studies included are small. Because intra-abdominal adhesions are often asymptomatic, it is difficult to interpret much of this evidence. In the CORONIS study we noted no difference in symptoms reported by more than 8000 women assessed in this intervention pair, suggesting that even if there are differences in the incidence of adhesion formation, these are unlikely to produce symptomatic disease for most women.

Implications of all the available evidence

Polyglactin-910 costs at least twice as much as chromic catgut and the finding of no benefit with the use of polyglactin-910 suggests that chromic catgut should be the suture material of choice for uterine repair in appropriate settings. The absence of evidence of any difference between closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum also suggests that non-closure is to be preferred, not simply because it may save time as previous recommendations suggest, but because it will result in the use of fewer sutures, therefore decreasing costs. The use of routine exteriorisation to repair the uterus can also be discouraged as it confers no benefit. If double layer closure of the uterus frequently employs two sutures, then single layer closure would also decrease costs. For those surgeons who routinely repair the uterus in two layers with a single suture, the only potential impact on the operation is the time taken, although there were no apparent differences in the duration of the operation between single and double layer closure in CORONIS.

### Long-term outcomes of two different surgical techniques for cesarean [^73e508a0]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the rate of adhesions and other long-term outcomes of two cesarean delivery techniques.

Methods

A total of 600 women were randomly assigned to either a standard (Pfannenstiel-Kerr) or modified (Joel-Cohen-Stark) technique for first-time cesarean delivery. A total of 124 women were assessed at repeat cesarean delivery. The primary outcome measure was the presence of adhesions.

Results

At repeat cesarean delivery, anesthesia-to-delivery time, total duration of surgery, change in hemoglobin level, time to mobilization and oral intake, and postoperative hospital stay were significantly less with the modified technique. Adhesions were found in 7 (11.3%) and 22 (35.5%) of the cases using the modified and standard techniques, respectively (P=0.0026; relative risk 3.14 [95% CI, 1.45-6.82]).

Conclusion

A modified cesarean delivery technique, including Joel-Cohen incision, exteriorized full thickness suturing of the uterine incision, and non-closure of the peritoneum may reduce long-term morbidities of the procedure.

### Effect of closure versus nonclosure of peritoneum at cesarean section on adhesions: a prospective randomized study [^288bb94d]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to determine the effect of nonclosure of the visceral and parietal peritoneum during cesarean section on the formation of adhesions.

Study Design

This was a prospective randomized trial of 533 women undergoing primary cesarean section; in 256 the peritoneum was left open and in 277 it was closed. Fifty women in the nonclosure group and 47 women in the closure group were subsequently evaluated intraoperatively at a repeat cesarean. The presence of adhesions and their severity were evaluated at several sites.

Results

The nonclosure and closure groups were comparable with regard to the proportion of patients with adhesions at any site (60% vs 51%, respectively; P = .31). Time from incision to delivery was comparable in the nonclosure and closure groups (8.98 ± 4.7 vs 9.32 ± 5.2 minutes, respectively; P = .84).

Conclusion

Closure or nonclosure of the peritoneum at cesarean section did not lead to large differences in the adhesion rate.

### Caesarean section surgical techniques: 3 year follow-up of the CORONIS fractional, factorial, unmasked, randomised controlled trial [^ed2d3814]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

The CORONIS trial reported differences in short-term maternal morbidity when comparing five pairs of alternative surgical techniques for caesarean section. Here we report outcomes at 3 years follow-up.

Methods

The CORONIS trial was a pragmatic international 2×2×2×2×2 non-regular fractional, factorial, unmasked, randomised controlled trial done at 19 sites in Argentina, Chile, Ghana, India, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sudan. Pregnant women were eligible if they were to undergo their first or second caesarean section through a planned transverse abdominal incision. Women were randomly assigned by a secure web-based allocation system to one intervention from each of the three assigned pairs. All investigators, surgeons, and participants were unmasked to treatment allocation. In this follow-up study, we compared outcomes at 3 years following blunt versus sharp abdominal entry, exteriorisation of the uterus for repair versus intra-abdominal repair, single versus double layer closure of the uterus, closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum, and chromic catgut versus polyglactin-910 for uterine repair. Outcomes included pelvic pain; deep dyspareunia; hysterectomy and outcomes of subsequent pregnancies. Outcomes were assessed masked to the original trial allocation. This trial is registered with the Current Controlled Trials registry, number ISRCTN31089967.

Findings

Between Sept 1, 2011, and Sept 30, 2014, 13,153 (84%) women were followed-up for a mean duration of 3·8 years (SD 0·86). For blunt versus sharp abdominal entry there was no evidence of a difference in risk of abdominal hernias (adjusted RR 0·66; 95% CI 0·39-1·11). We also recorded no evidence of a difference in risk of death or serious morbidity of the children born at the time of trial entry (0·99, 0·83-1·17). For exteriorisation of the uterus versus intra-abdominal repair there was no evidence of a difference in risk of infertility (0·91, 0·71-1·18) or of ectopic pregnancy (0·50, 0·15-1·66). For single versus double layer closure of the uterus there was no evidence of a difference in maternal death (0·78, 0·46-1·32) or a composite of pregnancy complications (1·20, 0·75-1·90). For closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum there was no evidence of a difference in any outcomes relating to symptoms associated with pelvic adhesions such as infertility (0·80, 0·61-1·06). For chromic catgut versus polyglactin-910 sutures there was no evidence of a difference in the main comparisons for adverse pregnancy outcomes in a subsequent pregnancy, such as uterine rupture (3·05, 0·32-29·29). Overall, severe adverse outcomes were uncommon in these settings.

Interpretation

Although our study was not powered to detect modest differences in rare but serious events, there was no evidence to favour one technique over another. Other considerations will probably affect clinical practice, such as the time and cost saving of different approaches.

### Skin and subcutaneous fascia closure at caesarean section to reduce wound complications: the closure randomised trial [^2d064c0d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

Overall, we found no strong evidence of effect for either the use of absorbable versus non-absorbable skin suture, or closure versus non-closure if the subcutaneous fascia. There was very weak evidence to suggest that the combination of subcutaneous fascia closure and skin closure with a non-absorbable skin suture was associated with a reduced risk of infection, but this finding should be interpreted with caution as no statistical adjustment has been made for multiple comparisons. Given low event rates and likelihood that any effect of the interventions is of small magnitude, future trials would have to be very large to properly investigate differences while accounting for any possible effect modification.

Comparison with published literature

We have shown that there is some weak evidence to suggest that the combined intervention of subcutaneous fascia closure and skin suturing with absorbable monofilament suture (Caprosyn™), is associated with an increased risk of postoperative wound infection, in comparison with subcutaneous fascia closure and skin suturing with non-absorbable monofilament suture (Prolene™). While previous studies have shown no statistically significant difference in wound infection rates when comparing the use of absorbable versus non-absorbable skin sutures, the combination of subcutaneous fascia closure (or non-closure) with different skin sutures has not been considered.

One possible reason for our findings is that the burden of absorbable suture material is related to the increased relative risk of wound infection, among women who underwent subcutaneous fascia closure and skin closure with absorbable suture. Both the suture used for subcutaneous fascia closure (Vicryl®), and the suture used for skin closure (Caprosyn™) are absorbable. Vicryl® is a poly-filament, braided absorbable synthetic suture, which is completely absorbed within 56–70 days. Caprosyn™ is a short-term absorbable monofilament suture, which is completely absorbed within 56 days. Whenever a foreign body such as a suture, is placed within tissue, it induces an inflammatory reaction. Absorption of absorbable suture material Vicryl® can cause tissue reactions that consist of free fluid, that may facilitate bacterial growth, and the congregation of macrophages and fibroblasts, lymphocytes and plasma cells, which gradually reduce in number and concentration postoperatively. Optimal wound healing requires an appropriate amount of tissue inflammation, however it is possible that the additive burden of concurrent tissue inflammatory responses is sufficient to result in excessive inflammation, decreased efficiency of removal of contaminating micro-organisms, and an increased risk of clinical wound infection.

### A prospective comparative study of single-layer versus double-layer uterine closure techniques on cesarean scar formation [^d3636e10]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

This prospective, randomized clinical trial was carried out at the Research Hospital of Atatürk University Faculty of Medicine between April 2018 and April 2019. The study received ethical approval from the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Atatürk University Faculty of Medicine (Approval No: B.30.2.ATA.0.01.00/150; Date: March 29, 2018). Prior to participation, all individuals provided written informed consent. This study was conducted and reported in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.

Women aged 18–50 years with at least one previous cesarean delivery were considered eligible to maintain consistency in uterine healing characteristics and to reduce variability related to primary uterine incision. Exclusion criteria included suspected or confirmed placenta previa or placenta accreta spectrum, clinical chorioamnionitis, anterior wall uterine fibroids, a history of non–low transverse uterine incision, and cases with anticipated obstetric hemorrhage.

Eligibility was assessed through clinical history, physical examination, abdominal ultrasonography, and laboratory investigations (including complete blood count, biochemical profile, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and blood type). Randomization was performed using computer-generated allocation lists created by a third-party physician who was not involved in the study. Group assignments were sealed in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes, which were opened intraoperatively by the principal investigator.

All cesarean deliveries were performed by senior residents under either general or regional anesthesia, selected based on patient preference and anesthesiologist consultation. Preoperative preparations included pubic hair removal, Foley catheterization, and antisepsis with povidone-iodine. A Pfannenstiel skin incision and a low transverse uterine incision were utilized in all cases. After fetal and placental delivery, cord blood gas analysis was performed. The uterus was either exteriorized or repaired in situ, depending on intraoperative assessment.

Closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum (pelvic and parietal) (Table 3)

Table 3 
Closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum

The Cochrane review of closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum, visceral and/or parietal peritoneum was last updated in 2003. It incorporates nine trials including 1,811 women comparing non-closure versus closure of the visceral and/or the parietal peritoneum. This review found that non-closure was associated with a reduction in operating time (WMD -7.33 mins, 95% CI -8.43, -6.24) and postoperative fever (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.46, 0.95), but no significant difference in the number of analgesic doses (WMD -0.29, 95% CI -0.69, 0.12), wound infection (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.29, 1.21) or endometritis (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.62, 2.71). However, the trials were generally small and of variable methodological quality; three of them used quasi-randomisation methods and hence did not have secure concealment of allocation, rendering them at high risk of bias.

A long-term follow-up study of one of the trials included in the Cochrane review has also been published. 144 out of 280 women originally randomised were included in this study (51%). There were no differences in fertility, abdominal pain, urinary symptoms, or adhesions at subsequent surgery, but the small sample size would be very unlikely to detect any but the largest differences.

These studies suggest that non-closure of the peritoneum may carry some short-term advantages, including a lower risk of post-operative infection, shorter operating time and shorter hospital stay. Again, however, the studies identified were small and the methodology was not always strong.

### A randomized study comparing skin closure in cesarean sections: staples vs subcuticular sutures [^4fd71774]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to compare postoperative pain according to the skin closure method (subcuticular sutures vs staples) after an elective term cesarean section.

Study Design

A randomized controlled trial of 101 women was performed. Women were randomly assigned to subcuticular sutures or staples. Operative technique and postoperative analgesia were standardized. Stratification was used for primary vs repeat cesareans. Analog pain and satisfaction scales ranging from 0-10 were completed at postoperative days 1 and 3, and at 6 weeks postoperatively. A digital photograph of the incision was taken at 6 weeks postoperatively and evaluated by 3 independent blinded observers.

Results

Pain at 6 weeks postoperatively was significantly less in the staple group (0.17 vs 0.51; P = .04). Operative time was shorter in that group (24.6 vs 32.9 minutes; P < .0001). No difference was noted for incision appearance and women's satisfaction.

Conclusion

Staples are the method of choice for skin closure for elective term cesareans in our population.

### Skin and subcutaneous fascia closure at caesarean section to reduce wound complications: the closure randomised trial [^7f196a2a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Wound infection and complication outcomes

Wound infection and complication outcomes by group are presented in Table 2. The overall wound infection rate was lower than expected, with 66 of 849 women (7.77%) reporting a postoperative wound infection in the 30 days postpartum (Table 2).

Table 2 
Incidence of wound outcomes by group in the Closure randomised trial

Women who underwent fascia closure and skin closure with a non-absorbable suture (Group 3) had the lowest rate of postoperative wound infection (10 women [4.72%]), while women who underwent fascia closure and skin closure with an absorbable suture had the highest rate of postoperative wound infection (Group 4) (22 women [10.43%]) (Table 2). In women who did not have fascia closure, rates of wound infection were similar between those who had skin closure with an absorbable suture (Group 2) (17 women (7.91%)) and those who had skin closure with a non-absorbable suture (Group 1) (17 women (8.06%); see Table 2).

The occurrence of wound haematoma and seroma were very low, with only 4 women (0.47%) in the whole cohort having this complication. Two of these women (0.95%) were in Group 2 (fascia non-closure and absorbable skin suture), with a further woman each in Group 1 (0.47%) (fascia non-closure and non-absorbable skin suture) and Group 4 (0.47%) (fascia closure and absorbable skin suture) (Table 2). Only 5 women (0.59%) required reoperation, and 3 women (0.35%) readmission for wound complications in the 30 days following operation (Table 2).

### Skin and subcutaneous fascia closure at caesarean section to reduce wound complications: the closure randomised trial [^74430d9c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Wound infection is a common complication following caesarean section. Factors influencing the risk of infection may include the suture material for skin closure, and closure of the subcutaneous fascia. We assessed the effect of skin closure with absorbable versus non-absorbable suture, and closure versus non-closure of the subcutaneous fascia on risk of wound infection following Caesarean section.

Methods

Women undergoing caesarean birth at an Adelaide maternity hospital were eligible for recruitment to a randomised trial using a 2 × 2 factorial design. Women were randomised to either closure or non-closure of the subcutaneous fascia and to subcuticular skin closure with an absorbable or non-absorbable suture.

Participants were randomised to each of the two interventions into one of 4 possible groups: Group 1 - non-absorbable skin suture and non-closure of the subcutaneous fascia; Group 2 - absorbable skin suture and non-closure of the subcutaneous fascia; Group 3 - non-absorbable skin suture and closure of the subcutaneous fascia; and Group 4 - absorbable skin suture and closure of the subcutaneous fascia.

The primary outcomes were reported wound infection and wound haematoma or seroma within the first 30 days after birth.

Results

A total of 851 women were recruited and randomised, with 849 women included in the analyses (Group 1: 216 women; Group 2: 212 women; Group 3: 212 women; Group 4: 211 women).

In women who underwent fascia closure, there was a statistically significant increase in risk of wound infection within 30 days post-operatively for those who had skin closure with an absorbable suture (Group 4), compared with women who had skin closure with a non-absorbable suture (Group 3) (adjusted RR 2.17; 95% CI 1.05, 4.45; p = 0.035). There was no significant difference in risk of wound infection for absorbable vs non-absorbable sutures in women who did not undergo fascia closure.

Conclusion

The combination of subcutaneous fascia closure and skin closure with an absorbable suture may be associated with an increased risk of reported wound infection after caesarean section.

### Functional recovery after cesarean delivery: a prospective cohort study in rural Rwanda [^789fdd4b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Setting

The parent study was conducted at Kirehe District Hospital (KDH), located in the Eastern Province of Rwanda. KDH encompasses 19 health centers and serves a population of over 360,000. Most Kirehe residents are insured through “ Mutuelle de Sante”— a community-based health insurance scheme by which patients only pay 10% of their healthcare cost. KDH is managed by the Rwandan Ministry of Health (MoH) and receives technical and financial support from Partners In Health/Inshuti Mu Buzima (PIH/IMB), a Boston-based non-governmental international organization. In Kirehe, like other rural areas of Rwanda, labor is monitored at the local health center for normal delivery, while complicated deliveries, high-risk pregnancies, and women who need a c-section delivery are subsequently transferred to KDH for higher level management. C-sections at KDH are performed by general practitioners (GPs) and post-cesarean recovery is monitored by midwives or nurses. There is one obstetrician-gynecologist who assists GPs on more complicated cases and mentors them in the performance of emergency interventions. When there are no complications, a woman is hospitalized for three days after her c-section and is then discharged home to continue wound dressing changes and evaluation at her local health center. The standard procedures for C-section operation at KDH include:1) pre-operative intravenous injection of 2 mg of antibiotics (usually ampicillin or ceftriaxone) within one hour of the operation; 2) spinal analgesia; 3) skin preparation with chlorhexidine followed by Povidone iodine solution; 4) Pfannenstiel incision for the majority(over 70%) of cases and Cohens of midline incision if prior c-section used these techniques; 5)while bladder flap is recommended, it is not usually done by most doctors at KDH; 5) closure of the uterus with a double-layer, non-locking absorbent monofilament suture (peritoneum is not usually sutured and the rectus muscle is sutured only when damaged); 6) skin closure with a continuous subcutaneous suture; 7) postoperative intramuscular injection of 75 mg of Diclofenac immediately after the operation and prescription of paracetamol or Ibuprofen 500 mg twice a day for 5 days, post-operatively. Post-operative antibiotic is provided on a case-by case basis.

### CORONIS-international study of caesarean section surgical techniques: the follow-up study [^139068d7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Methods/Design

The CORONIS Follow-up study

Objective

The objective of the CORONIS Follow-up Study is to measure and compare the incidence of outcomes at around three years between the randomised groups of women who participated in the CORONIS Trial.

Hypothesis

This study will assess the following null hypotheses: In women who underwent delivery by caesarean section, no differences will be detected with respect to a range of long-term outcomes when comparing the following five pairs of alternative surgical techniques:

1. Blunt versus sharp abdominal entry

2. Exteriorisation of the uterus for repair versus intra-abdominal repair

3. Single versus double layer closure of the uterus

4. Closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum (pelvic and parietal)

5. Chromic catgut versus Polyglactin-910 for uterine repair

### Guidelines on placenta accreta spectrum disorders: a systematic review [^e818e844]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Cesarean Hysterectomy

The section on hysterectomy techniques showed poor consensus (38.5% [5 of 13] agreement, 38.5% [5 of 13] insufficient evidence, and 23.0% [3 of 13] disagreement) (Figure 3 ; eTable 8 in Supplement 1). Consensus exists on using preoperative or intraoperative ultrasonography to map placental edges, using the modified dorsal lithotomy position for delivery, selecting the uterine incision site based on antenatal imaging and intraoperative findings to ensure a sufficient distance from the placenta, avoiding placental removal attempts to prevent bleeding, and administering tranexamic acid immediately before or during CD to manage hemorrhage. However, substantial disagreement and evidence gaps persist in key areas, including anesthesia choice, with some guidelines favoring general anesthesiaand others recommending regional techniques,ultimately advising a case-by-case approach based on patient preference and safety,, ; and skin incision technique, with some guidelines supporting a midline incision despite weak evidence, especially when the placental superior margin extends beyond the lower uterine segment,,,, and others emphasizing the safety and satisfaction of a large transverse incision, noting the lack of evidence comparing outcomes between techniques.

### Suture closure of subcutaneous fat and wound disruption after cesarean delivery: a meta-analysis [^c9da89c3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To define the role of suture closure of the subcutaneous dead space in preventing wound complications after cesarean delivery.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the bibliographies of major texts and review articles.

Methods Of Study Selection

Only studies in which patients undergoing cesarean delivery were randomly assigned to closure of the subcutaneous space or to no closure were included. Each study was required to report on at least 1 of the following outcomes: wound infection, hematoma, seroma, or separation. The studies also reported "wound disruption," a combination of these outcomes which either explicitly stated or strongly implied the need for further wound care. Six studies meeting criteria were identified.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Three studies included 875 patients with any subcutaneous thickness and noted a decrease in wound disruption with closure (relative risk [RR] 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36, 0.86). Two studies reported results from 181 patients with incision depth of 2 cm or less and noted no difference (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.46, 2.20). Five studies reported results on 887 patients with wound thickness greater than 2 cm. Although only 1 study had a significant effect by itself, when results were combined, there was a significant decrease in wound disruption (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.48, 0.91). This reduction seems to be largely a result of decreased wound seromas (4 studies, 852 patients, RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.24, 0.75). In women with wound thickness greater than 2 cm, subcutaneous closure resulted in a risk reduction of 6.2%, and 16.2 women would need subcutaneous closure to prevent 1 wound disruption (number needed to treat).

Conclusion

Suture closure of subcutaneous fat during cesarean delivery results in a 34% decrease in risk of wound disruption in women with fat thickness greater than 2 cm.

### Postpartum care: an approach to the fourth trimester-AAFP (...) [^7e192d93]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

The 12 weeks after delivery, known as the postpartum period or the fourth trimester, are a critical time in the life of a mother and her infant. Maternal mortality, which is defined as deaths that occur during pregnancy and the first year postpartum, is highest in the first 42 days postpartum and represents 45% of total maternal mortality. 1, 2 Early postpartum visits should evaluate complications from pregnancy as well as common postpartum medical complications. 3–5 Subsequent care should include a full biopsychosocial assessment and be tailored to individual patient needs going forward. 3 Family physicians should be aware of the importance of social determinants of health and disparities in maternal outcomes according to race, ethnicity, and public health insurance status. Timing and Frequency of Postpartum Visits Historically, physicians have performed a single postpartum visit between four and six weeks after delivery to close the prenatal care relationship.

1 There is a growing consensus to initiate care within the first three weeks postpartum, and to extend the postpartum period to transition to care of chronic conditions. 6–8 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends a postpartum evaluation within the first three weeks after delivery in person or by phone, with a complete biopsychosocial assessment to be completed within 12 weeks postpartum. 3 The World Health Organization recommends visits at three days, seven to 14 days, and six weeks postpartum, inclusive of newborn care. 3, 9 A routine pelvic examination is not indicated unless there are patient concerns. GESTATIONAL DIABETES MELLITUS Gestational diabetes mellitus is a significant risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and subsequent heart disease. A woman with a history of gestational diabetes has an eight- to 20-fold risk of developing type 2 diabetes during her lifetime.

20, 21 Women with gestational diabetes should be screened for impaired glucose tolerance with a 75-g two-hour fasting oral glucose tolerance test at four to 12 weeks postpartum, and should be evaluated for development of hypertension with blood pressure monitoring. 20, 53 They should continue to be screened for diabetes every one to three years because the risk of type 2 diabetes is elevated.
21. THYROID DISORDERS Postpartum thyroiditis can affect up to 10% of women during the first year postpartum, with similar rates of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. 23 Postpartum hyperthyroidism is usually transient and does not need to be treated. Hypothyroidism is treated with thyroid hormone therapy. The risk of Graves disease is also increased postpartum, and women with a history of this disease are more likely to relapse. Positive thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies can distinguish Graves disease from postpartum thyroiditis.

Infants of women who are breastfeeding and being treated for thyroid disorders should be monitored for growth and development; however, laboratory monitoring of infants' thyroid function is not necessary. 23, 24 The American Thyroid Association recommends annual thyroid function screening in women with a history of postpartum thyroiditis.
23. POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION Up to 10% of women will experience depression in the first year postpartum. The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force, ACOG, and American Academy of Pediatrics recommend one or more screening examinations for postpartum depression in settings where systems are in place to ensure diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. 25–27 The American Academy of Pediatrics has specific recommendations for timing of screening at the one-, two-, four-, and six-month well-child visits. The Patient Health Questionnaire-2, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale are appropriate screening tools.

### The CORONIS trial. international study of caesarean section surgical techniques: a randomised fractional, factorial trial [^6930e5aa]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2007). Low credibility.

2. Exteriorisation of uterus for repair versus intra-abdominal repair

Exteriorisation

Once the placenta has been delivered the uterus is drawn from the pelvis to rest on the anterior abdominal wall so that the uterine incision can clearly be visualised. The uterus is then repaired (with or without repair of the pelvic peritoneum) and the uterus is then returned to the pelvis.

If exteriorisation of the uterus is not possible because of pain, then intra-abdominal repair may be necessary. This should be recorded as intra-abdominal repair on the Data Collection Booklet and the reason for non-compliance with the allocated intervention given as "intra-operative pain".

Intra-abdominal repair

The uterine incision is repaired while in the pelvis.

3. Single versus double layer closure of the uterus

Double layer uterine closure

The uterine incision is closed with two layers of sutures. Each layer may be continuous, continuous locking, interrupted or any other accepted technique.

The first layer opposes the endometrial aspect of the uterine muscle layer and the second layer of sutures bring together the serosal layer ensuring haemostasis and complete apposition of the incision.

Single layer uterine closure

This technique involves bringing both edges of the uterine incision together with a single layer of sutures. This may be a continuous, continuous locking or an interrupted layer of sutures.

Haemostasis of the incision can be effected by using additional single or 'figure of eight' sutures as judged necessary by the surgeon regardless of the method of closure undertaken.

4. Closure or non-closure of the peritoneum

Closure of the peritoneum

Women allocated closure of the peritoneum should have the pelvic and parietal peritoneum closed. The techniques of closure, including the suture material used, will be at the discretion of the clinician.

In some women with a previous caesarean section, repair of the pelvic peritoneum, the parietal peritoneum or both may be impossible. If this is the case, surgeons should record this as non-closure of the peritoneum on the Data Collection Booklet including the reason for non-compliance.

Non-closure of the peritoneum

In women allocated non-closure, the peritoneum should not be closed.

For either closure or non-closure of the peritoneum, haemostasis should be affected as usual including, where necessary, the use of haemostatic sutures.

### Postoperative adhesions in gynecologic surgery: a committee opinion [^14bae884]. Fertility and Sterility (2019). High credibility.

Peritoneal closure and adhesions—controversy and observed rates: Whether parietal peritoneal closure is necessary or advisable remains controversial. Evidence suggests that the incidence of adhesions at the site of closure after laparotomy is approximately 22% with peritoneal closure and 16% without peritoneal closure. In women with ovarian cancer, closure of pelvic and parietal peritoneum appears to result in greater adhesion formation than is observed when the dissected areas are left open, whereas parietal peritoneal closure at primary cesarean delivery has been observed to yield significantly fewer dense and filmy adhesions.

### The value of subcutaneous tissue closure and drain in obese women undergo elective caesarean section: a randomized controlled trial [^171ecb93]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Techniques of management of subcutaneous tissue space during CD especially in obese women is considered a large area of debates. In a Cochrane review, closure of subcutaneous space in women with space thickness more than 2 cm is associated with lowered the risks of wound complications named seroma, separation, hematoma and infection.

In a systematic review the closure of subcutaneous space in women with space thickness more than 2 cm is associated with 34% decrease in the wound disruption risks and that was confirmed in a more recent meta-analysis.

The placement of subcutaneous drain was suggested as an alternative to subcutaneous suturing. Earlier studies demonstrated that the placement of subcutaneous drain after CD was associated with increased rates of wound infections.

More recent studies demonstrated that subcutaneous drain placement is associated with a decreased risk of all wound complications.

The placement of subcutaneous drain to prevent wound complication is controversial.

The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous suture reapproximation alone versus suture plus subcutaneous drain or non-closure for the prevention of wound complications in obese women undergoing elective cesarean delivery.

To assess pain perception and pain medication use between women who underwent suture and those who underwent stapling for skin closure after cesarean delivery.

Methods

This was a secondary analysis of a prospective, multicenter, randomized clinical trial conducted from 2010 to 2012 at three hospitals in the United States. We evaluated pain outcomes associated with skin closure of a low transverse skin incision for cesarean delivery. Patient-reported pain and pain medication use during hospitalization and 6 weeks postpartum were evaluated as prespecified secondary outcomes of the trial.

Results

A total of 746 women were randomized to cesarean skin closure with sutures (n=370) or staples (n=376). There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to pain perception during hospitalization (median average in-hospital pain score 3.9 in each group, P=.914), or at 4-8 weeks postsurgery (one in each group, P=.949). There were no significant differences in pain medication use during hospitalization (suture: 56 mg of intravenous morphine; staples: 54 mg, P=.545) or 4-8 weeks postpartum.

Conclusion

We observed no differences in patient-reported pain or pain medication use among women who underwent skin closure with suture and those who underwent stapling after cesarean delivery. Taken in conjunction with the primary analysis that showed decreased wound morbidity with suture closure, the results of this study support the use of suture closure of the cesarean delivery skin incision.

Wound management and closure techniques—risk and evidence in gynecologic surgery indicate that wound seroma increases the risk of abdominal wound infection, there are no validated techniques for gynecologic procedures, and although subcutaneous dead space closure has been shown to be effective and drain placement not effective for reducing surgical site infections during cesarean delivery, it is unknown if these results generalize to nongravid patients; in a systematic review of gynecologic surgeries including gynecologic oncology patients with 3 or more centimeters of subcutaneous fat, a single randomized controlled trial comparing no closure, subcutaneous dead space closure, and drain placement did not find a difference in surgical site infection rates.

### WITHDRAWN: single versus two layer suturing for closing the uterine incision at caesarean section [^6bcad14e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

A single layer closure might save operating time, disrupt less tissue, introduce less foreign material into the wound, and thus result in less post operative morbidity.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of a single layer closure of the uterine incision at caesarean section, in contrast to conventional two layer closure.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials of single layer closure, either interrupted or continuous, compared to two layer closure with continuous sutures in pregnant women undergoing elective or emergency caesarean section.

Data Collection and Analysis

One reviewer assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Two trials involving 1006 women were included. Based on one trial, single layer closure was associated with reduced operating time (5.6 minutes). Based on one trial, radiographic scar appearance showed fewer scar defects at three months with the single closure group. There were no statistically significant differences in the use of extra haemostatic sutures, incidence of endometritis, decrease in post operative haematocrit or use of blood transfusion.

Authors' Conclusions

There appear to be no advantages or disadvantages for routine use of single layer closure compared to two layer closure, except perhaps a shorter operation time.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of the female pelvis after cesarean section: a pictorial review [^c48e3601]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Cesarean delivery on maternal request without any medical indication is considered a separate indication.

In the majority of cases, skin incision is Pfannenstiel incision (transverse suprapubic cut). The uterine incision may be classical (midline vertical) or—most commonly performed—transverse just above the bladder edge (lower (uterine) segment Cesarean section (LSCS)).

It is hypothesized that the surgical technique of uterine incision closure is the most important determinant of C-section defect formation. The appropriate suture of the myometrial edges (in two layers of non-locking continuous sutures without undue tightness and minimal inclusion of decidua) allows their best apposition without devascularization, as ischemic necrosis of the myometrial tissue is considered as responsible for the formation of C-section defect, scarring, and adhesions.

There is a long list of possible maternal and fetal complications related to the uterine scar after C-section, including uterine scar dehiscence, uterine rupture, abdominal and pelvic adhesions, uterine synechiae, ectopic pregnancy, anomalous location of the placenta, placental invasion, and—rarely—vesicouterine or uterocutaneous fistulas. Other maternal complications include (chronic) pelvic pain, (chronic) incision site pain, dysmenorrhea, abnormal vaginal bleeding, endometriosis, and reduced future fertility. The risk of serious maternal morbidity (placenta previa, accreta/increta/percreta, uterine dehiscence or rupture, postpartum hemorrhage, blood transfusion, bladder injury), duration of the operation and of hospital stay, and the number of admissions to intensive care unit increase with increasing numbers of previous Cesarean sections.

### Practice bulletin no. 184: vaginal birth after cesarean delivery [^2e0b2bc5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cesarean delivery, more specifically with respect to vaginal birth after Cesarean delivery, technical considerations, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to recognize that external cephalic version for breech presentation is not contraindicated in females with a previous low transverse uterine incision being candidates for external cephalic version and a trial of labor after Cesarean delivery.

### A prospective comparative study of single-layer versus double-layer uterine closure techniques on cesarean scar formation [^8bcd57ca]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

This study aims to evaluate the impact of two different uterine closure techniques—single-layer versus double-layer non-locking sutures—on cesarean scar healing, as measured by RMT. By assessing healing at both six weeks and six months postpartum, this study seeks to contribute clinically applicable, time-specific data to an area of ongoing debate. Unlike previous studies, both techniques exclude endometrial inclusion, and surgical debridement is added in the double-layer group. Blinded ultrasonographic evaluation at defined time points strengthens objectivity. These methodological strengths help clarify the comparative efficacy of standardized closure techniques and add robust, evidence-based guidance to current surgical practice.

### The case for standardizing cesarean delivery technique: seeing the forest for the trees [^ee41d2e1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

WHY STANDARDIZE CESAREAN DELIVERY SURGICAL TECHNIQUE?

Standardized approaches to clinical practice are consistently associated with improved outcomes. In the outpatient setting, protocols and checklists have reduced patient harm through increased standardization and communication.The science of routinizing surgery remains in its infancy,, but may be particularly beneficial for high-volume procedures such as cesarean delivery. A prime example of these benefits is Shouldice Hospital, an inguinal hernia specialty hospital in Toronto, Ontario Canada. Atul Gawande, in his book Complications, described Shouldice's standardized approach to inguinal hernia repair which demonstrated a four-fold decrease in hernia recurrence relative to other Canadian hospitals. –

There is already strong evidence that standardizing certain aspects of cesarean delivery surgical technique is associated with less surgical site infection. Both Lemming et al and Kawakita et al reported a more than 50% reduction in surgical site infection when either four or nine aspects of cesarean delivery preparation or technique were standardized, respectively. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 44 studies, Martin et alfound similar surgical site infection reduction when preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis, vaginal preparation and spontaneous removal of the placenta were standardly performed. Carter et alalso demonstrated that evidence-based bundles were associated with reduced surgical site infection in a systematic review and meta-analysis. Interestingly, the techniques standardized varied among studies, suggesting that the act of bundling or standardization may independently contribute to improved outcomes rather than the specific techniques individually.

Since the previous systematic review by Dahlke et al in 2013, the CORONIS trial has reported short-term and long-term data for more than 15,000 women undergoing cesarean delivery randomized to three of five alternative surgical techniques.– There was no difference in outcomes related to cesarean delivery surgical technique including long-term outcomes such as subsequent uterine rupture (indicating that double layer uterine closure is not protective) or symptoms attributable to intra-abdominal adhesions (indicating that peritoneal closure is not protective). The authors suggest that in the absence of clinical benefit, considerations such as cost and time savings should dictate appropriate technique.We concur wholeheartedly with this logic. Omitting steps with no benefit are just as important as including those with benefit and critical to establishing a standardized technique.

### Continuous versus disrupted subcutaneous tissue closure in cesarean section: a retrospective cohort study [^42be42db]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To compare rates of surgical-site infections following continuous, as compared with interrupted, subcutaneous tissue closure technique during cesarean delivery (CD).

Methods

A retrospective cohort study during 2008-2018. The study group included women who underwent either elective or emergent CD with continuous subcutaneous tissue closure, while the control group comprised those with interrupted subcutaneous tissue closure. We excluded women with suspected infectious morbidity before CD. The primary outcome was surgical-site infection (SSI) rate.

Results

The final analysis included 6281 women. We performed continuous subcutaneous tissue closure in 37.4% (1867/4988) of scheduled CD, and 45.8% (592/1293) of emergent CD. The rate of SSI was significantly lower following continuous than interrupted subcutaneous tissue closure, in both elective CD (2.7% versus 4.5%, respectively, P =0.031) and emergent CD (3.2% versus 5.4%, respectively, P =0.036) in nulliparous and multiparous women. Similarly, secondary outcomes such as re-admission rates, postoperative maternal fever, and need for antibiotic treatment were significantly lower following continuous subcutaneous closure.

Conclusions

Continuous subcutaneous closure technique during CD yields a lower rate of surgical-site complications compared with the interrupted technique.

### CORONIS-international study of caesarean section surgical techniques: the follow-up study [^04c9c4f6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

There has been one large observational study of peripartum hysterectomy relating this to previous caesarean section. This study, carried out in the UK, collected all cases of peripartum hysterectomy during a 13 month period. There were 318 confirmed cases of peripartum hysterectomy in an estimated 779,955 total births, giving an incidence of 4.1 per 10,000 total births (95% CI 3.6 to 4.5). Three hysterectomies were undertaken electively for management of malignancy with the remaining 315 undertaken for management of haemorrhage. The most commonly reported causes of haemorrhage were uterine atony (53%), morbidly adherent placenta (39%), uterine rupture (8%) and extension of uterine incision at delivery (6%). Compared with controls, women who had had a peripartum hysterectomy had over three times the odds (odds ratio 3.52, 95% CI 2.35 to 5.26) of having a previous caesarean section. This odds ratio increased with the number of previous sections such that women with a peripartum hysterectomy had over eighteen times the odds of having two or more previous sections compared to control women. In this study, two women died, a case fatality of 0.6% (95% CI 0 to 1.5%).

This study did not collect data about the surgical techniques used at previous caesarean section but it does illustrate the evidence that is beginning to emerge about the important longer term morbidity associated with caesarean section.

There are no on-going studies of long-term follow-up of randomised controlled trials of caesarean section that any of the investigators are aware of. The UK CAESAR Trial, which was a 2×2×2 factorial trial of (i) single versus double layer uterine closure, (ii) closure versus non-closure of the pelvic peritoneum and (iii) liberal versus restricted use of a sub-sheath drain has finished recruiting and long-term follow-up of this cohort is planned. This trial was also conducted by the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit (NPEU) and follow-up is planned for 8–11 years after trial recruitment because the inter-pregnancy interval is substantially longer in a UK population than in the settings participating in CORONIS. A prospective meta-analysis of the trial follow-up studies (for single versus double layer uterine closure) is planned.

### The CORONIS trial. international study of caesarean section surgical techniques: a randomised fractional, factorial trial [^eeff4c91]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2007). Low credibility.

In the analysis of a factorial trial the same process is used for a 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design as for a 2 × 2 factorial design. All those allocated 1 are compared with all those allocated "not 1" regardless of what other interventions were allocated, provided that there is no interaction. This is best illustrated using an example. Consider a 2 × 2 factorial trial comparing the effects of single versus double layer closure of the uterine incision and closure versus non-closure of the peritoneum. Hence, there are four groups in the trial:

• single layer and closure of the peritoneum

• single layer and non-closure of the peritoneum

• double layer and closure of the peritoneum

• double layer and non-closure of the peritoneum

A simple example (Table 5) of no interaction being present. Here, the febrile morbidity risk ratio for double versus single layer uterine closure is the same in those who had closure of the peritoneum (20% vs 10% gives risk ratio = 2) and those who had non-closure (30% vs 15% gives risk ratio = 2). Therefore, the single layer and double layer groups may be combined and the analysis is based on the (bold) marginal totals (25% vs 12.5% gives risk ratio = 2).

Table 5 
Example of no interaction present

Numbers shown are number of cases of febrile morbidity/total (percentage)

Similarly, Table 6 gives a simple example of an interaction being present. Here, the febrile morbidity risk ratio for double versus single layer uterine closure is much smaller in those who had closure of the peritoneum (10% vs 10% gives risk ratio = 1) than in those who had non-closure (40% vs 20% gives risk ratio = 2). Therefore, we would present these two risk ratios separately rather than using the combined data.
