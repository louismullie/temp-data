## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about cardiac biomarkers — what they are, when they add value, and how to interpret and apply them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core biomarkers and their pathophysiologic roles. Then, I should verify the clinical contexts where each biomarker adds value. Next, I will examine special populations and confounders that alter interpretation. After that, I need to check guideline-backed protocols and thresholds. Finally, I will consider emerging biomarkers, limitations, and a practical decision framework, ensuring I continuously validate claims against the cited literature throughout.

> Let me first confirm the foundational biomarkers and their biology. Cardiac troponins I and T are the preferred markers for myocardial injury because of their high sensitivity and specificity; high-sensitivity assays detect very low concentrations and enable early rule-in/rule-out strategies, but they also detect non-ACS myocardial injury, so I need to ensure I interpret results in clinical context and with serial sampling to identify a rise and/or fall pattern [^1156S99x] [^114grbem] [^1133icD7]. Natriuretic peptides, BNP and NT-proBNP, reflect ventricular wall stress and are central to diagnosing and prognosticating heart failure; I should double-check that their diagnostic utility is strongest to exclude HF in the acute setting and that serial trends can inform prognosis and response to therapy [^116xxyxX] [^114AdW1k]. CK-MB and myoglobin are largely historical; I need to remember their limitations and that they have been supplanted by troponins in contemporary practice, though CK-MB may still be used in some settings for timing or reinfarction assessment [^115kDEdQ] [^111pt5wc].

> Now, I will examine the clinical contexts where these biomarkers change management. In acute chest pain and suspected ACS, hs-cTn with validated 0/1–2 hour algorithms enables rapid rule-out and early rule-in of MI; I should confirm that guidelines require detection of a dynamic rise/fall and integration with ECG and symptoms to define MI subtypes, and that hs-cTn also carries prognostic information beyond diagnosis [^1156S99x] [^1133icD7] [^112LLxUX]. In acute decompensated heart failure, NT-proBNP/BNP support diagnosis when uncertain and provide prognostic information; troponin elevation in ADHF signals worse outcomes, so I need to ensure I interpret troponin in the context of HF rather than reflexively labeling it as ACS unless the clinical picture supports ischemia [^116xxyxX] [^112X93ny]. In perioperative care, I should verify that major guidelines recommend hs-cTn and natriuretic peptides before and after intermediate/high-risk noncardiac surgery in patients with risk factors or symptoms, while discouraging routine testing in low-risk patients, to refine risk and detect silent myocardial injury [^115JrBGF] [^113UM9YM] [^112xUB3T]. In cardio-oncology, baseline and serial natriuretic peptides and/or troponin can aid early detection of cancer therapy–related cardiac dysfunction, but I need to check that evidence is mixed and that guidelines emphasize selective use rather than universal screening [^113UyWKR] [^116ZTUvQ] [^116HzT5S]. In COVID-19, troponin and natriuretic peptide elevations are common and correlate with adverse outcomes; I should confirm that biomarker-guided risk stratification is reasonable in severe cases while avoiding indiscriminate testing in mild disease [^116YkQ6E] [^111EH2ki] [^1123DUNj].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal cutoffs; I need to check special populations and confounders that alter interpretation. In chronic kidney disease, reduced clearance elevates baseline troponin and natriuretic peptides, so I should confirm that dynamic change and clinical context matter more than absolute values, and that sex-specific 99th percentiles for hs-cTn are recommended to improve diagnostic accuracy [^112iQ2vb] [^1146sGvY]. In pregnancy, natriuretic peptides and troponin remain useful when cardiac disease is suspected, but I should double-check that routine testing in uncomplicated pregnancy is discouraged and that postpartum elevations warrant evaluation rather than reassurance [^116jowwk] [^112XQZ9S]. In pediatrics, age-specific reference ranges are essential; I need to ensure I apply validated pediatric cutoffs and recognize that congenital heart disease and cardiomyopathy can confound interpretation [^111ACtVx] [^11113kcT]. In athletes, exercise-associated troponin elevations are common and usually benign; I should verify that troponin kinetics differ from MI and that clinical correlation is key to avoid overdiagnosis [^116cnaWy] [^116W5Pge] [^113XvJAe].

> Next, I should review guideline-backed protocols and thresholds to anchor practice. For hs-cTn, validated 0/1–2 hour algorithms using assay-specific cutoffs and delta criteria enable rapid MI rule-out; I need to ensure I apply the correct assay's 99th percentile upper reference limit and sex-specific thresholds where indicated, and remember that a rise/fall pattern is essential to distinguish acute injury from chronic elevation [^1133icD7] [^1156S99x] [^1146sGvY]. For natriuretic peptides, I should confirm that very low values effectively exclude acute HF, while higher values support the diagnosis; serial measurements can track response, but I must remember that obesity lowers NT-proBNP and that renal dysfunction elevates baseline levels [^116xxyxX] [^112daB2p]. For perioperative care, I should double-check that hs-cTn and natriuretic peptides are recommended around intermediate/high-risk surgery in at-risk patients, with timing at baseline and 24–48 hours postoperatively, while low-risk patients should not undergo routine testing [^115JrBGF] [^113UM9YM] [^112cVZFC].

> I will now examine emerging biomarkers and evolving concepts. Soluble ST2, galectin-3, and GDF-15 reflect myocardial stress, fibrosis, and inflammation and may add prognostic value in HF and CKD, but I need to ensure I acknowledge limited therapeutic implications and the need for further validation before routine adoption [^1164Swtg] [^112iQ2vb]. Troponin fragmentation patterns are being explored to improve specificity for type 1 MI versus other myocardial injuries; I should confirm this remains investigational but promising for future assay development [^114yzqgB]. Multimarker strategies combining necrosis, stress, and inflammatory markers may refine risk stratification, yet I must be cautious and verify that clinical utility and cost-effectiveness remain to be proven in prospective trials [^116y32Gn] [^1147aRY8].

> But wait, what if I overstate biomarker utility; I need to ensure I articulate limitations and pitfalls. Biomarkers must be interpreted in clinical context; troponin detects injury but not etiology, and natriuretic peptides reflect wall stress rather than a single disease, so false positives and negatives occur and serial sampling with clinical correlation is essential [^1156S99x] [^114grbem]. Analytic variability, preanalytical handling, and assay-specific characteristics can confound results; I should double-check institutional protocols and quality assurance to minimize misclassification [^113MGDSh]. Despite strong associations with outcomes, many biomarkers have modest incremental value over traditional risk factors, and evidence that biomarker-guided therapy improves hard outcomes is limited; I need to be transparent about these gaps when counseling patients [^112q1vpZ] [^1164Swtg].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and sanity-check it against guidelines. First, define the clinical question: is this suspected ACS, acute HF, perioperative risk, cardio-oncology surveillance, or primary prevention risk assessment; the indication drives which biomarker to choose and how to interpret it. Second, select the right biomarker and timing: hs-cTn for suspected MI with 0/1–2 hour algorithms, NT-proBNP/BNP for suspected HF, and hs-cTn plus natriuretic peptides for perioperative or cardio-oncology risk; avoid indiscriminate testing in low-risk settings [^1133icD7] [^115JrBGF] [^113UyWKR]. Third, account for confounders: adjust for age, sex, renal function, obesity, and athletic status, and use assay-specific cutoffs and deltas to avoid misinterpretation [^1146sGvY] [^112iQ2vb] [^116cnaWy]. Fourth, interpret dynamically: look for rise/fall in troponin and trajectory in natriuretic peptides, integrate with ECG, symptoms, and imaging, and escalate care when patterns indicate high risk [^1156S99x] [^1178NWLW]. Finally, communicate uncertainty: explain that biomarkers improve risk estimation but do not replace clinical judgment, and that some elevations warrant further evaluation even when the immediate diagnosis is not ACS [^114grbem] [^11219eGm].

> In conclusion, cardiac biomarkers are indispensable tools when used thoughtfully: hs-cTn and natriuretic peptides anchor diagnosis and risk stratification in ACS and HF, respectively, while guideline-directed protocols in perioperative and cardio-oncology settings enable earlier detection of injury or stress; I need to ensure I always interpret results in the right clinical context, apply assay-specific algorithms, and recognize special populations where thresholds and kinetics differ, so that biomarkers enhance rather than obscure clinical decision-making [^1156S99x] [^116xxyxX] [^115JrBGF] [^113UyWKR].

Cardiac markers are laboratory tests that detect myocardial injury or stress, with **high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn)** as the gold standard for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction (AMI) due to its superior sensitivity and specificity [^1156S99x] [^114grbem]. Natriuretic peptides (**BNP/NT-proBNP**) are central for diagnosing and risk-stratifying heart failure, while **CK-MB and myoglobin** are now reserved for specific scenarios or when hs-cTn is unavailable [^116xxyxX] [^112daB2p]. Emerging markers such as **ST2, galectin-3, and GDF-15** add prognostic value in heart failure and other cardiac conditions, but are not yet first-line diagnostics [^1164Swtg] [^112iQ2vb]. Interpretation must always be **context-specific**, integrating clinical presentation, ECG, and imaging, and considering confounders like renal dysfunction, age, and assay variability [^111oAaRe] [^1178NWLW].

## Established cardiac markers

### Cardiac troponins (cTnI and cTnT)

- **Clinical role**: Gold standard for AMI diagnosis; detect myocardial necrosis with high sensitivity and specificity [^1156S99x] [^114grbem].
- **High-sensitivity assays**: Enable detection of very low troponin levels, allowing early rule-out/rule-in of AMI and detection of subclinical injury [^1133icD7] [^1154vzR1].
- **Limitations**: Elevations can occur in non-ACS conditions (e.g. myocarditis, PE, renal dysfunction, sepsis), requiring clinical correlation [^11219eGm] [^113MGDSh].

---

### Creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB)

Historically used for **AMI diagnosis**, particularly for detecting reinfarction, but has been largely replaced by hs-cTn due to lower sensitivity and specificity [^111pt5wc] [^114grbem]. It may still be used when hs-cTn is unavailable or to assess reinfarction.

---

### Myoglobin

An **early marker of myocardial injury** that rises rapidly but lacks specificity, as it is also released with skeletal muscle injury [^111pt5wc]. It is rarely used alone and is mainly of historical interest.

---

### Natriuretic peptides (BNP and NT-proBNP)

- **Clinical role**: Central to heart failure diagnosis, prognosis, and risk stratification; elevated levels indicate ventricular wall stress and overload [^116xxyxX] [^112daB2p].
- **Guideline support**: Strongly recommended in acute and chronic HF management [^116xxyxX].
- **Limitations**: Levels can be affected by age, renal function, obesity, and thyroid dysfunction [^1164Swtg].

## Emerging cardiac markers

| **Marker** | **Clinical role** | **Current status** |
|-|-|-|
| Soluble ST2 (IL-33 receptor) | Prognostic marker in HF; reflects myocardial stress and fibrosis | Approved for HF risk stratification; not first-line diagnostic [^notfound] |
| Galectin-3 | Reflects cardiac fibrosis and inflammation; prognostic in HF | Approved for HF risk stratification; not first-line diagnostic [^notfound] |
| Growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) | Prognostic marker in HF, CAD, and AF | Investigational; promising but not routine [^notfound] |
| High-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) | Detects subclinical myocardial injury; prognostic in ambulatory populations | Widely adopted for AMI; expanding role in risk prediction [^1154vzR1] [^111Y44hC] |

---

## Clinical applications and limitations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Primary marker** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute MI | hs-cTn | False positives in non-ACS conditions; requires clinical correlation [^113MGDSh] [^11219eGm] |
| Heart failure | BNP/NT-proBNP | Influenced by age, renal function, obesity |
| Myocarditis | hs-cTn | Non-specific; requires clinical and imaging correlation [^1166z793] |
| Perioperative myocardial injury | hs-cTn | Routine use debated; context-specific [^115JrBGF] [^113UM9YM] |
| Cancer therapy cardiotoxicity | hs-cTn, BNP | Unclear thresholds; evolving evidence [^112T21pv] [^116ZTUvQ] |

---

## Factors influencing biomarker interpretation

- **Age and sex**: Older age and male sex are associated with higher baseline troponin levels; sex-specific reference limits are recommended [^1146sGvY].
- **Renal function**: Reduced clearance can elevate troponin and natriuretic peptide levels, complicating interpretation [^112iQ2vb].
- **Assay variability**: Different assays have varying sensitivities and reference ranges, necessitating assay-specific interpretation [^111oAaRe].

---

## Future directions

Efforts focus on developing **multimarker panels** to improve diagnostic accuracy and prognostication [^114LmpfC] [^116y32Gn]. Digital health tools may enable real-time biomarker monitoring and integration with clinical decision support [^115rEoRN]. Research continues to define clear roles for emerging markers in routine clinical practice [^1147aRY8].

---

Cardiac markers are essential for diagnosing and managing cardiovascular disease, with **hs-cTn and natriuretic peptides** as the cornerstone. Emerging markers show promise but require further validation. Interpretation must be **context-specific**, integrating clinical presentation and confounders.

### Serum cardiac markers are inversely associated with VOmax of amateur athletes in response to endurance training adaptations [^116cnaWy]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2019). High credibility.

What are the new findings?

Serum cardiac markers and maximum oxygen consumption have inverse relationship in young amateur moderately trained athletes.
Gradual training intensity adaptation results in decreased serum cardiac markers.
Increased serum cardiac markers are dependent on adaptation of training.

How might it impact on clinical practice in the near future?

Elevation of serum cardiac markers in young, moderately trained amateur athletes may not be pathological rather it may be due to training experience, genetic factor and extreme intensity as well as training duration which needs further considerations.

### How to interpret cardiac biomarkers in children? [^111ACtVx]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2023). Medium credibility.

Cardiac biomarkers are used as first-line diagnostic tools in suspected myocardial injury and heart failure in adult patients. Their use in paediatric patients has been limited by variability caused by age, gender and the presence of an underlying congenital cardiac condition. There are established reference ranges for both NT-proBNP and troponin in healthy children, but these cannot be applied to all paediatric patients because of limited large studies focusing on children with congenital heart disease and/or cardiomyopathy. This article will focus on the pathophysiology of myocardial injury and heart failure in children and the subsequent cardiac biomarker correlation. It will explain how to interpret the biomarker assay levels obtained for both troponin and NT-proBNP and highlights the importance of a clear clinical question prior to requesting a cardiac biomarker assay level. Clinical cases outline scenarios that may prompt consideration of biomarker analysis in children and aims to equip the reader with an understanding of how to interpret the results.

### Biomarkers in acute cardiac disease: the present and the future [^117P4NVR]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

The use of biomarkers to aid diagnosis and treatment is increasing rapidly as genomics and proteomics help us expand the number of markers we can use and as an improved understanding of the pathophysiology of cardiac disease guides their use. However, as with all rapidly expanding fields, there is the risk of excessive enthusiasm unless we are circumspect about the data that guide the clinical use of these new tools. This review focuses first on how to use troponin, which at present is the best validated of the new markers, and will hopefully provide insight into how to use this biomarker more productively by distinguishing subsets of patients and by providing an understanding of the meaning of elevations in various clinical situations. The review then discusses the use as well as the knowledge gaps associated with emerging biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptide and C-reactive protein, which are increasingly moving toward more productive clinical use. Finally, it reflects on some of the large number of markers that are still in development.

### Role and importance of biochemical markers in clinical cardiology [^115oSL2q]. European Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

This paper reviews the current contribution of the biochemical marker determination to clinical cardiology and discusses some important developments in this field. Biochemical markers play a pivotal role in the diagnosis and management of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), as witnessed by the incorporation of cardiac troponins into new international guidelines for patients with ACS and in the re-definition of myocardial infarction. Despite the success of cardiac troponins, there is still a need for the development of early markers that can reliably rule out ACS from the emergency room at presentation and also detect myocardial ischaemia in the absence of irreversible myocyte injury. Under investigation are two classes of indicators: markers of early injury/ischaemia and markers of inflammation and coronary plaque instability and disruption. Finally, with the characterisation of the cardiac natriuretic peptides, Laboratory Medicine is also assuming a role in the assessment of cardiac function.

### Cardiac markers for myocardial infarction. A brief review [^114J6XWq]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

Blood testing for biomarkers of myocardial injury plays an increasingly important role for the evaluation, diagnosis, and triage of patients with chest pain. The guidelines for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) have recently changed and prominently incorporate the results of cardiac marker testing in the clinical definition of MI. We review these updated guidelines for MI definition as it pertains to cardiac biomarker testing and further compare the differing biology and release kinetics of clinically relevant biomarkers. Finally, we define the contemporary use of cardiac biomarker testing for patients with chest pain, including appropriate integration of point-of-care testing into day-to-day clinical use.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cardiotoxicity of cancer therapy, more specifically with respect to cardiac biomarkers, ESMO 2020 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of cardiac biomarkers (high-sensitive cardiac troponins, BNP, or NT-proBNP) in patients receiving potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy. Consider obtaining a baseline measurement of such cardiac biomarkers in high-risk patients (with preexisting significant CVD) and patients receiving high doses of cardiotoxic chemotherapy, such as anthracycline.

### A translational approach to detecting drug-induced cardiac injury with cardiac troponins: consensus and recommendations from the cardiac troponins biomarker working group of the health and environmental sciences institute [^117BwBKc]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponins (cTns) are established biomarkers of ischemic heart disease in humans. However, their value as biomarkers of cardiac injury from causes other than ischemic heart disease is now being explored, particularly in drug development. In a workshop sponsored by the Cardiac Troponin Biomarker Working Group of the Health and Environmental Sciences Institute, preclinical, clinical, and regulatory scientists discussed the application of cTns in their respective environments, issues in translating the preclinical application of cTn to clinical studies, and gaps in our understanding of cTn biology and pathobiology. Evidence indicates that cTns are sensitive and specific biomarkers of cardiac injury from varying causes in both animals and humans. Accordingly, monitoring cTns can help ensure patient safety during the clinical evaluation of new drugs. In addition, preclinical characterization of cardiac risk and cTns as biomarkers of that risk can guide relevant clinical application and interpretation. We summarize here the outcomes of the workshop which included consensus statements, recommendations for further research, and a proposal for a cross-disciplinary group of clinical, regulatory, and drug development scientists to collaborate in such research.

### Circulating cardiac biomarkers, structural brain changes, and dementia: emerging insights and perspectives [^112NAkGd]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Medium credibility.

Diseases of the heart and brain are strongly linked to each other, and cardiac dysfunction is associated with cognitive decline and dementia. This link between cardiovascular disease and dementia offers opportunities for dementia prevention through prevention and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors and heart disease. Increasing evidence suggests the clinical utility of cardiac biomarkers as risk markers for structural brain changes and cognitive impairment. We propose the hypothesis that structural brain changes are the link between impaired cardiac function, as captured by blood-based cardiac biomarkers, and cognitive impairment. This review provides an overview of the literature and illustrates emerging insights into the association of markers of hemodynamic stress (natriuretic peptides) and markers of myocardial injury (cardiac troponins) with imaging findings of brain damage and cognitive impairment or dementia. Based on these findings, we discuss potential pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the association of cardiac biomarkers with structural brain changes and dementia. We suggest testable hypotheses and a research plan to close the gaps in understanding the mechanisms linking vascular damage and neurodegeneration, and to pave the way for targeted effective interventions for dementia prevention. From a clinical perspective, cardiac biomarkers open the window for early identification of patients at risk of dementia, who represent a target population for preventive interventions targeting modifiable cardiovascular risk factors to avert cognitive decline and dementia.

### The utilization and interpretation of cardiac biomarkers during pregnancy: expert panel [^112XQZ9S]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Cardiac biomarkers have well established roles in the diagnosis, management, and risk stratification for patients with cardiac dysfunction, outside of pregnancy. Pregnancy imposes a remarkable cardiovascular hemodynamic burden, and even normal pregnancy can cause symptoms that would otherwise be consistent with acute cardiovascular pathology. As a result, cardiac biomarkers are a promising tool to help guide and expedite care in the pregnant population. Larger-scale studies are required to better characterize the clinical utilization of cardiac biomarkers, particularly the natriuretic peptides and troponin during pregnancy and the peripartum period both in the context of complicated and uncomplicated pregnancy. Further, several novel markers have been investigated but require further research with respect to their clinical application for pregnant individuals.

### Hemodynamic and serum cardiac markers and risk of cognitive impairment and dementia [^116pKhQ1]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac function is a key player in maintaining energy homeostasis in the brain. Heart failure is closely related to higher risk of neurocognitive disorders. Recent evidence shows that this relationship might not be limited to patients with advanced heart failure, and even suboptimal cardiac functioning is associated with accelerated brain aging. Hence, hemodynamic and serum cardiac markers may provide valuable information about the risk of dementia.

Methods

We provide an overview on the link between cardiac markers and cognitive function by a systematic search in five databases. Furthermore, we discuss the pathophysiological aspects of this link and highlight the pertinent clinical and public health implications.

Results

Increasing evidence supports the associations of hemodynamic and serum cardiac markers with accelerated cognitive decline.

Discussion

Hemodynamic and serum cardiac markers are closely linked with risk of cognitive impairment. This highlights the significance of the heart-brain connection in reducing the burden of dementia.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cardiotoxicity of cancer therapy, more specifically with respect to cardiac biomarkers, ESMO 2020 guidelines recommend to consider measuring cardiac biomarkers in patients undergoing treatment with any cardiotoxic agent and presenting with unexplained signs and symptoms, such as (but not limited to) sinus tachycardia, rapid weight gain, dyspnea, peripheral edema, or ascites.

### Cardiac troponin: fragments of the future? [^114yzqgB]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiac troponin is the gold standard biomarker for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Development of high-sensitivity troponin platforms has revolutionized triage of chest pain patients, but specificity for type 1 AMI remains a clinical limitation. Consequently, differentiating type 1 AMI from other forms of myocardial injury is a common conundrum, heightened by the risks associated invasive coronary angiography. The troponin complex is a dynamic structure comprising of 3 subunits which variably fragment prior to measurement in the blood. Documenting the fragmentation patterns of cardiac troponin may help identify the cause of myocardial injury. This review explores the biology underlying troponin fragmentation and summarizes multiple lines of evidence that it can improve the specificity for diagnosis of type 1 AMI.

### Clinical translation of cardiovascular biomarkers – A long and uncertain road [^1147aRY8]. NEJM Evidence (2022). Medium credibility.

Biomarkers in cardiovascular medicine serve to probe disease mechanisms for research, assist in risk stratification, and - in the best cases - guide precise therapies to appropriate patients. In a classic 2007 article, Morrow and de Lemos 1 proposed three criteria by which to evaluate novel cardiovascular biomarkers for clinical use. First, can the biomarker be measured reproducibly in clinical laboratories? Second, does the biomarker add incremental new information to existing tests? And third, will the measurement of the biomarker assist in the care of patients? The answer to the third question often distinguishes a research tool from a clinical instrument.

### The utilization and interpretation of cardiac biomarkers during pregnancy: expert panel [^116jowwk]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiac biomarkers are widely used in the nonpregnant population when acute cardiovascular (CV) pathology is suspected; however, the behavior of these biomarkers in the context of pregnancy is less well understood. Pregnant individuals often have symptoms that mimic those of cardiac dysfunction, and complications of pregnancy may include CV disease. This paper will summarize our current knowledge on the use of cardiac biomarkers in pregnancy and provide suggestions on how to use these tools in clinical practice based on the available evidence. Natriuretic peptides and troponin should not be measured routinely in uncomplicated pregnancy, where values should remain low as in the nonpregnant population. In the context of pre-existing or suspected CV disease, these biomarkers retain their negative predictive value. Elevations of both natriuretic peptides and troponin may occur without clear clinical significance in the immediate postpartum period. Elevations of these markers should always prompt further investigation into possible CV pathology.

Conclusions

In summary, the use of cardiac biomarkers as a tool for monitoring during cancer therapy has expanded greatly in recent years; however, there continues to be a need to establish the firm threshold for an abnormal value and the requisite action that should result from early detection of cardiac damage or stress.

### Recommendations for the use of cardiac troponin measurement in acute cardiac care [^113MGDSh]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The release of cardiomyocyte components, i.e. biomarkers, into the bloodstream in higher than usual quantities indicates an ongoing pathological process. Thus, detection of elevated concentrations of cardiac biomarkers in blood is a sign of cardiac injury which could be due to supply-demand imbalance, toxic effects, or haemodynamic stress. It is up to the clinician to determine the most probable aetiology, the proper therapeutic measures, and the subsequent risk implied by the process. For this reason, the measurement of biomarkers always must be applied in relation to the clinical context and never in isolation. There are a large number of cardiac biomarkers, but they can be subdivided into four broad categories, those related to necrosis, inflammation, haemodynamic stress, and/or thrombosis. Their usefulness is dependent on the accuracy and reproducibility of the measurements, the discriminatory limits separating pathology from physiology, and their sensitivity and specificity for specific organ damage and/or disease processes. In recent years, cardiac biomarkers have become important adjuncts to the delivery of acute cardiac care. Therefore, the Working Group on Acute Cardiac Care of the European Society of Cardiology established a committee to deal with ongoing and newly developing issues related to cardiac biomarkers. The intention of the group is to outline the principles for the application of various biomarkers by clinicians in the setting of acute cardiac care in a series of expert consensus documents. The first of these will focus on cardiac troponin, a pivotal marker of cardiac injury/necrosis.

### Cardiac biomarker-based risk stratification algorithm in patients with severe COVID-19 [^116YkQ6E]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Cardiac biomarkers like cardiac troponins and natriuretic peptides are elevated in a substantial proportion of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We propose an algorithmic approach using cardiac biomarkers to triage, risk-stratify and prognosticate patients with severe COVID-19.

Methods

We systematically searched the PubMed and Google Scholar databases until May 31st, 2020, and accessed the available data on the role of cardiac biomarkers in patients with COVID-19.

Results

COVID-19 is associated with acute cardiac injury in around 7–28% of patients, significantly increasing its associated complications and mortality. Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease are more prone to develop acute cardiac injury as a result of COVID-19. The use of cardiac biomarkers may aid in differentiating the cardiac cause of dyspnea in patients with severe COVID-19. Cardiac biomarkers may also aid in triaging, risk-stratification, clinical decision-making, and prognostication of patients with COVID-19. However, there are concerns that routine testing in all patients with COVID-19 irrespective of severity, may result in unnecessary downstream investigations which may be misleading. In this brief review, using an algorithmic approach, we have tried to rationalize the use of cardiac biomarkers among patients with severe COVID-19. This approach is also likely to lessen the infection exposure risk to the cardiovascular team attending patients with severe COVID-19.

Conclusion

It appears beneficial to triage, risk-stratify, and prognosticate patients with COVID-19 based on the evidence of myocardial injury and the presence of underlying cardiovascular disease. Future research studies are, however, needed to validate these proposed benefits.

### Cardiac troponins [^115NvB8M]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponins I and T are proteins integral to the function of cardiac muscle. They are very sensitive markers for the detection of myocardial damage, and the ability to assay their serum levels accurately and quickly have revolutionized the concepts of minor myocardial injury and infarction. They are also powerful prognostic indicators of future adverse cardiac events. Limitations, more of troponin T than I, include decreased specificity in renal failure and skeletal muscle disease. Rapid, whole blood assays are now available that can be done at the patient's bedside. This review discusses the cardiac troponins, their biochemistry, the assays for them currently available, and their roles in the evaluation of cardiac disease in the Emergency Department (ED).

### Cardiovascular biomarkers for risk stratification in primary prevention [^112q1vpZ]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

The foundation of preventive cardiology relies on the assessment of cardiovascular (CV) risk using scores based on traditional risk factors. However, risk models based on these risk factors provide only moderate discrimination and some are poorly calibrated, highlighting a need for improved approaches to risk assessment. Cardiovascular biomarkers, including cardiac troponins, natriuretic peptides, and inflammatory markers, can be used to reclassify CV risk, especially in individuals at intermediate risk, providing opportunities for optimization of primary prevention strategies. This review provides an overview of the characteristics of a circulating biomarker that would promote its clinical use and on the existing evidence behind CV biomarkers for risk stratification. Hundreds of studies have described robust associations between CV biomarkers and incident CV events. However, the incremental value, when biomarkers were added to conventional risk factor models, has generally been modest in terms of improvement in model performance. The review also describes emerging proteomic techniques that enable high-throughput analysis of circulating proteins, presenting opportunities for improved CV risk prediction. Despite encouraging findings, challenges remain in integrating these biomarkers into clinical practice, and there is a need for evidence from clinical trials to demonstrate their cost-effective impact on reducing CV events. While biomarkers hold promise for enhancing CV prevention strategies, their routine application in clinical settings requires further innovation and investigation to establish clear treatment guidelines and optimize patient outcomes.

### Redefining cardiac biomarkers in predicting mortality of inpatients with COVID-19 [^111EH2ki]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has led to > 11.8 million confirmed cases with > 545 000 deaths worldwide by July 9, 2020. Patients with preexisting cardiovascular conditions are particularly at risk and have poor prognosis. With ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) — the binding and internalization receptor for SARS-COV2 — being highly expressed in the lung, heart, and the cardiovascular system, the heart is a target organ susceptible to viral and immune-mediated injury. Emerging data suggest that cardiac injury, manifested by cardiac biomarker elevation, is detected in a sizable of COVID-19 patients and is associated with adverse outcomes and increased mortality. However, how useful cardiac biomarkers are in COVID-19 prognosis and how to utilize these markers have not been well defined. This study aims to establish the role of cardiac-specific injury or stress biomarker and their precise association with COVID-19 mortality, to determine their use in prognostic evaluation of risk of death and to delineate the relationship of cardiac biomarker rise with other inflammatory markers in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

### Troponin: an important prognostic marker and risk-stratification tool in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes [^112LLxUX]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Over the past decade, there has been a progressive evolution of cardiac marker testing in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). This has not only resulted in a dramatic shift in how we view the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI), but it has also extended the role of cardiac marker testing into risk stratification and guidance of treatment decisions. By the year 2000, the development of highly sensitive and cardiac-specific troponin assays had resulted in a consensus change in the definition of MI, placing increased emphasis on cardiac-marker testing with troponins as the new gold standard. Furthermore, and perhaps more importantly, the role of the troponins as superior markers of subsequent cardiac risk in ACS patients became firmly established. Most recently, the supportive role of these markers in identifying patients with ACS who may derive particular benefit from potent anti-thrombotic and anti-platelet therapy or early invasive treatment strategies has been demonstrated. This paper will review the evolution of these important roles of troponin testing for risk stratification in ACS.

### Natriuretic peptides in heart failure: should therapy be guided by BNP levels? [^112daB2p]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Testing for natriuretic peptide markers, such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP), has emerged as an important tool for the diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with HF. However, questions remain regarding the potential role for natriuretic peptides to guide therapy in patients with HF. In this Review, we address the underlying assumptions and the existing evidence supporting a natriuretic-peptide-guided approach to the outpatient management of HF.

### Clinical adoption of prognostic biomarkers: the case for heart failure [^113w4bPD]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The recent explosion of scientific knowledge and technological progress has led to the discovery of a large array of circulating molecules commonly referred to as biomarkers. Biomarkers in heart failure (HF) research have been used to provide pathophysiologic insights, aid in establishing the diagnosis, refine prognosis, guide management, and target treatment. However, beyond diagnostic applications of natriuretic peptides, there are currently few widely recognized applications for biomarkers in HF. This represents a remarkable discordance considering the number of molecules that have been shown to correlate with outcomes, refine risk prediction, or track disease severity in HF in the past decade. In this article, we use a broad framework proposed for cardiovascular risk markers to summarize the current state of biomarker development for patients with HF. We use this framework to identify the challenges of biomarker adoption for risk prediction, disease management, and treatment selection for HF and suggest considerations for future research.

### Criteria for evaluation of novel markers of cardiovascular risk: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113zWcB2]. Circulation (2009). Low credibility.

There is increasing interest in utilizing novel markers of cardiovascular disease risk, and consequently, there is a need to assess the value of their use. This scientific statement reviews current concepts of risk evaluation and proposes standards for the critical appraisal of risk assessment methods. An adequate evaluation of a novel risk marker requires a sound research design, a representative at-risk population, and an adequate number of outcome events. Studies of a novel marker should report the degree to which it adds to the prognostic information provided by standard risk markers. No single statistical measure provides all the information needed to assess a novel marker, so measures of both discrimination and accuracy should be reported. The clinical value of a marker should be assessed by its effect on patient management and outcomes. In general, a novel risk marker should be evaluated in several phases, including initial proof of concept, prospective validation in independent populations, documentation of incremental information when added to standard risk markers, assessment of effects on patient management and outcomes, and ultimately, cost-effectiveness.

### Old and new biomarkers of heart failure [^115hDUa9]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2009). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) may be considered as the fatal finishing line of all cardiovascular disorders. Despite advances in the understanding and treatment, it still has a poor prognosis. Heart failure is a syndrome, rather than a primary diagnosis, which results from any structural or functional cardiac disorder that impairs the ability of the heart to support the physiological circulation. This is sustained by a chronic imbalance in the neurohormonal control of circulation. Unfortunately, there is no single diagnostic test for HF, and the accuracy of diagnosis by clinical means only (i.e. a combination of history, physical examination and appropriate investigations) is often inadequate. Diagnosis and risk stratification depend on the availability of accurate, and effective markers of either risk or disease. There is an increasing interest in the development of new biomarkers, and a great number of laboratory tests have recently been proposed. The goals of this 'commentary' are to (i) briefly discuss the characteristics of an ideal HF biomarker; (ii) describe the analytical performance and clinical relevance of currently available biomarker assay methods, (iii) evaluate newer biomarkers and finally, (iv) design a scheme to optimize the search for efficient diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for HF.

### Cardiac biomarkers in chronic kidney disease: signal or noise? [^112iQ2vb]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiac biomarkers can provide an easily accessible and non-invasive method of assessing aspects of a patients' underlying cardiovascular health. In doing so, they can serve both as a screening tool for evaluating patients' risk for cardiovascular events and a management tool for evaluating response to directed treatment. Biomarkers serve as surrogates for mechanistic pathways that are relevant for cardiovascular pathophysiology, and as such, have even been utilized as clinical trial endpoints. The overall utility of a biomarker is dependent on the reliability and consistency of the assay, the content of the represented information, and its ability to affect clinical care. Several cardiac biomarkers are widely available and routinely used in clinical practice. However, despite significant research into cardiac biomarkers, many have not been translated into routine clinical care of persons with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Interpretation of cardiac biomarkers can be challenging given the possible effects of reduced kidney clearance as well as the contribution of kidney-specific risk facts on circulating levels of the biomarkers. Here we will provide an overview of the current state of cardiac biomarkers in CKD; and whether the biomarker meets the above criteria specifically in persons with CKD. We will focus on several widely used cardiac biomarkers N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and troponin) as well as select newer promising cardiac biomarkers (soluble suppression of tumorigenicity 2, galectin-3, and growth differentiation factor-15).

### Biomarkers: a challenging conundrum in cardiovascular disease [^115rEoRN]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

The use of biomarkers has proven utility in cardiovascular medicine and holds great promise for future advances, but their application requires considerable rigor in thinking and methodology. Numerous confounding factors can cloud the clinical and investigative uses of biomarkers. Yet, the thoughtful and critical use of biomarkers can doubtless aid discovery of new pathogenic pathways, identify novel therapeutic targets, and provide a bridge between the laboratory and the clinic. Biomarkers can provide diagnostic and prognostic tools to the practitioner. The careful application of biomarkers can also help design and guide clinical trials required to establish the efficacy of novel interventions to improve patient outcomes. Point of care testing, technological advances, such as microfluidic and wearable devices, and the power of omics approaches all promise to elevate the potential contributions of biomarkers to discovery science, translation, clinical trials, and the practice of cardiovascular medicine.

Circulating biomarkers and imaging techniques provide independent and complementary information to guide management of heart failure (HF). This consensus document by the Heart Failure Association (HFA) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) presents current evidence-based indications relevant to integration of imaging techniques and biomarkers in HF. The document first focuses on application of circulating biomarkers together with imaging findings, in the broad domains of screening, diagnosis, risk stratification, guidance of treatment and monitoring, and then discusses specific challenging settings. In each section we crystallize clinically relevant recommendations and identify directions for future research. The target readership of this document includes cardiologists, internal medicine specialists and other clinicians dealing with HF patients.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin concentration and risk of first-ever Cardiovascular outcomes in 154, 052 participants [^111Y44hC]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Elevated cardiac troponin concentration, well within the normal range, was associated with an increased risk of incident CVD outcomes in the general population. This association was strongest for fatal CVD and persisted after adjustment for conventional CVD risk factors. Further research on cardiac troponin as a useful marker of risk prediction seems warranted.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Meta-analysis of published studies suggests that people with elevated circulating troponin concentrations in absence of clinically manifest myocardial injury are at a relatively high risk of developing cardiovascular events.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Future research is needed to clarify the predictive value of cardiac troponin measurements in relation to conventional cardiovascular risk factors.

### Bench-to-bedside review: the value of cardiac biomarkers in the intensive care patient [^1124siMt]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The use of cardiac biomarkers in the intensive care setting is gaining increasing popularity. There are several reasons for this increase: there is now the facility for point-of-care biomarker measurement providing a rapid diagnosis; biomarkers can be used as prognostic tools; biomarkers can be used to guide therapy; and, compared with other methods such as echocardiography, the assays are easier and much more affordable. Two important characteristics of the ideal biomarker are disease specificity and a linear relationship between the serum concentration and disease severity. These characteristics are not present, however, in the majority of biomarkers for cardiac dysfunction currently available. Those clinically useful cardiac biomarkers, which naturally received the most attention, such as troponins and B-type natriuretic peptide, are not as specific as was originally thought. In the intensive care setting, it is important for the user to understand the degree of specificity of these biomarkers and that the interpretation of the results should always be guided by other clinical information. The present review summarizes the available biomarkers for different cardiac conditions. Potential biomarkers under evaluation are also briefly discussed.

### Exercise-associated increases in cardiac biomarkers [^116W5Pge]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2008). Low credibility.

At present, the risk of myocardial damage by endurance exercise is under debate because of reports on exercise-associated increases in cardiac biomarkers troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP); these markers are typically elevated in patients with acute myocardial infarction and chronic heart failure, respectively. Exercise-associated elevations of cardiac biomarkers can be present in elite and in recreational athletes, especially after prolonged and strenuous endurance exercise bouts (e.g., marathon and ultratriathlon). However, in contrast to cardiac patients, it is still unclear if the exercise-associated appearance or increase in cardiac biomarkers in obviously healthy athletes represents clinically significant cardiac insult or is indeed part of the physiological response to endurance exercise. In addition, elevations in cardiac biomarkers in athletes after exercise may generate difficulties for clinicians in terms of differential diagnosis and may result in inappropriate consequences. Therefore, the aim of this article is to provide an overview of exercise-associated alterations of the cardiac biomarkers troponin T and I, ischemia-modified albumin, BNP, and its cleaved inactive fragment N-terminal pro BNP for the athlete, coach, scientist, and clinician.

### Origin of cardiac fibroblasts and the role of periostin [^112ckEU7]. Circulation Research (2009). Low credibility.

Cardiac fibroblasts are the most populous nonmyocyte cell type within the mature heart and are required for extracellular matrix synthesis and deposition, generation of the cardiac skeleton, and to electrically insulate the atria from the ventricles. Significantly, cardiac fibroblasts have also been shown to play an important role in cardiomyocyte growth and expansion of the ventricular chambers during heart development. Although there are currently no cardiac fibroblast-restricted molecular markers, it is generally envisaged that the majority of the cardiac fibroblasts are derived from the proepicardium via epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation. However, still relatively little is known about when and where the cardiac fibroblasts cells are generated, the lineage of each cell, and how cardiac fibroblasts move to reside in their final position throughout all four cardiac chambers. In this review, we summarize the present understanding regarding the function of Periostin, a useful marker of the noncardiomyocyte lineages, and its role during cardiac morphogenesis. Characterization of the cardiac fibroblast lineage and identification of the signals that maintain, expand and regulate their differentiation will be required to improve our understanding of cardiac function in both normal and pathophysiological states.

### High-sensitivity troponin assays: evidence, indications, and reasonable use [^1166z793]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

With advances in technology, a new era in troponin assays is approaching. Previous‐generation troponin assays have been used as diagnostic and prognostic markers in acute coronary syndrome patients and for risk stratification to guide triage decisions and aid in treatment selection. – New, high‐sensitivity troponin assays represent an important advance with added sensitivity for cardiac myocyte necrosis, – but there remains a need for judicious interpretation with these tests. These new troponin assays could have several distinct roles in clinical practice: (1) facilitation of earlier diagnosis and rule out of myocardial infarction (MI); (2) risk stratification in acute cardiac conditions and prognostic information in stable disease states; and (3) therapeutic monitoring and drug toxicity evaluation. However, because they are not specific for the etiology of cardiac cell death, the clinician has an increasing responsibility to interpret each test in clinical context. When commercially available in the United States (US), these high‐sensitivity analyses are expected to offer both advantages and disadvantages to practicing clinicians and to enhance current roles of the troponin assay as well as to open doors to new uses for troponin testing. However, they will also create new challenges in clinical applications, epidemiology, and research. The aim of this review is to discuss the potential clinical and research roles of high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin assays and the challenges they may create.

### High sensitivity troponins [^1133icD7]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays are highly specific to cardiac tissue and can detect small amounts of myocardial injury rapidly. Hs-cTn assays are the recommended cardiac biomarkers in the major US and European guidelines. In the appropriate clinical context, these assays allow clinicians to rapidly rule out a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and decrease 30-day major adverse cardiac events. This can have significant downstream impacts on the percentage of patients discharged from the emergency department (ED), ED lengths of stay, cardiac testing, and hospitalizations. There are many proposed diagnostic protocols and experts recommend institutions implement a single validated protocol.

### Use of cardiac biomarkers in neonatology [^11113kcT]. Pediatric Research (2012). Low credibility.

Cardiac biomarkers are used to identify cardiac disease in term and preterm infants. This review discusses the roles of natriuretic peptides and cardiac troponins. Natriuretic peptide levels are elevated during atrial strain (atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)) or ventricular strain (B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)). These markers correspond well with cardiac function and can be used to identify cardiac disease. Cardiac troponins are used to assess cardiomyocyte compromise. Affected cardiomyocytes release troponin into the bloodstream, resulting in elevated levels of cardiac troponin. Cardiac biomarkers are being increasingly incorporated into clinical trials as indicators of myocardial strain. Furthermore, cardiac biomarkers can possibly be used to guide therapy and improve outcome. Natriuretic peptides and cardiac troponins are potential tools in the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal disease that is complicated by circulatory compromise. However, clear reference ranges need to be set and validation needs to be carried out in a population of interest.

### Cardiac biomarkers in patients with cancer: considerations, clinical implications, and future avenues [^114ZxHbK]. Current Oncology Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Herein, we discuss the current and future role of circulating biomarkers in the assessment of the CTAC. This review encourages to establish recommendations and guidelines on the use of circulating biomarkers and urges further research on their contribution to the pathophysiology and mechanisms mediating the CTAC. Furthermore, we would like to stress out that the old definition of cardiotoxicity does not fit the adverse effects of newer antineoplastic treatments. The revision and new systematization of CTAC are needed to meet the requirements of clinicians working in cardio-oncology practices and to better correspond with research endpoints.

### Cardiac troponin as a novel tool for cardiovascular risk prediction in ambulatory populations [^115DsWzs]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Assays for cardiac troponin have become increasingly sensitive, and are now able to detect very low concentrations of circulating cardiac troponin in a substantial proportion of stable patients who are not suspected of having an acute myocardial infarction. These low concentrations of cardiac troponin are frequently well within the range of what is considered normal but are nonetheless associated with a significant increase in the risk of major cardiovascular events, including heart failure, myocardial infarction, and death in patients with and without established cardiovascular disease. The strength and consistency of these associations, and the fact that adding cardiac troponin to traditional risk factors improves the accuracy of existing cardiovascular risk prediction algorithms, raises the possibility of using cardiac troponin for therapeutic decision-making in ambulatory populations. Cardiac troponin is a powerful predictor of cardiovascular risk on the population level, but a specific intervention that can mitigate cardiac troponin-associated risk has not been identified. Thus, the therapeutic implications of cardiac troponin elevations for individual patients remain unclear. Ongoing research seeks to better understand the underlying cause of cardiac troponin release and to identify therapeutic interventions that can effectively mitigate cardiac troponin-associated cardiovascular risk. The development of high-sensitivity assays for cardiac troponin offers the opportunity to gain tremendous insight into the causes and consequences of chronic myocardial injury, and may, in the future, help guide therapy directed at improving the outcomes of ambulatory patients at high risk for cardiovascular events.

### Cardiac troponins in intensive care [^115kDEdQ]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

The cardiac troponins are integral components of the myofibrillary apparatus and they regulate muscle contraction. The measurement of cardiac troponins has replaced other biomarkers for the specific detection of myocardial necrosis and for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction. The tissue specificity plus sensitivity of the measurement technology has meant that cardiac damage can be detected in circumstances other than conventional acute coronary syndromes. The ability to specifically detect cardiac damage as part of multiple organ failure in intensive care patients has been shown to provide prognostic information, but it is unclear whether this is a dependent or an independent marker of outcome.

### Increasingly sensitive assays for cardiac troponins: a review [^114grbem]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Cardiac troponins are the preferred biomarkers for diagnosis of myocardial infarction because of their high sensitivity and specificity for myocardial injury. However, acute and chronic conditions distinct from acute coronary syndromes (ACS) commonly lead to small elevations in troponin levels, with few data available regarding management of care for patients with such conditions. Recently developed highly sensitive troponin assays will likely lead to a substantial increase in the proportion of detectable troponin levels attributable to non-ACS conditions. Novel algorithms with highly sensitive assays, incorporating baseline troponin values and changes in values over 1 to 2 hours, may allow rapid exclusion of myocardial infarction and help to address specificity concerns but must be validated in appropriate target populations. Enhanced detection of very low troponin levels with highly sensitive assays has made feasible several potential new indications for troponin testing, including in the ambulatory setting, where assessment for low-level chronic myocardial injury may enhance risk stratification for heart failure and cardiac death.

### Prognostic value of estimated functional capacity incremental to cardiac biomarkers in stable cardiac patients [^112ky8du]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Risk stratification plays an increasing role in contemporary management of patients with cardiovascular disease. Traditionally, the presence of specific clinical signs and symptoms coupled with abnormalities in cardiac‐specific measurements and estimates of end‐organ dysfunction generates an integrated view of an individual patient's risk profile. Recently, the broad acceptance of novel blood‐based biomarkers has emerged in the arena of risk stratification, even though the true incremental value of such measures in routine clinical practice has been challenged in population‐based studies. –

Cardiovascular health relies heavily on maintaining appropriate dietary behaviors and physical activities. The ability to determine functional capacity has relied on subjective assessment based on direct patient interviews during the history and physical examination and objectively by quantifying measures identified from standardized exercise testing. Standardized instruments to assess functional capacity and/or health status have been developed, – but their clinical adoption has been challenged by both logistical hurdles and an emphasis on "hard" clinical end points in the determination of treatment responses. Remarkably, few studies have undertaken the prospective validation of the functional capacity measures in the prediction of future major adverse cardiac outcomes beyond all‐cause mortality alone or direct comparisons with clinically available biomarkers. Here, we sought to determine the prognostic value of estimating functional capacity using a simple self‐administered assessment tool in a contemporary stable cardiac patient population.

### Serum markers in the emergency department diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction [^111pt5wc]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

No currently used cardiac-specific serum marker meets all the criteria for an "ideal" marker of AMI. No test is both highly sensitive and highly specific for acute infarction within 6 hours following the onset of chest pain, the timeframe of interest to most emergency physicians in making diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. Patients presenting to the ED with chest pain or other symptoms suggestive of acute cardiac ischemia therefore cannot make a diagnosis of AMI excluded on the basis of a single cardiac marker value obtained within a few hours after symptom onset. The total CK level is far too insensitive and nonspecific a test to be used to diagnose AMI. It retains its value, however, as a screening test, and serum of patients with abnormal total CK values should undergo a CK-MBmass assay. Elevation in CK-MB is a vital component of ultimate diagnosis of AMI, but levels of this marker are normal in one fourth to one half of patients with AMI at the time of ED presentation. The test is highly specific, however, and an abnormal value (particularly when it exceeds 5% of the total CK value) at any time in a patient with chest pain is highly suggestive of an AMI. There have been several improvements of CK-MB assay timing and subform quantification that appear highly useful for emergency physicians. Rapid serial CK-MB assessment greatly increases the diagnostic value of the assay in a timeframe suitable for ED purposes but unfortunately still misses about 10% of patients ultimately diagnosed with acute MI. Assays of CK-MB subforms have very high sensitivity, and, although unreliable within 4 hours of symptom onset, have excellent diagnostic value at 6 or more hours after chest pain begins. Automated test assays recently have become available and could prove applicable to ED settings. The cardiac troponins are highly useful as markers of acute coronary syndromes, rather than specifically of AMI, and abnormal values at any time following chest pain onset are highly predictive of an adverse cardiac event. The ED applicability of the troponins is severely limited, however, because values remain normal in most patients with acute cardiac events as long as 6 hours following symptom onset. Myoglobin appeared promising as a marker of early cardiac ischemia but appears to be only marginally more sensitive than CK-MB assays early after symptom onset and less sensitive than CK-MB at 8 hours or more after chest pain starts. Rapid serial myoglobin assessment, however, appears highly useful as an early marker of AMI. The marker has a very narrow diagnostic window. The clinician is left with several tests that are highly effective in correctly identifying patients with AMI (or at high risk for AMI), but none that can dependably exclude patients with acute coronary syndromes soon after chest pain onset. A prudent strategy when assessing ED patients with chest pain and nondiagnostic ECGs is to order CK-MB and troponin values on presentation in the hope of making an early diagnosis of AMI or unstable coronary syndrome. Although it is recognized that normal values obtained within 6 hours of symptom onset do not exclude an acute coronary syndrome, patients at low clinical risk and having normal cardiac marker tests could be provisionally admitted to low-acuity hospital settings or ED observation. After 6 to 8 hours of symptom duration has elapsed, the cardiac-specific markers are highly effective in diagnosing AMI, and such values obtained can be used more appropriately to make final disposition decisions. At no time should results of serum marker tests outweigh ECG findings or clinical assessment of the patient's risk and stability.

### Developing the next generation of cardiac markers: disease-induced modifications of troponin I [^112SnXS6]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Troponin I (TnI) and Troponin T (TnT) have evolved into arguably the two most important diagnostic markers for acute myocardial injury. Part of their diagnostic utility lies in the uniquely important roles that both TnI and TnT play in the calcium-dependent regulation of cardiac muscle contraction. Both proteins undergo extensive physiologic regulation, principally through phosphorylation, as well as specific disease-induced pathologic modifications, including phosphorylation, oxidation, and proteolysis. Many, if not all, of these protein modifications in some way modulate contractility, and when detected in serum may therefore provide important information about both the disease state and functional status of the heart. However, the complexity of the TnI (and TnT) forms in the serum is large, which leads to difficulty in detecting all of the Tn subunits in serum, and hence interpreting the biologic significance of each modified product. But, as diagnostic tools and modalities improve, our ability to monitor and detect specific disease-induced modified forms of proteins will inevitably lead to better and more specific diagnoses and therapies.

### Circulating cardiovascular biomarkers in cancer therapeutics-related cardiotoxicity: review of critical challenges, solutions, and future directions [^116mjXXi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Nevertheless, the routine use of biomarkers for this purpose is not clearly supported by current evidence, and it has been stated that the guidelines have overreached. This raises questions as to the limitations of prior studies. Previous reviews and recommendations have provided valuable perspectives and highlighted opportunities to optimize certain aspects of study design. Importantly, though challenges and solutions pertaining to use of circulating biomarkers in cardio‐oncology were mentioned in these publications, analytic aspects were not the primary focus and remain to be evaluated in depth. Addressing these concerns would aid development of a rubric for future circulating biomarker studies. Accordingly, in this review we present an in‐depth assessment of critical challenges, present solutions, and provide future directions for circulating biomarkers in cardiotoxicity.

### Unexplained sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death in the young: what is killing these young people when nothing is found? [^116vq4ag]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Unexplained sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the young remains a critical issue for clinicians, researchers, patients and their family members. In this review, we explore the current status of SCA and SCD evaluation in the young, including recent monogenic and polygenic disease discoveries, advancements in cardiac imaging and our growing understanding of the role of the Purkinje system in triggering life threatening and even fatal ventricular arrhythmias. Yet, despite these advancements, over a third of SCA and SCD among individuals with seemingly structurally normal hearts remain unexplained. We explore the future role of artificial intelligence, novel biomarkers, multimodality cardiac imaging, genetic discoveries, as well as wearable devices and sensors in closing this current gap. With the overarching framework provided in this review, we envision a future in which collaboration among patients, clinicians, researchers, innovators, and policy makers culminates in our ability to diagnose, predict, and ultimately prevent SCA and SCD in the young.

### Biomarkers in cardiovascular disease: statistical assessment and section on key novel heart failure biomarkers [^111kXrjS]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and continues to increase in prevalence compared to previous decades, in part because of the aging of the world population. Atherosclerotic CVD starts at a very young age and progresses over time allowing sufficient time for screening and early detection of the condition. Advances in biomarker research and developments related to CVD over the past 30 years have led to more sensitive screening methods, a greater emphasis on its early detection and diagnosis, and improved treatments resulting in more favorable clinical outcomes in the community. However, the use of biomarkers for different purposes in CVD remains an important area of research that has been explored by scientists over the years and many new developments are still underway. Therefore, a detailed description of all CVD biomarkers that are currently been used or investigated for future use in the field of cardiovascular medicine is out of scope for any review article. In the present review, we do not intend to replicate the information from previous exhaustive review on biomarkers, but highlight key statistical and clinical issues with an emphasis on methods to evaluate the incremental yield of biomarkers, including their clinical utility, a prerequisite before any putative novel biomarker is utilized in clinical practice. In addition, we will summarize information regarding recent novel heart failure biomarkers in current practice, which are undergoing scrutiny before they can be available for clinical use, and their impact on clinical outcomes.

Investigations into cardiac‐specific regulation of metabolic processes could expand our understanding of organ cross‐talk under physiological and pathological conditions. In addition to defining novel cardiokines for mechanistic and biomarker studies, future reports should address their biology including: synthesis and secretion, receptor expression and ligand binding, and activation of downstream signaling cascades. The information in this review advocates for metabolic intervention during CVD. Ultimately, the search for novel cardiokines should reveal pharmacological targets at the level of target tissues, including receptor expression studies, and at the level of transcriptional regulation of stressed cardiac tissue.

### Elevated serum cardiac troponin in non-acute coronary syndrome [^113Esrh5]. Clinical Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponins (CTn) are the most sensitive and specific biochemical markers of myocardial injury and risk stratification. The assay for troponin T (cTnI) is standardized, and results obtained from different institutions are comparable. This is not the case with troponin I (cTnT), and clinicians should be aware that each institution must analyze and standardize its own results. Elevated cTn levels indicate cardiac injury, but do not define the mechanical injury. The differentiation of cTn elevation caused by coronary events from those not related to an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is tiresome, at times vexing, and often costly. Elevation of cTn in non-ACS is a marker of increased cardiac and all-cause morbidity and mortality. The cause of these elevations may involve serious medical conditions that require meticulous diagnostic evaluation and aggressive therapy. At present, there are no guidelines to treat patients with elevated troponin levels and no coronary disease. The current strategy of treatment of patients with elevated troponin and non-ACS involves treating the underlying causes.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^111jfsot]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Myocardial infarction type 3 — definition states that the detection of cardiac biomarkers in the blood is fundamental for establishing the diagnosis of MI, but some patients may die before blood can be obtained or before biomarker values have risen; such patients are designated as having a type 3 MI when suspicion for an acute myocardial ischemic event is high, even when cardiac biomarker evidence of MI is lacking.

### Therapeutic implications of biomarkers in chronic heart failure [^114LmpfC]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Understanding of chronic heart failure (HF) has progressed from the concept of a purely hemodynamic disorder to that of a syndrome that results from dysfunction in interconnected molecular pathways. As a result, the focus of research investigations and clinical care has shifted to measurement and modification of maladaptive molecular processes. Accumulating evidence shows that molecular biomarkers provide a window into the pathophysiology of chronic HF and therefore have important therapeutic implications. However, the use of biomarkers in the treatment of HF remains in its infancy. This is partly a result of shortcomings in research studies and a dearth of biomarker-guided clinical trials. In this review, we summarize the potential therapeutic implications of promising biomarkers that uniquely capture the molecular dysfunction that occurs in chronic HF. We discuss the need for strict statistical standards in biomarker studies, provide an overview of biomarker-guided clinical trial design, and discuss the therapeutic potential of a multimarker-based strategy.

### High-sensitivity troponin assays: evidence, indications, and reasonable use [^113uG9yr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Troponin presently has several important diagnostic and prognostic roles in clinical medicine. While high‐sensitivity troponin assays are not yet available in the US, it is imperative that clinicians, researchers, and laboratorians begin to understand and consider the strengths, limitations, and unique characteristics of these assays to develop the evidence that will both enable informed implementation into clinical practice and guide future research aimed at harnessing their potential. With the advent of high‐sensitivity troponin assays, the roles for troponin testing may expand, potentially allowing for detection of very low levels of troponin in healthy individuals that are meaningful in a variety of clinical scenarios. However, with greater sensitivity comes the responsibility to integrate laboratory biomarker data with clinical data. While troponin is highly specific for myocardial necrosis, it provides no information on the etiology of myocyte death. Thus, more research and cross‐disciplinary collaboration are necessary to determine new thresholds and to establish parameters for high‐sensitivity troponin testing in practice. This will allow for clinicians to appropriately use these new and more powerful troponin assays.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin algorithms and the value of likelihood ratios [^115kpDLJ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) is now the recommended biomarker for diagnosis of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, but proper interpretation varies based on the assay being used. Nearly uniformly, suggested interpretations of assay-specific hs-cTn results are based on predictive values, which are not applicable to most patients. Through application of a published hs-cTn algorithm to several patient scenarios, we will demonstrate that likelihood ratios are superior to predictive values for patient-centered test interpretation and decision-making. Furthermore, we will provide a blueprint for how to use existing published data presented with predictive values to calculate likelihood ratios. Changing the output of diagnostic accuracy studies and diagnostic algorithms from predictive values to likelihood ratios can improve patient care.

### Multimodality imaging for cardiac surveillance of cancer treatment in children: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^114GLKgh]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2023). High credibility.

Knowledge gaps and opportunities for future research — one of the main limitations for the use of imaging markers in decision-making during cancer treatment is the lack of data on their prognostic value, so recommendations for changes in cancer treatment based on imaging findings alone should be made cautiously with a multidisciplinary approach and careful assessment of risks and benefits; further longitudinal data are needed to guide how imaging findings inform treatment decisions, and there are very few data on using imaging to initiate cardioprotective drugs or early cardiac treatment; for long-term survivors, echocardiographic values of EF and strain are often reported to be lower than in healthy controls but remain in the normal range for the majority of children, and further longitudinal follow-up through adult life is needed to determine prognostic significance; current recommendations on the frequency of repeat imaging are primarily based on limited prognostic data and expert consensus, indicating a need for risk‑stratified follow-up and personalized preventative strategies; individualized risk profiling will require integration of imaging with clinical, biochemical, and genetic markers, and given the relatively low incidence of clinical events during childhood, long-term follow-up data will be needed to fully inform these models.

### High-sensitivity assays for troponin in patients with cardiac disease [^1154vzR1]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Troponin is a widely used biomarker in patients with cardiac disease. The use of troponin is well established in patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI), but troponin measurement is also used in other acute and nonacute settings. In patients with suspected AMI, early decision-making is crucial to allow rapid treatment and further diagnostic evaluation. Current guidelines recommend serial measurements of troponin with a cut-off concentration at the 99th percentile to triage patients in the emergency department. Newer, high-sensitivity assays for troponin enable the detection of distinctly lower concentrations. Using these assays and very low cut-off concentrations, several rapid diagnostic strategies have been reported to improve diagnosis in acute cardiac care. Furthermore, noncoronary and nonacute applications of troponin assays - for example as a biomarker in patients with heart failure, pulmonary embolism, or stable coronary artery disease - are on the horizon and might improve individual risk stratification. In this Review, we provide an overview on the development of high-sensitivity assays for troponin, and their application in patients with cardiac disease.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cardiotoxicity of cancer therapy, more specifically with respect to cardiac biomarkers, EHA/ESC/ESTRO/IC-OS 2022 guidelines recommend to obtain baseline measurement of natriuretic peptides and/or cardiac troponin in all patients with cancer at risk of cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction if these biomarkers are going to be measured during treatment to detect cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction.

### Cardiac markers protocols in a chest pain observation unit [^112uL8rU]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The use of cardiac markers to identify high-risk patients in the observation unit is undeniable. As the literature reviewed here reveals, the history and ECG miss a significant portion of patients with acute cardiac ischemia. It appears that acute MI and some high-risk "unstable angina" observation unit patients can be identified within 6 hours of hospital presentation using a combination of cardiac markers. Testing these patients soon after symptom onset or on arrival in the ED for myoglobin, CK-MB subforms, or CK-MB delta appears to provide the best diagnostic usefulness. For testing later in the clinical course, CK-MB troponin I, or troponin T are of clear diagnostic and prognostic value. The markers currently used are unable to identify the significant subset of patients with "non-AMI" coronary syndromes, however. These patients require further testing with appropriate noninvasive or invasive diagnostic studies.

### Can electrocardiographic criteria predict adverse cardiac events and positive cardiac markers? [^116DtnEP]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine electrocardiogram (ECG) predictors of positive cardiac markers and short-term adverse cardiac events in an undifferentiated chest pain population presenting to emergency departments (EDs). The authors hypothesized that specific ECG findings, other than those previously identified in higher-risk populations, would be predictive of cardiac outcomes and positive cardiac markers.

Methods

This study used data from a prospectively collected, retrospectively analyzed Internet-based data registry of undifferentiated chest pain patients (i*trACS). Logistic regression modeling was performed to determine the ECG findings that were predictive of 1) positive cardiac markers and 2) short-term adverse cardiac events.

Results

ST-segment elevation (STE), ST-segment depression (STD), pathological Q-waves (PQW), and T-wave inversion were associated with increased odds of percutaneous coronary intervention or catheterization, myocardial infarction, or coronary artery bypass grafting. The odds of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) measuring positive were increased if STE, STD, or PQW were present [odds ratio (OR) 2.495, 2.582, and 1.295, respectively]. A right bundle branch block tended to decrease the odds of CK-MB measuring positive (OR 0.658). A similar pattern of results was observed for troponin I (OR 3.608 for STE, 3.72 for STD, 1.538 for PQW). Troponin T showed an increased odds of measuring positive if any of STE, STD, left bundle branch block, or T-wave inversion were evident (OR 2.313, 2.816, 1.80, and 1.449, respectively).

Conclusions

Initial ECG criteria can be used to predict short-term cardiac outcomes and positive cardiac markers. These findings can be important aids in the risk-stratification and aggressive treatment regimens of chest pain patients presenting to EDs.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^1156S99x]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Biochemical approach for diagnosing myocardial injury and infarction — Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) are the preferred biomarkers recommended to both rule-in and rule-out myocardial injury, and thus to define MI and each specific subtype of MI. Detection of a rise and/or fall of cTn values is essential and a key early component along with other clinical elements to establish the diagnosis of acute MI. Criteria for determining a pathological rise between 2 serial cTn values are assay-dependent and continue to evolve.

### The heart in COVID-19: primary target or secondary bystander? [^113Fi6oA]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2020). Medium credibility.

In the throes of the current pandemic, intense interest has burgeoned in cardiovascular involvement by novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Cardiologists as well as other practitioners who care for those with this virulent viral infection, and indeed the general public as well, share curiosity and concern in this regard. The torrent of published reports on this nascent topic contain clear-cut descriptions of fulminant myocarditis in certain individuals, as ably reviewed in the State-of-the-Art Review paper on cardiac involvement in COVID-19 by Atri et al. in this issue of JACC: Basic to Translational Science. Indeed, the human myocardium can express the receptor that COVID-19 uses to infect host cells, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, which is the counter-regulatory cousin of the more familiar angiotensin-converting enzyme-1. Thus, no doubt, in some cases, a viral myocarditis due to this agent can occur (Figure 1, far left). Yet, troponin rise seems nearly ubiquitous in patients requiring intensive care, an indication of cardiac involvement in many cases and a marker of poor prognosis as in many other circumstances. But can we, and should we, attribute all rises in troponin to direct myocardial infection by this virus?

### Cardiac-secreted factors as peripheral metabolic regulators and potential disease biomarkers [^114iuExQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Identification of "Cardiokines" for Mechanistic Studies

In addition to identifying novel biomarkers, it is important to understand how biomarkers fit into our mechanistic understanding of CVD. As the heart begins to fail, disruption in its metabolic processes can lead to the secretion of proteins from the heart into the circulation called "cardiokines". 9 Cardiokines are synthesized and secreted from multiple cell types in the heart, including cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, smooth muscle (aortic or blood‐derived progenitors), and vascular endothelial cells. An extensive list of cardiokines are in Table 2; also listed is their cellular origin, examples of stress‐induced regulation, as well as method of secretion (classical or nonclassical). Cardiokines derived from cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts are emphasized in Table 2, because these cell types represent ≈56% and 27% of cells in the heart, respectively. 10

Heart failure biomarkers in acute decompensated HF — measurement of BNP or NT-proBNP and/or cardiac troponin is useful for establishing prognosis or disease severity in acutely decompensated HF (Level of Evidence: A). The usefulness of BNP- or NT-proBNP–guided therapy for acutely decompensated HF is not well established (Level of Evidence: C). Measurement of other clinically available tests such as biomarkers of myocardial injury or fibrosis may be considered for additive risk stratification in patients with acutely decompensated HF (Level of Evidence: A).

### The role of cardiac biomarkers for predicting left ventricular dysfunction and cardiovascular mortality in acute exacerbations of COPD [^11762u2b]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Another issue is the wide range of biomarkers, time points at which they were measured and end points measured, precluding meta-analysis. Accordingly, future research should aim to address which of the specific biomarkers offer the most value in the setting of AECOPD in terms of influencing clinical decision making and management.

Troponins used as biomarkers can encompass a wide range of molecules, including troponin T, troponin I and cardiac-specific isoforms of troponins. While we did not exclude studies on the basis of which type of troponin they measured, this variety precludes direct comparison of studies or pooling of data.

Given that patients with COPD commonly have cardiovascular comorbidities, the development of biomarkers that can help identify LV dysfunction could guide treatment, improving both prognosis and quality of life. BNP and cardiac troponins are currently in widespread clinical use for patients with cardiac disease, and would be a simple, cheap test to aid COPD investigation and management. They also appear to have a predictive value in terms of prognosis, and could help identify patients with AECOPD who are at greater risks of poor outcomes and allow targeted interventions to improve outcomes.

The results presented above do suggest that NT-proBNP could be a useful biomarker for the diagnosis of LV failure, and also a predictor of mortality, particularly in the short term. However, more research is needed in order to determine the clinical utility of BNP or NT-proBNP as a biomarker in AECOPD.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin after cardiac stress test: a Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113XvJAe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

High‐sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs‐cTn) assays have replaced contemporary cardiac troponin (cTn) assays throughout most of the world and continue to enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of myocardial infarction, ischemia, and injury. In most adult patients, hs‐cTn assays have the ability to detect cTn at low concentrations and consequently to identify much smaller change values. 1 For instance, multiple studies have found significant cTn increases following strenuous physical activity and cardiovascular stress. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

Of particular relevance to cardiovascular medicine are cardiac biomarker elevations associated with cardiac stress testing. Cardiac biomarkers have the potential to increase the clinical utility of cardiac stress testing if they are able to identify high‐risk patients who do not have an unequivocal stress test result. However, there is currently no consensus regarding the mechanism or diagnostic utility of hs‐cTn release during and after cardiac stress testing. 7

To improve our understanding about hs‐cTn release associated with cardiac stress testing, we conducted a systematic review of the existing literature and performed a meta‐analysis.

### Biomarker-guided therapies in heart failure: a forum for unified strategies [^115USLAt]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2013). Low credibility.

The complexity of standard medical treatment for heart failure is growing, and such therapy typically involves 5 or more different medications. Given these pressures, there is increasing interest in harnessing cardiovascular biomarkers for clinical application to more effectively guide diagnosis, risk stratification, and therapy. It may be possible to realize an era of personalized medicine for heart failure treatment in which therapy is optimized and costs are controlled. The direct mechanistic coupling of biologic processes and therapies achieved in cancer treatment remains elusive in heart failure. Recent clinical trials and meta-analyses of biomarkers in heart failure have produced conflicting evidence. In this article, which comprises a summary of discussions from the Global Cardiovascular Clinical Trialists Forum held in Paris, France, we offer a brief overview of the background and rationale for biomarker testing in heart failure, describe opportunities and challenges from a regulatory perspective, and summarize current positions from government agencies in the United States and European Union.

### Biomarkers as predictors of cardiac toxicity from targeted cancer therapies [^114Q7zrq]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac biomarkers have been extensively investigated as early detectors of cardiac toxicity from cancer therapies. Whereas the role of biomarkers in monitoring anthracycline toxicity is generally well understood, substantial uncertainty remains regarding their role in monitoring newer targeted cancer therapies.

Methods and Results

This review article examines all major published studies using cardiac troponins and/or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in monitoring for cardiac toxicity with trastuzumab, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. There is substantial variability among studies regarding biomarker assays used, sensitivity of the assays, and definitions of abnormal results. In general, troponin I predicts early but not late cardiac events when trastuzumab is administered after anthracyclines, but troponin increases likely reflect anthracycline injury rather than trastuzumab injury. NT-proBNP detects cardiac toxicity with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors, but not independently from echocardiography.

Conclusions

Troponin I can serve as a marker for susceptibility to cardiac toxicity during early trastuzumab treatment in patients who have received recent anthracyclines. NT-proBNP can serve as a useful marker of cardiac toxicity in patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors or mTOR inhibitors if echocardiographic screening is not being used.

### Highly sensitive cardiac troponins: the evidence behind sex-specific cutoffs [^1146sGvY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

The role of cardiac biomarkers in the diagnosis, management, and prognosis of ACS is well established. 3, 4, 35, 36 Guidelines for the diagnostic performance and assay validation of cardiac biomarkers have established that a decision limit for each cardiac biomarker assay for diagnosis of MI should be based on the 99th percentile URL as determined by a study of at least 120 healthy individuals. 37 The MB fraction of creatinine kinase, which was in widespread use before the introduction of cardiac troponins (and has continued use in some regions today, despite a class III recommendation for initial diagnosis of MI), 38 has a notable difference in the 99th percentile URL between the sexes. Because of this, guidelines historically have recommended that clinical laboratories establish sex‐specific reference limits for the creatinine kinase MB fraction assay. 37 As data emerge on highly sensitive cardiac troponin assays, the most recent revision of the expert consensus for the diagnosis of MI also recognizes the need for sex‐specific reference limits for the highly sensitive cardiac troponin assays. 4

### Cardiac biomarkers in the new millennium [^116EwkJW]. Seminars in Dialysis (2001). Low credibility.

Cardiac disease is the major cause of death in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), accounting for about 45% of all deaths. In dialysis patients about 20% of cardiac deaths are attributed to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The survival of dialysis patients after AMI is poor, with nearly three-quarters of patients dead at 2 years after AMI. The definition of AMI is based on symptoms, electrocardiography, and cardiac biomarkers. In the non-ESRD population, it has been recognized that sensitive markers of myocardial injury (cardiac troponin I and troponin T) define a group of patients who are increased risk for adverse cardiac outcomes and who are more likely to benefit from treatment. Elevated cardiac troponin levels in nonhospitalized ESRD patients without other evidence of ongoing myocardial ischemia may also prospectively identify a subgroup of ESRD patients at increased risk for death. This editorial is an overview of cardiac biomarkers (specifically troponin I and troponin T) in the management of acute coronary syndromes in ESRD patients. A potential role of cardiac troponin testing for risk stratification in the outpatient dialysis unit is also presented.

### A test in context: interpretation of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays in different clinical settings [^111oAaRe]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays have the ability to detect minute troponin concentrations and resolve minor changes in biomarker concentrations. Clinically, this allows for the ability to rapidly identify or exclude acute myocardial injury in the setting of acute chest discomfort-thus providing more rapid evaluation for acute myocardial infarction-but the improvements in troponin assays also create avenues for other applications where troponin release from the cardiomyocyte might confer prognostic information. These situations include cardiovascular risk assessment across a wide range of clinical circumstances, including apparently-well individuals, those at risk for heart disease, and those with prevalent cardiovascular disorders. The optimal hs-cTn threshold for each circumstance varies by the assay used and by the population assessed. This review will provide context for how hs-cTn assays might be interpreted depending on the application sought, reviewing results from studies leveraging hs-cTn for applications beyond "acute myocardial infarction diagnostic evaluation".

### Biochemical and bioimaging markers for risk assessment and diagnosis in major cardiovascular diseases: a road to integration of complementary diagnostic tools [^113ycjzw]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

This report from the first International Course on Integrated Biomarkers, Biochemical and Bioimaging Endpoints in Cardiovascular Diagnosis, Prevention, Therapy and Drug Development provides the basis for optimizing diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic information in four areas of cardiovascular medicine: primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases, acute coronary syndromes, heart failure and stroke. Risk stratification and treatment strategies can be refined and enhanced through integration of bioimaging and biochemical markers to characterize sub-clinical and clinical atherosclerosis. For the integrative approach to be useful, each of the biomarkers must be validated and cost-effective. Clinical decision is the primary level of integration and is based on clinical evaluation and the use of a combination of bioimaging and biochemical markers. The decision to initiate preventive or therapeutic intervention must take into account the factors affecting the levels of expression of the biomarker and the potential input the biomarker has on metabolic processes or modulation of other biomarkers. The optimal approach to intervention must take into consideration the risk-benefit and cost-effectiveness ratios.

### The sensitivity of cardiac markers stratified by symptom duration [^112cBpgy]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

We compared the sensitivity of three commonly used cardiac markers between two subpopulations, those who came to the Emergency Department (ED) late (6–24 h) after their symptoms began, and those who arrived earlier (< 6 h), in a prospective comparative trial. Among all adult patients who presented to our ED with symptoms suggestive of acute myocardial infarction (MI), we drew serum for myoglobin, CK-MB, and troponin I upon arrival (time 0) and 2 h later. Outcomes, including acute MI, were determined. Sensitivities for all three markers between the subpopulations who arrived fewer than 6 h from symptom onset were compared to those who arrived later (6–24 h). We enrolled 346 eligible subjects, 36% of whom described cardiac symptoms as beginning 6 or more hours earlier; 14% suffered acute MIs. For time 0, the sensitivity of all three markers for acute MI was significantly higher among those subjects with symptoms of 6 or more hours' duration as compared to those with less. For troponin I, the increase in sensitivity between these two subpopulations approached 300%. At the time of the 2-h sample, the differences in sensitivities were much less and were not statistically significant. We conclude that cardiac marker values obtained at time 0 among Emergency Department patients who arrive 6 or more hours after cardiac symptom onset provide significantly higher sensitivities as compared to those obtained in patients who arrive earlier. For troponin I, the increase in sensitivity approaches threefold.

Despite considerable advances in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, it remains the leading cause of death in developed countries. Assessment of classic cardiovascular risk factors — including high blood pressure, diabetes and smoking — has a central role in disease prevention. However, many individuals with coronary heart disease (a narrowing of the blood vessels that supply the heart) have only one, or none, of the classic risk factors. Thus, new biomarkers are needed to augment the information obtained from traditional indicators and to illuminate disease mechanisms.

### NT-proBNP qualifies as a surrogate for clinical end points in heart failure [^1155uqtw]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

☑ N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) is known as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for heart failure.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

☑ In this study, we investigate whether NT‐proBNP concentrations qualify as a surrogate for clinical composite end points in heart failure trials. Based on data from 25 clinical studies and ~ 100,000 real‐world medical records, we demonstrate that across all subtypes of heart failure the NT‐proBNP event rate relationship follows an E max relationship.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

☑ Our quantitative model predicts mid‐term to long‐term event rates in clinical trials based on short‐term response of NT‐proBNP to treatment. The qualification of the model with data from five phase III heart failure studies demonstrates the quantitative accuracy of predictions.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

☑ A model‐based use of short‐term NT‐proBNP response can replace pivotal efficacy event end points in heart failure trials and allows reliable assessments of probability of technical success already in phase II.

### Cardiac biomarkers in patients with cancer: considerations, clinical implications, and future avenues [^116m5ehW]. Current Oncology Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Now that efforts to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) have improved outcomes, cancer is rising as the major cause of mortality and morbidity in high-income countries. According to the World Health Organization, Europe, which represents 9% of the global population, accounts for 23.4% of the global cancer cases and 20.3% of global cancer deaths. There are approximately 8.7 million cancer survivors in Europe, and more than 3 million new cases are predicted to occur every year. The Americans come in the second place with 21% and 14.4% of the global incidence and mortality, respectively. According to the American Cancer Society, around 17 million Americans have a history of cancer and the number of cancer survivors is expected to increase to more than 22.1 million in 2030. Furthermore, cancer and CVD share multiple risk factors and in fact very often coincide.

In the last years, cancer management and treatments have improved. However, the use of both traditional and novel antineoplastic agents is limited by their toxic effects, often leading to CTAC. Previously, the risk of CTAC was not recognized because the life span of patients with a neoplasm was too short to make CVD a major concern. Today, the progress in early diagnosis and the advances in cancer therapies have resulted in a prolonged life expectancy and improved survivorship. Consequently, the medical community recognizes the CTAC in response to antineoplastic agents as a clinically relevant issue, which has been highlighted in several recent articles.

Since functional deteriorations only become clinically manifest in later stages, when cardiotoxicity becomes irreversible, physicians should focus on early detection of CVD when treatment or prevention may still be an option. Regarding the diagnosis of CVD, many biomarkers have demonstrated the ability to predict cardiac dysfunction before the occurrence of clinical signs or symptoms. However, the progress in the CVD biomarker field has been slow considering the fact that a good biomarker must satisfy strict criteria, including a solid and easy use of assays, good sensitivity, specificity, and knowledge on the confounders and the context of the assay. Although for several biomarker assays, these requirements are satisfied, in the setting of CTAC, this is often less straightforward. The lack of unified clinical guidelines leaves clinicians dependent on their own judgment and generalized expert opinions.

### Cardiac troponin level elevations not related to acute coronary syndromes [^11219eGm]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Over the past 2 decades, cardiac troponins (cTn) have emerged as the preferred biomarkers for the noninvasive detection of myocardial injury. In conjunction with typical clinical findings of ischaemia, elevated cTn levels in blood confirm a diagnosis of myocardial infarction. However, neither cTnT or cTnI are exclusively released as a result of ischaemic myocardial cell necrosis, but also with numerous nonischaemic acute and chronic cardiac conditions, such as myopericarditis, toxic injury, or severe cardiac overload. With the advent of high-sensitivity assays, causes of cTn elevation not related to an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have become common findings in patients with chest pain and in those with acute or chronic systemic disorders. Elevated cTn levels in blood are associated with increased rates of cardiac events and mortality, independently of the underlying disease. However, the clinical conditions leading to cTn release in patients who do not have ACS, and the appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for these individuals, are largely unknown. Here, we provide an overview of the many causes and the prognostic importance of the release of cTn not related to ACS. We also recommend strategies to discriminate between ischaemic and nonischaemic cTn elevation, and describe the clinical evaluation of these patients.

### Transcriptomic biomarkers of cardiovascular disease [^115WuvhW]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Transcriptomics is the study of how our genes are regulated and expressed in different biological settings. Technical advances now enable quantitative assessment of all expressed genes (ie, the entire "transcriptome") in a given tissue at a given time. These approaches provide a powerful tool for understanding complex biological systems and for developing novel biomarkers. This chapter will introduce basic concepts in transcriptomics and available technologies for developing transcriptomic biomarkers. We will then review current and emerging applications in cardiovascular medicine.

### The role of natriuretic peptides as biomarkers for guiding the management of chronic heart failure [^113DTGXn]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

The current standard treatment of chronic heart failure (HF) is based on clinical judgment, with the goal of achieving the maximally tolerated therapeutic program. The complexity of this approach may contribute to the well-established treatment gaps that exist in HF management; consequently, the risks for morbidity and mortality in this population remain extremely high. Alternative means are needed to improve the outcomes of patients with HF. Natriuretic peptides are biological markers for HF disease — its presence, severity, and prognosis — and show unique interactions with therapeutics known to have benefit in HF. Accordingly, interest has recently developed in "biomarker-guided" care for HF. This approach involves applying these assays to identify patients in need of therapy intensification and to provide an objective "monitor" of disease status. This review examines the biology of natriuretic peptides, discusses the rationale for their use in HF, and details the aggregate experience gained thus far in biomarker-guided care.

Introduction

Physicians routinely use biomarkers for the diagnosis, prognosis and management of patients with heart failure (HF). Established biomarkers such as N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP), B‐type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs‐cTn) are integrated into the current European (European Society of Cardiology, ESC) and American (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, ACC/AHA) guidelines. In the ESC guidelines, natriuretic peptides are advocated for their utility in diagnosis of HF, with particular value to exclude HF. However, most data regarding biomarkers in HF report on their prognostic utility, while recognizing these markers may not necessarily improve diagnosis or treatment. To improve performance, it has been advocated to use serial measurements or to implement biomarker guided‐therapies. Factors complicating clinical application of markers include fluctuation in biomarker levels at various time points in clinical decision‐making; for example, at the emergency department, prior to dischargeor in the outpatient clinic. Further, although biomarkers can both be used to assess high and low risk of adverse events, comorbidities and other patient characteristics including age, sex, coefficient of variation within an individual (biological variation), and kidney function potentially confound the biomarker result and its interpretation. Finally, few prospective trials have been conducted to test if biomarker‐based clinical decision‐making improves management or outcomes. As a result, the role of biomarkers in ongoing HF treatment decision‐making remains limited although it is universally accepted that lower peptide serum concentrations associate with a better prognosis. The role and best clinical use of established markers of renal function such as serum creatinine has recently been summarized elsewhere and is not discussed.

### Donor heart selection: evidence-based guidelines for providers [^1113F9cw]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic studies — cardiac biomarkers in donor evaluation: The measurement of biomarkers is an established method of predicting risk for many cardiovascular conditions, including myocardial injury and heart failure, and has drawn considerable interest in the assessment of organ donors. B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), NT-proBNP, and troponin are elevated after brain death, particularly subarachnoid hemorrhage, likely due to increased sympathetic activity and release of catecholamines with associated elevated wall stress and myocardial injury. Class IIb: Coronary angiography should be considered for potential donors with significantly increased troponin concentrations.

### High-sensitivity troponin as a biomarker in heart rhythm disease [^1147TR2T]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Biomarkers are important prognostic tools in various cardiovascular conditions, including coronary artery disease and heart failure. Although their utility in cardiac electrophysiology (EP) is less established, biomarkers may guide EP clinical practice by identifying patients at risk for developing arrhythmias and their complications, in addition to augmenting therapeutic decisions by targeting appropriate pharmacologic and interventional therapies to patients who may benefit most. In this review, we focus on the prognostic role of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays-which detect subclinical cardiac myocyte damage-in cardiac arrhythmias and their sequelae. We review the current literature on hs-cTn and its impact on various arrhythmia disease states and also provide suggestions for future research in this field. In conclusion, although the utility of hs-cTn assays remains at an investigational stage in cardiac EP, studies to date have suggested value as a prognostic biomarker in atrial fibrillation and as a screening marker for patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death (both in the general population and among those with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy).

### FDA-approved devices that help keep the heart beating… [^1175BUDZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart disease, also called cardiovascular disease, can have serious consequences. It's the leading cause of death for adults in the U. S. Medical devices approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration, such as pacemakers and defibrillators, have extended and improved the lives of millions of people living with heart disease. Below are some categories of FDA-approved devices used to treat various cardiovascular issues. Types of heart devices include: Cardiac ablation catheters: Long, thin flexible tubes that are threaded into or onto the heart, cardiac ablation catheters treat abnormally rapid heartbeats. They work by modifying small areas of heart tissue that are causing abnormal heart rhythms. Cardiovascular angioplasty devices: These are long, thin, flexible tubes that are threaded into a heart or other blood vessel to open narrowed or blocked areas. They are intended to improve blood flow to the heart, reduce chest pain, and treat heart attacks.

Cardiac pacemakers: Small and battery-powered, pacemakers are implanted into the body. Used when the heart beats too slowly, they monitor the organ's electrical impulses and, when needed, deliver electrical stimulation to make it beat at a more appropriate rate. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators: These devices monitor heart rhythms and deliver paced heartbeats and shocks if dangerously fast rhythms are detected. Many record the heart's electrical patterns when certain abnormal rhythms occur, allowing doctors to review the patterns. Prosthetic heart valves: Used for replacing diseased or dysfunctional heart valves, which direct blood flow through the heart, these are available in two forms. Mechanical valves are made of man-made materials. The second type, called bioprosthetic valves, are made from tissue taken from animals or human cadavers.

Stents: Small, lattice-shaped, metal tubes that are inserted permanently into an artery, stents are intended to help improve blood flow. Some contain drugs that may reduce the chance that arteries will become blocked again. Ventricular assist devices: Mechanical pumps that are intended to help weak hearts pump blood effectively, VADs were originally approved for short-term use until donor hearts became available. Some are now approved for long-term therapy in patients with severe heart failure who are not candidates for heart transplants. If you have questions about an AED device or AED accessory, contact the manufacturer. You can also call the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator who works with your state; phone numbers are listed online.

### Chemotherapy less toxic to the heart may Be option for some… [^112NxSnC]. NCI (2011). Low credibility.

The nonanthracycline regimen tested in BCIRG-006 was based on laboratory data that showed synergy between trastuzumab and docetaxel or platinum -based chemotherapy drugs. "It was also anticipated that might circumvent the cardiac toxicity seen with anthracycline-based regimens, " wrote the study authors, led by Dennis Slamon, M. D. Ph. D., director of Clinical/Translational Research at the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of California, Los Angeles. Researchers in 41 countries enrolled 3, 222 women with HER2-positive breast cancer in the trial. Participants were randomly assigned to receive one of three chemotherapy regimens after surgery: doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and docetaxel; AC-T plus trastuzumab; or docetaxel and carboplatin plus trastuzumab. The trial was sponsored by Sanofi-Aventis, the maker of docetaxel, with additional support from Genentech, the maker of trastuzumab.

Therefore, there is no definitive answer to whether one of the trastuzumab-containing regimens is better than the other, explained Sally Hunsberger, Ph. D., an investigator with the Biometric Research Branch in NCI's Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis. Instead, the authors looked at the tradeoff between disease-free events and cardiac events by comparing the excess of breast cancer events to the excess of high-grade congestive heart failure events. A total of 144 women receiving TCH had a distant recurrence of their cancer compared with 124 women receiving AC-T plus trastuzumab. However, 21 women receiving AC-T plus trastuzumab had high-grade congestive heart failure compared with 4 women who received TCH. In addition, 18. 6 percent of women receiving AC-T plus trastuzumab had a nonsymptomatic loss of heart function compared with
9. 4 percent of women who received TCH. It will be important, said Dr.

Slamon, to keep following these and other women who have received the combination of an anthracycline and trastuzumab to better understand the long-term effects on the heart. "We don't have long-term safety data on a lot of these studies, and that's a real problem, " he explained.
