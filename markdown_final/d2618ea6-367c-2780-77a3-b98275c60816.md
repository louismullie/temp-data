## Question

Target organ damage in uncontrolled hypertension

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about target organ damage in uncontrolled hypertension. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining uncontrolled hypertension and distinguishing it from hypertensive emergencies. Then, I should verify which organs are classically affected and why. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology linking pressure, neurohormonal drivers, and end-organ injury. After that, I should quantify the burden and prognostic impact of target organ damage. Then, I will review how to detect it clinically and with noninvasive tools. Finally, I will integrate management principles that both lower blood pressure and reverse organ damage, and I will flag special populations and uncertainties that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate terms. Uncontrolled hypertension generally refers to blood pressure above guideline targets despite treatment or untreated hypertension above diagnostic thresholds, whereas hypertensive emergency is severe elevation, typically ≥ 180/120 mm Hg, with acute target organ damage that mandates urgent inpatient parenteral therapy; severe hypertension without acute organ damage should not be acutely lowered with IV agents in the hospital, and outpatient oral intensification is preferred [^82ca87a2] [^5b5912e0] [^7165ec6e].

> I need to check which organ systems are considered classic targets. Contemporary guidelines and reviews consistently identify the heart, vasculature, kidneys, brain, and retina as the principal sites of hypertension-mediated organ damage, with cardiac, renal, and cerebrovascular manifestations carrying the greatest prognostic weight in routine risk stratification and treatment decisions [^14e698d3] [^b3d108ea] [^054216ef].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanisms without anchoring them to the data. The dominant driver is sustained elevation of blood pressure that exceeds organ-specific autoregulatory capacity, producing mechanical stress, endothelial injury, and microvascular ischemia; superimposed neurohormonal activation, especially the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and sympathetic overactivity, accelerates fibrosis, hypertrophy, and oxidative stress, while emerging evidence implicates immune and inflammatory pathways and mitochondrial dysfunction in end-organ remodeling, though translational clinical applications remain investigational [^b3d108ea] [^76fe518f] [^40ca0244] [^ead56018].

> Next, I should review the cardiac manifestations and verify their prognostic implications. Left ventricular hypertrophy is a hallmark of pressure overload and independently predicts heart failure, ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, and sudden death; diastolic dysfunction and atrial enlargement often accompany LVH, and atrial fibrillation and heart failure emerge as cumulative injury accrues, with autonomic imbalance both contributing to and being amplified by hypertension, creating a vicious cycle that perpetuates end-organ damage [^076465d2] [^23b22016] [^04cf3372].

> I will now examine the vascular compartment, because macro- and microvascular disease mediate many downstream events. Hypertension accelerates atherosclerosis and increases carotid intima–media thickness and plaque burden, while also promoting arterial stiffening and elevated pulse wave velocity; these changes correlate with stroke, coronary events, and peripheral artery disease, and in resistant hypertension, peripheral arterial disease appears more prevalent than in other uncontrolled phenotypes, underscoring the severity of vascular injury in this subgroup [^054216ef] [^05aced19].

> Let me consider the kidney carefully, since renal damage both reflects and amplifies cardiovascular risk. Chronic kidney disease and albuminuria are common in uncontrolled hypertension and independently predict cardiovascular events; importantly, masked uncontrolled hypertension is particularly strongly associated with albuminuria, suggesting that out-of-office hypertension exerts a disproportionate renal microvascular toll even when clinic pressures appear "controlled" [^6254d058] [^e765186c].

> I should confirm the cerebrovascular and neurocognitive consequences. Uncontrolled hypertension increases the risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, white matter disease, and cognitive decline; severe spikes can precipitate hypertensive encephalopathy, and longitudinal data show that even transient severe elevations associate with markedly higher subsequent stroke risk, reinforcing the need for durable control rather than episodic treatment [^24c9c316] [^b3d108ea].

> But wait, what about the retina as a window to microvascular injury. Hypertensive retinopathy grades correlate with systemic cardiovascular risk; in malignant hypertension, high-grade retinopathy frequently coexists with renal failure and microangiopathic processes, reflecting acute endothelial injury and thrombotic microangiopathy, and thus retinal findings can be both diagnostic and prognostic in acute and chronic settings [^d9cf3629] [^ace03098].

> I should double-check the burden of target organ damage in real-world cohorts. Large surveys indicate that more than half of individuals with hypertension harbor at least one form of hypertension-mediated organ damage, and clustering of multiple damages, such as LVH plus albuminuria plus impaired renal function, confers additive mortality and cardiovascular event risk, with hazard ratios rising steeply as the number of damaged organs increases [^14e698d3] [^09ecd8d9] [^0ed2d954].

> Next, I should review how we detect target organ damage in practice, balancing sensitivity, cost, and guideline direction. Routine assessment should include a focused history and exam, basic labs including renal function and urinalysis for albuminuria, and a 12-lead ECG; echocardiography is appropriate when cardiac involvement is suspected or to refine risk, and ambulatory or home blood pressure monitoring is essential to uncover masked hypertension and nocturnal patterns that track with organ damage, with ESH recommending periodic reassessment of organ damage depending on baseline findings and risk [^e53cf6fb] [^8981b55e] [^6d1405a2].

> Hold on, I should verify the prognostic value of specific markers. Microalbuminuria is a highly sensitive, early signal of endothelial dysfunction and glomerular injury and is cost-effective for broad screening; echocardiography detects LVH and diastolic dysfunction; carotid ultrasound identifies subclinical atherosclerosis; and arterial stiffness indices such as pulse wave velocity correlate with cardiovascular events and can be measured noninvasively, though availability varies and routine use is not universal [^beaf8931] [^1606c76e] [^054216ef].

> I need to ensure management principles address both blood pressure lowering and organ damage regression. First-line pharmacotherapy with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics reduces events, and agents that modulate the RAAS are particularly effective at reversing LVH and slowing CKD progression; in resistant hypertension, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, rigorous adherence assessment, and evaluation for secondary causes are critical, and device-based sympathomodulation may be considered in selected patients, though evidence for hard outcomes remains limited and patient selection is key [^b3d108ea] [^5f02e87b] [^3983d10d].

> Let me reconsider the role of blood pressure variability and nocturnal patterns, because they meaningfully modify risk. Increased visit-to-visit or day-to-night blood pressure variability independently associates with end-organ damage and adverse outcomes, and non-dipping or elevated nocturnal pressures correlate with more pronounced cardiac and renal damage; therefore, stabilizing blood pressure over time and targeting nocturnal control are reasonable therapeutic goals when feasible [^7c15214b] [^c5942094].

> I should confirm special populations and contexts where target organ damage assessment changes management. In chronic kidney disease, misclassification of blood pressure status is common, so ambulatory monitoring is especially important, and albuminuria guides both cardiovascular and renal risk stratification; in diabetes, the presence of hypertension-mediated organ damage shifts patients into higher risk categories and tightens blood pressure targets; in pregnancy, gestational hypertension without proteinuria still warrants close surveillance for evolving organ damage and progression to preeclampsia [^153799b7] [^b7b460ae] [^0ea6855d].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought that all patients with severe hypertension, even without acute symptoms, should be admitted for IV therapy, but that would be a mistake; I should correct that. Severe hypertension without acute target organ damage should be managed as an outpatient with prompt oral intensification and close follow-up, whereas hypertensive emergency with organ damage requires ICU-level monitoring and parenteral therapy to prevent progression of injury, balancing the risks of too-rapid correction against ongoing organ threat [^82ca87a2] [^5b5912e0] [^7165ec6e].

> Finally, I need to ensure the synthesis remains clinically actionable. Uncontrolled hypertension drives a predictable pattern of end-organ injury across heart, vasculature, kidneys, brain, and retina, with the severity and multiplicity of damage tracking closely with cardiovascular risk; systematic detection using guideline-directed evaluation, risk-informed imaging, and out-of-office blood pressure assessment, coupled with aggressive, mechanism-targeted therapy and follow-up for regression, offers the best strategy to halt progression and improve outcomes [^14e698d3] [^6d1405a2] [^b3d108ea].

Uncontrolled hypertension causes **progressive target organ damage** in the heart, brain, kidneys, vasculature, and retina, with risk rising as blood pressure remains elevated over time [^14e698d3] [^b3d108ea]. The most common and clinically significant damage includes **left ventricular hypertrophy** [^076465d2], heart failure, atrial fibrillation, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, chronic kidney disease with proteinuria [^6254d058], and hypertensive retinopathy [^ace03098]. Early detection with echocardiography, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio enables timely intervention to prevent irreversible injury and reduce cardiovascular events [^1606c76e] [^8981b55e] [^beaf8931].

---

## Cardiac target organ damage

Uncontrolled hypertension imposes chronic pressure overload on the heart, leading to **structural and functional changes** that increase cardiovascular risk [^076465d2].

- **Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)**: A compensatory increase in LV mass that independently predicts heart failure, ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, and sudden death [^076465d2].

- **Heart failure**: Both HFpEF and HFrEF are more common due to LVH, diastolic dysfunction, and ischemia [^076465d2].

- **Atrial fibrillation**: Hypertension-related atrial enlargement and fibrosis promote AF, increasing stroke risk [^23b22016].

- **Coronary artery disease**: Accelerated atherosclerosis and ischemia are more likely with sustained hypertension [^b3d108ea].

---

## Cerebrovascular target organ damage

Hypertension is the leading modifiable risk factor for stroke and cognitive impairment, with risk rising as blood pressure remains uncontrolled [^b3d108ea].

- **Ischemic stroke**: Small-vessel disease and atherosclerosis increase ischemic stroke risk [^b3d108ea].

- **Hemorrhagic stroke**: Chronic hypertension weakens vessel walls, increasing intracerebral hemorrhage risk [^b3d108ea].

- **Cognitive impairment**: Chronic hypertension contributes to vascular dementia and cognitive decline via chronic hypoperfusion and white matter injury [^b3d108ea].

---

## Renal target organ damage

The kidneys are particularly vulnerable to hypertension, with damage often progressing silently until advanced disease develops [^6254d058].

- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**: Hypertension is a leading cause of CKD, with reduced eGFR and proteinuria as key markers [^6254d058].

- **Proteinuria/microalbuminuria**: Early markers of glomerular injury and strong predictors of cardiovascular risk [^6254d058].

- **End-stage renal disease (ESRD)**: Uncontrolled hypertension accelerates progression to dialysis or transplant [^a689cb02].

---

## Vascular target organ damage

Hypertension accelerates systemic atherosclerosis and causes large- and small-vessel injury, increasing ischemic events and organ dysfunction [^b3d108ea].

- **Atherosclerosis**: Increased carotid intima-media thickness and plaques reflect systemic atherosclerotic burden [^b3d108ea].

- **Peripheral arterial disease (PAD)**: Higher prevalence in resistant hypertension, contributing to limb ischemia and amputation risk [^05aced19].

- **Aortic aneurysm/dissection**: Chronic hypertension weakens the aortic wall, increasing aneurysm and dissection risk [^b3d108ea].

---

## Ocular target organ damage

Hypertensive retinopathy reflects systemic microvascular injury and is a marker of cardiovascular risk [^ace03098].

- **Hypertensive retinopathy**: Grades II–IV retinopathy indicate severe vascular damage and correlate with increased cardiovascular risk [^ace03098].

- **Retinal arteriolar narrowing**: An early sign of microvascular remodeling and risk marker for future events [^ace03098].

---

## Clinical implications and management

Early detection and aggressive blood pressure control are essential to prevent or reverse target organ damage. Key strategies include:

- **Risk stratification**: Use LVH, CKD, and retinopathy to refine cardiovascular risk and guide therapy intensity [^b7b460ae].

- **Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM)**: Identifies masked hypertension and nocturnal hypertension, which are linked to greater organ damage [^c5942094] [^e765186c].

- **Therapeutic targets**: Aim for < 130/80 mmHg when tolerated, with individualized goals in older or comorbid patients [^c13dc9b8].

- **Organ-protective agents**: RAAS blockade, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics are first-line; MRAs are key in resistant hypertension [^b3d108ea] [^5f02e87b].

---

Uncontrolled hypertension causes **multisystem target organ damage** that is often silent until advanced; early identification with appropriate diagnostics and guideline-directed therapy can halt or reverse injury and improve outcomes [^14e698d3] [^6d1405a2].

### Vascular, cardiac and renal target organ damage associated to arterial hypertension: which noninvasive tools for detection? [^054216ef]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Arterial hypertension is a systemic condition characterized by elevated blood pressure in the vascular system. Despite the great effort of scientific community to sensitize population to the problem, enforcing the preventive and treatment measures, this condition continues to be responsible for a large portion of global mortality, as it represents one of the major modifiable risk factors of cardiovascular disease. The significant and substantial clinical implications of high blood pressure on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are explained by the effect of hypertension on specific organs, particularly sensitive to the effects of changes in blood pressure, resulting cardiac remodeling, cerebrovascular disease, renal failure, atherosclerotic vascular disease, and retinopathy, hence the term "target organ damage". The aim of this review is to give an overview of several noninvasive tools useful in the detection of organ damage related to arterial hypertension.

### Cardiovascular risks and organ damage in secondary hypertension [^93a974f0]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Secondary hypertension is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and exaggerated target organ damage, not only due to the higher and more sustained blood pressure values often observed in these patients but also because certain forms of hypertension can increase cardiovascular risk and organ damage by the neurohormonal and/or molecular pathways activation they exert. Early identification of secondary forms of hypertension can help mitigate organ damage and prevent cardiovascular complications. Signs and symptoms distinction among types of secondary hypertension is essential in order to prevent complications.

### Antihypertensive treatment: should it be titrated to blood pressure reduction or to target organ damage regression? [^bacb7103]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The success of an antihypertensive treatment is difficult to estimate by the extent of blood pressure reduction alone. Above and beyond blood pressure values in an individual patient, it is necessary to monitor the impact of antihypertensive treatment on the development or regression of hypertension-induced early end-organ damage. The intermediate objectives or surrogate endpoints may provide additional valuable information about the level of success of a given therapy in a particular patient. Moreover, monitoring intermediate objectives may provide scientific evidence for delineating the best antihypertensive treatment.

Recent Findings

The importance of assessing left ventricular mass, microalbuminuria, carotid wall thickness and the development of new-onset diabetes during antihypertensive treatment has been stressed. Left ventricular hypertrophy during antihypertensive therapy is associated with a lower likelihood of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, independent of blood pressure lowering and treatment modalities in people with essential hypertension. Likewise, a reduction in urinary albumin excretion seems to be followed by a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Risk implications of reducing carotid wall thickness or of developing new-onset diabetes have been more controversial, although it seems to be that both can have a desirable effect.

Summary

The available findings support the necessity to monitor intermediate objectives, aside from blood pressure measurement, during the follow-up of hypertensives.

### Hypertensive target organ damage predicts incident diabetes mellitus [^e5545f94]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

A large body of epidemiological and pathological data indicates that type 2 diabetes mellitus (diabetes) is an independent risk factor for preclinical cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD), including carotid atherosclerosis (CA) and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH), as well as for overt CVD in both men and women. Diabetes also worsens survival in patients who develop clinical CVD.

We have previously demonstrated that uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) is associated with a two-fold increased risk of incident diabetes in treated hypertensive subjects, extending previous observations indicating that incident diabetes is more frequent in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects, and that combinations of hypertension, obesity, and abnormal lipid profile, which often coexist with diabetes, are associated with preclinical cardiovascular abnormalities. Interestingly, clusters of metabolic abnormalities and the presence of LVH are also reported to increase the probability of uncontrolled hypertension.

These findings raise questions regarding the temporal sequence of these abnormalities and development of both hypertension and diabetes.

It is unclear whether the presence of hypertensive preclinical CVD (target organ damage), such as LVH and/or CA, is associated with increased risk of incident diabetes, independent of metabolic risk factors and arterial hypertension. Accordingly, the present study was designed to test whether or not prevalent hypertensive preclinical CVD increases the risk of incident diabetes in the hypertensive participants of the Campania Salute Network Registry.

### Protective effects of nebivolol from oxidative stress to prevent hypertension-related target organ damage [^45630d17]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Target organ damage (TOD) is one of the most feared consequences of uncontrolled hypertension. The presence of TOD leads to an increase in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Primarily the heart, kidney, brain and the vasculature are affected by the damage that results from elevated blood pressure. Established TOD may lead to coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, and atherosclerotic changes (development of stenosis, aneurysm) and renal failure. According to The European Society of Hypertension (ESH), evaluation of subclinical organ damage at an early stage is crucial in determining cardiac risk in patients with hypertension. Oxidative stress is one of the most important mechanisms implicated in TOD in patients with hypertension. It is defined as an increase in vascular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn decreases the level of antioxidant activity in the vasculature. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, xanthine oxidase and uncoupled nitric oxide synthase (NOS) are among the major sources of ROS in vascular disease and hypertension.TOD, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, carotid atheromatosis and renal impairment, is considered as an intermediate stage in the continuum of vascular disease. A study including 1095 consecutive hypertensive subjects showed a prevalence of TOD in 44.5% of the hypertensive population. Segura et al. reported the presence of at least one manifest TOD in 61.3% of the hypertensive (n = 5243) and 30.8% (n = 308) of the pre-hypertensive patients. Hence, the assessment and management of TOD in hypertensive patients is important and should be taken into account when planning clinical care which may improve their cardiovascular prognosis.

Hypertensive patients with a known history of diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and/or renal disease are high risk patients. According to the ESH guidelines, target blood pressure should be < 140/90 for low-moderate risk hypertensives and < 130/80 mm Hg for high-risk patients. A decrease in blood pressure by 20/10 mm Hg results in a decrease in mortality in cerebrovascular, cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease patients.

Nebivolol is a third-generation β-blocker. A direct relationship between oxidative stress and TOD via the NO pathway exists in the patients with hypertension. Thus, nebivolol mediated increase in bioavailability of NO in vasculature may provide added benefits in reducing TOD in patients with hypertension. Therefore, we intend to discuss the mechanism by which oxidative stress leads to TOD and the role of nebivolol in preventing the same in this review.

### Getting to goal in complex patients [^e0df8621]. Clinical Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Traditionally, the term complex hypertension has been applied to patients who have clinical evidence of target organ damage. However, this definition can be expanded to include many hypertensive patients who either present without manifest disease but harbor silent concomitant organ damage, or belong to a high-risk group and are likely to develop such damage. Thus, the number of patients who deserve special consideration as complex patients is considerable. Various factors may contribute toward classifying a patient as having complex hypertension. These include severe hypertension, concomitant conditions such as diabetes, chronic renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, orcongestive heart failure; and high-risk populations such as the elderly and African Americans. Recent evidence demonstrates that aggressive goal blood pressure (BP)-lowering therapy is the key toward halting the progression of vascular disease. Although the choice of initial therapy seems less important than achieving goal BP, the drug selected must impart efficacy, organ protection, and tolerability. Combination therapy consisting of calcium-channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors seems to achieve these desirable effects. Several clinical trials have demonstrated these agents to have favorable effects on BP and organ protection even in complex hypertension, particularly when used in combination.

### Essential hypertension [^fd500bc7]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Essential hypertension can be defined as a rise in blood pressure of unknown cause that increases risk for cerebral, cardiac, and renal events. In industrialised countries, the risk of becoming hypertensive (blood pressure > 140/90 mm Hg) during a lifetime exceeds 90%. Essential hypertension usually clusters with other cardiovascular risk factors such as ageing, being overweight, insulin resistance, diabetes, and hyperlipidaemia. Subtle target-organ damage such as left-ventricular hypertrophy, microalbuminuria, and cognitive dysfunction takes place early in the course of hypertensive cardiovascular disease, although catastrophic events such as stroke, heart attack, renal failure, and dementia usually happen after long periods of uncontrolled hypertension only. All antihypertensive drugs lower blood pressure (by definition) and this decline is the best determinant of cardiovascular risk reduction. However, differences between drugs exist with respect to reduction of target-organ disease and prevention of major cardiovascular events. Most hypertensive patients need two or more drugs for blood-pressure control and concomitant statin treatment for risk factor reduction. Despite the availability of effective and safe antihypertensive drugs, hypertension and its concomitant risk factors remain uncontrolled in most patients.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Out-of-office blood pressure (BP) monitoring and masked hypertension — adults on antihypertensive medication with high office BP: It is reasonable to conduct out-of-office BP monitoring for individuals with high office BP (office SBP/DBP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg), and individuals with office SBP/DBP ≥ 160/100 mm Hg should have antihypertensive medication intensification as necessary to control BP. Clinicians may consider targeted screening approaches for masked hypertension, particularly among those with unexplained BP-related target organ damage; in the absence of a best approach, out-of-office BP monitoring may be reasonable to exclude masked hypertension among adults with office SBP/DBP < 130/80 mm Hg. Recent evidence suggests antihypertensive medication may improve target organ damage among adults with masked hypertension, but the effect on cardiovascular outcomes remains unknown. Compared with controlled hypertension, masked uncontrolled hypertension is associated with an increased risk of CVD events and mortality; antihypertensive medication targeting out-of-office BP in masked uncontrolled hypertension reduces hypertension-related target organ damage measures (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, pulse wave velocity, left ventricular mass index), and although the effect of medication intensification on CVD events remains unknown, it may be reasonable to exclude masked uncontrolled hypertension using out-of-office BP monitoring for CVD risk stratification.

### Role of aldosterone in various target organ damage in patients with hypertensive emergency: a cross-sectional study [^d9cf3629]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite the progress in diagnostic medicine and therapeutic pharmacology, uncontrolled severe hypertension remains a matter of great concern in emergency medicine. A variety of organ damage ensues following the development of acute severe hypertension, including cerebral hemorrhage, heart failure, retinopathy and acute kidney impairment. Although the pathophysiology of the organ injuries in hypertensive emergencies is attributed in large part to absolute levels and the pace of the changes in blood pressure (BP), other factors may also contribute to the development of the organ damage. Because the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) is activated in these patients, it is reasonably surmised that RAS shares the responsibility for the organ damage with acute severe hypertension. Nevertheless, there have been few studies that attempt to evaluate comprehensively the role of RAS and BP in the pathophysiology of the acute organ damage in hypertensive emergencies.

There are reported various incidence rates of acute target organ injuries among patients with hypertensive emergencies. In patients with malignant hypertension, a subset of hypertensive emergencies, high-grade hypertensive retinopathy is observed, and renal functional impairment is reported to be common, with 63% of the patients manifesting this feature at the time of the presentation. Furthermore, acute vascular endothelial damage could elicit thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), which is characterized by fragmented erythrocytes and hemolytic anemia and is reported to be present in 25–44% of the patients with malignant hypertension. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is also observed frequently, which occurs most often in combination with other complications. Although these observations imply that the patients with hypertensive emergencies possess multiple target organ injuries, it remains unknown which factors (e.g. BP or aldosterone) are associated more closely with the occurrence of multiple organ injuries.

In the present study, we attempted to characterize the acute severe hypertension-induced injuries of various organs, including the kidney, heart, retina, and microvessels, in patients with hypertensive emergencies. Because RAS is recognized to be markedly activated in this disorder, we evaluated whether the augmented aldosterone was associated with or additively contributed to the development of these complications in patients with acute severe hypertension.

### Noninvasive cardiovascular imaging for evaluating subclinical target organ damage in hypertensive patients: a consensus article from the European association of cardiovascular imaging, the European Society of Cardiology council on hypertension and the European Society of Hypertension [^1606c76e]. Journal of Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Arterial hypertension accounts for the largest amount of attributable cardiovascular mortality worldwide, and risk stratification in hypertensive patients is of crucial importance to manage treatment and prevent adverse events. Asymptomatic involvement of different organs in patients affected by hypertension represents an independent determinant of cardiovascular risk, and the identification of target organ damage is recommended to further reclassify patients' risk. Noninvasive cardiovascular imaging is progressively being used and continues to provide new technological opportunities to target organ damage evaluation at early stage. The aim of this article is to provide the community of cardiology with an update on appropriate and justified use of noninvasive imaging tests in the growing population of hypertensive patients.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^e53cf6fb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension — recommendation-specific supportive text: Pertinent laboratory tests should be repeated at least annually to monitor for potential adverse effects of therapies, to assess for development or progression of kidney disease, and to monitor for changes in predicted CVD risk; in addition to the standard diagnostic assessment, optional testing for cardiac biomarkers (eg, high-sensitivity troponin [hs-cTn], B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP]), echocardiography, and coronary artery calcium may be helpful for CVD risk stratification and for detection of target organ damage in individuals with hypertension; and additional diagnostic evaluation should be considered when secondary causes of hypertension are suspected.

### Clinical practice guideline for screening and management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents [^b393c0d3]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Pediatric hypertension — echocardiography for cardiac target organ damage (Key Action Statement 15) specifies that it is recommended that echocardiography be performed to assess for cardiac target organ damage (left ventricular [LV] mass, geometry, and function) at the time of consideration of pharmacologic treatment of hypertension (HTN). Repeat echocardiography may be performed to monitor improvement or progression of target organ damage at 6- to 12-month intervals, with indications including persistent HTN despite treatment, concentric LV hypertrophy, or reduced LV ejection fraction. In patients without LV target organ injury at initial echocardiographic assessment, repeat echocardiography at yearly intervals may be considered in those with stage 2 HTN, secondary HTN, or chronic stage 1 HTN incompletely treated (noncompliance or drug resistance) to assess for the development of worsening LV target organ injury (grade C, moderate recommendation).

### Resistant hypertension and target organ damage [^e16eecb8]. Hypertension Research (2013). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular (CV) complications such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke and renal failure are related to both the degree and the duration of blood pressure (BP) increase. Resistant hypertension (RH) is associated with a higher risk of CV complications and a higher prevalence of target organ damage (TOD). The relationship between CV disease and TOD can be bidirectional. Elevated BP in RH may cause CV structural and functional alterations, and the development or persistence of left ventricular hypertrophy, aortic stiffness, atherosclerotic plaques, microvascular disease and renal dysfunction, may render hypertension more difficult to control. Specifically, RH is related to several conditions, including obesity, sleep apnea, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and hyperaldosteronism, characterized by an overexpression of humoral and hormonal factors that are involved in the development and maintenance of TOD. Optimal therapeutic strategies, including pharmacological treatment and innovative invasive methodologies, have been shown to achieve adequate BP control and induce the regression of TOD, thereby potentially improving patient prognosis.

### Hypertensive target organ damage predicts incident diabetes mellitus [^fed96ed6]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

We provide first evidence that initial LVH and CA are significant predictors of new onset diabetes in a large population of treated, relatively healthy hypertensive patients, independently of initial metabolic profile, anti-hypertensive therapy, and other significant covariates. This temporal sequence is likely to be attributable to risk factors both affecting CV system and yielding to diabetes, for which LVH and CA represent a more severe and advanced stage, but a vascular origin of diabetes cannot be excluded.

There are important implications of these findings for primary CV prevention, because they help identifying hypertensive patients at high risk of incident diabetes, a condition that would enormously increase CV risk in the setting of arterial hypertension. The possibility of refining identification of hypertensive patients at high risk to develop diabetes, by pooling ultrasound with clinical information, increases the chance to target individuals who might benefit from more aggressive pharmacological management, even independently of BP control, to reduce their vascular burden. Further studies are warranted to evaluate mechanisms explaining the reverse causation suggested by our findings.

### Blood pressure in childhood and adolescence [^8a4eab28]. American Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Elevated blood pressure (BP) and hypertension commonly occur in children and adolescents and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease in adulthood. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent research in pediatric hypertension including changes in defining hypertension, BP measurement techniques, hypertension epidemiology, risk factors, treatment, and BP-related target organ damage. Defining pediatric hypertension using the 2017 American Academy of Pediatrics' updated Clinical Practice Guideline resulted in a larger proportion of children being classified as having elevated BP or hypertension compared with prior guidelines. Trends in the distribution of BP among US children and adolescents suggest that BP levels and the prevalence of hypertension may have increased from 2011–2014 to 2015–2018. Factors including a family history of hypertension, obesity, minority race/ethnicity, physical inactivity, high dietary intake of sodium, and poor sleep quality are associated with an increased prevalence of elevated BP and hypertension. Evidence of a linear relationship between systolic BP and target organ damage indicates that BP levels currently considered normal could increase the risk of target organ damage in childhood. Lifestyle changes, such as adhering to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, are a central component of effectively reducing BP and have been shown to reduce target organ damage. Pharmacologic treatment using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers is an effective and safe method for reducing BP among children with uncontrolled BP after implementing lifestyle changes. Research gaps in the prevention, detection, classification, and treatment of hypertension in children demonstrate opportunities for future study.

Screening for features suggesting secondary hypertension — algorithm: Begin with the question "Does the patient have any of the following conditions associated with secondary HTN?" and assess for drug-resistant/induced HTN, abrupt onset of HTN, onset of HTN at < 30 y, exacerbation of previously controlled HTN, disproportionate target organ damage (TOD) for degree of HTN, accelerated/malignant HTN, onset of diastolic HTN in older adults (age ≥ 65 y), unprovoked or excessive hypokalemia, insomnia or daytime sleepiness, concomitant adrenal nodule, history of early-onset stroke, or family history of primary aldosteronism. If no, screening is not indicated. If yes, screen for primary aldosteronism and other secondary forms of HTN; if the result is a positive screening test then refer to a clinician with specific secondary HTN expertise, and if not, enhance medication therapy. For clarity, HTN indicates hypertension and TOD means target organ damage.

### Recognition and management of resistant hypertension [^5f02f87b]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Despite improvements in hypertension awareness and treatment, 30%-60% of hypertensive patients do not achieve BP targets and subsequently remain at risk for target organ damage. This therapeutic gap is particularly important to nephrologists, who frequently encounter treatment-resistant hypertension in patients with CKD. Data are limited on how best to treat patients with CKD and resistant hypertension, because patients with CKD have historically been excluded from hypertension treatment trials. First, we propose a consistent definition of resistant hypertension as BP levels confirmed by both in-office and out-of-office measurements that exceed appropriate targets while the patient is receiving treatment with at least three antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic, at dosages optimized to provide maximum benefit in the absence of intolerable side effects. Second, we recommend that each patient undergo a standardized, stepwise evaluation to assess adherence to dietary and lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive medications to identify and reduce barriers and discontinue use of substances that may exacerbate hypertension. Patients in whom there is high clinical suspicion should be evaluated for potential secondary causes of hypertension. Evidence-based management of resistant hypertension is discussed with special considerations of the differences in approach to patients with and without CKD, including the specific roles of diuretics and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and the current place of emerging therapies, such as renal denervation and baroreceptor stimulation. We endorse use of such a systematic approach to improve recognition and care for this vulnerable patient group that is at high risk for future kidney and cardiovascular events.

### Hypertension [^b3d108ea]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Systemic arterial hypertension is the most important modifiable risk factor for all-cause morbidity and mortality worldwide and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Fewer than half of those with hypertension are aware of their condition, and many others are aware but not treated or inadequately treated, although successful treatment of hypertension reduces the global burden of disease and mortality. The aetiology of hypertension involves the complex interplay of environmental and pathophysiological factors that affect multiple systems, as well as genetic predisposition. The evaluation of patients with hypertension includes accurate standardized blood pressure (BP) measurement, assessment of the patients' predicted risk of atherosclerotic CVD and evidence of target-organ damage, and detection of secondary causes of hypertension and presence of comorbidities (such as CVD and kidney disease). Lifestyle changes, including dietary modifications and increased physical activity, are effective in lowering BP and preventing hypertension and its CVD sequelae. Pharmacological therapy is very effective in lowering BP and in preventing CVD outcomes in most patients; first-line antihypertensive medications include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers and thiazide diuretics.

Hypertensive emergencies — definition, risks, and approach to severe hypertension without target organ damage: Hypertensive emergencies are defined as severe elevations in BP (≥ 180/120 mm Hg) associated with evidence of acute target organ damage, and patients with hypertensive emergencies experience a high in-hospital mortality rate of 10% with a 1-year cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rate of 20% to 30%. Hypertensive emergencies demand immediate reduction of BP to prevent or limit further target organ damage, but rapid correction to normal range may result in vital organ hypoperfusion due to loss of autoregulation. In contrast, patients with severe hypertension without evidence of acute target organ damage should not have aggressive BP lowering in the short-term or be given parenteral antihypertensive drug therapy, and reinitiation or intensification of oral antihypertensive medications, preferably in the outpatient setting, is recommended for these patients; additionally, there is no RCT evidence that antihypertensive drugs reduce morbidity or mortality in patients with hypertensive emergencies.

### MicroRNAs are involved in end-organ damage during hypertension [^1ae36095]. Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Even in the new millennium, arterial hypertension remains a serious condition, with considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. Crucial in managing the disease is not only lowering arterial blood pressure but also preventing or treating the typical end-organ damage caused by long-lasting and inadequately treated hypertension. In the past decade, it has been shown that microRNAs (miRs) are involved in several hypertension-related pathologies, such as cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, hypertensive heart failure, renal fibrosis, kidney failure, and, to a lesser extent, eye disease and hemorrhagic stroke. Whereas others extensively reviewed the role of miRs in atherosclerosis and vascular disease, this review focuses on their role in target organ damage during arterial hypertension. We emphasize the involvement of miRs in pathological end-organ remodeling processes and try to demonstrate some common miR signatures in distinct end organs. Hence, we aimed to provide proof of arterial hypertension being a systemic disease, similar to diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, miRs that act on one particular process in different end organs are interesting therapeutic targets. Some future perspectives in miR research are highlighted with respect to novel therapeutic strategies in the cardiovascular field.

### Albuminuria and masked uncontrolled hypertension in chronic kidney disease [^e765186c]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Masked uncontrolled hypertension (MUCH) is associated with greater target organ damage such as left ventricular hypertrophy, increased arterial stiffness and albuminuria. Whether MUCH independently associates with greater cardiovascular end-organ damage or kidney damage is unclear. The objective of this study was to assess the strength of the relationship of MUCH (awake ambulatory blood pressure ≥ 135/85 mmHg and clinic blood pressure < 140/90 mmHg) with target organ damage.

Methods

In a cross-sectional study at a veterans' administration medical center, clinically normotensive veterans without chronic kidney disease (CKD) (n = 29) and 287 patients with CKD and controlled hypertension (CH, n = 193), MUCH (n = 67) and uncontrolled hypertension (UCH, n = 27) had evaluation of target organ damage. Target organ damage was measured by echocardiography [left ventricular mass index (LVMI)], arterial ultrasonography [aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV)] and 24-h urine collection [albuminuria (urine albumin to creatinine ratio)] in all participants.

Results

Compared to that of controls, LVMI was higher by 21.8 g/m2 (CI, 4.0–39.7 g/m2) in CH, 27.9 (CI, 8–47.8) in MUCH and 39.5 (CI, 15.7–63.2) in UCH (P < 0.01 for group differences, P < 0.01 for linear trend). Although differences persisted after adjustment for age, sex and race, they lost significance after adjustments for cardiovascular risk factors and their treatment. Compared to that of controls, PWV was different among CH, MUCH and UCH (P = 0.04 for group differences, P = 0.02 for linear trend). However, differences lost significance after adjustments for age, sex and race. Compared to that of controls, log2 UACR was higher by 2.40 mg/mg (CI, 1.28–3.52) in CH, 4.94 (CI, 3.70–6.18) in MUCH and 6.01 (CI, 4.49–7.53) in UCH (P < 0.0001 for group difference, P < 0.0001 for linear trend). Differences persisted after adjustment for age, sex and race, cardiovascular risk factors and their treatment and cardiovascular disease (P < 0.0001 for group difference, P < 0.0001 for linear trend).

Conclusions

MUCH is more strongly related to albuminuria compared with cardiovascular damage as assessed by left ventricular mass and PWV. A graded and an independent relationship of blood pressure classification status with albuminuria is consistent with the hypothesis that renal mechanisms may be more important than cardiovascular disease in mediating the pathogenesis of MUCH.

### Preventing chronic kidney disease in special populations [^c424a795]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular events, and premature death. However, certain groups are known to be at higher risk for hypertensive end-organ damage, including diabetic patients, older patients with isolated systolic hypertension, and specific ethnic populations. Coexistent diabetes and hypertension dramatically increase the risk of developing CKD and other target-organ complications. The prevalence of hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, CKD, hypertensive renal disease, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is far greater in African Americans compared with white Americans. Identification of patients at increased risk for CKD offers the potential to prevent or delay ESRD and the cardiovascular events associated with CKD. Data from completed and ongoing controlled clinical hypertension trials will assist clinicians in creating optimal antihypertensive regimens for patients at increased risk for CKD.

### Immune-related effects in hypertension and target-organ damage [^76fe518f]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Several studies published in the past three decades have suggested that inflammation and activation of immunity are central features in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, ischemic myocardial injury, and also in hypertension-induced target organ damage. A better understanding of this field could help us to explain the increased cardiovascular risk in patients with chronic inflammation.

Recent Findings

Recent studies have demonstrated that macrophages and various T-cell subtypes play a pivotal role in the regulation of blood pressure and target organ damage. Hypertensive stimuli such as the effector molecule of the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin II, not only regulate vascular tone and sodium balance, but also activate immune cells and promote cell infiltration into target organs. Experimental and clinical evidence show that adaptive transfer of immune cells, rendering mice deficient for a certain subset of immune cells, or immunosuppressive treatment affects blood pressure and ameliorates target organ damage.

Summary

The aim of this review is to summarize and discuss some of the more recent insights as to how immune cells might affect the regulation of blood pressure and the pathogenesis of hypertension-induced target organ damage.

### Clinical trial design principles and outcomes definitions for device-based therapies for hypertension: a consensus document from the hypertension academic research consortium [^3983d10d]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Additional Outcomes Relevant to Device-Based Therapies for Hypertension Trials

Clinical Outcomes

HARC recommends to ascertain and classify death, neurological events, myocardial infarction, bleeding, access and vascular complications, acute kidney injury, and heart failure, following standardized definitions. Although complications occur infrequently with current technologies, procedure-specific criteria are proposed on the basis of existing ARC standards and available in the. Independent adjudication of clinical events (both safety and effectiveness) is a quality marker in clinical trials, enhances the validity of study results, and is often requested by regulatory authorities.

Target-Organ Damage

Regression of hypertension-mediated organ damage is associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes. Several prospective observational studies have suggested that RDN is associated with regression of echocardiographic or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging–based left ventricular mass index, improvement in left ventricular function, – decrease in left atrial volume index, and augmentation index or pulse wave velocity, irrespective of BP reduction. These studies, however, are limited because of sample size and lack of independent, blinded core laboratory assessment. Available data, limited by sample size and short-term follow-up, suggest that RDN is safe and effective in patients with chronic kidney disease, although it remains to be established whether RDN leads to improvement in albuminuria or kidney function, or at least attenuates the decline in glomerular filtration rate.

BP Targets and Variability

Clinical guidelines for hypertension treatment share an OBP target of < 130/80 mm Hg (when tolerated and on the basis of risk profiles), with an OBP of < 140/90 mm Hg for those > 65 years of age per the European guidelines. The proportion of patients achieving these targets is an alternative to targeting a specified absolute BP reduction from baseline, considering that relative percentage reduction from baseline after device-based therapies is influenced by initial BP levels and might be less applicable in milder forms of hypertension.

Long-term visit-to-visit variability in BP offers prognostic information in patients with hypertension and can be used as a secondary efficacy outcome. High BP variability has been associated with increased cardiovascular risk, and device-based therapies have been shown to reduce such variability after correction of baseline BP values, thus offering potential as an effectiveness outcome. A more consistent reduction in BP would expectedly mitigate BP variability and improve time in target range that has been associated with a lower risk of adverse events.

### Autonomic nervous system: a therapeutic target for cardiac end-organ damage in hypertension [^23b22016]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

More than 1.5 billion people worldwide have arterial hypertension, defined in adults as a systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg. Hypertension increases the risks of adverse cardiovascular outcomes and death. Conversely, lowering the blood pressure below < 130 mm Hg prevents cardiovascular diseases and death. High blood pressure has long-term adverse effects on multiple organs, including the heart. Such hypertension-mediated cardiac end-organ damage often takes clinical form as atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF).

Despite being essential for regulating cardiovascular physiology, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) also plays a relevant role in the pathophysiology of hypertension. Hypertension is associated with increased sympathetic activity, attenuation of parasympathetic activity, and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that interacts with ANS. These ANS alterations not only increase blood pressure but also perpetuate the development of AF and HF. – Common comorbidities, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and obesity, can contribute to altered ANS activity further accelerating the pathogenesis of hypertension, AF and HF.

ANS modulation, therefore, represents a potential therapeutic target for both hypertension and related cardiac end-organ damage. Below, we discuss clinical interventions for ANS modulation in hypertension and related AF and HF (outlined in the Figure and Table 1). Most clinical trials have been designed to test outcomes in blood pressure and not to study potential preventative effects on end-organ damage in the heart (Tables 2 and 3). Despite reports with promising results, the current evidence levels for ANS modulatory treatments for AF and HF remain low and the treatments are not routinely recommended, implying a knowledge gap to be covered in future randomized trials. The role of ANS in the pathogenesis of hypertension, AF, HF, OSA, and obesity has been reviewed elsewhere. –

DISCUSSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Numerous clinical trials have investigated the efficacy and safety of autonomic modulatory therapies for hypertension and renal denervation is now recommended for clinical use in certain patients with hypertension by current guidelines. Because hypertension promotes cardiac end-organ damage, also mediated by ANS changes, autonomic modulatory therapies likely are beneficial for hypertensive patients with AF and HF. Tables 2 and 3 summarize the major trials, some with promising results for treating AF and HF. However, there is still a need for randomized and controlled trials on ANS modulation in AF and HF cohorts to cover current evidence gaps. It would be important to include control groups subjected to antihypertensive treatments causing similar reduction in blood pressure, to evaluate the direct role of autonomic modulation on cardiac end-organ prevention, independent of the hemodynamic load exerted on the heart.

Because sex has been shown to influence the effect of cardiovascular therapies with typically poorer outcomes in females, it is worth noticing that 8 of the 12 interventional clinical trials summarized in Tables 2 and 3 report on a male-dominant patient population. Achieving balanced patient populations, also in terms of racial ethnicity, is crucial in future trials, to ensure evidence-based medicine in all patient groups.

In alignment, pharmacological antihypertensive treatment, that normalizes blood pressure, does not show a complete normalization in ANS activity. This persisting autonomic dysfunction could favor progression of hypertension-related AF and HF, despite controlled hypertension with normal blood pressure. Direct modulation of ANS might result in a more effective prevention of hypertension-mediated end-organ damage in the heart than conventional antihypertensive drugs. However, it is still unknown whether autonomic modulatory therapies in patients with hypertension, but without AF and HF, prevent the later development of cardiac end-organ damage. Long-term follow-up of the clinical trials is essential to reveal such prevention in disease development of AF and HF in patients with hypertension. Last, combinations of pharmacological and interventional therapies with most optimal effect on ANS and cardiac end-organ damage remain to be identified.

Hypertensive emergencies — burden and management principles: Patients with hypertensive emergencies experience a high in-hospital mortality rate of 10% with a 1-year cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rate of 20% to 30%. Common forms of acute hypertension-related target organ damage include acute heart failure/pulmonary edema, neurologic disorders (encephalopathy, intracerebral hemorrhage [ICH], acute ischemic stroke), and acute kidney injury (AKI), with aortic dissection the least common presentation. Hypertensive emergencies demand immediate reduction of blood pressure (BP) to prevent or limit further target organ damage, whereas patients with severe hypertension without evidence of acute target organ damage should not have aggressive BP lowering in the short-term or be given parenteral antihypertensive drug therapy; reinstitution or intensification of oral antihypertensive medications, preferably in the outpatient setting, is recommended for these patients.

### Role of the immune system in hypertensive target organ damage [^3ed01954]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Recent advances in our understanding of cardiovascular diseases clearly show that inflammation and activation of immunity are central features in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, ischemic myocardial injury, and also in hypertension-induced target organ damage. However, the idea that special immune cells could regulate immune responses in these conditions in favor of minimizing disease is a novel concept. Regulatory T cells have unique immune modulatory properties that offer an attractive alternative to common immunosuppressant drugs. Their application in animal models of autoimmunity and neoplastic conditions offers exciting therapeutic avenues. Thus, with the use of regulatory T cells in hypertension-induced target organ damage enables new insights into the pathophysiologic mechanisms and widen our knowledge of the role of the immune system in cardiovascular disease. The aim of this review was to summarize and discuss some of the most recent insights and put them into a perspective based on well-known interactions between immunity and hypertensive damage.

Pre-hypertension — guideline recommendations and potential role for echocardiography: In the category of pre-hypertension (systolic blood pressure 130–140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure 80–90 mmHg), JNC 7 recommends intense lifestyle modification in such patients, and clinicians may obtain echocardiography to evaluate the presence of LV hypertrophy in such patients with pre-hypertension, particularly where there is a strong family history of hypertension and cardiovascular complications. Current guidance emphasizes blood pressure control rather than imaging-based risk stratification, as JNC 7 recommendations do not risk stratify patients for treatment on the basis of target organ damage and current guidelines recommend the use of combination treatment to get blood pressure to goal, thus blood pressure remains the primary target of therapy. Evidence gaps remain: no studies have examined whether a patient's knowledge of echocardiography demonstrating LVH will improve adherence to lifestyle modifications or pharmacological treatment, and NICE notes uncertainty about how to assess the impact of blood pressure treatment in people aged < 40 years with grade 1 hypertension and no overt target organ damage or CVD.

### Evaluation of subclinical target organ damage for risk assessment and treatment in the hypertensive patients: left ventricular hypertrophy [^076465d2]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

At some point in the natural history of hypertension, the compensatory increase in left ventricular mass ceases to be beneficial. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) becomes a preclinical disease and an independent risk factor for congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, arrhythmia, sudden death, and stroke. In addition to elevated BP, several mechanisms are involved, including body size, age, gender, race, fibrogenic cytokines, and neurohumoral factors, notably angiotensin II, which favor interstitial collagen deposition and perivascular fibrosis. These tissue changes are responsible for the insidious contractile dysfunction that is associated with LVH, consequent to decreased coronary reserve and altered diastolic ventricular filling and relaxation. The cardinal investigations are echocardiography and electrocardiography. All antihypertensive drugs regress LVH, notably those that act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which also could target the detrimental tissue changes. Regression enhances systolic midwall performance, normalizes autonomic function, and restores coronary reserve. The resulting improvement in prognosis has enshrined the detection, prevention, and reversal of LVH in the current guidelines of hypertension management.

### Severe asymptomatic hypertension: evaluation and treatment [^2ae3a846]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension affects one-third of Americans and is a significant modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke, renal disease, and death. Severe asymptomatic hypertension is defined as severely elevated blood pressure (180 mm Hg or more systolic, or 110 mm Hg or more diastolic) without symptoms of acute target organ injury. The short-term risks of acute target organ injury and major adverse cardiovascular events are low in this population, whereas hypertensive emergencies manifest as acute target organ injury requiring immediate hospitalization. Individuals with severe asymptomatic hypertension often have preexisting poorly controlled hypertension and usually can be managed in the outpatient setting. Immediate diagnostic testing rarely alters short-term management, and blood pressure control is best achieved with initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive therapy. Aggressive lowering of blood pressure should be avoided, and the use of parenteral medications is not indicated. Current recommendations are to gradually reduce blood pressure over several days to weeks. Patients with escalating blood pressure, manifestation of acute target organ injury, or lack of compliance with treatment should be considered for hospital admission.

The present study, which is based on the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) Presidential Lecture given at the 32 nd ESH Meeting in Milan, will be focused on the effects of different nonpharmacological, pharmacological and devices-based interventions on the hypertension-related sympathetic overactivity. Following an introductory paragraph focused on the rationale for sympathomodulatory interventions in antihypertensive treatment, the most critical methodological aspects of the published studies aimed at assessing the antisympathetic therapeutic approaches adopted in the disease will be reviewed. The core of the study will be focused on the effects of nonpharmacological, pharmacological (monotherapy, combination drug treatment, new drugs), as well as devices-based interventions (renal sympathetic nerves ablation and carotid baroreceptor activation therapy) on the hypertension-related sympathetic overdrive. The final part of the manuscript will offer to the readers an outlook on the open questions related to this area of research that will need to be addressed in the forthcoming years. These include, among others, the new potential methodologies to assess sympathetic function during antihypertensive treatment and the link between adrenergic overdrive, adherence to antihypertensive treatment and controlled or uncontrolled blood pressure status.

### Cumulative effects of several target organ damages in risk assessment in hypertension [^09ecd8d9]. American Journal of Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The prognostic value of screening multiple target organ damages (TODs) in hypertensive subjects has not been extensively studied. We estimated the prognostic value of considering 3 TODs in estimating the 10-year survival in hypertensive subjects.

Methods

At baseline 1,848 out of a cohort of 1,963 hypertensive patients had a previous cardiovascular disease (CVD) or assessments of 3 TODs: Modification in Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) < 60ml/min or albuminuria > 300mg/day, Sokolow index > 3.5 mV, and advanced hypertensive retinopathy (grades 3 and 4 of Keith-Wagener-Barker classification). The cohort was divided into 5 groups: 0 TOD (N = 978), 1 TOD (N = 308), 2 TODs (N = 94), 3 TODs (N = 30), and previous CVD (N = 438).

Results

After 10 years of follow-up, we observed 418 deaths of which 254 from cardiovascular cause. The adjusted hazard ratios for the major cardiovascular risk factors showed a progressive risk associated with the number of TODs. For all-cause death, the hazard ratios [95% confidence intervals] vs. 0 TOD of the other 4 groups were 1.91 [1.39–2.63], 1.99 [1.28–3.10], 4.33 [2.42–7.72], and 3.09 [2.35–4.05], respectively. For cardiovascular death, the hazard ratios [95% confidence intervals] were of the same order of magnitude: 2.14 [1.38–3.32], 2.12 [1.15–3.89], 4.22 [1.83–9.72], and 4.24 [2.95–6.11], respectively.

Conclusions

Our results indicate that hypertensive patients with several TODs had a worst outcome. Thus, it seems important to screen for multiple TODs in hypertension; especially check for severe hypertensive retinopathy in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and renal damage.

### Efficacy of antihypertensive treatment for target organ protection in patients with masked hypertension (ANTI-MASK): a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^8aef6dce]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Blood pressure and target organ damage in the primary intention-to-treat analysis. The Figure shows the time trends by randomisation group for systolic and diastolic office blood pressure (panels A and B), the 24-h systolic and diastolic ambulatory blood pressure (panels C and D), the proportion of target organ damage (panel E), and the improvement proportion in target organ damage, the primary study outcome (panel F). SBP and DBP indicate systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and TOD target organ damage. Significance of the between-group differences: ✱ p < 0.05; †p < 0.01; ‡p < 0.001.

Subgroup analyses were conducted in the framework of the primary ITT analysis and stratified by sex or the medians of age (55 years), body mass index (24 kg/m 2), and 24-h systolic BP at randomisation (135 mm Hg), history of antihypertensive treatment prior to screening, and the presence versus absence of 24-h, daytime or nighttime hypertension (Fig. S4 in Appendix B). Among all strata, only the presence versus absence of daytime hypertension reached significance (p = 0.017) with greater TOD benefit in patients with daytime hypertension.

Per-protocol analysis

The per-protocol analysis excluded 36 patients randomised to active treatment and 44 randomised to placebo, because patients withdrew or violated the protocol (Fig. 1, and Table S8 in Appendix B). The per-protocol analysis confirmed the BP changes observed in the ITT analysis as well as the changes in TOD (Tables S9 and S10, Fig. S5 in Appendix B).

Safety analysis

The safety analysis excluded 3 patients randomised to active treatment and 4 randomised to placebo, who did not take any study medication. Adverse events were generally mild (Table S11 in Appendix B) and occurred in 38 (25.3%) and 43 (26.4%) patients randomised to active treatment and placebo, respectively (p = 0.83). Serious adverse events leading to hospitalisation occurred in 3 (2.0%) patients randomised to active treatment and 4 (2.5%) patients on placebo. No patient died during follow-up.

### Autonomic nervous system: a therapeutic target for cardiac end-organ damage in hypertension [^04cf3372]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

More than 1.5 billion people worldwide have arterial hypertension. Hypertension increases the risks of death and cardiovascular disease, such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure. The autonomic nervous system plays an essential role in hypertension development and disease progression. While lifestyle factors, such as obesity and obstructive sleep apnea, predispose to hypertension by increasing sympathetic activity, hypertension itself maintains the autonomic nervous imbalance, providing the substrate for atrial fibrillation and heart failure. Therefore, autonomic nervous system modulation either by direct targeting or indirect treatment of comorbidities has the potential to treat both hypertension and related atrial and ventricular end-organ damage. We discuss interventions for the modulation of the autonomic nervous system for hypertension and related cardiac end-organ damage, including pharmacological adrenergic beta-receptor blockade, renal denervation, carotid baroreceptor stimulation, low-level vagal stimulation, and ablation of ganglionated plexuses. In summary, the literature suggests that targeting the autonomic nervous system potentially represents a therapeutic approach to prevent atrial and ventricular end-organ damage in patients with hypertension. However, clinical trials specifically designed to test the effect of autonomic modulation on hypertension-mediated cardiac end-organ damage are scarce.

### Acute severe hypertension | NEJM resident 360… [^24c9c316]. resident360.nejm.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published November 6, 2019 Blood-pressure elevations above 180/110 to 120 mm Hg can result in acute injury to the heart, brain, and the microvasculature. If acute hypertension-mediated target-organ damage is present, the condition is labeled "hypertensive emergency" and demands immediate and aggressive treatment to limit progressive injury. Read the Clinical Practice Article here. A: Even in the absence of acute target-organ damage, episodes of severe hypertension have long-term implications. In a study involving 2435 patients with a previous transient ischemic attack, an isolated systolic blood pressure above 180 mm Hg was associated with an increase in stroke risk during 3 years of follow-up by a factor of 5, as compared with no episodes of systolic blood pressure above 140 mm Hg, regardless of usual blood pressures.

Similarly, a prospective cohort study showed that patients who had an admission with hypertensive urgency had a 50% higher risk of fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events than controls, despite similar blood-pressure levels during follow-up. A: There are relatively few trials comparing different agents for hypertensive emergency and hypertensive urgency. Treatment is largely determined by an understanding of the pathophysiological features, the presence and type of target-organ injury, the availability and costs of medications, and physician experience with given agents. There is considerable variability in practice regarding the choice of medications. All patients should be admitted to an intensive care unit and treated with intravenous antihypertensive drugs on the basis of the clinical scenario. In the United States, labetalol, nitroglycerin, nicardipine, hydralazine, and nitroprusside are the most commonly used agents.

Of these medications, hydralazine has unpredictable effects, often leads to excessive blood-pressure lowering, and should generally be avoided as a first option. A: Most patients without acute target-organ damage can be cared for as outpatients. Treatment with guideline-concordant long-acting medications should be started, reinstated, or adjusted, and follow-up should be scheduled within 1 to 7 days. In a study involving more than 500 patients presenting to an emergency department with severe hypertension, blood pressure fell to less than 180/110 mm Hg after 30 minutes of quiet rest in approximately one third of the patients.

Gestational hypertension — risk and treatment evidence: It is the de novo development of hypertension after 20 weeks' gestation in the absence of new proteinuria or target organ damage and is associated with increased maternal and fetal/neonatal adverse events, with up to 30% of women ultimately developing preeclampsia. Following delivery, affected individuals have an increased risk of future hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The highest-quality randomized trial of nonproteinuric hypertension compared tight versus less-tight DBP targets (85 mm Hg and 100 mm Hg, respectively) and showed a reduction in severe maternal hypertension with tight control, with no other significant differences in maternal, fetal, or neonatal complications or pregnancy loss between groups. Post-hoc analyses associated development of severe hypertension with increased risks of pregnancy loss, neonatal intensive care unit admission, preterm delivery, and low birthweight.

### Hypertension: new guidelines from the international… [^22f6dc84]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Use an average threshold of 140/90 mm Hg for office diagnosis of hypertension, but 135/85 mm Hg for home and 130/80 mm Hg for 24-hour ambulatory monitoring.
- Initial assessment in a patient who is hypertensive should evaluate for cardiovascular risk and any hypertension-mediated organ damage. From the AFP Editors Hypertension is one of the leading causes of death globally each year, accounting for up to 30% of myocardial infarctions. Although the prevalence of hypertension is increasing, many patients are underdiagnosed and undertreated. The International Society of Hypertension has published summary guidelines based on major international guidelines published between 2017 and 2020 on the control of hypertension. These summary guidelines include essential recommendations and suggestions for optimal care. The ISH recommends categorizing grade 1 hypertension for BP levels less than 160/100 mm Hg and grade 2 hypertension for any higher BP levels.

Hypertension should only be diagnosed from a single BP reading if the measurement is 180/110 mm Hg or higher with evidence of cardiovascular disease requiring immediate treatment. Otherwise, the patient should be reassessed every one to four weeks to confirm BP elevations. Assessment After diagnosing hypertension, further assessment is recommended to identify cardiovascular risk factors and signs of hypertension-mediated organ damage. The cardiovascular risk factors of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, obesity, or nicotine use affect one-half of people with hypertension. In addition to history and physical examination, a cost-effective assessment includes serum chemistry levels, fasting glucose level, fasting lipid panel, urinalysis, and electrocardiography. Within the first three months of starting pharmacotherapy, the BP target should be less than 140/90 mm Hg.

Recommended long-term blood pressure targets are less than 130/80 mm Hg in patients younger than 65 years and less than 140/90 mm Hg in patients 65 years or older. Editor's Note: The ISH guidelines are important because they successfully cut the Gordian knot of conflicting diagnosis thresholds and treatment targets in hypertension. They move us away from the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, which recommended a diagnosis and treatment target of 130/80 mm Hg primarily based on a few large, well-controlled trials that are difficult to replicate in practice.

### Mitochondrial injury and dysfunction in hypertension-induced cardiac damage [^ead56018]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Hypertension remains an important modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Deciphering the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension is critical, as its prevalence continues increasing worldwide. Mitochondria, the primary cellular energy producers, are numerous in parenchymal cells of the heart, kidney, and brain, major target organs in hypertension. These membrane-bound organelles not only maintain cellular respiration but also modulate several functions of the cell including proliferation, apoptosis, generation of reactive oxygen species, and intracellular calcium homeostasis. Therefore, mitochondrial damage and dysfunction compromise overall cell functioning. In recent years, significant advances increased our understanding of mitochondrial morphology, bioenergetics, and homeostasis, and in turn of their role in several diseases, so that mitochondrial abnormalities and dysfunction have been identified in experimental models of hypertension. In this review, we summarize current knowledge of the contribution of dysfunctional mitochondria to the pathophysiology of hypertension-induced cardiac damage, as well as available evidence of mitochondrial injury-induced damage in other organs. Finally, we discuss the capability of antihypertensive therapy to ameliorate hypertensive mitochondrial injury, and the potential position of mitochondria as therapeutic targets in patients with hypertension.

### Nocturnal blood pressure: pathophysiology, measurement and clinical implications. position paper of the European Society of Hypertension [^c5942094]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Relationship with organ damage

Nocturnal BP patterns are associated with target organ damage in patients with hypertension: Studies on patients with essential hypertension have indeed shown a correlation between elevated night-time BP or a nondipper BP profile and a higher risk of damage to target organs, including the heart, kidneys, blood vessels, and brain.

As mentioned above, while the assessment of the 24 h BP profile by ABPM is not feasible in all patients, new devices for the assessment of home BP might allow to estimate nocturnal hypertension more easily. Within the J-HOP study, nocturnal hypertension was prevalent, and its association with target organ damage was consistent regardless the device used (ABPM or HBPM). However, while masked nocturnal hypertension was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events (see next paragraph) and demonstrated varying prevalence among seasons, similar risk profiles were observed for organ damage.

Considering that current methods of measuring night-time BP are not readily available in all patients, a predictor score for identifying those in whom nocturnal BP may be elevated was proposed in order to identify candidates for nocturnal BP monitoring. The predictors included male sex, high BMI, diabetes, elevated office and home BP and elevated urinary albumin-creatinine ratio. However, the generalizability of this score beyond the Japanese population requires further validation.

Examining the impact of bedtime dosing of antihypertensive drugs on BP reduction at night revealed no significant difference as compared to morning dosing, but controlling night-time BP was associated with reduced target organ damage in the J-TOP study.

In conclusion, night-time BP exhibits associations with target organ damage independently of daytime measurements. This underscores its clinical significance and the potential need for specific populations to undergo aggressive evaluation and management of night-time BP, an indication which requires to be addressed by further studies.

### Therapeutic potential of extracellular vesicles in hypertension-associated kidney disease [^9cea5158]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypertension-mediated organ damage frequently includes renal function decline in which several mechanisms are involved. The present review outlines the state of the art on extracellular vesicles in hypertension and hypertension-related renal damage. Emerging evidence indicates that extracellular vesicles, small vesicles secreted by most cell types and body fluids, are involved in cell-to-cell communication and are key players mediating biological processes such as inflammation, endothelial dysfunction or fibrosis, mechanisms present the onset and progression of hypertension-associated kidney disease. We address the potential use of extracellular vesicles as markers of hypertension-mediated kidney damage severity and their application as therapeutic agents in hypertension-associated renal damage. The capacity of exosomes to deliver a wide variety of cargos to the target cell efficiently makes them a potential drug delivery system for treatment of renal diseases.

### Cardiovascular and renal risk assessment as a guide for treatment in primary hypertension [^f817f81a]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2004). Low credibility.

BP levels per se may be an unreliable indicator of risk in the individual patient. In fact, the global cardiovascular profile, including the presence and degree of target organ damage, is a better predictor of future events and, therefore, should be used to choose both treatment and BP goals. However, the prevalence of target organ damage and therefore the percentage of patients who are at risk very much depends on the diagnostic techniques used. However, as a result of the high prevalence of hypertension and its financial impact on public health systems, limiting unnecessary and extensive diagnostic tests also should be a priority. The routine search for microalbuminuria may lead to the detection of a significantly greater percentage of patients who are at high risk while contributing the optimization of the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic workup in hypertensive patients.

To achieve contemporary blood pressure targets, combinational therapy is often required. Thus, several single-pill combination therapies have been widely used, and these antihypertensive treatments are among the most remarkable achievements in modern clinical medicine. Even with these accomplishments, resistant hypertension, defined by uncontrolled blood pressure despite the use of a diuretic and ≥ 2 antihypertensives drugs at the maximum tolerated dose, persists in 12%–14% of treated hypertensive patients. It has been reported that patients with resistant hypertension experience higher rates of target organ damage compared to those with well-controlled blood pressure. Moreover, 3% of these patients who do not achieve blood pressure control even with ≥ 5 antihypertensive therapies are defined as refractory hypertensive, and those with refractory hypertension were found to have higher prevalence ratios for Black race, diabetes mellitus, and albuminuria, compared to those with resistant hypertension. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies are still needed to combat resistant and refractory hypertension.

### Hypertension-mediated organ damage and established cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension: the China hypertension survey, 2012–2015 [^7696bdb2]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The global prevalence of hypertension was estimated to be 1.13 billion in 2015, with an alarming number of 235 million in east Asia. Hypertension prevalence has been rising in China in recent decades, with up to 23.2% prevalence in Chinese people aged 18 and older, or an estimated 244.5 million individuals, resulting in an increase of blood pressure (BP)-related morbidity and mortality. If the definition of hypertension from the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline was adopted, the prevalence of hypertension would be double, suggesting a critical burden of elevated BP in China. Furthermore, the prevalence of hypertension is expected to continue increasing with rapid economic development, urbanization, and aging.

Hypertension is the leading cause of cardiovascular (CV) disease globally. It is well known that the incidence of several CV diseases, including stroke, coronary heart disease, and peripheral artery disease, is closely linking to hypertension. Meanwhile, many patients with long-term elevated BP may present with hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD, previously termed target organ damage), and at first without symptoms, including left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), microalbuminuria, and so on, many of which are usually markers of preclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Identifying HMOD could help to estimate the burden of high-CV-risk populations in the hypertensive population. Furthermore, earlier screening and intervention in HMOD may lead to more effective therapeutic strategies and reduce future CV events. Since the various classes of antihypertensive agents have protective actions on end-target organs, the distribution of HMOD and CVD may differ in hypertensive patients depending on whether they use antihypertensive drugs or not. However, there is limited data on the status of HMOD and established CVD in China and worldwide. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of HMOD and established CVD in a nationally representative population in China.

IMPLICATIONS

Generally, compared with patients with nonresistant hypertension, patients with resistant hypertension, regardless of controlled or uncontrolled, have greater target end-organ damage, including increased cardiovascular morbidity, retinal changes, and CKD progression. Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study determined prevalence, and clinical outcomes of aTRH in 3367 nondialysis CKD patients with hypertension based on less than 140/90 mmHg BP target. The overall prevalence of aTRH was 40.4% in CRIC cohort and much higher (54.2%) in participants with eGFR less than 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2. Compared with no aTRH, participants with aTRH had a higher hazard ratio of 1.38 (95% CI,1.22–1.56) for composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, congestive heart failure, and all-cause mortality and 1.28 (95% CI, 1.11–1.46) for renal events. The degree to which these risks are reduced with treatment of resistant hypertension was evaluated in a large cohort of Kaiser Permanente Southern California members with hypertension, where aTRH was defined by BP more than 140/90 mmHg. In this study, the hazard ratio of ESKD was significantly higher in uncontrolled resistant hypertension than those of controlled resistant hypertension (1.25; 95% CI, 1.18–1.33) and patients with controlled resistant hypertension had higher risk of ESKD when compared to nonresistant hypertension (1.16, 95% CI, 1.10–1.22). These results suggest that BP control alleviates most, but not all of the increased risk of target organ damage associated with aTRH; however, such evidence is not available in patients with resistant hypertension associated with CKD. Nonetheless, the benefits of successful treatment are possibly significant as suggested by data from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) study, although needs definitive evaluation in resistant hypertension associated with CKD.

### Comparison of the association of masked hypertension defined by the 2017 ACC / AHA BP guideline versus the JNC7 guideline with left ventricular hypertrophy [^393d4b6a]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

The results from the current study suggest that screening for MHT using awake BP and the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline thresholds to define in-office and out-of-office hypertension status could identify adults more likely to have LVH compared with using the JNC7 BP guideline thresholds. However, according to the results of the current study, screening for masked uncontrolled hypertension using BP thresholds from the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline may not be useful for identifying individuals with a high probability of LVH. It is unclear whether antihypertensive medication lowers the risk for LVH or CVD among individuals with MHT or masked uncontrolled hypertension. Several randomized trials are underway evaluating the effect of antihypertensive medication on LVH regression among individuals with masked uncontrolled hypertension.

The current study has several strengths. The analyses were conducted pooling the data from selected participants from five population-based, community-based, and practice-based US studies. These studies were conducted in diverse populations and across a broad geographic area. Office and ambulatory BP were measured following standardized protocols. The conduct of high-quality echocardiograms permitted the assessment of the association of BP thresholds from the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline on target organ damage. The results should also be interpreted in the context of potential and known limitations. Office BP was obtained on a single occasion versus multiple occasions as recommended by clinical practice guidelines. Information on CVD events were not available for most study participants. We may have lacked statistical power when assessing the association of LVH with MHT. Future studies should compare the association of MHT defined using the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline versus the JNC7 guideline with CVD events. Some characteristics, including eGFR, family history of hypertension, lipid-lowering, and glucose-lowering medication use were not collected in NCMH study.

### Characterization of resistant hypertension… [^003f53e2]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Background Resistant hypertension is a common clinical problem and greatly increases the risk of target organ damage. Methods. Patients with resistant hypertension are at a disproportionately high risk for target organ damage and cardiovascular events. 7 Some factors associated with poor BP control include older age, more severe hypertension, chronic kidney disease, female sex, black race, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. 3, 4 Although these patient characteristics are known to be associated with poorly controlled hypertension, mechanisms that underlie resistant hypertension remain poorly elucidated. In contrast, only 4% of controls had an elevated ratio with the use of either plasma or urinary aldosterone levels. The ANP and BNP values were incrementally higher in patients with a high aldosterone status vs patients with a normal aldosterone status vs controls.

The PRA levels were lower in patients with resistant hypertension despite widespread use of agents known to increase PRA, and serum potassium levels were also lower, perhaps as a consequence of greater diuretic use or higher aldosterone levels. The present study is the first, to our knowledge, to report significantly higher BNP and ANP levels in patients with resistant hypertension compared with controls. Atrial natriuretic peptide is mainly produced in the cardiac atria, and BNP is produced mostly in the cardiac ventricles in response to volume or pressure overload. 21–24 These findings of higher BNP and ANP levels in patients with resistant hypertension despite widespread diuretic use support persistent intravascular volume expansion as an important cause of resistant hypertension.

Interpretation of the present results to suggest persistent fluid retention separate from higher arterial BP as an important cause of the higher natriuretic peptide levels is consistent with findings from Mayo Clinic investigators, 25 who reported that higher intravascular volumes as indexed by thoracic impedance, predicted a favorable response to increased diuretic use in individuals with resistant hypertension. In conclusion, the present study implicates aldosterone excess and persistent intravascular volume expansion as common underlying causes of resistant hypertension. Increased intravascular volume is not limited to patients with measurable evidence of aldosterone excess, suggesting that either factors other than aldosterone contribute to fluid retention or conventional assessments of aldosterone levels do not accurately reflect the functional role of aldosterone in maintaining fluid excess.

### Protective effects of nebivolol from oxidative stress to prevent hypertension-related target organ damage [^8e03331f]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion/perspective

Subclinical and clinical organ damage in the cardiovascular (left ventricular hypertrophy, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, coronary events, increased arterial stiffness and atherosclerotic changes), renal (proteinuria and renal failure) and cerebrovascular systems remain the major cause of death among patients with hypertension. Hence, appropriate management of high blood pressure is crucial to reduce mortality and morbidity in such patients. The heterogeneous nature of the underlying mechanisms for hypertension and the availability of more than 75 drugs in nine different pharmacologic groups add to the complexity in its management. It is important to understand various genetic (gender, ethnicity, race) factors, environmental factors, and the role of the renal artery stenosis/adrenergic system, salt/water retention, arterial stiffness, presence of TOD in the development of effective drug therapy for hypertensive patients. Nebivolol is a promising antihypertensive drug and demonstrates strong antioxidative properties due to its NO-releasing capabilities. It has shown considerable efficacy and safety in reducing blood pressure and preventing organ damage, and its role as an effective disease modifying agent in elderly heart failure patients irrespective of left ventricular ejection fraction, making it an attractive option in the treatment of high-risk hypertension. Its complete therapeutic profile needs to be further evaluated including its protective effects on TOD and death in large outcome-based clinical trials. Additional randomized controlled trials comparing effects of nebivolol with other commonly used antihypertensive drugs on TOD and death are also warranted. Results from such clinical studies will immensely help in designing therapeutic strategies for the management of hypertension and in the prevention of associated TOD and death in hypertensive patients.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients with asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department [^5bb7d0da]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department — guideline statements — emphasize limited need for emergency therapy without target organ damage but provide mixed direction on immediate treatment. JNC VI stated, "Elevated blood pressure alone, in the absence of symptoms or new or progressive target organ damage, rarely requires emergency therapy". JNC 7 recommendations state that "marked elevations of blood pressure without target organ damage "usually do not require hospitalization, but should receive immediate combination oral antihypertensive therapy". This statement appears to be consensus in origin because no supportive references were cited, and the authors noted, "We could find no evidence demonstrating improved patient outcomes or decreased mortality or morbidity with acute management of elevated blood pressure in the ED".

### Masked hypertension and target organ damage in treated hypertensive patients [^b04816d1]. American Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Recent studies have shown that an elevated ambulatory or home blood pressure (BP) in the absence of office BP-a phenomenon called masked hypertension-is associated with poor cardiovascular prognosis. However, it remains to be elucidated how masked hypertension modifies target organ damage in treated hypertensive patients.

Methods

A total of 332 outpatients with chronically treated essential hypertension were enrolled in the present study. Patients were classified into four groups according to office (< 140/90 or ≥ 140/90 mm Hg) and daytime ambulatory (< 135/85 or ≥ 135/85 mm Hg) BP levels; ie, controlled hypertension (low office and ambulatory BP), white-coat hypertension (high office but low ambulatory BP), masked hypertension (low office but high ambulatory BP), and sustained hypertension (high office and ambulatory BP). Left ventricular mass index, carotid maximal intima-media thickness, and urinary albumin levels were determined in all subjects.

Results

Of the patients, 51 (15%), 65 (20%), 74 (22%), and 142 (43%) were identified as having controlled hypertension, white-coat hypertension, masked hypertension, and sustained hypertension, respectively. Left ventricular mass index, maximal intima-media thickness, and urinary albumin level in masked hypertension were significantly higher than in controlled hypertension and white-coat hypertension, and were similar to those in sustained hypertension. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that the presence of masked hypertension was one of the independent determinants of left ventricular hypertrophy, carotid atherosclerosis, and albuminuria.

Conclusions

Our findings indicate that masked hypertension is associated with advanced target organ damage in treated hypertensive patients, comparable to that in cases of sustained hypertension.

### The measurement of adult blood pressure and management of hypertension before elective surgery: joint guidelines from the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland and the British hypertension society [^99c0b104]. Anaesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

The association of hypertension with cardiovascular disease is established, but there is no clear evidence that patients with stage 1 or 2 hypertension (Table 1) without evidence of target organ damage have increased peri‐operative cardiovascular risk 14. Patients with stage 3 or 4 hypertension, who are more likely to have target organ damage, have not been subjected to rigorous randomised controlled trials of peri‐operative interventions. There is evidence that hypertension with target organ damage is associated with a small increased incidence of peri‐operative major adverse cardiovascular events 4. It is not known whether or not reducing blood pressure in these patients during a postponement of planned surgery would reduce this rate of events; there is sparse evidence to guide a decision. Any decision should take into account factors other than blood pressure, namely: age; comorbidity; functional capacity (i.e. functional status and reserve); and the urgency and indication for surgery (see section below, 'The treatment of cardiovascular risk, not hypertension'). The latest guidelines published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), in conjunction with the British Hypertension Society, recognise the importance of target organ damage in the management of hypertension by targeting a lower threshold for further medical intervention 1. Whether or not these thresholds and targets should be rigorously applied in the peri‐operative setting is not clear.

Clinical Applications of–Theragnostic Implications

The degree of hypertension is a well‐established predictor of target‐organ damage and a determinant of prognosis. However, until recently, very limited data were available on the prognostic impact of BPV. Data available from various studies and meta‐analyses have shown that BPV is an independent risk factor (even after adjusting for the increased risk attributable to the elevation of mean BP levels) for cardiovascular events, a decline in renal function, subclinical brain small‐vessel disease, dementia, and end‐organ damage.,

The exact underlying mechanism responsible for target‐organ damage due to BPV is not known. However, the literature suggests that the adverse effects of increased BPV can be related to a traumatic effect of wider BP swings on the vessel wall integrity, causing microcirculation dysfunction and eventually leading to target‐organ damage. While the use of BPV as a clinical tool to predict outcomes has been used effectively in patients with hypertension, the application of such a prognostic tool in patients with heart failure requires an entirely different data set to understand the outcome and potentially inform more tailored treatment.

A number of animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of BPV on end‐organ damage. For instance, in a Wistar rat model with chronic kidney disease, the increased BPV was induced by sino‐aortic denervation and was associated with a higher level of glomerulosclerosis and cardiac and renal hypertrophy. In another rat model‐based (spontaneously hypertensive rats) study, discontinuous treatment with valsartan induced a significant increase in day‐to‐day BPV, short‐term BPV, diastolic BPV, and increase in pulse wave velocity despite a similar decrease in SBP and no changes in elastin/collagen ratio or aortic thickness, as compared with continuous treatment with valsartan. This study highlights the potential role of BPV independent of SBP in the development of aortic stiffness.

### Clinical trial design principles and outcomes definitions for device-based therapies for hypertension: a consensus document from the hypertension academic research consortium [^1ad6939b]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite its recognition as the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, the awareness, treatment, and control of blood pressure (BP) have plateaued if not modestly declined. In the United States alone, for example, more than half of individuals with hypertension — representing > 29 million people — are estimated to have BP exceeding professional society and guideline-recommended treatment goals. As the most commonly diagnosed condition and largest contributor to mortality in industrialized countries, hypertension is present in > 1 in 3 individuals, and the risk of cardiovascular mortality doubles for every 20 mm Hg and 10 mm Hg increase in the systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), respectively. With population growth and aging, the global prevalence of hypertension and associated adverse outcomes are expected to continue to escalate.

Irrespective of baseline hypertension severity, even moderate reductions in BP translate into clinically meaningful reductions in cardiac, renal, and cerebral vascular-related adverse events. Recent large randomized clinical trials have also demonstrated the clinical benefits of more intensive BP reduction, leading to revision of guideline-directed treatment goals to further lower SBP and DBP standards. Countering evidence-based efforts to improve BP with a broad spectrum of pharmaceutical therapies are routine challenges in clinical practice that include patient intolerance of medication-related adverse effects, general nonadherence with prescribed therapy, and physician inertia for treatment of an illness that remains largely silent until onset of clinically irreversible conditions.

### Residual cardiovascular risk in individuals on blood pressure-lowering treatment [^c8bff1ce]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical Implications

Our observations of increased CVD risk and subclinical disease burden in treated hypertensives (compared with untreated participants with similar BP) support the concept that the intake of antihypertensive medication is a marker for the chronicity and severity of elevated BP and for greater subclinical disease burden. It is conceivable that physicians treat patients with antihypertensive medication if patients have higher BP levels more frequently and over a longer period of time. Consequently, even though antihypertensive medications significantly lower BP and improve clinical outcome, treated individuals are still at higher CVD risk compared with untreated persons with similar usual BP levels. These observations suggest that those on BP‐lowering medication should be monitored closely for target organ damage and potential symptoms of overt CVD, even if their BP levels reach normal or high‐normal values. Given the well‐documented burden of hypertension with significant deficits in the awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension in the Unites States, 22 these data underscore the need for better screening strategies for hypertension in the community to improve the rates of early detection and subsequent treatment and control of hypertension. Finally, our analyses emphasize the importance of primary prevention of hypertension because the CVD risk cannot be entirely eliminated by medications once hypertension has developed.

Strengths and Limitations

The large sample size, the community‐based design, the careful assessment of BP and clinical covariates, the broad panel of subclinical disease traits, and the prospective design with up to 14 years of follow‐up for incident CVD strengthen our investigation. Some limitations merit consideration. We focused our BP group classification on the mean of 2 BP measurements at 1 examination cycle (examination cycle 6). This examination cycle was chosen because it offered the broadest and most comprehensive spectrum of subclinical disease measures and because using it as the baseline examination ensured a sufficiently long follow‐up period for incident CVD analyses (follow‐up of up to 14 years, 449 events). Nevertheless, classification based on BP measurement and treatment information from a single examination cycle might have led to some nondifferential misclassification, biasing us toward the null hypothesis of no association between higher BP group and disease outcome. Our sample was middle‐aged and of European American descent. It is unknown whether our results are applicable to nonwhite ethnicities and other age groups.

### 'Essential'arterial hypertension: time for a paradigm change [^be6a01af]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Essential hypertension is a life-sentence

Labelling a patient as affected by essential hypertension is not without serious consequences, because this is a chronic condition that, albeit treatable, is by definition incurable, since its cause(s) and underlying mechanisms are unknown. In the best scenario, following current guidelines, the patient diagnosed with essential hypertension will be instructed to implement lifestyle changes and will be prescribed antihypertensive medications, both of which measures should last life-long. Moreover, the need for antihypertensive medications usually increases over time, along with the development of organ damage. More often, the patient will only receive drug prescription which, while controlling the high BP values only in a proportion of the cases, will not eliminate the excess cardiovascular risk associated with persistently high BP in many patients, leaving them with a 'residual risk'. Over time, several patients requiring an escalating dose of a single agent and/or more antihypertensive agents will experience side effects with the treatment. These two facts are known to negatively impact on patient's adherence to long-term treatment and contribute, along with other factors, to the disappointing control rate of high BP worldwide.

On the contrary, identification of secondary hypertension, and institution of treatment targeting the underlying cause, will permit to achieve cure of high BP and/or a decreased need for medications in most of the cases. Therefore, the arguments to encourage doctors to undertake all the efforts that are necessary to identify a curable cause of hypertension are strong.

Further Unmet Needs and Future Directions in Hypertension Therapy

siRNA therapeutics have the potential to meet a hitherto largely unmet need in relation to adherence in patients with hypertension. However, current data on safety and efficacy for zilebesiran, the first‐in‐class angiotensinogen‐targeting siRNA therapy, are restricted to well‐defined populations from small clinical trials, and will require further evaluation. It can be expected that the results from an on‐going component of the zilebesiran phase I studies (Part D: in patients who are obese) and recently started phase II studies (KARDIA‐1 and 2), will be informative. For licensing, we will also need to know how the drug performs in higher‐risk subpopulations with hypertension such as those with chronic kidney disease, diabetes, heart failure, and obesity, and in the elderly. In addition, its value as an add‐on therapy in those with uncontrolled hypertension or treatment‐resistant hypertension is yet to be established. Furthermore, with their ability to specifically target key proteins, siRNA therapeutics have the potential to knockdown other important nonhepatic mediators in hypertension, such as renin and endothelin. However, challenges in delivery currently limit the use of siRNA therapies for nonliver targets in hypertension.

Other important unmet needs in hypertension include effective treatments to minimize/prevent cardiovascular events and target organ damage associated with hypertension, thereby improving morbidity and mortality. Here, emerging therapies, such as SGLT2 inhibitors and angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitors, could potentially offer solutions. Treatment‐resistant hypertension, affecting nearly 10% of patients with hypertension, is another priority challenge because of its higher likelihood of adverse outcomes.

In summary, siRNA‐based therapeutic approaches have substantial potential to address treatment adherence, one of the major unmet needs in antihypertensive therapy. Emerging evidence from larger ongoing trials and long‐term follow‐up studies will help us understand whether siRNA therapy offers solutions to other unmet needs in hypertension therapy. Challenges remain, but the valuable study from Uijl et al suggests effective ways to mitigate against hypovolemia and hypotension with angiotensinogen‐targeting siRNA therapy, which will be important to the successful clinical translation of this valuable novel therapeutic approach to hypertension.

### Hypertension and the eye: changing perspectives [^ace03098]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Systemic hypertension is a common condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Hypertension confers cardiovascular risk by causing target-organ damage that includes retinopathy in addition to heart disease, stroke, renal insufficiency and peripheral vascular disease. The recognition of hypertensive retinopathy is important in cardiovascular risk stratification of hypertensive individuals. This review reevaluates the changing perspectives in the pathophysiology, classification and prognostic significance of fundal lesions in hypertensives.

### Targeting inflammation in hypertension [^40ca0244]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Revealing immune mechanisms in the pathophysiology of hypertension has clearly expanded its already multifactorial etiology. A precise characterization of the underlying immune mechanisms may create new possibilities to treat hypertension causally. Lowering arterial pressure will undoubtedly remain an important target of the therapy, but improved understanding of immune mechanisms shifted the accent from a simply pressure related cause of hypertension to a mechanistic insight into causes of related organ damage. First experimental and clinical intervention studies clearly point to the fact that targeting the immune system in hypertension may have beneficial outcomes on various organ systems independent of lowering arterial pressure. The clinical studies also suggest that attempts of immunosuppression or immunomodulation with a single target may not be sufficient and may even be detrimental. Therefore, further unraveling inflammatory markers and their interactions in immune networks is crucial for more efficient immunomodulation of hypertensive disease.

### Familial clustering of hypertensive target organ damage in the community [^5a040046]. Journal of Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Prior studies suggest that hypertensive target organ damage (TOD) is a heritable trait. However, the risk that parental TOD confers on propensity for TOD in their offspring, and how hypertensive TOD clusters in the context of parental versus offspring hypertension status remain unclear.

Methods

We studied 3238 Framingham Heart Study participants (mean age 39 ± 8 years, 53% women) with available parental data on TOD. Parents and offspring underwent measurements for left ventricular hypertrophy, increased relative wall thickness, albuminuria and conventional risk factors.

Results

Prevalence of any TOD (left ventricular hypertrophy or albuminuria) in participants with zero and at least one parents with any TOD was 7 and 13%, respectively (P < 0.001 for difference). Having at least one parent with TOD was associated with greater odds of TOD in offspring than individuals without parental TOD [multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.65; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.27–2.14]. Similarly, parental left ventricular hypertrophy was associated with offspring left ventricular hypertrophy (OR, 2.73; 95% CI 1.92–3.89), parental increased relative wall thickness conferred increased odds of increased relative wall thickness in the offspring (OR, 1.54; 95% CI 1.16–2.04) and parental albuminuria was related to offspring albuminuria (OR, 1.49; 95% CI 1.03–2.16). These associations remained significant upon adjustment for other risk factors, including blood pressure, and in analyses of subgroups defined according to parental or offspring hypertension status.

Conclusion

Overall, our data suggest that familial clustering of TOD in the community is independent of blood pressure. Additional studies are warranted to confirm our observations.

### Renin inhibition: should it supplant ACE inhibitors and ARBS in high risk patients? [^8cd5a5a9]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The direct renin inhibitor aliskiren has recently been approved for the treatment of hypertension in humans. The potential for these newer agents having an advantage over the existing renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonists in the treatment of hypertension and related target organ damage has drawn the interest of several investigators. In this review, we discuss the potential advantages and disadvantages of this newest antihypertensive class over other available RAAS antagonists.

Recent Findings

The antihypertensive efficacy of aliskiren monotherapy has been compared with that of other RAAS antagonists and combinations of aliskiren with these agents. These studies have shown that aliskiren is equally effective as angiotensin receptor blockers and may be slightly more effective than angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in lowering blood pressure. In contrast to the other RAAS antagonists, aliskiren shuts down the entire downstream RAAS cascade. This results in greatly increased plasma renin concentration due to removal of angiotensin II-mediated feedback inhibition of renin release, which has raised concerns about whether direct renin inhibition adds anything to inhibition of downstream components of the RAAS cascade.

Summary

The potential advantages and disadvantages of aliskiren therapy versus existing RAAS antagonists in treating hypertension and target organ damage are under investigation.

### High prevalence of cardiac and extracardiac target organ damage in refractory hypertension [^168098ba]. Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Target organ damage (TOD) in chronically treated hypertensives is related to effective blood pressure (BP) control. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of cardiac and extracardiac TOD in patients with refractory hypertension (RH) compared with well-controlled treated hypertensives (C).

Methods

Fifty-four consecutive patients with RH (57 ± 10 years), selected according to WHO/ISH guidelines definition, and 51 essential hypertensives (55 ± 10 years) with satisfactory BP control obtained by association therapy, underwent the following procedures: (1) clinic BP measurement; (2) blood sampling for routine chemistry examinations; (3) 24 h urine collection for microalbuminuria; (4) non-mydriatic retinography; (5) echocardiogram; (6) carotid ultrasonogram. In order to exclude 'office resistance' (defined as clinic BP > 140/90 mmHg and average 24 h BP ≤ 125/79 mmHg), all patients with RH were subjected to 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring.

Results

Both groups were similar for age, gender, body surface area, smoking habit and duration of hypertension, glucose, creatinine and lipid levels. By definition, clinic BP was significantly higher in RH than C (161 ± 19/96 ± 9 versus 127 ± 6/80 ± 5 mmHg, respectively, P < 0.01). The increased prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and carotid intima-media (IM) thickening (40 versus 12%, P < 0.01, according to a non-gender-specific partition value of 125 g/m2; and 36 versus 14%, P < 0.01, according to IM thickness ≥ 1.0 mm, respectively); a higher prevalence of carotid plaques (65 versus 32%, P < 0.05), a more advanced retinal involvement (grade II and III, 73 and 5% versus 38 and 0%, P < 0.01) and a greater albumin urinary excretion (22 ± 32 mg/24 h versus 11 ± 13 mg/24 h, P < 0.01) were found in RH compared to C.

Conclusions

Our study suggests that RH is a clinical condition associated with a high prevalence of TOD at cardiac, macro- and microvascular level and consequently with high absolute cardiovascular risk, which needs a particularly intensive therapeutic approach aimed to normalize BP levels and to induce TOD regression.

### Association of morning hypertension subtype with vascular target organ damage and central hemodynamics [^b68b4459]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

During the past decade, mounting evidence has indicated that ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring (ABPM) provides various details on BP profiles, including the average 24‐hour BP, daytime and nighttime BP, and circadian variability, which is superior to clinical BP for the diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of hypertensive individuals. 1, 2, 3, 4 As such, current guidelines recommend the use of ABPM in routine clinical practice. 5

Recent studies have demonstrated that morning hypertension is associated with target organ damage and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertension. 6, 7, 8, 9 The Japan Morning Surge Home Blood Pressure (J‐HOP) study reported that morning systolic BP (SBP) was closely related to subclinical target organ damage indicators, such as urine albumin/creatinine ratio and pulse wave velocity (PWV). 7 In the Home Blood Pressure Measurement With Olmesartan Naive Patients to Establish Standard Target Blood Pressure (HONEST) registry, in a cohort of 21 591 patients with essential hypertension, morning hypertension (morning home BP ≥ 145 mm Hg) was associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, even among patients with well‐controlled clinical BP. 8, 9

Patients with morning hypertension could be categorized as either those with nocturnal hypertension who have sustained hypertension upon awakening or those without nocturnal hypertension who have morning hypertension upon awakening. Previous studies have shown that both nocturnal hypertension and early morning BP surge are associated with a higher risk of target organ damage and cardiovascular disease (CVD). 6, 8 However, it is unclear whether morning hypertension associated with sustained nocturnal hypertension and that associated with morning BP surge differ in terms of their effects on cardiovascular target organ damage and clinical outcomes. In the present study, we aimed to determine the association of morning hypertension with or without nocturnal hypertension with vascular target organ damage and central hemodynamics in a prospective cohort of patients at high risk for CVD.

### Blood pressure pattern and target organ damage in patients with chronic kidney disease [^153799b7]. Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

In patients with chronic kidney disease, data on blood pressure (BP) pattern and its association with target organ damage, which indicates elevated cardiovascular risk, are sparse. In 305 treated hypertensive chronic kidney disease patients, we assessed BP pattern, left ventricular mass (magnetic resonance imaging), intima-media thickness (ultrasound), 24-hour-pulse wave velocity and 24-hour-central augmentation index (Mobil-O-Graph). Controlled hypertension (normal office and ambulatory BP) was found in 41% and sustained uncontrolled hypertension (elevated office and ambulatory BP) in 30% of patients. Misclassification of BP status occurred in 29%: white coat uncontrolled hypertension (elevated office but normal ambulatory BP) was detected in 11% and masked uncontrolled hypertension (normal office but elevated ambulatory BP) in 18% of patients. Left ventricular mass was increased in white coat uncontrolled hypertension (+11.2 g), masked uncontrolled hypertension (+9.4 g), and sustained uncontrolled hypertension (+16.6 g) compared with controlled hypertension. Intima-media thickness was similar across all 4 BP groups. Twenty-four hour-pulse wave velocity and 24-hour-central augmentation index were increased in masked uncontrolled hypertension (+0.5 m/sec and +2.5%) and sustained uncontrolled hypertension (+0.5 m/sec and +2.9%) compared with controlled hypertension. In conclusion, based on office BP measurements, misclassification of true BP status occurred in almost one-third of chronic kidney disease patients. Both types of misclassification (white coat uncontrolled hypertension and masked uncontrolled hypertension) were associated with parameters of target organ damage. Ambulatory BP monitoring should be used routinely to identify chronic kidney disease patients at high cardiovascular risk.

CVD Risk Assessment

CVD risk assessment identifies individuals at increased risk for the major complications of hypertension, including target organ damage and death. Both guidelines recommend CVD risk assessment as a complement to the level of BP for antihypertensive treatment decisions, with the ESC/ESH guideline also emphasizing the importance of CVD risk prediction for consideration of concomitant interventions such as statin and antiplatelet therapies. The 2 guidelines differ in their methods for estimation of risk, and as outlined later, their use of the risk information in decision-making for antihypertensive drug treatment. The ACC/AHA prescribes a relatively simple approach in which the presence of CVD automatically indicates high risk (Table 5). In the absence of CVD, ASCVD risk in adults 40 to 79 years of age is estimated using the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations, which have been validated in White and Black US adults. The ACC/AHA ASCVD Risk Estimator Plusis based on age; levels of SBP, DBP; total, high-density, and low-density cholesterol; history of DM; current smoking; and treatment with antihypertensive drug therapy, statins, or aspirin. The ACC/AHA Guideline Writing Committee estimated a 10-year ASCVD risk of ≈10% in the landmark event–based antihypertensive drug treatment trials, leading to the choice of a higher and lower 10-year ASCVD risk of ≥ 10% and < 10%, respectively. Hypertension in adults with DM, CKD, or age of ≥ 65 years is accepted as a surrogate disease marker for higher ASCVD risk. For adults < 40 years of age, the ACC/AHA recommends estimation of lifetime CVD risk. The ESC/ESH uses 4 categories of CVD risk (Figure 1). Adults with existing CVD, including asymptomatic atheromatous disease on imaging, type 1 or 2 DM, very high levels of individual CVD risk factors, or CKD are considered to be at high or very high risk (10-year CVD mortality of 5%–10% and ≥ 10%, respectively). For all others, 10-year CVD mortality risk should be estimated using the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) risk estimator. The SCORE risk is estimated using a patient's age, sex, total cholesterol or total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking status, and level of SBP. Although not included in SCORE, the ESC/ESH guidelines recommend that heart rate should also be recorded during BP measurements (Table 1–3) and a resting heart rate > 80 beats/min should be considered as a cardiovascular risk factor. Validated SCORE risk charts are available for both high-risk and low-risk European countries and 15 national or regional SCORE risk charts are also available. The ESC/ESH places emphasis on the importance of considering HMOD in the assessment of CVD risk. Comorbidities such as CKD, left ventricular hypertrophy, and DM are included in the SCORE risk assessment tool (Table 5). The guideline also includes a table of SCORE risk calculation correction factors according to ethnicity. Last, the ESC/ESH guideline uses a classification system based on levels of BP, categories of HMOD, other CVD risk factors, and/or CVD, to illustrate the amplification of risk when risk factors aggregate. Both the ESC/ESH and ACC/AHA guidelines recognize challenges with the use and interpretation of CVD/ASCVD risk-estimating tools.

### Impact of target organ damage assessment in the evaluation of global risk in patients with essential hypertension [^beaf8931]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Accurate assessment of cardiovascular risk is a key step toward optimizing the treatment of hypertensive patients. We analyzed the impact and cost-effectiveness of routine, thorough assessment of target organ damage (TOD) in evaluating risk profile in hypertension. A total of 380 never-treated patients with essential hypertension underwent routine work-up plus evaluation of albuminuria and ultrasonography of cardiac and vascular structures. The impact of these tests on risk stratification, as indicated by European Society of Hypertension-European Society of Cardiology guidelines, was assessed in light of their cost and sensitivity. The combined use of all of these tests greatly improved the detection of TOD, therefore leading to the identification of a higher percentage of patients who were at high/very high risk, as compared with those who were detected by routine clinical work-up (73% instead of 42%; P < 0.0001). Different signs of TOD only partly cluster within the same subgroup of patients; thus, all three tests should be performed to maximize the sensitivity of the evaluation process. The diagnostic algorithm yielding the lowest cost per detected case of TOD is the search for microalbuminuria, followed by echocardiography and then carotid ultrasonography. Adopting lower cut-off values to define microalbuminuria allows us to optimize further the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic algorithms. In conclusion, because of its low cost and widespread availability, measuring albuminuria is an attractive and cost-effective screening test that is especially suitable as the first step in the large-scale diagnostic work-up of hypertensive patients.

Blood pressure (BP) control should be confirmed by standardized BP measurements over at least several weeks before donation, and candidates should be informed that donation may accelerate the rise in BP and the need for antihypertensive treatment, that uncontrolled hypertension may cause target organ damage to the remaining kidney, and should be counseled on maintaining a healthy lifestyle and BP control before and after donation.

### Hypertensive target organ damage and the risk for vascular events and all-cause mortality in patients with vascular disease [^0ed2d954]. Journal of Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Presence of hypertensive target organ damage is related to increased vascular risk and mortality. Whether combined presence of hypertensive target organ damage confers higher vascular risk compared to single presence is unknown. This study evaluates the separate and combined effects of impaired renal function [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≤ 60ml/min per 1.73m], albuminuria (albumin/creatinine-ratio men ≥ 2.5mg/mmol, women ≥ 3.5mg/mmol) and left-ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (Sokolow-Lyon and/or Cornell-voltage criterion) on the occurrence of vascular events and mortality in patients with vascular disease (coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease).

Methods and Results

A cohort of patients with vascular diseases (n = 4319) was followed (median 4.4 years) for the occurrence of vascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, vascular death) and mortality. LVH was present in 11%, impaired renal function in 15%, and albuminuria in 18%. Presence of at least two hypertensive target organ damage was prevalent in 8%. The risk for vascular events was hazard ratio 1.5 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2–1.9] for presence of one hypertensive target organ damage and hazard ratio 3.8 (95% CI 2.3–6.3) for three manifestations of hypertensive target organ damage (adjusted for age, sex). For mortality this was hazard ratio 1.4 (95% CI 1.1–1.7) and hazard ratio 3.2 (95% CI 1.9–5.2). Hazard ratios for single presence of different types of organ damage were comparable and independent of the presence of hypertension.

Conclusions

Impaired renal function, albuminuria, and LVH are prevalent in patients with vascular disease and confer independent and additive risk for vascular events and mortality. Measurement of hypertensive target organ damage in patients with vascular disease identifies patients at very high risk and may have treatment implications.

### The hidden role of left atrial strain: insights into end-organ damage in dipper and nondipper hypertension [^eff29d2c]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our study, the results showed that the non-dipper hypertension group exhibited significantly higher rates of hypertensive heart disease and nephropathy compared to the dipper hypertension and control groups. Additionally, this group demonstrated significantly lower left atrial strain values, further reflecting impaired atrial mechanics. Left atrial parameters, especially LASr, which was significantly associated with both hypertensive heart disease and hypertensive nephropathy, were identified as strongly associated with target organ damage.

Clinical significance of hypertension and end-organ damage

Hypertension remains a significant global health concern, contributing substantially to morbidity and mortality while imposing a considerable burden on healthcare systems in both developed and developing countries. Non-dipper hypertension, characterized by inadequate nocturnal blood pressure reduction, is associated with a heightened risk of end-organ damage and worsened clinical outcomes. In our study, the higher prevalence of hypertensive heart disease in the non-dipper hypertension group underscores the substantial chronic pressure load and hemodynamic stress on the heart in this patient population. Similarly, the markedly increased prevalence of hypertensive nephropathy in non-dipper hypertension highlights the necessity of vigilant renal function monitoring in these patients. Multiple studies have established a strong association between non-dipper hypertension and end-organ damage, emphasizing the accelerated progression of irreversible injury in target organs when nocturnal blood pressure remains uncontrolled. Kario et al. demonstrated that elevated nocturnal systolic blood pressure load is linked to myocardial fibrosis, renal microvascular injury, and an increased risk of stroke. These findings underscore the importance of targeting nocturnal blood pressure control as a critical therapeutic goal in this subgroup. These findings highlight the need for specific biomarkers, such as left atrial parameters, to better understand the cardiovascular and renal consequences of non-dipper hypertension.

Impact of hypertension on left atrial volume and physiomechanics

Hypertension exerts its deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system not only through elevated arterial pressure but also via hemodynamic changes affecting cardiac chambers, particularly the left atrium. Our study demonstrates the adverse effects of hypertension on left atrial volume and physiomechanics, supporting this evidence. While Nagueh et al. highlighted the utility of left atrial parameters in detecting diastolic dysfunction, our study demonstrates their association with both cardiac and renal dysfunction. These findings underscore the importance of assessing left atrial functions not only as indicators of cardiac dysfunction but also as potential biomarkers for hypertension management.

### Isolated diastolic hypertension and target organ damage: findings from the STANISLAS cohort [^2947bcf4]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Subtle damage to certain organs can be detected in hypertensive patients early in the disease and can occur years before overt clinical events occur. Evaluation of markers of target organ damage constitute an easy to assess, early and reliable surrogate of hypertension‐related clinical events. In fact, it has been shown that target organ damage have an independent prognostic significance and strongly increases cardiovascular risk, irrespectively of the involved structure (heart, kidney, brain, or vessels). Wei et al.explored the association of target organ damage with 24‐h systolic and diastolic BP levels and ambulatory hypertension subtypes in a large cohort of untreated Chinese patients. They found that 24‐h SBP and mixed hypertension were the major determinants of target organ damage and its severity irrespective of age and target organ, whereas 24‐h diastolic BP and IDH only related to the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio below middle age. Another study by Lin et al.investigated the impact of ambulatory ISH, SDH and IDH (cut‐off for systolic BP ≥ 140 mmHg and diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg) on target organ damage in a population of 171 subjects, showing that IDH had only a marginal effect in determining target organ damage when compared to ISH and mixed hypertension. In a large metanalysis that involved 2485 patients with and without hypertension, SBP was more closely associated with target organ damage (LV mass index, cIMT, PWV, and urinary protein excretion) compared to diastolic BP. In a study conducted in 972 hypertensive patients at high cardiovascular risk, systolic BP was showed to be linearly associated with ABI, while diastolic BP was not. In line, Powell et al.showed a strong association between ISH and SDH and incident symptomatic peripheral artery disease in middle‐aged and older American women, whereas IDH was not associated with an increased risk. Finally, in a previous analysis of STANISLAS cohort, Ferreira et al.showed a linear positive association between systolic BP increase and cIMT thickness, meanwhile the association with diastolic BP was weaker and not significant.

### Patients with resistant hypertension have more peripheral arterial disease than other uncontrolled hypertensives [^05aced19]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether resistant hypertension differs from uncontrolled and controlled hypertension in terms of target organ damage. Hypertensive subjects with antihypertensive medication (n = 385) were identified in a population survey conducted in southwestern Finland. None of the study subjects had previously diagnosed cardiovascular or renal disease or diabetes. Ankle-brachial index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, electrocardiogram-determined left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiometabolic risk factors were assessed. The prevalence of peripheral arterial disease among subjects with resistant, uncontrolled and controlled hypertension was 6/37 (16%), 22/275 (8%) and 0/73 (0%), respectively (P = 0.006). There were no differences in the prevalence of renal insufficiency, left ventricular hypertrophy or metabolic parameters between the groups. Resistant hypertension affects vasculature more than uncontrolled hypertension, and thus it can be regarded as a marker of more severe disease.

### Protective effects of nebivolol from oxidative stress to prevent hypertension-related target organ damage [^adc5389c]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertension is one of the leading risk factors for morbidity and mortality in patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and renal impairment. It also leads to target organ damage (TOD), which worsens organ function and the patient's clinical status. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidative stress may contribute significantly to TOD in patients with hypertension. NO (nitric oxide) is a paracrine factor derived from endothelial cells that has been shown to alleviate ROS-mediated oxidative damage. Nebivolol is a third-generation β-blocker with vasodilator activity, both actions contributing to decreased blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Its vasodilatory function is mediated by the endothelial-arginine NO pathway. Nebivolol increases the bioavailability of NO in the vasculature. Its efficacy and safety profile is comparable to other commonly used antihypertensive agents. In this article, we review the current literature to understand TOD secondary to oxidative stress in patients with hypertension and the role of nebivolol in its prevention. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which nebivolol reduces ROS-mediated TOD will not only help in the development of targeted therapies but may also improve health outcomes in hypertensive patients.

EUROPEAN SOCIETY OF HYPERTENSION GUIDELINES

Historically, essential hypertension represents one of the first clinical conditions for which diagnostic and therapeutic clinical guidelines have been developed. The first official guideline paper dates back to 1977 when the Joint National Committee in the United States released the document, which was revised few years later in a new paper jointly issued by an 'ad hoc' Committee of the WHO in conjunction with the International Society of Hypertension (ISH). During the last decade of the XX century, updated versions of the guidelines document have been prepared by the previously mentioned organizations in collaboration with American scientific societies. The first guideline document prepared by European Societies dates back to 2003, when the ESH together with the European Society of Cardiology jointly signed the European guidelines document. New guidelines followed in 2007, 2013 and 2018, the latter being as previously mentioned, the most frequently cited paper in the worldwide medical literature. The new guidelines document, released during the 32nd European Meeting on Hypertension held in Milan in 2023 and published in the Journal of Hypertension, represents the most updated document on the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension.

Although an in-depth analysis of the guidelines is beyond the scope of this article, it should be mentioned that the 2023 guidelines document addresses a number of critical issues in the field of hypertension diagnosis and treatment, also offering to the readers elements of novelties. These include, for example, the thresholds and targets of the blood pressure-lowering intervention, the relevance of out-of-office blood pressure measurements, the modern quantification of cardiovascular risk, the greater use of organ damage measures, the upgrading of beta-blocking drugs to the level of major antihypertensive agents and the wider choice of drug combination between major drugs, with confirmation of their strategic role as first-line and subsequent treatment in the majority of patients. Finally, emphasis has been given to the treatment strategies based on renal denervation, particularly but not exclusively in drug-resistant hypertension, and to the patient's follow-up modalities, including the careful assessment of nonadherence as a fundamental barrier to the long-term blood pressure control.

Finally, given the importance of primary care providers in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the hypertensive state, ESH has decided to provide a novel concise format of the guidelines, the so called '2024 Clinical Practice Guidelines', for implementation into current clinical practice. The four pillars of these practice guidelines include the accurate diagnostic approach, the assessment of the patient's cardiovascular risk profile, the careful selection of the treatment strategy and the long-term evaluation of the blood pressure response.

### Renal function and target organ damage in hypertension [^6254d058]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is frequently observed in patients with arterial hypertension. The same factors that promote the appearance and progression of atherosclerosis can also promote the development of CKD. Two parameters are usually measured to estimate alterations in renal function, the presence of albuminuria, and the estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Microalbuminuria and a decreased estimated GFR (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) are both accompanied by a significant increase in cardiovascular (CV) risk. Chronic kidney disease can develop all over the cardiorenal continuum and its presence in hypertensive patients with already developed CV disease contributes to a further increase in the development of events and death. Renal protection will in turn obtain CV protection and the treatment to be used is similar to that employed to prevent or to treat established CV disease.

### Hypertensive target organ damage predicts incident diabetes mellitus [^f20b6a59]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

The presence of either of the two markers of preclinical CVD (n = 1582) increased the chance of incident diabetes by more than 60% [HR = 1.63; (95% CI 1.27–2.08); P < 0.0001], a risk that remained similar in the presence of both markers [n = 551; HR = 1.64; (95% CI 1.19–2.23); P = 0.002], and was independent of initial higher systolic BP [HR = 1.05/5 mmHg; (95% CI 1.02–1.11); P = 0.001], greater BMI [HR = 1.05/kg/m; (95% CI 1.02–1.08)], higher fasting glucose [HR = 1.08/mg/dL; (95% CI 1.07–1.09)], family history of diabetes [HR = 1.59; (95% CI 1.29–1.96); all P < 0.0001], and type and number of anti-hypertensive medications (not significant).

### Clustering of target organ damage increases mortality after acute coronary syndromes in patients with arterial hypertension [^271f6ea6]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

The impact of target organ damage (TOD) clustering in hypertensive patients with established cardiovascular disease has not been clearly defined. Multicentre, observational and prospective study of 1054 consecutive patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACSs). The objective was describing the impact of TOD on first-year mortality. Ankle-brachial index (ABI), left ventricular hypertrophy and renal dysfunction were assessed during hospital stay. Hypertensive patients accounted for 80% of the cohort and had slightly higher mean age, higher prevalence of risk factors, previous cardiovascular disease and TOD. During follow-up, mean time 387.9 (7.2) days and median 382 (364.0–430.0) days, mortality rate tended to be higher in hypertensive patients (6.1 versus 3.5%; P = 0.16). Cox regression survival analysis identified pathological ABI as the only TOD independently associated with mortality. When assessed globally, the presence of at least one TOD predicted mortality only in patients with hypertension and differences in mortality rate appeared very early in the follow-up. A linear increase in mortality rate was observed with the clustering of TOD: 2.0%, if no TOD was present, 7.6% in one TOD, 11.1% in two TODs and 20.0%, if three TODs were present. An increased risk in the combined end point of ischaemic events was observed in hypertensive patients without TOD (odds ratio (OR): 3.18; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.31–7.70; P = 0.01) and was still higher in patients with hypertension and TOD (OR: 4.61; 95% CI: 1.90–11.80; P < 0.01). TOD predicts mortality and ischaemic events of hypertensive patients after ACS.
