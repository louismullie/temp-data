## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how RAF (particularly BRAF and CRAF) informs cancer diagnosis and treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the RAF family and the RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK pathway. Then, I should classify RAF mutations by frequency and functional class. Next, I will map tumor-type specific implications and testing indications. After that, I need to translate RAF genotypes into diagnostic and prognostic utilities. Finally, I will integrate therapeutic decisions, including resistance and next-generation strategies, and close with a concise, guideline-aligned clinical summary.

> Let me first confirm the biological framework. The RAF family comprises ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF (RAF1), all serine/threonine kinases that integrate RAS signaling to activate MEK and ERK, a lineage-agnostic oncogenic axis implicated across many cancers, which is why RAF status is so clinically consequential for both prognosis and therapy selection [^112yF7YT] [^1151tyUD].

> Wait, let me verify the mutation taxonomy before I overgeneralize. Class 1 BRAF mutations at V600 signal as RAS-independent monomers, class 2 mutants signal as RAS-independent dimers, and class 3 mutants are kinase-impaired but amplify signaling via RAS-dependent CRAF engagement. Importantly, V600E is the most common BRAF mutation overall and the predominant driver in several histologies, though non-V600 alterations are not rare in lung and colorectal cancers, and their clinical implications differ substantially from V600E/K [^112ECiQi] [^115sjLwz] [^1147iDQi].

> Hold on, I should double-check the disease-level prevalence before I draw conclusions. BRAF mutations occur in roughly 50–60% of melanoma, 40–70% of papillary thyroid carcinoma, about 10–12% of colorectal cancer, and 3–5% of non-small cell lung cancer, while RAF1 alterations are less frequent but clinically meaningful in colorectal and other contexts, including a role in RAS-driven tumors and resistance biology [^115sjLwz] [^1151tyUD] [^117K3P9c].

> I will now examine melanoma as the prototypical BRAF-mutant disease. I need to ensure testing scope is precise: in cutaneous melanoma, codon 600 mutations (V600E most common, with V600K and others) predict sensitivity to BRAF and MEK inhibitors, and guidelines mandate BRAF testing with consideration of broader genomic profiling at baseline to inform systemic options. Importantly, BRAF inhibitors should not be used without an activating BRAF mutation, and combination BRAF plus MEK therapy is superior to monotherapy in V600-mutant disease [^1147iDQi] [^114LUarN] [^111M9VE3].

> Let me consider thyroid cancer next, and I should confirm testing urgency. In anaplastic thyroid cancer, expeditious BRAF V600E testing at diagnosis is recommended to enable targeted therapy; in differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma, BRAF V600E associates with aggressive features and is commonly used as a prognostic marker, though it should not be used in isolation for prognosis, and BRAF testing can be adjunctive in thyroid nodule evaluation, particularly when cytology is indeterminate [^116QyCn3] [^1176FBYB] [^115MzzPY].

> Now, colorectal cancer — wait, I initially thought BRAF testing is uniformly predictive for anti-EGFR response, but I should verify that nuance. Guidelines recommend testing KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF in metastatic CRC, and BRAF V600E generally confers poor prognosis and reduced benefit from anti-EGFR therapy unless combined with BRAF-targeted regimens; in MSS disease, BRAF V600E is linked to worse survival, whereas in dMMR/MLH1-deficient tumors, BRAF V600E supports sporadic etiology but does not by itself rule out Lynch syndrome; moreover, combination strategies such as encorafenib plus cetuximab are supported for BRAF V600E–mutant mCRC, whereas monotherapy with BRAF inhibitors is ineffective in this context [^114MuSDs] [^111dwcQ7] [^111HiZnz] [^114y2CDb].

> Next, I should review non-small cell lung cancer, and I need to check that I'm not conflating testing modalities. In NSCLC, BRAF V600 mutations, while uncommon, predict response to BRAF plus MEK inhibitor combinations; guidelines advise DNA-based methods such as real-time PCR or NGS for detection, and caution against relying on immunohistochemistry alone for BRAF V600E without extensive validation in this setting [^116JcXe4].

> Let me think about CNS tumors, because the testing targets differ. In CNS cancers, BRAF V600E and KIAA1549–BRAF fusions are prevalent in select entities and guide both diagnosis and therapy. For example, KIAA1549–BRAF fusions are characteristic of posterior fossa pilocytic astrocytoma, whereas BRAF V600E occurs across multiple CNS histologies and may respond to BRAF inhibition, and sequencing or RNA-based assays are preferred over FISH for fusions given reliability concerns [^111qoQS7] [^1151tyUD].

> I should confirm hematologic implications too. In hairy-cell leukemia, BRAF V600E is present in over 90% of cases and predicts marked responses to vemurafenib, supporting routine testing in that diagnosis and reinforcing BRAF's cross-tissue clinical utility in select hematologic malignancies [^114oVdfs].

> Now, translating genotypes into diagnostic and prognostic action, I need to ensure I align with consensus standards. Tier 1/Level A evidence supports using BRAF V600E to predict response to approved BRAF inhibitors in melanoma and hairy-cell leukemia, and multiple guidelines endorse BRAF testing for therapy selection and prognostic stratification across several tumor types; importantly, molecular pathology now frequently augments or refines morphologic diagnoses, and BRAF results must be interpreted in clinical and histologic context, not in isolation [^notfound] [^111rfdRg] [^111M9VE3].

> Next, I should review therapeutic mapping and be careful about paradoxes. In BRAF V600–mutant melanoma, vemurafenib, dabrafenib, or encorafenib combined with MEK inhibitors (trametinib, cobimetinib, binimetinib) improve outcomes. By contrast, in BRAF V600E–mutant colorectal cancer, BRAF inhibitor monotherapy fails due to feedback dimerization and EGFR-mediated resistance, necessitating encorafenib plus cetuximab with or without chemotherapy. In NSCLC, dabrafenib plus trametinib is the standard for BRAF V600–mutant disease. And in anaplastic thyroid cancer, rapid BRAF/MEK inhibition is now standard and can be combined with immunotherapy in selected patients [^1147iDQi] [^114MuSDs] [^116JcXe4] [^112yFKmP].

> But wait, what about non-V600 BRAF and RAF1 alterations — do they respond similarly. I should double-check the emerging data. Non-V600 BRAF mutants often require MEK inhibition or combinations tailored to dimer-dependent signaling, and some patients with nonstandard BRAF alterations still derive clinical benefit from BRAF/MEK regimens, albeit with generally worse prognosis than V600E/K; RAF1 (CRAF) is increasingly recognized as a key effector in RAS-driven and some colorectal cancers, and RAF1-specific degraders or inhibitors are under exploration to overcome dimerization-mediated resistance [^111DWAMJ] [^115KzrzF] [^117K3P9c].

> I need to ensure I address resistance mechanisms and safety. Acquired resistance commonly involves ERK reactivation via RAS mutations, RTK upregulation, or RAF dimerization, and paradoxical MAPK activation in wild-type RAF contexts explains secondary cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas with first-generation inhibitors. Next-generation RAF inhibitors and rational combinations aim to blunt dimerization and adaptive signaling, and combination BRAF plus MEK therapy reduces but does not eliminate secondary malignancies, underscoring the need for vigilant surveillance and mechanism-informed sequencing [^116XKmiP] [^113CWKaN] [^112T9LYk].

> Let me reconsider testing logistics and pitfalls so I don't overstate any single assay. DNA-based methods such as real-time PCR and NGS are preferred for BRAF V600 detection across solid tumors, whereas IHC for BRAF V600E requires rigorous validation and should not be the sole determinant in NSCLC. For CNS tumors, RNA sequencing or PCR-based fusion assays are superior to FISH for KIAA1549–BRAF detection. And in silico variant interpretation tools have limited specificity and should never be used alone to classify variants, particularly for non-V600 alterations that may still be oncogenic [^116JcXe4] [^111qoQS7] [^113bSzcM].

> To synthesize, I should confirm the clinical throughline. RAF genotyping is now embedded in standard-of-care for melanoma, colorectal cancer, NSCLC, thyroid cancer, and select CNS and hematologic malignancies, serving to refine diagnosis, stratify prognosis, and guide targeted therapy. Testing should be performed on tissue when feasible, with plasma-based assays considered when tissue is inadequate. Results must be interpreted in histologic and clinical context, and when BRAF V600 is present, timely consideration of BRAF plus MEK inhibition is appropriate, while non-V600 or RAF1-driven tumors may require MEK-based or combination strategies informed by dimer biology and evolving clinical data [^1147iDQi] [^111dwcQ7] [^116JcXe4] [^113jgASf].

RAF mutations are key cancer drivers, with **BRAF V600E** the most common and clinically actionable across melanoma, colorectal, thyroid, and lung cancers [^115sjLwz] [^113grnhH]. Routine **BRAF testing** is standard in these malignancies to guide targeted therapy, with **BRAF/MEK inhibitors** improving outcomes in V600E-mutant disease [^1147iDQi] [^116JcXe4] [^114MuSDs] [^116QyCn3] [^113grnhH]. CRAF mutations are less frequent but drive progression and resistance, especially in colorectal cancer, and are emerging therapeutic targets [^117K3P9c] [^1159kEjv]. RAF mutations also inform prognosis and help distinguish sporadic from hereditary tumors, supporting their integration into diagnostic and treatment algorithms [^111rEf1a] [^111HiZnz].

---

## RAF genes and their normal function

The RAF family comprises **three serine/threonine kinases** — ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF (RAF1) — that transmit signals from RAS to the MAPK/ERK pathway, regulating proliferation, differentiation, and survival [^11386buJ]. RAF kinases are activated by RAS, undergo dimerization, and phosphorylate MEK, which then activates ERK to drive nuclear transcriptional programs [^116zmVzz].

---

## RAF mutations in cancer

RAF mutations are recurrent in multiple cancers, with **BRAF** the most frequently mutated and clinically significant [^115sjLwz].

| **Cancer type** | **BRAF mutation frequency** | **Most common mutation** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Melanoma | 40–60% | V600E | - Predicts response to BRAF/MEK inhibitors <br/> - Prognostic marker [^1147iDQi] |
| Colorectal cancer | 8–15% | V600E | - Poor prognosis <br/> - Predicts resistance to anti-EGFR therapy <br/> - Guides targeted combinations [^114MuSDs] [^111dwcQ7] |
| Thyroid cancer (papillary) | 40–70% | V600E | - Diagnostic and prognostic marker <br/> - Guides targeted therapy [^1176FBYB] [^113QXFFN] |
| Non-small cell lung cancer | 2–4% | V600E | - Predicts response to BRAF/MEK inhibitors <br/> - Routine testing recommended [^116JcXe4] |
| Hairy cell leukemia | > 90% | V600E | - Diagnostic marker <br/> - Predicts response to BRAF inhibitors [^114oVdfs] |

---

CRAF mutations are less common but occur in colorectal and lung cancers and are implicated in **tumor progression and resistance**, making them emerging therapeutic targets [^117K3P9c] [^1159kEjv].

## Diagnostic methods for detecting RAF mutations

Several **methods** are used to detect RAF mutations in clinical practice:

- **Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)**: Rapid, sensitive detection of specific mutations (e.g. BRAF V600E) [^112oAwt7].
- **Next-generation sequencing (NGS)**: Comprehensive detection of multiple RAF mutations and other genomic alterations [^111rfdRg].
- **Immunohistochemistry (IHC)**: Detects BRAF V600E protein expression; rapid but requires validation [^116QyCn3].
- **Liquid biopsy**: Non-invasive detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for mutation monitoring and resistance detection [^notfound].

---

## Clinical implications of RAF mutations

RAF mutations have **significant clinical implications**:

- **Prognosis**: BRAF V600E is associated with aggressive behavior and poorer outcomes in melanoma, colorectal, and thyroid cancers [^111rEf1a] [^116iggNM].
- **Therapy selection**: BRAF V600E predicts response to BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib, dabrafenib) combined with MEK inhibitors (trametinib, cobimetinib), improving survival in melanoma and other cancers [^113grnhH] [^113jgASf].
- **Resistance**: RAF mutations drive intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapies, necessitating combination strategies and novel inhibitors [^116XKmiP] [^112T9LYk].

---

## Current therapeutic strategies targeting RAF mutations

Current strategies focus on **BRAF V600E**, with approved BRAF/MEK combinations in melanoma, NSCLC, and thyroid cancer [^113jgASf]. CRAF-targeted therapies are under development to overcome resistance and address non-V600 BRAF and CRAF mutations [^117K3P9c] [^112T9LYk].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Key challenges include **heterogeneity** — variability in mutation type and context complicates therapy and resistance — and **resistance**, with both intrinsic and acquired mechanisms limiting durability and requiring novel combinations and next-generation inhibitors [^115sjLwz] [^116XKmiP]. Access to and validation of advanced diagnostics also remain barriers in some settings [^111qoQS7].

---

RAF mutations are central cancer drivers, with **BRAF V600E** as the most clinically actionable; routine testing and targeted therapies have improved outcomes, while CRAF and non-V600 BRAF mutations are emerging targets to overcome resistance [^117K3P9c] [^111DWAMJ] [^113jgASf].

### KRAS and BRAF: drug targets and predictive biomarkers [^111K4cGh]. The Journal of Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Three decades have passed since RAS was first identified as the transformative factor in the Harvey and Kirsten strains of the mouse sarcoma virus. RAS and several of its downstream effectors, including BRAF, have since been shown to be commonly mutated in broad range of human cancers and biological studies have confirmed that RAS pathway activation promotes tumour initiation, progression and metastatic spread in many contexts. With the identification of RAS mutation as a strong predictor of clinical resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies, RAS mutational testing has been incorporated into the routine clinical care of patients with colorectal and lung cancers. This article reviews the current understanding of RAS signalling as it relates to cancer biology, current efforts to develop inhibitors of RAS and its key downstream effectors and the technical challenges of RAS mutational testing in the clinical setting.

### The future of molecular analysis in melanoma: diagnostics to direct molecularly targeted therapy [^116Sj5RE]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Melanoma is a malignancy of pigment-producing cells that is driven by a variety of genetic mutations and aberrations. In most cases, this leads to upregulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway through activating mutations of upstream mediators of the pathway including BRAF and NRAS. With the advent of effective MAPK pathway inhibitors, including the US FDA-approved BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib and MEK inhibitor trametinib, molecular analysis has become an integral part of the care of patients with metastatic melanoma. In this article, the key molecular targets and strategies to inhibit these targets therapeutically are presented, and the techniques of identifying these targets, in both tissue and blood, are discussed.

### A structure is worth a thousand words: new insights for RAS and RAF regulation [^114mVnuT]. Cancer Discovery (2022). Medium credibility.

UNRESOLVED ISSUES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

The recently determined RAS and RAF structures have significantly advanced our understanding of RAS and RAF regulation; however, outstanding issues still remain, and the new structures themselves pose some additional questions. In particular, it is unclear whether all RAF family members will exhibit a similar autoinhibited conformation as is observed for BRAF, and little is known regarding the regulatory mechanisms that determine the formation of RAF homodimers versus heterodimers, in particular, the heterodimeric BRAF–CRAF/RAF1 complexes that predominate in RAS-driven signaling. Moreover, in the context of the plasma membrane and RAS binding, whether regions other than the RAF kinase domain make contacts that modulate the dynamics of dimerization is not known, nor is the extent to which full-length RAF dimers impact the organization of RAS complexes at the membrane.

In addition to providing key regulatory insights, these structures have also provided important new information relevant to therapeutic drug targeting. For example, with mounting structural and biochemical evidence supporting isoform and mutation-specific differences in oncogenic RAS alleles, it is becoming increasingly apparent that a single therapeutic strategy will not work for all RAS-driven cancers. Understanding and exploiting these isoform and mutation-specific differences may reveal distinct vulnerabilities, enabling the development of more refined treatment regimens for specific cancer types. In addition, the autoinhibited RAF structures have also demonstrated the potential feasibility of designing inhibitors that stabilize the inactive "compact configuration" of the RAF kinase domain by engaging not only the ATP-binding site, but also residues in the P-loop and kinase domain C-lobe to mimic ATP binding. Moreover, similar approaches to trap RAF and/or other components within the autoinhibited RAF complexes in an inactive state may prove advantageous, as is predicted for the next-generation allosteric MEK inhibitors described above. Thus, based on these initial structural studies, it is exciting to envision a multidisciplinary approach that combines structural biology with cell-based signaling analyses to spur the development of new compounds and inhibitors to combat aberrant RAS- and RAF-dependent signaling in tumor cells.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: central nervous system cancers, version 2.2022 [^111qoQS7]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

NCCN Central Nervous System Cancers — BRAF mutation and fusion testing is recommended and characterized: BRAF fusion and/or mutation testing is recommended in the appropriate clinical context (category 2A). Activating mutations in BRAF, most commonly V600E, occur across central nervous system tumors including 60%–80% of supratentorial grade 2–3 pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (PXAs), 30% of dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNETs), 20% of grade 1 gangliogliomas, and 5% of grade 1 pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs), and activating BRAF fusions are reported in entities including diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor and HGAP and predominate in posterior fossa PA, with some supratentorial PA also harboring this fusion. For detection, BRAF V600E is best detected by sequencing, and BRAF fusions are detected with RNA sequencing or other PCR-based breakpoint methods that capture the main 16–9, 15–9, and 16–11 breakpoints between BRAF and KIAA1549; FISH is too unreliable to detect BRAF fusions. Diagnostic value includes that a BRAF fusion is reliable evidence that the tumor is a PA if histology is compatible, whereas BRAF V600E can occur in a variety of tumors over all WHO grades and requires histologic integration. Prognostically, tumors with BRAF fusions tend to be indolent with occasional recurrence and only rare progression to lethality, while BRAF V600E tumors show a wider range of outcomes and may respond to BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib, although comprehensive clinical trials are still ongoing.

### RAF proteins exert both specific and compensatory functions during tumour progression of NRAS-driven melanoma [^112kaa8e]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

NRAS and its effector BRAF are frequently mutated in melanoma. Paradoxically, CRAF but not BRAF was shown to be critical for various RAS-driven cancers, raising the question of the role of RAF proteins in NRAS-induced melanoma. Here, using conditional ablation of Raf genes in NRAS-induced mouse melanoma models, we investigate their contribution in tumour progression, from the onset of benign tumours to malignant tumour maintenance. We show that BRAF expression is required for ERK activation and nevi development, demonstrating a critical role in the early stages of NRAS-driven melanoma. After melanoma formation, single Braf or Craf ablation is not sufficient to block tumour growth, showing redundant functions for RAF kinases. Finally, proliferation of resistant cells emerging in the absence of BRAF and CRAF remains dependent on ARAF-mediated ERK activation. These results reveal specific and compensatory functions for BRAF and CRAF and highlight an addiction to RAF signalling in NRAS-driven melanoma.

### BRAF-a tumour-agnostic drug target with lineage-specific dependencies [^113jgASf]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

In June 2022, the FDA granted Accelerated Approval to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib in combination with the MEK inhibitor trametinib for the treatment of adult and paediatric patients (≥ 6 years of age) with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600E -mutant solid tumours, except for BRAF V600E -mutant colorectal cancers. The histology-agnostic approval of dabrafenib plus trametinib marks the culmination of two decades of research into the landscape of BRAF mutations in human cancers, the biochemical mechanisms underlying BRAF-mediated tumorigenesis, and the clinical development of selective RAF and MEK inhibitors. Although the majority of patients with BRAF V600E -mutant tumours derive clinical benefit from BRAF inhibitor-based combinations, resistance to treatment develops in most. In this Review, we describe the biochemical basis for oncogenic BRAF-induced activation of MAPK signalling and pan-cancer and lineage-specific mechanisms of intrinsic, adaptive and acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors. We also discuss novel RAF inhibitors and drug combinations designed to delay the emergence of treatment resistance and/or expand the population of patients with BRAF-mutant cancers who benefit from molecularly targeted therapies.

### A novel oncogenic role for the miRNA-506–514 cluster in initiating melanocyte transformation and promoting melanoma growth [^111BeMz3]. Oncogene (2012). Low credibility.

Malignant melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer and its incidence has doubled in the last two decades. It represents only 4% of skin cancer cases per year, but causes as many as 74% of skin cancer deaths. Early detection of malignant melanoma is associated with survival rates of up to 90%, but later detection (stage III to stage IV) is associated with survival rates of only 10%. Dysregulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression has been linked to tumor development and progression by functioning either as a tumor suppressor, an oncogene or a metastasis regulator in multiple cancer types. To understand the role of miRNA in the pathogenesis of malignant melanoma and identify biomarkers of metastasis, miRNA expression profiles in skin punches from 33 metastatic melanoma patients and 14 normal healthy donors were compared. We identified a cluster of 14 miRNAs on the X chromosome, termed the miR-506–514 cluster, which was consistently overexpressed in nearly all melanomas tested (30–60 fold, P < 0.001), regardless of mutations in N-ras or B-raf. Inhibition of the expression of this cluster as a whole, or one of its sub-clusters (Sub-cluster A) consisting of six mature miRNAs, led to significant inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, decreased invasiveness and decreased colony formation in soft agar across multiple melanoma cell lines. Sub-cluster A of the miR-506–514 cluster was critical for maintaining the cancer phenotype, but the overexpression of the full cluster was necessary for melanocyte transformation. Our results provide new insights into the functional role of this miRNA cluster in melanoma, and suggest new approaches to treat or diagnose this disease.

### Classifying BRAF alterations in cancer: new rational therapeutic strategies for actionable mutations [^111DWAMJ]. Oncogene (2018). Low credibility.

The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade is among the most frequently mutated pathways in human cancer. Approximately 50% of melanoma patients possess a druggable hotspot V600E/K mutation in the BRAF protein kinase. FDA-approved combination therapies of BRAF and MEK inhibitors are available that provide survival benefits to patients with a BRAF V600 mutation. Non-V600 BRAF mutants are found in many cancers, and are more prevalent than V600 mutations in certain tumor types. For example, between 50–80% of BRAF mutations in non-small cell lung cancer and 22–30% in colorectal cancer encode for non-V600 mutants. As next generation sequencing becomes increasingly used in clinical practice, oncologists are frequently identifying non-V600 BRAF mutations in their patient's tumors, but are uncertain of viable therapeutic options that could be employed for optimal treatment. From recent studies, a new classification system is emerging for BRAF mutations based on biochemical and signaling mechanisms associated with these mutants. Class I BRAF mutations affect amino acid V600 and signal as RAS-independent active monomers, class II mutations function as RAS-independent activated dimers, and class III mutations are kinase impaired but increase signaling through the MAPK pathway due to enhanced RAS binding and subsequent CRAF activation. These distinct classes of BRAF mutations predict response to targeted therapies and have important implications for future drug development. Herein, we discuss pre-clinical and clinical findings that may lead to improved treatments for all classes of BRAF mutant cancers.

### Clonal selection confers distinct evolutionary trajectories in BRAF-driven cancers [^115sjLwz]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The identification of BRAF as a commonly mutated target in cancers has significantly altered the management of affected cancer types. BRAF is mutated in ~8% of all tumors including melanoma (~50%) or papillary thyroid (~60%), colorectal (~12%) or non-small cell lung cancer (~5%) –. By far, the most frequent mutation in BRAF across all cancer types is BRAF V600E, which drives tumor growth by hyperactivating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. In addition to BRAF V600E there are many other mutations in exons that encode or are directly adjacent to the conserved kinase domain. Some of these mutations have been previously characterized as hypermorphic, but a majority remain categorized as variants of unknown clinical significance. For example, in lung adenocarcinoma, it is estimated that approximately half of the mutations in BRAF are non-V600. Despite the confirmed activation of the mitogen-activated extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) pathway in some of these tumors, it is not clear whether mutations in these putative BRAF -driven tumors confer upfront sensitivity to inhibitors of BRAF (BRAFi) and/or MEK (MEKi) or alter the tumor genetic composition –. Due to its multitude of variants, its significant alteration frequency in several cancer types and the variable clinical efficacy of drugs that target it, BRAF is a model oncogene to study molecular classification-based heterogeneity.

Herein, we map the clonal trajectory of BRAF mutation-bearing cells across diverse variants and cancer types and exploit the variation in the architectures of BRAF -driven tumors to optimize tumor sensitivity.

### Standards and guidelines for the interpretation and reporting of sequence variants in cancer: a joint consensus recommendation of the Association for Molecular Pathology, American Society of Clinical Oncology, and college of American pathologists [^113bSzcM]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2017). Medium credibility.

In silico prediction algorithms — somatic variant interpretation: Algorithms are used to assess missense and splice effects and "can be binned into two categories: prediction of the impact of a missense variant on protein function and impact of a sequence variant on splicing". Overall performance is limited, with "moderate specificity (approximately 60% to 80%) with a tendency of over-predicting deleterious impact". Conflicting outputs can occur even for known drivers, as "the canonical BRAF V600E oncogenic mutation is predicted to have conflicting or even benign effect when analyzed across multiple in silico algorithms". Clinical laboratories "should exercise caution when interpreting in silico scores", and "It is recommended that the results of these prediction algorithms should never be used as the sole evidence for variant classification or clinical decision making".

### Metastatic colorectal cancer: ESMO clinical practice guideline for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^114y2CDb]. Annals of Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for rectal cancer, more specifically with respect to molecular testing (specific gene mutations), ESMO 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain testing for BRAF mutation simultaneously with the evaluation of RAS mutation status, for prognostic assessment
and for the option of treatment with cetuximab-encorafenib.

### Towards a unified model of RAF inhibitor resistance [^116XKmiP]. Cancer Discovery (2014). Low credibility.

ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors elicit profound but often temporary antitumor responses in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma. Analysis of tumor samples collected at the time of disease progression indicates that alterations within the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway that result in reactivation of ERK signaling are present in most patients. Mutations in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathway that enhance the adaptive response to RAF inhibitors also contribute to RAF inhibitor resistance in a subset of patients.

### Fusions in solid tumours: diagnostic strategies, targeted therapy, and acquired resistance [^111dVzUd]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Structural gene rearrangements resulting in gene fusions are frequent events in solid tumours. The identification of certain activating fusions can aid in the diagnosis and effective treatment of patients with tumours harbouring these alterations. Advances in the techniques used to identify fusions have enabled physicians to detect these alterations in the clinic. Targeted therapies directed at constitutively activated oncogenic tyrosine kinases have proven remarkably effective against cancers with fusions involving ALK, ROS1, or PDGFB, and the efficacy of this approach continues to be explored in malignancies with RET, NTRK1/2/3, FGFR1/2/3, and BRAF/CRAF fusions. Nevertheless, prolonged treatment with such tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) leads to the development of acquired resistance to therapy. This resistance can be mediated by mutations that alter drug binding, or by the activation of bypass pathways. Second-generation and third-generation TKIs have been developed to overcome resistance, and have variable levels of activity against tumours harbouring individual mutations that confer resistance to first-generation TKIs. The rational sequential administration of different inhibitors is emerging as a new treatment paradigm for patients with tumours that retain continued dependency on the downstream kinase of interest.

### Tumorigenesis: RAF / RAS oncogenes and mismatch-repair status [^117SaprG]. Nature (2002). Excellent credibility.

Genes of the RAF family encode kinases that are regulated by Ras and mediate cellular responses to growth signals. Activating mutations in one RAF gene, BRAF, have been found in a high proportion of melanomas and in a small fraction of other cancers. Here we show that BRAF mutations in colorectal cancers occur only in tumours that do not carry mutations in a RAS gene known as KRAS, and that BRAF mutation is linked to the proficiency of these tumours in repairing mismatched bases in DNA. Our results not only provide genetic support for the idea that mutations in BRAF and KRAS exert equivalent effects in tumorigenesis, but also emphasize the role of repair processes in establishing the mutation spectra that underpin human cancer.

### RAF kinase dimerization: implications for drug discovery and clinical outcomes [^112T9LYk]. Oncogene (2020). Medium credibility.

The RAF kinases activated by RAS GTPases regulate cell growth and division by signal transduction through the ERK cascade and mutations leading to constitutive activity are key drivers of human tumors, as are upstream activators including RAS and receptor tyrosine kinases. The development of first-generation RAF inhibitors, including vemurafenib (VEM) and dabrafenib led to initial excitement due to high response rates and profound regression of malignant melanomas carrying BRAF V600E mutations. The excitement about these unprecedented response rates, however, was tempered by tumor unresponsiveness through both intrinsic and acquired drug-resistance mechanisms. In recent years much insight into the complexity of the RAS-RAF axis has been obtained and inactivation and signal transduction mechanisms indicate that RAF dimerization is a critical step in multiple cellular contexts and plays a key role in resistance. Both homo- and hetero-dimerization of BRAF and CRAF can modulate therapeutic response and disease progression in patients treated with ATP-competitive inhibitors and are therefore highly clinically significant. Ten years after the definition of the RAF dimer interface (DIF) by crystallography, this review focuses on the implications of RAF kinase dimerization in signal transduction and for drug development, both from a classical ATP-competitive standpoint and from the perspective of new therapeutic strategies including inhibiting dimer formation. A structural perspective of the DIF, how dimerization impacts inhibitor activation and the structure-based design of next-generation RAF kinase inhibitors with unique mechanisms of action is presented. We also discuss potential fields of application for DIF inhibitors, ranging from non-V600E oncoproteins and BRAF fusions to tumors driven by aberrant receptor tyrosine kinase or RAS signaling.

### New perspectives for targeting RAF kinase in human cancer [^116LjAyD]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2017). Medium credibility.

The discovery that a subset of human tumours is dependent on mutationally deregulated BRAF kinase intensified the development of RAF inhibitors to be used as potential therapeutics. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved second-generation RAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib have elicited remarkable responses and improved survival of patients with BRAF-V600E/K melanoma, but their effectiveness is limited by resistance. Beyond melanoma, current clinical RAF inhibitors show modest efficacy when used for colorectal and thyroid BRAF-V600E tumours or for tumours harbouring BRAF alterations other than the V600 mutation. Accumulated experimental and clinical evidence indicates that the complex biochemical mechanisms of RAF kinase signalling account both for the effectiveness of RAF inhibitors and for the various mechanisms of tumour resistance to them. Recently, a number of next-generation RAF inhibitors, with diverse structural and biochemical properties, have entered preclinical and clinical development. In this Review, we discuss the current understanding of RAF kinase regulation, mechanisms of inhibitor action and related clinical resistance to these drugs. The recent elucidation of critical structural and biochemical aspects of RAF inhibitor action, combined with the availability of a number of structurally diverse RAF inhibitors currently in preclinical and clinical development, will enable the design of more effective RAF inhibitors and RAF-inhibitor-based therapeutic strategies, tailored to different clinical contexts.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) prognostic biomarkers — APC, KRAS, and BRAF alterations and their current clinical utility are described as follows: Alterations in these critical genes have been shown to affect prognosis by metrics of tumor progression or survival, yet the utility of incorporating prognostic biomarkers in CRC management has not been well defined in clinical practice, and defining the utility of information gathered from prognostic molecular biomarkers for clinical management of CRC is warranted.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: melanoma: cutaneous, version 2.2024 [^1147iDQi]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Principles of molecular testing — BRAF (B-raf proto-oncogene) alterations in cutaneous melanoma: BRAF mutations are most commonly found at codon 600 with V600E (80%), V600K (15%), and V600R/M/D/G (5%). BRAF V600 mutations are associated with sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors, and "BRAF inhibitors should not be used in patients without activating mutations in BRAF". BRAF V600 mutations are also associated with sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, and combination BRAF plus MEK inhibitors are "superior to either agent alone" in patients with BRAF V600 mutations. Compared with BRAF V600E, patients with BRAF V600K–mutated metastatic melanoma may have slightly lower response/benefit to BRAF ± MEK inhibitors, although less frequent codon 600 mutations (including V600R/M/D/G) also may benefit. Non‑V600 BRAF mutations and BRAF fusions are found in approximately 5% of melanomas; BRAF L597 and K601 have shown response to MEK inhibitors and BRAF+MEK combinations, BRAF fusions have shown responses to MEK inhibitors and non‑specific RAF inhibitors (eg, sorafenib), whereas other codons in exon 11 or exon 15 have not demonstrated response to either BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Although some clinical features correlate with higher BRAF mutation frequency, these "should not be used either as a proxy… or to decide testing". All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: non-small cell lung cancer, version 7.2025 [^116JcXe4]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Non-small cell lung cancer — BRAF point mutations: Mutations in BRAF can be seen in NSCLC, and a specific change in amino acid position 600 (most commonly p.V600E, but rarely p.V600K, p.V600D, or other changes) has been associated with responsiveness to combined therapy with oral inhibitors of BRAF and MEK. Other mutations in BRAF are observed in NSCLC, and their impact on therapy selection is not well understood at this time. Testing methodologies indicate that real-time PCR and NGS are the most commonly deployed for examining BRAF mutation status, while an anti-BRAF p.V600E-specific monoclonal antibody should only be deployed after extensive validation.

### Targeting RAF kinases for cancer therapy: BRAF-mutated melanoma and beyond [^1137PXqa]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2014). Medium credibility.

The identification of mutationally activated BRAF in many cancers altered our conception of the part played by the RAF family of protein kinases in oncogenesis. In this Review, we describe the development of BRAF inhibitors and the results that have emerged from their analysis in both the laboratory and the clinic. We discuss the spectrum of RAF mutations in human cancer and the complex interplay between the tissue of origin and the response to RAF inhibition. Finally, we enumerate mechanisms of resistance to BRAF inhibition that have been characterized and postulate how strategies of RAF pathway inhibition may be extended in scope to benefit not only the thousands of patients who are diagnosed annually with BRAF-mutated metastatic melanoma but also the larger patient population with malignancies harbouring mutationally activated RAF genes that are ineffectively treated with the current generation of BRAF kinase inhibitors.

### USP32 facilitates non-small cell lung cancer progression via deubiquitinating BAG3 and activating RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway [^115oSLmu]. Oncogenesis (2024). Medium credibility.

The regulatory significance of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 32 (USP32) in tumor is significant, nevertheless, the biological roles and regulatory mechanisms of USP32 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain unclear. According to our research, USP32 was strongly expressed in NSCLC cell lines and tissues and was linked to a bad prognosis for NSCLC patients. Interference with USP32 resulted in a significant inhibition of NSCLC cell proliferation, migration potential, and EMT development; on the other hand, USP32 overexpression had the opposite effect. To further elucidate the mechanism of action of USP32 in NSCLC, we screened H1299 cells for interacting proteins and found that USP32 interacts with BAG3 (Bcl2-associated athanogene 3) and deubiquitinates and stabilizes BAG3 in a deubiquitinating activity-dependent manner. Functionally, restoration of BAG3 expression abrogated the antitumor effects of USP32 silencing. Furthermore, USP32 increased the phosphorylation level of the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway in NSCLC cells by stabilizing BAG3. In summary, these findings imply that USP32 is critical to the development of NSCLC and could offer a theoretical framework for the clinical diagnosis and management of NSCLC patients in the future.

Testing and BRAF — BRAF mutation testing is an important component of therapy selection because recommended therapy differs by BRAF status; however, the Expert Panel could not make any formal recommendation in favor of specific tests. In progressing BRAF wild-type disease, a prior false-negative result is technically possible; therefore, retesting on progression could be considered, which may rarely be of value as the Expert Panel is not aware of high-quality data supporting this retesting.

Function: This proto-oncogene belongs to the RAF subfamily of the Ser/Thr protein kinase family, and maybe involved in cell growth and development. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. ARAF is a Protein Coding gene. Diseases associated with ARAF include pallister-killian syndrome and mycobacterium marinum. Among its related pathways are Sertoli-Sertoli Cell Junction Dynamics and Signaling by GPCR. GO annotations related to this gene include transferase activity, transferring phosphorus-containing groups and protein tyrosine kinase activity. An important paralog of this gene is RAF1. Raf kinases, a family of three serine/threonine kinases, are part of the Ras-MAPK signaling cascade and phosphorylate MEK. Upon growth factor stimulation, Raf-1 is activated by GTP-bound Ras and recruited to the cell membrane. This activation process is tightly regulated.

### To BRAF or not to BRAF: is that even a question anymore? [^114KgDHS]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Alterations in BRAF have been discovered in most pediatric low-grade gliomas. Because the field has moved quickly during the past few years, there is not yet widespread awareness about what B-Raf normally does, how the BRAF gene is modified in gliomas, why mutant proteins promote gliomagenesis, and what an abnormal BRAF result means for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Depending on the data from ongoing clinical trials, however, BRAF mutation screening could quickly become mandatory for all pediatric gliomas and perhaps even a subset of adult gliomas. Herein, these topics and different methods of testing for BRAF fusions and V600E point mutations are reviewed.

### Raf kinases in cancer-roles and therapeutic opportunities [^114PHdif]. Oncogene (2011). Low credibility.

Raf are conserved, ubiquitous serine/protein kinases discovered as the cellular elements hijacked by transforming retroviruses. The three mammalian RAF proteins (A, B and CRAF) can be activated by the human oncogene RAS, downstream from which they exert both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent, tumor-promoting functions. The kinase-dependent functions are mediated chiefly by the MEK/ERK pathway, whose activation is associated with proliferation in a broad range of human tumors. Almost 10 years ago, activating BRAF mutations were discovered in a subset of human tumors, and in the past year treatment with small-molecule RAF inhibitors has yielded unprecedented response rates in melanoma patients. Thus, Raf qualifies as an excellent molecular target for anticancer therapy. This review focuses on the role of BRAF and CRAF in different aspects of carcinogenesis, on the success of molecular therapies targeting Raf and the challenges they present.

### Mutations of the BRAF gene in human cancer [^115at8me]. Nature (2002). Excellent credibility.

Cancers arise owing to the accumulation of mutations in critical genes that alter normal programmes of cell proliferation, differentiation and death. As the first stage of a systematic genome-wide screen for these genes, we have prioritized for analysis signalling pathways in which at least one gene is mutated in human cancer. The RAS RAF MEK ERK MAP kinase pathway mediates cellular responses to growth signals. RAS is mutated to an oncogenic form in about 15% of human cancer. The three RAF genes code for cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinases that are regulated by binding RAS. Here we report BRAF somatic missense mutations in 66% of malignant melanomas and at lower frequency in a wide range of human cancers. All mutations are within the kinase domain, with a single substitution (V599E) accounting for 80%. Mutated BRAF proteins have elevated kinase activity and are transforming in NIH3T3 cells. Furthermore, RAS function is not required for the growth of cancer cell lines with the V599E mutation. As BRAF is a serine/threonine kinase that is commonly activated by somatic point mutation in human cancer, it may provide new therapeutic opportunities in malignant melanoma.

### Targeting alterations in the RAF-MEK pathway [^112yF7YT]. Cancer Discovery (2019). Medium credibility.

The MAPK pathway is one of the most commonly mutated oncogenic pathways in cancer. Although RAS mutations are the most frequent MAPK alterations, less frequent alterations in downstream components of the pathway, including the RAF and MEK genes, offer promising therapeutic opportunities. In addition to BRAF V600 mutations, for which several approved therapeutic regimens exist, other alterations in the RAF and MEK genes may provide more rare, but tractable, targets. However, recent studies have illustrated the complexity of MAPK signaling and highlighted that distinct alterations in these genes may have strikingly different properties. Understanding the unique functional characteristics of specific RAF and MEK alterations, reviewed herein, will be critical for developing effective therapeutic approaches for these targets. SIGNIFICANCE: Alterations in the RAF and MEK genes represent promising therapeutic targets in multiple cancer types. However, given the unique and complex signaling biology of the MAPK pathway, the diverse array of RAF and MEK alterations observed in cancer can possess distinct functional characteristics. As outlined in this review, understanding the key functional properties of different RAF and MEK alterations is fundamental to selecting the optimal therapeutic approach.

### Discovery of a novel raf kinase inhibitor [^116tuZx5]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2001). Low credibility.

We discuss the biology of Ras signal transduction and the epidemiology of ras mutations in association with disease as a background for the development of a Raf kinase inhibitor, BAY 43–9006. Knowledge of Ras effector pathways has permitted genetic validation of numerous targets involved in the Ras signaling cascade. A key Ras effector pathway involves the kinase cascade RAF/MEK/ERK (MEK: MAP/ERK kinase; ERK: extracellular signal related kinase). Indeed, we present studies of cell lines stably expressing mutant MEK constructs, which point to Raf kinase as a target for therapeutics with selective anti-tumor activity. Finally, a small molecule drug discovery program based on inhibition of Raf kinase activity is outlined and the initial pre-clinical development process of the Raf kinase inhibitor BAY 43–9006 is discussed.

### RAF1 contributes to cell proliferation and STAT3 activation in colorectal cancer independently of microsatellite and KRAS status [^1159kEjv]. Oncogene (2023). Medium credibility.

Little is known about the mechanistic role of RAF proteins and especially of RAF1 in colorectal cancer (CRC). CRC is the third most common cancer worldwide in terms of incidence and the second in terms of mortality. It is a heterogeneous disease that arises through different mechanisms, with two mutually exclusive subtypes of these tumors reported so far, i.e. CRC displaying microsatellite instability (MSI) or chromosomal instability (MSS for MicroSatellite Stable). At the molecular level, MSS is frequently associated with inactivating mutations of APC (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli), while the MSI phenotype (about 15% of CRC) is due to an accumulation of mutations in the microsatellite sequences caused by a defect in the DNA mismatch repair system. In CRC, KRAS mutations occur in about 40% of the cases and are more prevalent in the MSS than in MSI group which in contrast more frequently display BRAF activating mutations. Understanding signaling and molecular mechanisms downstream of mutated KRAS might help to develop treatments for these tumors that do not respond to therapies such as anti-EGFR.

A crucial role of RAF proteins in KRAS-mutated CRC has been postulated previously. On one hand, silencing of RAF and autophagy inhibition leads to cell cycle arrest and cell death in KRAS mutant cells, a phenotype similar to the one observed in KRAS lung adenocarcinoma when only RAF1 is genetically ablated. On the other hand, targeting RAF1 with selective inhibitors synergizes with MEK inhibition in MSS CRC cell lines harboring a KRAS mutation, with a prominent role of RAF1, as also described in human colonosphere cultures in which genetic depletion of RAF1 impairs clonogenic and tumorigenic properties of CRC cells. Research on RAF1-specific functions focused on its impact in KRAS mutated samples or MSS cell lines. Based on this, we aimed to elucidate whether RAF1 is required as an effector of mutated KRAS in MSI and MSS CRC, or whether it might have a role involving other pathways. Here, we demonstrate a crucial role of RAF1 in the proliferation of CRC cell lines both in 2D and 3D cultures. This role is independent of KRAS and MS status and requires an intact dimerization surface but not RAF1 catalytic activity. The decrease in proliferation caused by RAF1 loss is potentiated by MEK inhibition. Loss of RAF1 in CRC spheroids deregulates a group of genes that impact the transcription factor STAT3 and its downstream targets implicated in angiogenesis in human primary CRC. The data indicate that selective degraders of RAF1 might be more effective than selective inhibitors.

Tier I variants with strong clinical significance — Level A evidence defines therapeutic variants that predict response or resistance to FDA-approved or guideline-included therapies for specific tumor types, with examples including BRAFV600E predicting response to the FDA-approved drug vemurafenib in melanoma and KRAS mutations predicting resistance to anti–epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibodies in colorectal cancer. Level A diagnostic/prognostic variants are included in professional guidelines as diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers, exemplified by PML-RARA fusion being pathognomonic for promyelocytic leukemia and FLT3 internal tandem duplication associated with poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia. PML-RARA fusion is also described as diagnostic for promyelocytic leukemia and associated with a good prognosis and predicts sensitivity to all-trans retinoic acid or arsenic.

### Conferring specificity on the ubiquitous raf / MEK signalling pathway [^116UntwL]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

B-Raf is mutated in 66% of melanomas and a smaller number of other prevalent cancers such as colon tumours. While the activation of Raf-1 requires a complex series of events, the activation of B-Raf is much simpler to achieve, explaining why B-Raf is a preferred target for mutational activation in human cancers. The main mutation is V599E, which introduces a negative charge into the activation loop. This phosphomimetic mutation suffices to deregulate B-Raf activity and convert it into an oncogene. In the meantime, a flurry of studies has established that B-Raf is indeed mutated in a great variety of cancers albeit, with the exception of thyroid carcinoma, B-Raf mutation has a rather low incidence. Most of these tumour types are known to have Ras mutations, but interestingly, Ras and B-Raf mutations usually do not coincide in the same tumour. This observation provides strong genetic evidence that B-Raf is a crucial effector for Ras-mediated tumourigenesis; however, the exact molecular mechanism is still obscure. Besides the prevalent V599E mutation, which enhances kinase activity, there are three other classes of mutations whose functional consequences are less clear. One class affects the Akt phosphorylation sites in B-Raf, which have been implicated in the inhibition of B-raf kinase activity. Obviously, these mutations would only activate B-raf in cells where its activity is restrained through Akt. Another class of mutations that leads to modest activation is found in the ATP-binding glycine-rich loop. Yet another type alters the conserved DFG motif at the base of the activation loop. Such mutations usually incapacitate the kinase activity. These mutations are rare, but challenge the view that the oncogenic conversion of B-Raf is only due to the chronic hyperstimulation of the MEK-ERK pathway. A plausible explanation is that B-Raf has a role that is independent of its kinase activity, for instance, as a scaffolding protein or as a dominant-negative mutant, which sequesters proteins that prevent transformation.

### BRAF-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer: current evidence, future directions, and research priorities [^116umGud]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

BRAF V600E -mutant metastatic colorectal cancer represents a distinct molecular phenotype known for its aggressive biological behavior, resistance to standard therapies, and poor survival rates. Improved understanding of the biology of the BRAF oncogene has led to the development of targeted therapies that have paved the way for a paradigm shift in managing this disease. However, despite significant recent advancements, responses to targeted therapies are short-lived, and several challenges remain. In this review, we discuss how progress in treating BRAF V600E -mutant metastatic colorectal cancer has been made through a better understanding of its unique biological and clinical features. We provide an overview of the evidence to support current treatment approaches and discuss critical areas of need and future research strategies that hold the potential to refine clinical practice further. We also discuss some challenging aspects of managing this disease, particularly the complexity of acquired resistance mechanisms that develop under the selective pressure of targeted therapies and rational strategies being investigated to overcome them.

### The role of CRAF in cancer progression: from molecular mechanisms to precision therapies [^117K3P9c]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2024). High credibility.

The RAF family of kinases includes key activators of the pro-tumourigenic mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Hyperactivation of RAF proteins, particularly BRAF and CRAF, drives tumour progression and drug resistance in many types of cancer. Although BRAF is the most studied RAF protein, partially owing to its high mutation incidence in melanoma, the role of CRAF in tumourigenesis and drug resistance is becoming increasingly clinically relevant. Here, we summarize the main known regulatory mechanisms and gene alterations that contribute to CRAF activity, highlighting the different oncogenic roles of CRAF, and categorize RAF1 (CRAF) mutations according to the effect on kinase activity. Additionally, we emphasize the effect that CRAF alterations may have on drug resistance and how precision therapies could effectively target CRAF-dependent tumours. Here, we discuss preclinical and clinical findings that may lead to improved treatments for all types of oncogenic RAF1 alterations in cancer.

### Prevalence of BRAFV600 in glioma and use of BRAF inhibitors in patients with BRAFV600 mutation-positive glioma: systematic review [^1151tyUD]. Neuro-Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Significant prevalence of BRAFV600 in five glioma entities.
Variable but promising response to BRAFi in V600-mutant glioma in a recurrent setting.
Provides rationale for adjuvant clinical trials of BRAFi in V600-mutant glioma.

Importance of the Study

There is a need for accurate prevalence estimates of the biomarker BRAF V600 within glioma to inform decisions around testing and to consider the role of targeted therapeutic strategies. Our systematic review has identified glioma subtypes with high prevalence of BRAF V600 in which testing might be recommended. We have also identified subtypes with lower prevalence of BRAF V600 where testing might be considered. We describe the available evidence about the use of, and response to, BRAF inhibitors in V600-mutant glioma and conclude that adjuvant randomized trials of BRAF inhibitors in adult and pediatric low-grade and high-grade gliomas are needed.

Brain tumors are responsible for the most years of life lost by any cancer and there is a need for novel precision medicine approaches informed by detailed biomarker research.

One such candidate is BRAF (v-raf Murine Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog B1), a gene, responsible for production of the B-Raf protein, a member of the Raf serine/threonine kinase family. BRAF is a key mediator in the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cell signaling pathway, which has a role in cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation.B-Raf activates MAPK extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) proteins, which stimulate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) proteins which control cellular responses.

BRAF is the most commonly mutated kinase in cancer; more than 75 unique BRAF mutations have been reported in melanoma, although many of these mutations yield no or unknown significance. BRAF mutations are prevalent in melanoma (40–50%), thyroid cancers (10–70%), serous ovarian cancer (~30%), colorectal cancers (~10%), and non-small cell lung carcinoma (~3–5%).

The most-reported oncogenic driver mutation in BRAF is V600E (~90%). There are others; for example, the E558K mutation promotes dimerization of the kinase domains which increases B-Raf activity. Additionally, KIAA1549-BRAF gene fusions are found in low-grade glioma, particularly pilocytic astrocytoma.

### BRAF mutation testing in colorectal cancer [^112oAwt7]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in the United States. Understanding the biochemical pathways underlying carcinogenesis has paved the way for more effective treatments and better outcomes. BRAF mutation testing has a role in (1) differentiating sporadic colorectal cancer from Lynch syndrome, (2) identifying cancers lacking BRAF mutation that are more likely to respond to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor therapy, and (3) conferring worse prognosis in colorectal cancer that is microsatellite stable. Several analytic methods are available to reliably detect BRAF mutations. Real-time polymerase chain reaction identifies the most common BRAF mutation, V600E, in frozen or paraffin-embedded colorectal cancer tissue. Traditional DNA sequencing and the somewhat more-sensitive pyrosequencing method can detect multiple alternative BRAF mutations that are predicted to constitutively activate signaling through the MAPK pathway, promoting tumor growth and survival. Pathologists play an important role in assay validation as well as in consulting with clinicians about indications for testing, ensuring quality of testing, and interpreting results in conjunction with other clinicopathologic factors important in the management of affected patients.

### 2015 American Thyroid Association management guidelines for adult patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer: the American Thyroid Association guidelines task force on thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^1176FBYB]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Optimizing molecular markers for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic targets — significant progress has been made over the last several years in understanding the genetic mechanisms of thyroid cancer and creating molecular tests for cancer diagnosis in thyroid nodules. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other laboratories have identified mutations and other driver genetic alterations in more than 90% of thyroid cancers, and the TCGA focused only on PTC. Next-generation sequencing technologies may allow detection of most of these alterations in a limited cell sample obtained by fine-needle aspiration (FNA), and progress in identifying mutational, other genetic markers of thyroid cancer is expected to result in a significantly improved accuracy of cancer detection in thyroid nodules compared to current clinical tests; as the cost of next-generation sequencing of human DNA decreases and analytical tools become more efficient, it should be expected that the cost of molecular testing will decrease. Molecular markers are expected to have a significant impact on cancer prognostication; while the BRAF status can be considered as a relatively sensitive prognostic marker for papillary cancer, it cannot be used in isolation for tumor prognostication, and several specific molecular signatures, including TP53 and TERT in isolation or with BRAF, are found in a small fraction of well-differentiated papillary and follicular cancers and appear to be associated with more aggressive tumor behavior. Discoveries of new gene fusions in thyroid cancer, such as those of ALK and NTRK3, are expected to drive development of new effective therapeutic targets, and new therapeutic approaches to target genes commonly mutated in thyroid cancer, such as the RAS genes, are in development and expected to enter clinical trials in the future.

### Molecular biomarkers for the evaluation of colorectal cancer [^111vCCvp]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2017). Medium credibility.

Colorectal carcinoma — BRAF p.V600 and mismatch repair testing for prognosis and Lynch risk: BRAF p.V600 (BRAF c.1799 p.V600) mutational analysis should be performed in colorectal cancer tissue for prognostic stratification, and BRAF p.V600 mutational analysis should be performed in deficient MMR tumors with loss of MLH1 to evaluate for Lynch syndrome risk; presence of a BRAF mutation strongly favors a sporadic pathogenesis, but the absence of a BRAF mutation does not exclude risk of Lynch syndrome. Clinicians should order mismatch repair status testing in patients with colorectal cancers for the identification of patients at high risk for Lynch syndrome and/or prognostic stratification, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend BRAF c.1799 p.V600 mutational status as a predictive molecular biomarker for response to anti-EGFR inhibitors.

### Targeting BRAF in thyroid cancer [^116SAvyj]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Functionally, BRAF V600E is capable of inducing thyroid cell transformation in vitro and to induce thyroid cancer in vivo in transgenic mice with thyroid-specific expression of the protein. These data confirm that BRAF V600E is an oncogene for thyroid cancer. Because BRAF and the other RAF kinases were putative downstream signal transducing molecules for RET/PTC, and because mutations in BRAF and RAS, and rearrangements in NTRK and RET/PTC are largely mutually exclusive in human PTC samples, it was suggested that the RAS/RAF/MEK pathways might represent a linear cascade whose activation promotes thyroid cancer formation. To test this hypothesis, a series of elegant gene expression studies were performed using in vitro models and clinical samples to determine the role of BRAF in RET/PTC effects in thyroid cells and the degree of overlap in gene expression in tumours with either genetic abnormality. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that BRAF and RET/PTC share similar mechanisms for their acute effects on thyroid cells and that there is substantial, although not complete overlap in gene expression profiles of PTC expressing either oncogene. The relative importance of BRAF signalling in the actions of the different RET/PTC or RAS oncogenes has not yet been carefully dissected, although it seems likely that BRAF, and perhaps other RAF kinases, play an important role based on data from cell model systems.

Important distinctions between tumours that express RET/PTC vs BRAF V600E are their relationships to radiation exposure and age at PTC diagnosis. Convincing functional and epidemiologic evidence supports the ability of radiation to induce RET/PTC gene rearrangements and a high prevalence of RET/PTC expression in radiation-induced PTCs (reviewed in). In contrast, BRAF mutations appear to be uncommon in radiation-related PTCs. In addition, RET/PTC is more prevalent in childhood thyroid cancers, whereas BRAF V600E mutations are extremely rare in children and the age of patients with PTCs who express BRAF V600E is more than that of the general PTC population.

### BRAFV600E: implications for carcinogenesis and molecular therapy [^116YYqNC]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is frequently mutated in human cancer. This pathway consists of a small GTP protein of the RAS family that is activated in response to extracellular signaling to recruit a member of the RAF kinase family to the cell membrane. Active RAF signals through MAP/ERK kinase to activate ERK and its downstream effectors to regulate a wide range of biological activities including cell differentiation, proliferation, senescence, and survival. Mutations in the v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogenes homolog B1 (BRAF) isoform of the RAF kinase or KRAS isoform of the RAS protein are found as activating mutations in approximately 30% of all human cancers. The BRAF pathway has become a target of interest for molecular therapy, with promising results emerging from clinical trials. Here, the role of the most common BRAF mutation BRAF(V600E) in human carcinogenesis is investigated through a review of the literature, with specific focus on its role in melanoma, colorectal, and thyroid cancers and its potential as a therapeutic target.

### Initial management of BRAF V600E-Variant anaplastic thyroid cancer: the FAST multidisciplinary group consensus statement [^112yFKmP]. JAMA Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

BRAF/MEK inhibitors revolutionized the treatment of BRAF V600E-variant anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (BRAFv-ATC), offering improved outcomes for patients with this previously incurable disease.

Observations

Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) accounts for approximately half of thyroid cancer-related deaths. It presents as a rapidly growing tumor that often invades locoregional structures and spreads to distant sites early; therefore, prompt diagnosis, staging, and treatment initiation are of the essence in the treatment of ATC. Although most oncologists will encounter a patient with ATC in their practice, the rarity of this disease makes treatment challenging, particularly because those with BRAFv-ATC no longer have a dismal prognosis. BRAF/MEK kinase inhibitors have transformed the outlook and treatment of BRAFv-ATC. Therefore, molecular profiling to identify these patients is critical. More recently, the addition of immunotherapy to BRAF/MEK inhibitors as well as the use of the neoadjuvant approach were shown to further improve survival outcomes in BRAFv-ATC. Many of these recent advances have not yet been incorporated in the currently available guidelines, allowing for disparities in the treatment of patients with BRAFv-ATC across the US. With the increasing complexity in the management of BRAFv-ATC, this Consensus Statement aims to formulate guiding recommendations from a group of experts to facilitate therapeutic decision-making.

Conclusions and Relevance

This Consensus Statement from the FAST (Facilitating Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer Specialized Treatment) group at MD Anderson Cancer Center emphasizes that rapid identification of a BRAF V600E pathogenic variant and timely initiation of sequential therapy are critical to avoid excess morbidity and mortality in patients with BRAFv-ATC. In the past decade, remarkable progress has been made in the treatment of patients with BRAFv-ATC, justifying these new evidence-based recommendations reached through a consensus of experts from a high-volume center.

### Conferring specificity on the ubiquitous raf / MEK signalling pathway [^117VqbY6]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

The Raf-MEK-ERK signalling pathway controls fundamental cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation and survival. It remains enigmatic how this pathway can reliably convert a myriad of extracellular stimuli in specific biological responses. Recent results have shown that the Raf family isoforms A-Raf, B-Raf and Raf-1 have different physiological functions. Here we review how Raf isozyme diversity contributes to the specification of functional diversity, in particular regarding the role of Raf isozymes in cancer.

### Targeting the raf kinases in human cancer: the raf dimer dilemma [^115KSNFj]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Although much progress has been made in understanding the genetic alterations that cause constitutive Ras/ERK cascade signalling in human cancer, identifying therapies that are broadly effective has been difficult. In particular, the usefulness of the first-generation Raf inhibitors has been limited by issues related to Raf dimerisation and paradoxical ERK activation. Next-generation Raf inhibitors take two approaches to address this problem: (1) inhibition of monomeric and dimeric pan-Raf complexes or (2) engagement of the ATP binding cleft in a manner that is inhibitory to Raf dimerisation. While dose limitations and potential side effects of these drugs are yet to be determined, it is expected that like vemurafenib and dabrafenib, the non-dimer-promoting drug PLX8395 will be well tolerated and have little activity in normal cells due to its selectivity for V600E-B-Raf. In contrast, the high potency pan-Raf inhibitors will likely have a reduced therapeutic window due to the fact that they target normal as well as mutant Raf signalling. The pan-Raf inhibitors, in particular, may be good candidates for combinatorial therapies where their activity may synergise with other pathway inhibitors to reduce drug toxicity. Likewise, alternative approaches to inhibit or prevent Raf dimerisation may prove beneficial in the treatment of Ras-driven cancers, or could partner with traditional ATP-competitive Raf inhibitors to augment their efficacy or stave off drug resistance. Thus, with the development of next-generation Raf inhibitors and better strategies to overcome the Raf dimer dilemma, the goal of finding more durable therapies moves forward.

### BRAF signaling and targeted therapies in melanoma [^1164Q4a6]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway has emerged as a major player in the induction and maintenance of melanoma, particularly the protein kinase BRAF, mutated in approximately 44% of melanoma cases. The availability of new drugs affecting the components of this pathway and pathways that may cooperate with MAPK signaling, means that targeted therapies are fast becoming a real option in the clinical management of melanoma. The authors discuss what they learned from clinical trials using first- and second-generation inhibitors to this pathway.

### Mechanism and consequences of RAF kinase activation by small-molecule inhibitors [^111SzH8w]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

There have also been reports of progression of non-cutaneous lesions in BRAF inhibitor-treated patients.described the occurrence of pre-malignant colonic adenomas and gastric polyps in three vemurafenib-treated patients. Although these lesions were all non-malignant, their frequency reportedly exceeds that typically observed in similar patient populations. The acceleration or development of true malignancies has been described in two patients. In both cases, which included a leukaemia patient and a colorectal cancer patient, the tumours contained WT BRAF together with mutant RAS mutations. Although the causative role of BRAF kinase inhibition in these cases was not directly proven, analyses of the drug-induced signalling alterations in the specific cancer cells were consistent with the molecular mechanism of WT BRAF activation by BRAF inhibitors.

The difference in the pharmacological effect of RAF inhibitors in cells expressing wild-type vs BRAF V600E also has the potential to impact therapeutic efficacy. For example, acquired resistance to RAF inhibitor treatment can result from the acquisition of activating NRAS mutations. As described above, this would result in reactivation of the pathway through wild-type BRAF and CRAF, an effect that could be amplified by the presence of a RAF inhibitor. Furthermore, genetic heterogeneity in melanoma tumours can lead to discordance in BRAF mutational status between different metastases in the same patient. In such cases treatment, with a RAF inhibitor would be expected to result in a mixed response, with BRAF V600 mutation-positive metastases responding to treatment and BRAF wild-type metastases failing to respond or even accelerating growth rate.

### The "SWOT" of BRAF inhibition in melanoma: RAF inhibitors, MEK inhibitors or both? [^111JwHeN]. Current Oncology Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Activating mutations in the BRAF gene are among the most prevalent kinase mutations in human cancer. BRAF mutations are most frequent in patients with melanoma where they occur in approximately 50% of patients with advanced disease. Remarkable clinical activity has recently been reported with highly selective RAF inhibitors in melanoma patients whose tumors harbor V600E BRAF mutations. The response rates of RAF inhibitors in patients with BRAF-mutant melanomas far exceed the activity level of any prior therapy studied in this disease. The results suggest that we have entered an era of personalized therapy for patients with metastatic melanoma in which treatment selection will be guided by BRAF mutational status. This review will discuss the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats ("SWOT") of developing RAF and MEK selective inhibitors as anti-cancer therapies, recent insights into the mechanisms of intrinsic and acquired resistance to these agents, and current efforts to develop mechanism-based combination therapies.

### Molecular pathways: mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway mutations and drug resistance [^115qYCgY]. Clinical Cancer Research (2013). Low credibility.

Receptor tyrosine kinases are a diverse family of transmembrane proteins that can activate multiple pathways upon ligation of the receptor, one of which is the series of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades. The MAPK pathways play critical roles in a wide variety of cancer types, from hematologic malignancies to solid tumors. Aberrations include altered expression levels and activation states of pathway components, which can sometimes be attributable to mutations in individual members. The V600E mutation of BRAF was initially described in 2002 and has been found at particularly high frequency in melanoma and certain subtypes of colorectal cancer. In the relatively short time since this discovery, a family of drugs has been developed that specifically target this mutated BRAF isoform, which, after results from phase I/II and III clinical trials, was granted U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in August 2011. Although these drugs produce clinically meaningful increases in progression-free and overall survival, due to acquired resistance they have not improved mortality rates. New drugs targeting other members of the MAPK pathways are in clinical trials or advanced stages of development. It is hoped that combination therapies of these new drugs in conjunction with BRAF inhibitors will counteract the mechanisms of resistance and provide cures. The clinical implementation of next-generation sequencing is leading to a greater understanding of the genetic architecture of tumors, along with acquired mechanisms of drug resistance, which will guide the development of tumor-specific inhibitors and combination therapies in the future.

### Advances in targeting the ras / raf / MEK / erk mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade with MEK inhibitors for cancer therapy [^117L1KPt]. Clinical Cancer Research (2008). Low credibility.

The identification of intracellular signaling cascades important for the growth and survival of cancer cells has led to the development of targeted cancer therapeutics aimed at blocking these signals. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway has a well-defined role in cancer biology and has been an important target in the development of targeted therapies. Recently, several small-molecule inhibitors of MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK), a key intermediary of MAPK signaling, have been developed and are currently being tested in clinical trials. Herein, we review the MAPK pathway, the development of small-molecule MEK inhibitors, and the results obtained to date with MEK inhibitors in human cancer trials.

### Targeting the raf-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade for the treatment of cancer [^112qiHv6]. Oncogene (2007). Low credibility.

Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are key signaling pathways involved in the regulation of normal cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. Aberrant regulation of MAPK cascades contribute to cancer and other human diseases. In particular, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) MAPK pathway has been the subject of intense research scrutiny leading to the development of pharmacologic inhibitors for the treatment of cancer. ERK is a downstream component of an evolutionarily conserved signaling module that is activated by the Raf serine/threonine kinases. Raf activates the MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)1/2 dual-specificity protein kinases, which then activate ERK1/2. The mutational activation of Raf in human cancers supports the important role of this pathway in human oncogenesis. Additionally, the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway is a key downstream effector of the Ras small GTPase, the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancers. Finally, Ras is a key downstream effector of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is mutationally activated and/or overexpressed in a wide variety of human cancers. ERK activation also promotes upregulated expression of EGFR ligands, promoting an autocrine growth loop critical for tumor growth. Thus, the EGFR-Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling network has been the subject of intense research and pharmaceutical scrutiny to identify novel target-based approaches for cancer treatment. In this review, we summarize the current status of the different approaches and targets that are under evaluation and development for the therapeutic intervention of this key signaling pathway in human disease.

### V-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) as a prognostic biomarker of poor outcomes in esophageal cancer patients [^1157J6s4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Esophageal cancer (EC) is the eighth most common cancer and the sixth most common cause of death globally. EC remains a significant health problem in the world because the 5-year survival rate is low. Worldwide statistics have revealed that the incidence of EC increases with age, and men are more likely to be diagnosed with the disease than women at a ratio of 3:1. Many EC patients are already locally advanced or advanced at the time of diagnosis, and EC is susceptible to recurrence and metastasis, highlighting the main reasons for poor EC prognosis. Although there are many factors that influence the prognosis of EC, additional influential factors need to be studied further. A new index is necessary to enable more accurate prognostic predictions and provide the best preoperative counseling to patients. The coding products of v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) occur through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signal transduction network, which plays a crucial role in multiple tumorigenic processes, including cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, metastasis, and protection of the cancer cell from apoptosis. Mutations in the Kirsten ras 1 (KRAS) and BRAF genes may be predictive of drug responses that are directly linked to the EGFR pathway.

In this study, we detected BRAF protein expression in EC tissues, studied the effect of BRAF on the invasion and metastasis of TE-1 (human esophageal cancer cell) cells in vitro, and explored the value of the BRAF gene in early EC diagnosis as well as the possibility of predicting prognosis to a provide theoretical basis for using BRAF inhibitors as targeted drugs in EC treatment.

Comprehensive molecular profiling as a tool for improving diagnostic precision and selection of treatment — Lessons learned from rare cancers

Although haematologic malignancies, for reasons outlined in the previous section, are disease entities that have pioneered precision diagnostics and medicine, several lessons can also be learned from other rare cancer types. The translational and clinical potential of comprehensive molecular profiling to improve the stratification of patients to treatments is well illustrated by the example of rare cancers. However, determining the clinical consequences of a tumour's molecular profile is not always straightforward. For example, the question often arises whether the 'druggability' of a genetic variant can be transferred from one tissue context to another. This problem is well illustrated by the example of monotherapy with the mutation‐specific BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in more common malignancies with BRAF V600E mutations, such as melanoma, where these alterations were first described, which leads to an objective response in approximately half of the entities studied. In contrast, in colorectal carcinoma, rational combination therapies that take into account the physiologic expression profile of the tissue of origin are required to suppress oncogenic RAF‐MEK‐ERK signalling. Another barrier to implementing precision oncology approaches in rare cancers is that negative evidence of drug efficacy in unstratified clinical trials that followed a 'one‐size‐fits‐all' strategy likely underestimated the value of many therapies, leaving the efficacy of most approved targeted drugs in rare cancers unexplored.

### Molecular pathways and mechanisms of BRAF in cancer therapy [^113grnhH]. Clinical Cancer Research (2022). Medium credibility.

With the identification of activating mutations in BRAF across a wide variety of malignancies, substantial effort was placed in designing safe and effective therapeutic strategies to target BRAF. These efforts have led to the development and regulatory approval of three BRAF inhibitors as well as five combinations of a BRAF inhibitor plus an additional agent(s) to manage cancer such as melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, anaplastic thyroid cancer, and colorectal cancer. To date, each regimen is effective only in patients with tumors harboring BRAFV600 mutations and the duration of benefit is often short-lived. Further limitations preventing optimal management of BRAF-mutant malignancies are that treatments of non-V600 BRAF mutations have been less profound and combination therapy is likely necessary to overcome resistance mechanisms, but multi-drug regimens are often too toxic. With the emergence of a deeper understanding of how BRAF mutations signal through the RAS/MAPK pathway, newer RAF inhibitors are being developed that may be more effective and potentially safer and more rational combination therapies are being tested in the clinic. In this review, we identify the mechanics of RAF signaling through the RAS/MAPK pathway, present existing data on single-agent and combination RAF targeting efforts, describe emerging combinations, summarize the toxicity of the various agents in clinical testing, and speculate as to where the field may be headed.

### BRAF mutant colorectal cancer: prognosis, treatment, and new perspectives [^112yD8HD]. Annals of Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

The MAPK cascade plays a crucial role in tumor cell proliferation and survival. Accumulating evidence suggests that mutations in the BRAF oncogene are not only associated with poor prognosis but also linked with less benefit when treated with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Targeting this molecular aberration has thus become a matter of particular interest in mCRC drug development. In contrast to other malignances such as BRAF mutant melanoma, efficacy observed with BRAF inhibitors in monotherapy in mCRC is poor. Several mechanisms of resistance have been identified leading to the development of different treatment strategies that have shown promising activity in early clinical trials. Hence, rational combination of targeted therapies is expected to further increase the efficacy of selective BRAF inhibitors. Herein, we discuss the main clinical and molecular characteristics of BRAF mutant colorectal cancer and its translation into the clinic, with a focus on developmental therapeutics and combination strategies. In addition, we contextualize the available data with potential future approaches that include the extended access to next-generation sequencing platforms and gene expression strategies for molecular subtyping. These approaches will facilitate the identification of certain patient profiles providing more therapeutic possibilities.

### Diagnostic value of fine needle aspiration BRAF (V600E) mutation analysis in papillary thyroid cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115MzzPY]. Human Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Fine needle aspiration (FNA) with cytologic analysis is an initial step in diagnosing thyroid nodules that are suspicious for cancer. We systematically reviewed the test accuracy of B-type Raf kinase (BRAF(V600E)) gene mutation analysis plus conventional FNA in the diagnosis of papillary thyroid cancer. We identified studies reporting BRAF(V600E) mutation analysis after FNA for evaluation of thyroid nodules through searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, scanning reference lists of relevant studies, and contacting experts. Two independent reviewers screened literature results, abstracted data, and appraised study quality. When appropriate, bivariate and univariate random-effects meta-analyses of sensitivity and specificity were considered for all outcomes. Forty-seven studies met our inclusion criteria after screening 1560 citations and 169 full-text articles. The included studies enrolled approximately 16170 patients with 9924 FNA samples evaluated for BRAF(V600E) mutation. Univariate pooled sensitivity was 69% (95% confidence interval, 61%-76%) for papillary thyroid cancer. For thyroid nodules that were diagnosed cytologically as suspicious for papillary thyroid cancer, univariate pooled sensitivity using FNA and BRAF(V600E) results was 52% (95% confidence interval, 39%-64%). Despite its high specificity, our meta-analysis shows that BRAF(V600E) mutation analysis has a low sensitivity in diagnosing papillary thyroid cancer in thyroid nodules. The feasibility of this test as a single molecular tool is not well established, which indicates the need for well-designed prospective clinical studies.

### Targeting the raf kinases in human cancer: the raf dimer dilemma [^111hxkmb]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

The Raf protein kinases are key intermediates in cellular signal transduction, functioning as direct effectors of the Ras GTPases and as the initiating kinases in the ERK cascade. In human cancer, Raf activity is frequently dysregulated due to mutations in the Raf family member B-Raf or to alterations in upstream Raf regulators, including Ras and receptor tyrosine kinases. First-generation Raf inhibitors, such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib, have yielded dramatic responses in malignant melanomas containing B-Raf mutations; however, their overall usefulness has been limited by both intrinsic and acquired drug resistance. In particular, issues related to the dimerisation of the Raf kinases can impact the efficacy of these compounds and are a primary cause of drug resistance. Here, we will review the importance of Raf dimerisation in cell signalling as well as its effects on Raf inhibitor therapy, and we will present the new strategies that are being pursued to overcome the 'Raf Dimer Dilemma'.

### Paradoxical oncogenesis – the long-term effects of BRAF inhibition in melanoma [^113CWKaN]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2013). Medium credibility.

The clinical benefits of BRAF inhibition in patients with advanced-stage BRAF-mutant melanoma are now well established. Although the emergence of cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas (SCCs) and secondary melanomas in patients on BRAF-inhibitor therapy have been well described, reports are emerging of additional secondary premalignant and malignant events, including RAS-mutant leukaemia, the metastatic recurrence of RAS-mutant colorectal cancer and the development of gastric and colonic polyps. In most cases, paradoxical MAPK activation — resulting from the BRAF-inhibitor-mediated homodimerization and heterodimerization of nonmutant RAF isoforms — seems to underlie the development of these secondary tumours. Although evidence supports that therapy with the simultaneous administration of BRAF and MEK inhibitors abrogates the onset of treatment-induced SCCs, whether combination treatment will limit the emergence of all BRAF-inhibitor-driven pathologies is unclear. In this Review, we describe the clinical and mechanistic manifestations of secondary cancers that have thus far been observed to arise as a consequence of BRAF inhibition. We discuss the concept of pre-existing populations of partly transformed cells with malignant potential that might be present in various organ systems, and the rationale for novel therapeutic strategies for the management of BRAF-inhibitor-induced neoplasia.

### Next generation sequencing and tumor mutation profiling: are we ready for routine use in the oncology clinic? [^112nK4aQ]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

There are increasing numbers of agents that are approved for the treatment of cancers harboring specific genomic alterations. The canonical example, of course, is the use of imatinib in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia harboring the BCR/ABL rearrangement. A more recent example is the remarkable success of BRAF inhibitors in the treatment of malignant melanomas with BRAF V600E mutations. Tumor mutation profiling can identify these mutations, of course, but the specific alterations appropriate for treatment with approved agents are well-defined, and there are usually specific companion diagnostic assays. There is no obvious benefit to using a NGS assay to identify an established mutation, and likely significant incremental cost. So, if there is a known target in a particular disease type, NGS profiling is not necessary.

At the other end of the spectrum is the hope that NGS may identify a therapeutic target that would not have been considered based on disease type, and that this knowledge will allow the oncologist to select an 'off the shelf' treatment for a patient that will be superior to a more traditional physician-selected therapy. While this is the application that is the most logical in the popular imagination, it is also the one that is the least supported by data. Even if one identifies a mutation that confers sensitivity in a particular disease, it may not predict response in another context. An example is the relative insensitivity of BRAF-mutant colon cancer to BRAF inhibition, despite the presence of the same mutation that confers sensitivity in melanoma. The situation becomes even more complicated when one attempts to predict response based upon non-canonical alterations in genes that could be plausible targets for existing drugs. If the platform evaluates tumor DNA alone, any identified sequence change may, in fact, be germ line (inherited) in origin. The mere fact that a variation is rare does not argue for pathogenic relevance, since most normal human variation is common, and even protein-truncating mutations are seen in the constitutional DNA of apparently healthy people. To identify sequence variants that are present in tumor only, a number of laboratories now sequence tumor and normal samples simultaneously, and 'subtract' the germ line sequence from the somatic sequence in order to identify those variants that are unique to the tumor. However, even somatic variants may not be causative. Such variants may not be functionally significant, and the process of determining causality is both complex and partly subjective despite the best efforts of a number of groups to standardize the process of curation. Even if causative, the variant may not be directly related to the cancer process ('passenger' rather than driver' mutation), in which case targeting the mutation will not have an effect on the growth of the tumor.

### Molecular pathways: response and resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors in BRAF (V600E) tumors [^111RwYAQ]. Clinical Cancer Research (2014). Low credibility.

The RAS-RAF-MEK (MAP-ERK kinase)-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway plays a central role in driving proliferation, survival, and metastasis signals in tumor cells, and the prevalence of oncogenic mutations in RAS and BRAF and upstream nodes makes this pathway the focus of significant oncology drug development efforts. This focus has been justified by the recent success of BRAF and MEK inhibitors in prolonging the lives of patients with BRAF(V600E/K)-mutant melanoma. Although it is disappointing that cures are relatively rare, this should not detract from the value of these agents to patients with cancer and the opportunity they provide in allowing us to gain a deeper understanding of drug response and resistance. These insights have already provided the basis for the evaluation of alternative dosing regimens and combination therapies in patients with melanoma.

### Mutant-selective degradation by BRAF-targeting PROTACs [^11386buJ]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The Ras-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway is important for many aspects of cellular homeostasis. The pathway is initiated upon extracellular growth factor binding to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), thereby activating the kinase cascade. Upon activation of upstream effectors, GTP-bound RAS recruits RAF (ARAF, BRAF, or CRAF) to the cell membrane, promoting its dimerization and activation. Thus, the scaffolding and enzymatic role of BRAF are both essential for its function –. Activated RAF phosphorylates and activates MEK, which in turn phosphorylates and activates ERK leading to cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. BRAF is mutated in 8% of observed cancers including melanoma (60%), colorectal cancer (10%), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (10%), and hairy cell leukemia (100%). These mutations (often missense mutations found in the kinase domain) distinctly affect the biochemical characteristics of the kinase –. Class 1 BRAF mutants such as V600E and V600K are hyper-activating and can signal as monomers in the absence of activated RAS. Class 2 BRAF mutants such as K601E and G469A signal as constitutive, RAS- independent dimers. Lastly, Class 3 BRAF mutants such as G466V and D594N harbor low to no kinase activity and function by binding tightly to RAS thus recruiting CRAF into hyperactivated heterodimers –. FDA-approved inhibitors such as vemurafenib have been successful in increasing progression-free survival of patients harboring hyperactive BRAF V600E mutations. However, as with many kinase inhibitors, resistance occurs that renders patients insensitive to continued treatment. Significant efforts have focused on creating drugs that target Class 2 BRAF mutations by inhibiting dimer formation, but adequate drugs have not yet been approved. Therefore, there is a need for new and innovative therapies to address BRAF-driven cancers.

### Molecular biomarkers for the evaluation of colorectal cancer: guideline from the American Society for Clinical Pathology, college of American pathologists, Association for Molecular Pathology, and American Society of Clinical Oncology [^111rEf1a]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2017). Medium credibility.

BRAF p.V600 testing for prognostic stratification in colorectal cancer — BRAF p.V600 [BRAF c.1799 (p.V600)] position mutational analysis should be performed in CRC tissue in selected patients with colorectal carcinoma for prognostic stratification. BRAF activating mutations occur in about 8% of advanced disease patients with CRC and in approximately 14% of patients with localized stage II and III CRC. Patients with advanced CRC who possess a BRAF mutation have significantly poorer outcomes as measured by progression-free survival and overall survival and have a decreased response rate to anti-EGFR therapy relative to those without mutated BRAF. A randomised phase 3 adjuvant trial reported that trials in the adjuvant setting should consider mismatch repair, BRAF, and KRAS status for stratification, since BRAF p.V600 and KRAS mutations were associated with shorter disease-free and overall survival in microsatellite-stable colon cancer but not in those with MSI. This recommendation is supported by seven systematic reviews, three of which included meta-analyses.

### TRIM22 promotes the proliferation of glioblastoma cells by activating MAPK signaling and accelerating the degradation of raf-1 [^11465mYh]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Raf-1 is a major effector recruited through the GTP-binding protein Ras that activates the MEK-MAPK pathway. Activation of Raf-1 involves the phosphorylation of multiple activation sites, including Ser338, Tyr341, Thr491, Ser494, Ser497, and Ser499. The ratio of Raf-1 S338 /Raf-1 illustrates the activation of Raf-1, and our study revealed that the synergistic effect of TRIM22 on both Raf-1 phosphorylation and degradation prompted Raf activation. In addition, the p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) signaling pathway is activated in response to various extracellular stimuli. MEK1 and MEK2 activate p44 and p42, respectively, by phosphorylating the activation loop residues Thr202/Tyr204 and Thr185/Tyr187, respectively. ERK1/2 is a key target for cancer diagnosis and treatment. We demonstrated that TRIM22 targets Raf-1 for proteasome-mediated degradation and further enhances MAPK signaling activation by modifying the K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on ERK1/2. However, in addition to K48- and K63-linked chains, K6-, K11-, K27-, K29-, and K33-linked polyubiquitin chains also play important roles in the regulation of Raf-1 and ERK1/2; however, whether TRIM22 regulates other ubiquitination and phosphorylation sites of Raf-1 and ERK1/2 also needs further study.

K145 is a selective inhibitor of SPHK2 and shows excellent antitumor activity in vivo and in vitro. Liu's groupfound that K145 can act as a dual pathway inhibitor and inhibit both ART and AKT signaling pathway phosphorylation while inhibiting SPHK2, thereby achieving antiproliferative and apoptotic effects in U937 leukemia cells. Selumetinib is a highly potent and selective non-ATP-competitive MEK1/2 inhibitor, and the results from the National Cancer Institute showed a good therapeutic effectin a clinical trial of selumetinib in the treatment of low-grade astroglioma and metastatic low-grade glioma (NCT04166409) conducted on January 3, 2020. Our study revealed that K145 and selumetinib significantly inhibited TRIM22 overexpression-induced proliferation of GBM cells both in vivo and in vitro.

### Targeting the raf kinases in human cancer: the raf dimer dilemma [^1131XNpR]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

In human cancer, mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), Ras family members, or the B-Raf kinase frequently hijack the proliferative and survival functions of Ras pathway signalling to drive tumourigenesis. When the pathway is co-opted by constitutive RTK or Ras activity, dimerisation of the wild-type Raf proteins is required to activate MEK and ERK, with B-Raf/C-Raf heterodimers again predominating (Figure 1b). However, when oncogenic signalling is driven by B-Raf, the requirement for Raf dimerisation can vary (Figure 1c and d). Of the Raf kinases, B-Raf has the highest intrinsic kinase activity and is mutated in 50–70% of malignant melanomas, 40% of thyroid carcinomas, 30% of ovarian tumours, and nearly 100% of hairy cell leukaemias. Although many B-Raf alterations have been detected in human cancer, mutations affecting the valine residue at amino acid position 600 (V600) are most prevalent, with V600E-B-Raf accounting for 80–90% of B-Raf mutations in melanoma. V600 mutations allow B-Raf to adopt an active kinase conformation in the absence of dimerisation and, as a result, these mutants can signal as Ras-independent monomers. With limited exceptions, all other oncogenic B-Raf proteins, including non-V600 mutants and B-Raf truncation or fusion proteins, depend on dimerisation for their transforming activity, which can involve Ras-independent self-dimerisation or Ras-dependent heterodimerisation with C-Raf.

Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) — diagnostic cytology, biopsy, pathology, and molecular testing: FNA cytology can play an important diagnostic role in the initial evaluation of ATC, but parallel core biopsy may be necessary for definitive diagnosis and to obtain sufficient material for molecular interrogation, and every effort should be made to establish a diagnosis via biopsy before proceeding with surgical resection, as surgical resection may be inappropriate; routine surgical pathology evaluation of resection specimens should focus on confirming a definitive diagnosis of ATC, documenting extent of disease, and defining the presence of any coexisting DTC and/or other pathologies, and the proportion of tumor that represents ATC should also be documented; once ATC diagnosis is considered, assessment of BRAF V600E mutation should be expeditiously performed by IHC and confirmed/expeditiously assessed by molecular testing, and molecular profiling should be performed at the time of ATC diagnosis to inform decisions related to the use of targeted therapies, especially as there are now Food and Drug Administration-approved mutation-specific therapies in this context.

### Raf: a strategic target for therapeutic development against cancer… [^112EBpGh]. ASCO (2005). Low credibility.

The mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway plays a critical role in transmitting proliferative signals generated by cell surface receptors and cytoplasmic signaling elements to the nucleus. Several important signaling elements of the MAPK pathway, particularly Ras and Raf, are encoded by oncogenes, and as such, their structures and functions can be modified, rendering them constitutively active. Because the MAPK pathway is dysregulated in a notable proportion of human malignancies, many of its aberrant and critical components represent strategic targets for therapeutic development against cancer.

Raf, which is an essential serine/threonine kinase constituent of the MAPK pathway and a downstream effector of the central signal transduction mediator Ras, is activated in a wide range of human malignancies by aberrant signaling upstream of the protein and activating mutations of the protein itself, both of which confer a proliferative advantage. Three isoforms of Raf have been identified, and therapeutics targeting Raf, including small-molecule inhibitors and antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides, are undergoing clinical evaluation. The outcomes of these investigations may have far-reaching implications in the management of many types of human cancer. This review outlines the structure and diverse functions of Raf, the rationale for targeting Raf as a therapeutic strategy against cancer, and the present status of various therapeutic approaches including ASONs and small molecules, particularly sorafenib.

### Molecularly targeted therapies in cancer: a guide for the nuclear medicine physician [^116i7o2R]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

The MAPK Pathway

Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a critical pathway for human cancer cell survival, dissemination, and resistance to drug therapy. One of the most studied MAPK pathways is the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. ERK is a subgroup of MAPKs that is activated by external factors such as growth factors and mitogens. The MAPK/ERK pathway is activated by upstream genomic events and/or activation of multiple signaling events where information coalesces at this important nodal pathway point. This pathway is tightly regulated under normal conditions by phosphatases and bidirectional communication with other pathways, such as the AKT/mTOR pathway. Ligand-mediated activation of receptor tyrosine kinases such as Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) initiate the cascade of ERK signaling that flows through RAS GTPase, which acts as a molecular on/off switch. Once RAS, a family of various oncogenes such as KRAS, NRAS and HRAS, is turned on it recruits and activates proteins necessary for the propagation of growth factor and other receptor signals, including RAF and PI3K. RAF activation is achieved through a complex process that requires lipid and protein binding, conformational changes, and regulatory phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events. There are three RAF proteins in mammals, including BRAF, and they can all activate MAP kinase kinase (MEK) just upstream of ERK. The downstream MAPK/ERK signaling node, predominantly activated by upstream SRC/RAS/RAF signaling, is also regulated by modulation through parallel pathways. Several mutations involving the MAPK/ERK pathway have been identified, occurring upstream in membrane receptor genes (EGFR), in signal transducers (RAS), and in downstream kinases belonging to the MAPK/ERK pathway itself (BRAF) in human cancers and are ripe for targeting. Currently approved for the treatment of unresectable metastatic melanoma with somatic point mutation in the BRAF gene resulting in constitutive activation of BRAF (V600E) kinase, inhibitors of B-RAF kinase are being studied alone (vemurafenib, dabrafenib) and in combination with inhibitors of MEK (cobimetinib) and other pathways to optimize treatment of many tumor types. This therapeutic is well tolerated with the most common adverse effects including skin reactions, photosensitivity, headache and arthralgia, although an increased risk of development of localized cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma has also been observed. Inhibitor of MEK in monotherapy (Trametinib) was also shown to be effective for the treatment of patients with un-resectable or metastatic melanoma harboring activating BRAF V 600E/K mutations. However, therapies targeted toward MAPK/ERK components have variable response rates when used in different solid tumors, such as colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer. Understanding the differential nature of activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway in each tumor type is critical in developing single and combination regimens. Several studies have evaluated development of new tracers to specifically target the altered pathways. Also, standard FDG PET still has its role for therapy evaluation or prediction of response.

Introduction

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related fatalities worldwide, for approximately 25% of the deaths related to cancer. The primary histologic subtype of lung cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which encompasses a number of different forms, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), and large cell carcinoma (LCC). The majority of patients are diagnosed with locally advanced disease or metastases to distant locations, because there is a dearth of an early diagnostic platform and patients typically present with late onset symptoms. A number of novel therapies, including screening, minimally invasive procedures, radiation chemotherapy, etc. have advanced significantly in recent years thanks to the advancement of genetic analysis and molecular testing techniques. Consequently, NSCLC patient survival rates have increased. Additionally, NSCLC patients can receive immunotherapy and molecular targeted therapy as a form of selective treatment because tumor biomarkers are continually being discovered and studied. However, the microenvironment of NSCLC is subject to diverse changes due to genetic alterations and tissue-specific responses, so the analysis of genes and mechanistic studies is the discovery of new immunotherapeutic targets for NSCLC.

### BRAF mutation in papillary thyroid cancer: pathogenic role, molecular bases, and clinical implications [^116iggNM]. Endocrine Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

In recent years, the T1799A B-type Raf kinase (BRAF) mutation in thyroid cancer has received enthusiastic investigation, and significant progress has been made toward understanding its tumorigenic role and clinical significance. Among various thyroid tumors, this mutation occurs uniquely in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), the most common endocrine malignancy, and some apparently PTC-derived anaplastic thyroid cancers. Many studies have found this mutation to be associated with those clinicopathological characteristics of PTC that are conventionally known to predict tumor progression and recurrence, including, for example, old patient age, extrathyroidal invasion, lymph node metastasis, and advanced tumor stages. Direct association of BRAF mutation with the clinical progression, recurrence, and treatment failure of PTC has also been demonstrated. The BRAF mutation has even been correlated with PTC recurrence in patients with conventionally low-risk clinicopathological factors. Some molecular mechanisms determining BRAF mutation-promoted progression and the aggressiveness of PTC have recently been uncovered. These include the down-regulation of major tumor suppressor genes and thyroid iodide-metabolizing genes and the up-regulation of cancer-promoting molecules, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloproteinases, nuclear transcription factor kappaB, and c-Met. Thus, BRAF mutation represents a novel indicator of the progression and aggressiveness of PTC. Significant advances have also occurred in the preclinical testing of new therapeutic strategies targeting the MAPK pathway aberrantly activated by BRAF mutation and other related mutations. New mitogen extracellular kinase (MEK) inhibitors developed recently are particularly promising therapeutic agents for thyroid cancer. With these advances, it has become clearer that BRAF mutation will likely have significant impact on the clinical management of PTC.

### Upregulation of MAPK pathway is associated with survival in castrate-resistant prostate cancer [^114ZAg9W]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

The MAPK pathway is known to have critical roles in the control of the cell cycle, growth and prevention of apoptosis. This pathway has been implicated in the development of CRPC and circumvention of AR involvement in prostate cancer. Raf is well known to be involved in a broad range of cancers and is considered to be an oncogene that drives the MAPK pathway and proliferation to enhance tumourigenesis. The upstream activator of Raf, Ras, has also previously been identified as being linked to tumourigenesis.

The distribution of Raf-1 and MAPK observed by immunohistochemistry is consistent with the current understanding of their cellular localisation and functions, indicating that their localisation and functions were not disrupted during tumourigenesis, their levels however showed a very broad range of fluctuations. The data presented here suggests that Raf-1 activates MAPK in the cytoplasm, which in turn translocates to the nucleus. No correlations were observed between activated Raf-1 and activated MAPK; however, this was not unexpected as Raf-1 becomes rapidly inactivated and phosphorylated at serine 259 in the cytoplasm.

Raf has been shown to have the ability to circumvent the MAPK pathway by acting directly upon retinoblastoma protein. The very strong correlations between cytoplasmic and nuclear activated Raf levels and the weaker correlations between Raf and MAPK may indicate that a small portion of Raf activity may be attributable to MAPK-independent action. The lack of any clear links between active Raf and active MAPK in CRPC would appear to indicate that the two pathways can and do operate independently in the latter stages of prostate cancer. In addition, the tight correlations present between the various forms of MAPK after transition to CRPC is a strong indicator that this pathway has become very active in either the transition to or progression of CRPC.

There are several correlations between PSA levels and both Raf and MAPK (all forms) indicating a clear and distinct link between PSA and these pathways in HNPC. Interestingly, these correlations are completely absent in CRPC, giving further indication that these pathways have become dislocated with the general indicators associated with prostate cancer (i.e. PSA and Gleason score). This may indicate a reason for PSA being useful in the initial diagnosis of prostate cancer, but not in determining hormone relapse or overall survival (Supplementary Figure 1). Furthermore, this may indicate that markers in the Raf and MAPK pathways may be more appropriate targets for monitoring disease progression.

### Cancer prevention and screening: the next step in the era of precision medicine [^116MGwFW]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

The case for precision cancer prevention

A substantial body of research has been devoted to investigating the pathways involved in cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis, and identifying biomarkers associated with these mechanisms for clinical utility. The term 'biomarker', however, is broad and encompasses a multitude of biological features or molecules, such as imaging or radiomic alterations, DNA modifications, expression of different RNA types, and metabolomic and proteomic changes. Regardless of the biomarker type, the ideal biomarker should be: (1) directly associated with the disease of interest, (2) be involved in at least one part of the cancer spectrum, (3) provide high sensitivity and specificity, (4) have relatively non-invasive detection, and 5) have a reasonable cost-benefit ratio. The success of individual biomarkers has been limited, however progress has been made in the use of biomarker panels for the early detection and precision treatment of several cancers, such as breast cancer and melanoma. The American Society for Clinical Oncology recommends tumor-typing for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in breast biopsies. The information attained from this tumor-typing can then be used to inform interventive options, such as tamoxifen for ER-positive cancers, trastuzumab for HER2-positive cancers, or the need for additional genetic analysis. A similar tiered approach can be utilized in the early detection of melanoma harboring BRAF-V600E mutations. Approximately 50% of melanomas have a mutation in BRAF which results in the constitutive activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway. Of these, over 90% of the BRAF mutations are a missense mutation resulting in the substitution of valine for glutamic acid at codon 600. Early detection of melanoma and tumor-typing for the BRAF-V600E mutation can then inform therapeutic options, such as treatment with vemurafenib or dabrafenib which specifically target the activating mutation.

### Mechanism and consequences of RAF kinase activation by small-molecule inhibitors [^1116vbsf]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

RAF inhibitors have made a significant impact on the lives of melanoma patients whose tumours express the BRAF V600E oncogene. As with most other cancer therapeutics, efficacy is associated with side effects and in the case of RAF inhibitors, induction of secondary malignancies is a significant concern. However, it appears that the vast majority of cases with the risk to the patient is relatively low, although the clinical experience with these agents is still very early. The pharmacological behaviour of these inhibitors may not have been anticipated but the observations and follow-up mechanistic studies have led to a deeper understanding of RAF–MEK–ERK signalling. These insights will guide future drug development efforts to create better inhibitors that may be optimised towards a tailored pharmacological profile.

### The spectrum of clinical utilities in molecular pathology testing procedures for inherited conditions and cancer: a report of the Association for Molecular Pathology [^111rfdRg]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance of molecular diagnosis in oncology highlights that molecular diagnostic testing serves an important role in distinguishing benign from malignant proliferations and is often the modality of choice to establish a definitive diagnosis when morphology, immunohistochemistry, conventional cytogenetics, or flow cytometry are inconclusive. Molecular studies of antigen receptor genes can help distinguish lymphoma from benign lymphoproliferations, and mutation analyses in cystic pancreatic neoplasia and thyroid lesions of indeterminate cytology can help differentiate benign from malignant lesions; in suspected myelodysplasia, guidelines recommend testing a panel of genes to establish presence of clonal hematopoiesis. Stratification of cancer has become part of the primary diagnosis, with the World Health Organization classification of lymphomas and leukemias requiring molecular diagnostic data for many tumor categories, and correct molecularly assisted diagnosis being essential to evidence-based management. Until recently, lung cancer diagnosis used histological classification only, but mutation status has now become part of disease naming in an increasing number of cancers because mutations predict recurrence or have implications for targeted therapy (eg, BRAF-, MEK-, and RAS-mutant melanomas). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) can interrogate multiple mutational hot spots to efficiently identify several somatic mutations known to be important cancer drivers.

### V600E / V600K mutations versus nonstandard alterations: prognostic implications and therapeutic outcomes [^115KzrzF]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

BRAF and MEK inhibitors are standard of care for BRAF V600E/K-mutated melanoma, but the benefit of BRAF and/or MEK inhibitors for nonstandard BRAF alterations for melanoma and other cancers is unclear. Patients with diverse malignancies whose cancers had undergone next-generation sequencing were screened for BRAF alterations. Demographics, treatment with BRAF and/or MEK inhibitors, clinical response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were determined from review of the electronic medical records for patients with standard BRAF V600E/K versus nonstandard BRAF alterations. A total of 213 patients with BRAF alterations (87 with nonstandard alterations) were identified; OS from diagnosis was significantly worse with nonstandard BRAF versus standard alterations, regardless of therapy [HR (95% confidence interval), 0.58 (0.38–0.88); P = 0.01]. Overall, 45 patients received BRAF/MEK-directed therapy (eight with nonstandard alterations); there were no significant differences in clinical benefit rate [stable disease ≥ 6 months/partial/complete response (74% vs. 63%; P = 0.39) or PFS (P = 0.24; BRAF V600E/K vs. others)]. In conclusion, patients with nonstandard versus standard BRAF alterations (BRAF V600E/K) have a worse prognosis with shorter survival from diagnosis. Even so, 63% of patients with nonstandard BRAF alterations achieved clinical benefit with BRAF/MEK inhibitors. Larger prospective studies are warranted to better understand the prognostic versus predictive implication of standard versus nonstandard BRAF alterations.

### Treatment of advanced BRAF-Mutated colorectal cancer: where we are and where we are going [^112mutcY]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

In recent years, studies on the molecular typing of colorectal cancer have matured, and the V-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway has been shown to be an important effector molecule of this pathway and regulates the occurrence and development of colorectal cancer. Clinical observations indicate that colorectal cancer patients harboring the BRAF V600E mutation have a worse prognosis than BRAF wild type patients. Several resistance mechanisms have been identified that have led to the development of different treatment strategies, which have shown encouraging activity in early clinical trials. Therefore, a reasonable combination of targeted therapies is expected to further enhance the efficacy of selective BRAF inhibitors. Moreover, some CRC patients with high microsatellite instability or a mismatch repair deficiency seem to be susceptible to checkpoint inhibitors with objective and sustained clinical responses, providing new opportunities for patients with advanced disease. This article primarily explores 3 aspects of the treatment strategies for advanced BRAF-mutated colorectal cancer; chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.

### Targeting the raf kinases in human cancer: the raf dimer dilemma [^116zmVzz]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Importance of Raf dimerisation in normal and oncogenic signalling

The Raf kinases are best known for their role in Ras pathway signalling – a pathway widely utilised to control many cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation and survival. All members of the Raf family, which include A-Raf, B-Raf and C-Raf, possess a Ras-binding domain (RBD) in their N-terminal regulatory region and can function as effectors of active GTP-bound Ras. The direct interaction with Ras recruits the cytosolic Raf kinases to the plasma membrane and disrupts their autoinhibited state. Ras binding also promotes changes in Raf phosphorylation and induces Raf dimer formation, which is now recognised to be a required step in the Raf activation process. The Raf kinases can dimerise with any of the other Raf family members, and although the factors that determine the dimerisation preferences are poorly understood, B-Raf/C-Raf heterodimers predominate in Ras-dependent signalling (Figure 1a). The Raf kinase domains contact one another through a side-to-side dimer interface, and as a result of protomer transactivation, a catalytically active kinase conformation is assumed, resulting in the phosphorylation and activation of MEK. MEK, in turn, phosphorylates and activates ERK, which plays a critical role in the forward transmission of signals and contributes to inhibitory feedback loops that control the duration and amplitude of pathway signalling. With respect to the inhibitory feedback regulation, active ERK phosphorylates multiple components of the Ras pathway, including the Sos guanine nucleotide exchange factors and members of the Raf family. These phosphorylation events have an overall effect of attenuating signal transmission and, in the case of Raf, disrupt both Ras binding and Raf dimerisation.

### A transcriptional MAPK pathway activity score (MPAS) is a clinically relevant biomarker in multiple cancer types [^114Gwir7]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a conserved developmental pathway that regulates organ development and tissue homeostasis by transmitting signals through a series of phosphorylation events emanating from receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), RAS family members, RAF family members, mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) (MAP2K1/2), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) (MAPK3/1). Nuclear translocation of activated ERK1/2 then triggers the transcriptional activation of multiple target genes involved in modulating the cellular processes of differentiation, proliferation, survival, migration, and angiogenesis. Enhanced MAPK pathway activity can be driven by genetic alterations (including amplification and genetic mutations) in RTKs and RAS/RAF family members, as well as aberrant growth factor signaling. The high prevalence of aberrant MAPK signaling in cancer has motivated the clinical development of inhibitors targeting critical pathway nodes, including BRAF V600 -mutant selective inhibitors, pan-RAF inhibitors, MEK1/2 inhibitors, and ERK1/2 inhibitors. – Currently, there are at least 20 different MEK, RAF, and ERK inhibitors being tested alone or in combination with other drugs in active clinical trials according to. While single genetic events may not always correspond to pathway hyperactivation in tumors, in some instances, these drugs have demonstrated therapeutic benefit alone or in combination in pre-selected patient populations defined by genetic mutations. For example, treatment of BRAF V600E or BRAF V600K mutant melanoma patients with BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib or dabrafenib) increases overall survival, and the combination with MEK1/2 inhibitors (cobimetinib or trametinib) achieves deeper MAPK pathway inhibition, resulting in improved clinical efficacy. – However, clinical responses to MAPK pathway inhibition in mutant BRAF populations outside of melanoma are more variable, and the therapeutic benefit of MEK1/2 inhibitors trametinib, selumetinib, and refametinib does not appear to be associated with KRAS mutation status in lung cancer or pancreatic cancer. – ERK phosphorylation also varies extensively across cell lines and does not predict MEK inhibitor sensitivity. Together, these observations suggest that neither BRAF/ KRAS mutation status nor ERK phosphorylation status alone are sufficiently reliable biomarkers of MAPK pathway activity in multiple cancer indications and that additional, clinically translatable biomarkers are needed.

### The clinical development of MEK inhibitors [^113SZjvn]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2014). Medium credibility.

Aberrant activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway occurs in more than 30% of human cancers. As part of this pathway, MEK1 and MEK2 have crucial roles in tumorigenesis, cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis and, therefore, MEK1/2 inhibition is an attractive therapeutic strategy in a number of cancers. Highly selective and potent non-ATP-competitive allosteric MEK1/2 inhibitors have been developed and assessed in numerous clinical studies over the past decade. These agents are not efficacious in a broad range of unselected cancers, although single-agent antitumour activity has been detected mainly in tumours that harbour mutations in genes encoding the members of the RAS and RAF protein families, such as certain melanomas. Combinations of MEK1/2 inhibitors and cytotoxic chemotherapy, and/or other targeted agents are being studied to expand the efficacy of this class of agents. Identifying predictive biomarkers, and delineating de novo and acquired resistance mechanisms are essential for the future clinical development of MEK inhibitors. We discuss the clinical experience with MEK inhibitors to date, and consider the novel approaches to MEK-inhibitor therapy that might improve outcomes and lead to the wider use of such treatments.

### Is B-raf a good therapeutic target for melanoma and other malignancies? [^111ukwjP]. Cancer Research (2008). Low credibility.

The RAF family members, A-Raf, B-Raf, and C-Raf (or Raf-1), are intermediate molecules in the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase [Ras/Raf/MAP kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) kinase (MEK)/Erk] pathway, which relays extracellular signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus via a cascade of phosphorylation events ultimately promoting cancer development. This pathway is activated by mutation in approximately 7% of all human cancers. B-Raf is one of the proteins frequently mutated to an active form during tumor development. Therefore, B-Raf is an attractive cancer target but lack of clinical efficacy using agents targeting this protein has raised serious doubts about its therapeutic utility. Design of more effective B-Raf inhibitory agents, targeting other members of the signaling cascade for greater clinical efficacy or inhibiting B-Raf in combination with other targets, is being evaluated to resolve these perplexing issues. Here, we discuss recent progress, using preclinical models and clinical studies, to resolve the controversy of whether B-Raf would be a good therapeutic target for melanoma and other malignancies.

The very recent discovery of B-RAF point mutations as the most prevalent genetic alteration in papillary thyroid carcinoma has revolutionized the molecular knowledge of thyroid malignancies. In this review, we address the role played by such mutations in the etiopathogenesis, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy selection of thyroid cancer, with an emphasis on papillary carcinoma.

### Advances in the development of cancer therapeutics directed against the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway [^113pk1ib]. Clinical Cancer Research (2008). Low credibility.

Among mammalian mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades, the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway has received the most attention in the oncology drug discovery arena. By virtue of its central role in promoting proliferation, survival, and metastasis, this pathway directly affects both the formation and progression of human tumors. The identification of non-ATP-competitive inhibitors of the MAPK kinase MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) resulted in the first demonstration that the ERK pathway could be effectively shut down in a highly selective fashion. Subsequent discovery of the oncogenic nature of B-raf kinase led to the escalation of drug discovery efforts revolving around MEK and RAF. The emergence of multiple drug candidates targeting these downstream kinases provides us with the means for validating the importance of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade in human tumors. This article highlights the lessons learned in the clinical evaluation of MAPK pathway inhibitors as anticancer agents and the complexities surrounding optimization of their therapeutic potential in light of the challenges posed by genetic heterogeneity within patient populations.

### Clonal selection confers distinct evolutionary trajectories in BRAF-driven cancers [^112ECiQi]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Estimates of the selection, or effect size, of well-known drivers have been previously reported. These methods, however, are dependent on the prevalence of individual variants in a cancer type and, therefore, may not be sufficiently powered to predict selection for rarer drivers. The vast majority of non-V600E mutations in BRAF occur at very low frequencies within and across cancer types (Fig. 1a). Despite their rare occurrences, phenotypic profiling of some these variants indicated functional significance as defined by pathway activation and growth (Fig. 1e, f). Therefore, a critical advantage of our framework is the ability to estimate selection based on an individual patient's bulk sequencing data independent of a variant's prevalence in cancer.

Activating BRAF mutants signal as either active monomers (class 1), constitutively active dimers (class 2), or as kinase-dead or -impaired mutants that are RAS-dependent (class 3). Class 1 and 2 mutant signaling has been shown to be effectively blocked by BRAFi, whereas class 3 mutants appear to be insensitive to BRAFi but sensitive to MEKi. Critically, we used BRAFi and/or MEKi in a manner informed by the class of the variant such that downstream Raf-Mek signaling was effectively blocked in an variant-independent manner. This permitted us to examine the effects of distinct classes of variants on tumor response without the confounding effects of the specific molecular interactions between variant types and individual BRAFi.

### Personalizing therapy for colorectal cancer [^113qwTym]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide. Several important scientific discoveries in the molecular biology of CRC have changed clinical practice in oncology. These included the comprehensive genome-wide profiling of CRC by the Cancer Genome Atlas Network, the discovery of mutations along the RAS-RAF signaling pathway as major determinants of response to antibodies against the epidermal growth factor receptor, the elucidation of new molecular subsets of CRC or gene signatures that may predict clinical outcome after adjuvant chemotherapy, and the innovative targeting of the family of vascular endothelial growth factor and receptors. These new data have allowed oncologists to individualize drug therapy on the basis of a patient's tumor's unique molecular profile, especially in the management of metastatic CRC. This review article will discuss the progress of personalized medicine in the contemporary management of CRC.

### Genomically driven tumors and actionability across histologies: BRAF-Mutant cancers as a paradigm [^115suHnC]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

The diagnosis, classification, and management of cancer are traditionally dictated by the site of tumor origin, for example, breast or lung, and by specific histologic subtypes of site-of-origin cancers (e.g., non-small cell versus small cell lung cancer). However, with the advent of sequencing technologies allowing for rapid, low cost, and accurate sequencing of clinical samples, new observations suggest an expanded or different approach to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer-one driven by the unique molecular features of the tumor. We discuss a genomically driven strategy for cancer treatment using BRAF as an example. Several key points are highlighted: (i) molecular aberrations can be shared across cancers; (ii) approximately 15% of all cancers harbor BRAF mutations; and (iii) BRAF inhibitors, while approved only for melanoma, have reported activity across numerous cancers and related disease types bearing BRAF aberrations. However, BRAF-mutated colorectal cancer has shown poor response rate to BRAF inhibitor monotherapy, striking a cautionary note. Yet, even in this case, emerging data suggest BRAF-mutated colorectal cancers can respond well to BRAF inhibitors, albeit when administered in combination with other agents that impact resistance pathways. Taken together, these data suggest that molecular aberrations may be the basis for a new nosology for cancer. Mol Cancer Ther; 15(4); 533–47. ©2016 AACR.

### Targeting the raf kinases in human cancer: the raf dimer dilemma [^112hbN2F]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

First generation Raf inhibitors: the dimer dilemma

Early efforts targeting the Raf kinases were focused on inhibitors that showed high specificity towards V600E-B-Raf, given its prominent role as a cancer driver. Vemurafenib and dabrafenib were the first of these drugs to gain FDA approval, and they displayed an unprecedented therapeutic effect in melanomas possessing V600E mutations, with over 90% of patients showing some degree of tumour regression and 50–60% achieving partial to complete responses. Somewhat surprisingly, however, these inhibitors had little activity in tumours possessing RTK or Ras mutations, and they had limited clinical benefit in other cancer types with activating B-Raf mutations. Moreover, despite the impressive initial responses in melanomas with V600E-B-Raf mutations, the majority of patients relapsed within a year due to drug resistance. In addition, some patients with responsive tumours developed secondary malignancies during treatment, most frequently squamous cell carcinomas and keratoacanthomas, many of which possessed activating Ras mutations.

Insights regarding these unexpected findings first came from the analysis of melanoma lines expressing either V600E-B-Raf or mutant Ras proteins, where the inhibitors were found to block ERK activation in the V600E-B-Raf lines, but paradoxically activate ERK in Ras mutant cells. Subsequent studies revealed that drug resistance to vemurafenib or dabrafenib could often be attributed to cellular conditions or mutational alterations where ERK activation was dependent on Raf dimerisation. Through extensive structure/function studies, it is now known that an underlying explanation for these findings resides in how these first-generation inhibitors contact the Raf catalytic domain and impact both dimer formation and dimer activity (Figure 2).
