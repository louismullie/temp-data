## Question

Mslt vs mwt

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to use the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) versus the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT), how to execute them properly, and how to interpret results across scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical objective and the constructs each test measures. Then, I should confirm diagnostic thresholds and guideline-based protocols. Next, I will review patient-specific modifiers and medication effects. After that, I should verify execution details, including pitfalls like motivation and circadian timing. Finally, I will interpret results in context, integrate subjective and objective measures, apply them to common scenarios, and align with current guidelines before concluding.

> Let me first clarify the core constructs, because choosing the correct test hinges on this distinction: the MSLT measures physiologic sleep propensity, while the MWT measures manifest ability to resist sleepiness during a monotonous task, and concordance between them is low, so they are not interchangeable and should be selected based on the clinical question rather than availability or convenience [^113av4SA].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic use case for MSLT: when the question is "what is the cause of excessive daytime sleepiness", the MSLT is the primary objective test after excluding common confounders like obstructive sleep apnea, insufficient or irregular sleep, and circadian misalignment, with narcolepsy typically defined by mean sleep latency of 8 minutes or less and at least two SOREMPs, noting that pediatric data validate a very similar cutoff of 8.2 minutes and ≥ 2 SOREMPs for narcolepsy type 1 and support the combined PSG + MSLT approach in high pretest probability settings [^113U5RXK] [^116ygG34].

> Next, I should review when the MWT is the right tool: when the question is "can this patient stay awake sufficiently to function safely or is treatment working", the MWT is preferred, correlates modestly with real driving performance (e.g., inappropriate line crossings), and is the regulatory endpoint for wake-promoting agents such as modafinil, armodafinil, solriamfetol, and sodium oxybate in relevant indications, although it is not a direct surrogate for real-world crash risk and should be combined with broader functional assessments in safety-critical decisions [^1179Ry93] [^116VBtPU] [^117E9eUK] [^115t6NY3] [^113av4SA].

> I need to consider patient-specific modifiers carefully because they can substantially change test selection and interpretation: in pediatrics, MSLT cutoffs are validated for narcolepsy type 1 whereas MWT normative data are limited though feasibility for treatment monitoring exists; in Parkinson's disease, neither test is validated and subjective-objective dissociation is common; in shift workers, circadian misalignment undermines both tests; and in psychiatric hypersomnolence, pathologic MSLT latencies occur in around 25% despite different mechanisms, underscoring poor discriminant validity in that subgroup [^116y5F5P] [^112nPqeo] [^113av4SA] [^114MW1ze].

> Wait, let me verify medication and substance effects before testing because they are frequent and impactful: stimulant or antidepressant use reduces the likelihood of repeat-positive MSLT; dopamine agonists in Parkinson's disease can shift subjective versus objective measures; and routine urine drug screening identifies unreported substances in about 16% of referrals, all of which can confound MSLT or MWT interpretation and should be addressed in preparation and documentation [^111msYEc] [^113kHC2a] [^113MsvtK].

> I will now examine protocol execution for MSLT under current guidance: perform after an overnight PSG confirming adequate sleep, enforce appropriate medication washout and abstain from caffeine and alcohol, schedule 4 to 5 nap opportunities at two-hour intervals, and consider a fifth nap when mean sleep latency is borderline or only one SOREMP is present after four naps, given the fifth nap tends to increase mean sleep latency by about 0.5 minutes and can change interpretation in a small subset, which argues for conditional use rather than routine five-nap testing [^115t6NY3] [^113U5RXK].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check MWT implementation details because termination rules can differ by protocol and study: standard clinical MWT protocols use four trials after the prior night PSG with a darkened room, upright posture, and neutral instructions to remain awake as long as possible; the 40-minute version is superior to 20-minute trials for detecting impairment in highly motivated subjects and should be preferred when fitness for duty is at stake; I initially thought termination occurs at 20 minutes if no sleep, but that applies to specific drug-trial MWT20 paradigms and older labeling, whereas the clinical MWT40 runs to 40 minutes if no sleep occurs, so I need to align termination criteria with the chosen protocol and purpose [^115t6NY3] [^112VzHAd] [^116VBtPU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about validity without addressing motivation and circadian timing; highly motivated individuals can prolong wakefulness on MWT, and while MWT40 mitigates this, it does not eliminate it, and the circadian wake maintenance zone in the early evening can transiently improve performance, so testing should be scheduled consistently and interpreted with awareness of motivation and circadian phase to avoid false reassurance or overcalling impairment [^112VzHAd] [^115t6NY3] [^115rGNX5].

> Next, I should review MSLT interpretation and reliability because they differ by phenotype: reproducibility is high in narcolepsy type 1 but poor in narcolepsy type 2 and idiopathic hypersomnia, where diagnoses change on retesting due to shifts in mean latency and SOREMP counts; the sleep stage of origin for SOREMPs can aid specificity, with NREM1-origin SOREMPs more typical of narcolepsy, whereas behaviorally induced insufficient sleep often shows SOREMPs from NREM2; additionally, SOREMPs are not evenly distributed across naps, with a lower probability in the fourth nap, which, together with the small but real fifth-nap effects, argues for careful, context-aware interpretation [^111msYEc] [^1141te1h] [^114VEp29] [^1149iRmi] [^113U5RXK].

> I will now examine MWT interpretation thresholds and what constitutes a meaningful change: normative data are limited and context-specific, but in CPAP-treated OSA cohorts an MWT mean latency of 40 minutes is often used as a conservative lower limit of normal wakefulness, and improvements of roughly 2 to 3 minutes have been considered clinically meaningful in drug trials, although individual-level inference should be paired with functional outcomes and adherence or disease-burden metrics such as hypoxic burden and arousal index [^116gPe7D].

> But wait, what if subjective and objective measures disagree; I need to integrate them rather than choose one over the other: correlations between ESS and MSLT or MWT are weak, caregiver-rated ESS can sometimes track objective measures slightly better than self-report, and actigraphy-verified total sleep time in the week or two preceding MSLT correlates with mean sleep latency and helps identify sleep restriction bias, so ESS and actigraphy should be obtained routinely alongside objective testing for a more complete phenotype [^11598BVW] [^1179NHce] [^111DNrWP].

> Let me think about scenario-based application to solidify this: for a 35-year-old with significant sleepiness and suspected narcolepsy after OSA is excluded, I would order PSG followed by MSLT with appropriate washout and consider a fifth nap if borderline or with only one SOREMP; if results are non-diagnostic but suspicion remains high, I would repeat under stricter preparation and review medications for REM-suppressing agents that might blunt SOREMPs [^115t6NY3] [^116y5F5P].

> Now, for a commercial driver with treated OSA and residual sleepiness where safety and licensure are central, I should use MWT40 to assess ability to sustain wakefulness, interpret alongside ESS and, ideally, a driving simulator or psychomotor vigilance measure, and ensure CPAP adherence and physiologic disease control including hypoxic burden are optimized before attributing risk solely to residual sleepiness [^112VzHAd] [^1179Ry93] [^116gPe7D].

> For a patient with narcolepsy on wake-promoting therapy where we need to assess treatment efficacy or titration, I should select MWT as an objective endpoint aligned with regulatory precedents and time the testing relative to dosing to understand durability across the day, while recognizing that changes of a few minutes on MWT can be meaningful but should be interpreted with patient-reported outcomes and functional goals [^117E9eUK] [^116VBtPU].

> Next, I should review and align with guidelines so I am not missing consensus expectations: the 2021 AASM protocols detail adult MSLT and MWT preparation, scheduling, conditions, and documentation; the AASM treatment guideline supports use of MWT to assess response in central hypersomnolence; and European guidelines for narcolepsy emphasize comprehensive assessment using both tests where appropriate rather than relying on a single measure [^115t6NY3].

> I need to ensure documentation is complete and transparent because interpretive validity depends on it: I will record medication washout, caffeine and alcohol abstinence, sleep duration verification with logs and preferably actigraphy, test environment details, raw nap latencies, SOREMP occurrences with sleep stage of origin, and an interpretation that explicitly situates results within clinical context and acknowledges limitations such as motivation, circadian factors, and test-retest variability [^115t6NY3] [^111DNrWP] [^111msYEc].

> Final check and synthesis before concluding: MSLT and MWT measure different constructs and have low concordance, so the test must match the question — MSLT for diagnosis of central hypersomnolence disorders and MWT for functional safety and treatment monitoring — while both require rigorous protocol adherence, awareness of population-specific limitations, careful integration with subjective measures and actigraphy, and, when needed, retesting to address variability and confounders [^113MJwW9] [^11598BVW] [^115t6NY3].

The MSLT and MWT are complementary tests: the **MSLT measures sleep propensity** [^113MJwW9] and is used to diagnose narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia [^113o42kk], whereas the **MWT measures the ability to stay awake** [^114Ctind] and is used to assess treatment response [^117E9eUK], fitness for duty [^112VzHAd], and driving risk [^1179Ry93]. The MSLT consists of 4–5 nap opportunities with eyes closed, and a mean sleep latency ≤ 8 minutes with ≥ 2 SOREMPs supports narcolepsy [^116y5F5P]; the MWT consists of 4 trials with eyes open [^115t6NY3], and a **mean latency ≥ 40 minutes indicates normal wakefulness** [^116gPe7D]. The MSLT is more sensitive to sleep deprivation [^111DNrWP] and medications, whereas the MWT is less affected by these factors; both require standardized protocols and careful interpretation [^115t6NY3].

## Purpose and clinical applications

| **Test** | **Primary purpose** | **Clinical applications** |
|-|-|-|
| MSLT | Measures sleep propensity (tendency to fall asleep) [^115t6NY3] | - Diagnosis of narcolepsy [^113MJwW9] <br/> - Idiopathic hypersomnia [^113o42kk] <br/> - Other central disorders of hypersomnolence |
| MWT | Measures ability to stay awake in monotonous situations [^115t6NY3] | - Assessment of treatment response [^117E9eUK] <br/> - Fitness for duty [^112VzHAd] <br/> - Driving risk [^1179Ry93] <br/> - Occupational safety [^113o42kk] |

## Test protocols and procedures

### Multiple sleep latency test (MSLT)

- **Procedure**: Four to five nap opportunities at 2-hour intervals after overnight PSG; patient lies in a dark, quiet room with eyes closed, instructed to fall asleep [^115t6NY3].
- **Measurements**: Mean sleep latency (time to sleep onset) and number of sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs) [^115t6NY3].
- **Interpretation**: Mean latency ≤ 8 minutes with ≥ 2 SOREMPs supports narcolepsy [^115t6NY3]; mean latency ≤ 8 minutes without SOREMPs suggests idiopathic hypersomnia.

---

### Maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT)

- **Procedure**: Four trials at 2-hour intervals after overnight PSG; patient sits upright in a dimly lit room with eyes open, instructed to stay awake [^115t6NY3].
- **Measurements**: Mean sleep latency (time to sleep onset) [^114Ctind].
- **Interpretation**: Mean latency ≥ 40 minutes indicates normal wakefulness [^116gPe7D]; shorter latencies indicate impaired ability to stay awake [^112VzHAd].

## Limitations and confounding factors

### Multiple sleep latency test (MSLT)

For the MSLT, **limitations** include sensitivity to sleep deprivation [^111DNrWP], medications [^113MsvtK], and circadian factors [^115rGNX5]; variable test-retest reliability in some populations [^1141te1h]; and results that may not reflect real-life sleepiness [^113MJwW9]. Confounding factors include sleep deprivation [^111DNrWP], medications [^113MsvtK], circadian rhythm disturbances [^115rGNX5], psychiatric conditions [^114MW1ze], and motivation [^112T8mL8].

---

### Maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT)

For the MWT, **limitations** include susceptibility to motivation [^112T8mL8] and environmental factors [^115t6NY3]; results may not reflect real-life wakefulness [^113MJwW9]; and limited normative data [^113MJwW9]. Confounding factors include motivation [^112T8mL8], medications [^113MsvtK], environmental factors [^115t6NY3], and psychiatric conditions [^114MW1ze].

## Summary of key differences

| **Aspect** | **MSLT** | **MWT** |
|-|-|-|
| Primary measure | Sleep propensity | Ability to stay awake |
| Clinical use | Diagnosis of narcolepsy and hypersomnia [^115t6NY3] | Assessment of treatment response [^117E9eUK], fitness for duty [^112VzHAd], driving risk [^1179Ry93] |
| Procedure | Nap opportunities, eyes closed [^115t6NY3] | Trials, eyes open [^113mDB17] |
| Sensitivity | Sensitive to sleep deprivation [^111DNrWP] and medications | More robust to sleep deprivation and medications |
| Limitations | Poor test-retest reliability [^1141te1h], influenced by external factors | Influenced by motivation [^112T8mL8], limited normative data [^113MJwW9] |

The MSLT and MWT are **complementary tests** that assess different aspects of sleepiness and wakefulness [^115t6NY3]. The MSLT is used primarily to diagnose narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia, whereas the MWT is used to assess treatment response [^117E9eUK], fitness for duty [^112VzHAd], and driving risk [^1179Ry93]. Both have limitations and confounding factors that must be considered during interpretation [^113MJwW9].

### Maintenance of wakefulness test, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, and driving risk [^1179Ry93]. Annals of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Sleepiness at the wheel is a major risk factor for traffic accidents. Because of the potential medical and legal implications, this study evaluated the correlation between subjective and objective measures of sleepiness and driving performances in patients suffering from excessive daytime sleepiness.

- **Methods**: Thirty-eight untreated sleep apnea patients (mean age ± standard deviation, 51 ± 9 years; mean apnea-hypopnea index ± standard deviation, 41 ± 25) and 14 healthy control subjects (mean age ± standard deviation, 46 ± 9 years) were included in the study. Nocturnal polysomnography, mean sleep latency measured by four 40-minute Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) trials, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, and the number of inappropriate line crossings during a 90-minute real-life driving session were analyzed.

- **Results**: The number of inappropriate line crossings correlated with MWT scores (Spearman's Rho: r = -0.339; p < 0.05), Karolinska Sleepiness Scale scores measured at halfway in total driving distance (Rho: r = 0.367; p < 0.01), and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (Rho: r = 0.389; p < 0.01). There was a significant difference in the number of inappropriate line crossings among the four groups defined by MWT scores: very sleepy (0–19 minutes), sleepy (20–33 minutes), alert (34–40 minutes), and controls (Kruskal-Wallis test: H = 11.319; p < 0.01). Very sleepy and sleepy patients had more inappropriate line crossings than control drivers (p < 0.05).

### Testing sleepiness and vigilance in the sleep laboratory [^113o42kk]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a common and potentially devastating public health challenge. EDS has been implicated as a contributing factor to workplace injury, motor vehicle accidents, cardiovascular disease, and impaired quality of life. Subjective self-report measures have failed to sufficiently quantify EDS; therefore, the use of objective tools found in sleep laboratories is fundamental in managing patients with EDS. This review provides an overview of the methods used to quantify sleepiness and highlights recent advances.

The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), normally used for the diagnosis of narcolepsy, can be a useful tool in recognizing other forms of sleepiness. Additionally, the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) has been confirmed as an important test to identify EDS and provide an indicator of future risk of accidents. Recent modifications and newer tests have been discussed, with potential applications for the future.

Objective tests such as the MSLT and MWT are useful in the diagnosis and management of patients with EDS. However, the relatively high cost can restrict their overall usefulness in clinical medicine. Newer, simpler tests are under development.

### Multiple sleep latency test and maintenance of wakefulness test [^113MJwW9]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

Excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue are common complaints in the sleep clinic. The objective evaluation and quantification of these symptoms is important for both the diagnosis of underlying health problems and for gauging treatment response. The multiple sleep latency test measures physiologic sleepiness, whereas the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) aims to measure manifest sleepiness. Neither test correlates well with subjective measures of sleep, such as the Epworth sleepiness scale and the Stanford sleepiness scale. In 2005, updated practice parameters were published, promoting the standardization of testing procedures.

In recent years, there has been an effort to document daytime sleepiness when associated with occupational risk. However, these laboratory-based tests may not reflect or predict real-life experience. Normative data for both tests, particularly the MWT, are limited and are inadequate for the evaluation of pediatric patients, shift workers, and others.

Regarding the medical management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, particularly with respect to managing insomnia and fatigue, the ALSSC 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining an appropriate evaluation for insomnia, as it may have multiple causes, such as respiratory insufficiency and depression. It is suggested to consider respiratory investigations and sleep studies to determine the type and cause of insomnia.

### European guideline and expert statements on the management of narcolepsy in adults and children [^114DZNgy]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of narcolepsy, particularly focusing on agents with no evidence of benefit, the EAN 2021 guidelines recommend not to use the following agents in patients with narcolepsy, regardless of age:

- **Corticosteroids**: Their use is not supported due to lack of evidence.
- **Monoclonal antibodies**: These agents are not recommended as they have shown no benefit.
- **IVIG**: Intravenous immunoglobulin is not advised for managing narcolepsy in any age group.

### The MSLT is repeatable in narcolepsy type 1 but not narcolepsy type 2: A retrospective patient study [^111msYEc]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The study aimed to examine repeatability of Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) results in narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) and narcolepsy type 2 (NT2) according to the criteria of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, Third Edition (ICSD-3).

- **Methods**: Repeatability of the MSLT was retrospectively evaluated in NT1 (n = 60), NT2 (n = 54) cases, and controls (n = 15). All subjects had documented HLA-DQB1✱06:02 status and/or hypocretin-1 levels from cerebrospinal fluid. Each subject underwent two MSLTs, with at least one meeting the ICSD-3 criteria for narcolepsy. Repeatability was explored in children versus adults and in those on versus not on medication(s). Subsample and multivariate analyses were performed.

- **Results**: Both MSLTs in unmedicated patients were positive for narcolepsy in 78%, 18%, and 7% of NT1, NT2, and controls, respectively. NT2 cases changed to idiopathic hypersomnia or to a negative MSLT 26% and 57% of the time, respectively. Although NT1 cases were 10 to 14 times more likely to demonstrate a second positive MSLT compared to NT2 cases (P < .00001) and controls (P < .0001), NT2 cases were not significantly different from controls (P = 0.64). Medication use (P = 0.009), but not adult versus children status (P = 0.85), significantly decreased the likelihood of a repeat positive MSLT.

- **Conclusions**: In a clinical setting, a positive MSLT for narcolepsy is a more reproducible and stable feature in NT1 than NT2. The retrospective design of this study hinders interpretation of these data, as there are many different, and possibly opposing, reasons to report.

### Self-evaluated and close relative-evaluated Epworth Sleepiness Scale vs. multiple sleep latency test in patients with obstructive sleep apnea [^11598BVW]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The aims of this study were to determine (1) the agreement in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) evaluated by patients and their close relatives (CRs), and (2) the correlation of objective sleepiness as measured by multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) with self-evaluated and close relative-evaluated ESS.

A total of 85 consecutive patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (70 males, age 46.7 ± 12.9 years) with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) > 5 events per hour (mean 38.9 ± 26.8/h) were recruited into this study. All participants underwent an overnight polysomnographic assessment (PSG), MSLT, and ESS rated by both patients and their CRs. There was a strong correlation between self-evaluated and CR-evaluated ESS results (r = 0.88, p < 0.05). However, the Bland-Altman plot showed individual differences between self-evaluated and CR-evaluated ESS scores, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of -9.3 to 7.0. The mean sleep latency on MSLT was significantly associated with CR-evaluated ESS (r = -0.23, p < 0.05); the significance of association with self-evaluated ESS was marginal (r = -0.21, p = 0.05).

CR-evaluated ESS has a good correlation but also significant individual disagreement with self-evaluated ESS in Chinese patients with OSA. CR-evaluated ESS performs as well as, if not better than, self-evaluated ESS in this population when referring to MSLT.

### ECTRIMS/EAN guideline on the pharmacological treatment of people with multiple sclerosis [^1175W9dD]. Multiple Sclerosis (2018). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, specifically concerning monitoring indications, the ECTRIMS/EAN 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining a standardized reference brain MRI when monitoring treatment safety in patients with multiple sclerosis treated with disease-modifying drugs:

- **Low risk for PML**: Every year.
- **High risk for PML (JC virus-positive, natalizumab treatment duration > 18 months)**: More frequent MRI (on a 3–6 monthly basis).
- **High risk for PML and switching drugs**: At the time the treatment is discontinued and after the new treatment is started.

### Sleep stage sequence analysis of sleep onset REM periods in the hypersomnias [^114VEp29]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) remains an important diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of hypersomnias. However, a positive MSLT may be found in other sleep disorders, such as behaviorally induced inadequate sleep syndrome (BIISS). It has been demonstrated that in sleep onset rapid eye movement (SOREM) periods in BIISS, REM sleep tends to arise from stage 2 sleep (non-REM (NREM) 2) rather than stage 1 sleep (NREM1), as in narcolepsy.

- **Methods**: We performed sleep stage sequence analysis on 127 patients with nocturnal polysomnography and MSLT, including 25 with narcolepsy with cataplexy (N+C), 41 with narcolepsy without cataplexy (N-C), 21 with idiopathic hypersomnia with long sleep time (IHL), 20 with BIISS, and 20 with periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD). A total of 537 naps were recorded, containing 176 SOREM periods.

- **Results**: All SOREM periods in the IHL, BIISS, and PLMD groups arose from NREM2 sleep. In the N+C group, 75% of SOREM periods arose from NREM1, whereas in the N-C group, only 52% arose from NREM1. Within the N-C group, those with SOREM periods all arising from stage 1 had a shorter MSL (p = 0.02).

- **Conclusions**: These results suggest that SOREM periods arising from NREM1 have high sensitivity for the diagnosis of narcolepsy and that SOREM periods from NREM1 are a marker of severity, either of sleepiness or REM instability. Sleep stage sequence analysis of SOREM periods may also aid in more accurate phenotyping of the hypersomnias and, in particular, clarify heterogeneity among patients with narcolepsy without cataplexy.

### Clinical practice guideline for diagnostic testing for adult obstructive sleep apnea: An American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^112J4Mu5]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults and is intended for use in conjunction with other American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines on the evaluation and treatment of sleep-disordered breathing in adults.

- **Methods**: The AASM commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine. A systematic review was conducted to identify studies, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) process was used to assess the evidence. The task force developed recommendations and assigned strengths based on the quality of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use. In addition, the task force adopted foundational recommendations from prior guidelines as "good practice statements" that establish the basis for appropriate and effective diagnosis of OSA. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

- **Recommendations**: The following recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians diagnosing OSA in adults. Under GRADE, a strong recommendation is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A weak recommendation reflects a lower degree of certainty regarding the outcome and appropriateness of the patient-care strategy for all patients. The ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific care must be made by the clinician in light of the individual circumstances presented by the patient, available diagnostic tools, accessible treatment options, and resources.

### Provigil [^113dQrVD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

The effectiveness of Provigil in improving wakefulness in patients with excessive sleepiness associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was established in two multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical studies of patients who met the criteria for OSA. These criteria include either:

- **Excessive sleepiness or insomnia**: Plus frequent episodes of impaired breathing during sleep, with associated features such as loud snoring, morning headaches, and dry mouth upon awakening.

- **Excessive sleepiness or insomnia with polysomnography**: Demonstrating one of the following: more than five obstructive apneas, each greater than 10 seconds in duration, per hour of sleep, and one or more of the following: frequent arousals from sleep associated with the apneas, bradytachycardia, and arterial oxygen desaturation in association with the apneas.

For entry into these studies, all patients were required to have excessive sleepiness as demonstrated by a score ≥ 10 on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), despite treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Evidence that CPAP was effective in reducing episodes of apnea/hypopnea was required, along with documentation of CPAP use.

In the first study, a 12-week trial, a total of 327 patients with OSA were randomized to receive Provigil 200 mg/day, Provigil 400 mg/day, or matching placebo. The majority of patients (80%) were fully compliant with CPAP, defined as CPAP use greater than 4 hours/night on more than 70% of nights. The remainder were partially CPAP compliant, defined as CPAP use on 30% of nights.

### Neural network analysis of sleep stages enables efficient diagnosis of narcolepsy [^116ygG34]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

High pretest probability sample

MSLTs are typically performed in patients with daytime sleepiness that cannot be explained by OSA, insufficient/disturbed sleep, or circadian disturbances. These patients have a higher pretest probability of having T1N than random clinical patients. Patients are then diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, or subjective sleepiness based on MSLT results, cataplexy symptoms, and HLA results (if available). To test whether our detector differentiates T1N from these other cases with unexplained sleepiness, we conducted a post hoc analysis of the detector performance in these subjects extracted from both the test and replication datasets.

### Sunosi [^117E9eUK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

At Week 12, doses of 37.5 mg, 75 mg, and 150 mg of Sunosi all demonstrated improvements in wakefulness compared to placebo. This was assessed in test sessions 1 (approximately 1 hour post-dose) through 5 (approximately 9 hours post-dose) of the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT). Nighttime sleep, as measured with polysomnography, was not affected by the use of Sunosi in Study 2. Patients' compliance with a primary OSA therapy device was similar across the placebo and Sunosi treatment groups at baseline and did not change during the 12-week study period in any treatment group.

- **Maintenance of wakefulness test improvements**: Maintenance of Wakefulness Test Improvements in Test Sessions 1 through 5 in patients with OSA in Study 2 at Week 12.

- **Maintenance of efficacy in narcolepsy and OSA**: The maintenance of the effect of Sunosi in improving wakefulness and reducing excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy and OSA was assessed in two randomized-withdrawal, placebo-controlled studies, Study 3 (NCT02348619) and Study 4 (NCT02348632).

Study 3 was a 6-week, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized-withdrawal study in 174 adult patients with a diagnosis of OSA. The co-primary efficacy endpoints were the change from the beginning to the end of the randomized withdrawal period in MWT and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). During a 2-week, open-label titration phase, patients were started on Sunosi 75 mg once daily and were titrated to the maximum tolerable dose between 75 mg and 300 mg per day, which is two times the maximum recommended daily dose. Patients continued on this dose for a 2-week stable-dose phase.

### Forty- versus 20-minute trials of the maintenance of wakefulness test regimen for licensing of drivers [^112VzHAd]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective assessment of the ability to maintain wakefulness, although very important, is still equivocal. A recent study from our lab has shown that the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT), when performed with the 20-minute protocol (MWT20), is unreliable in assessing patients who are highly motivated to maintain wakefulness. In this study, we sought to examine whether the 40-minute protocol (MWT40) is a better tool in assessing such individuals.

- **Methods**: One hundred sixty-four consecutive subjects referred to our sleep lab by the Medical Institute for Driving Safety were studied. All subjects underwent a full-night polysomnogram followed by an MWT, 4 trials of 40 minutes each. All subjects knew that if they failed the wakefulness test, their driving license would be revoked.

- **Results**: Forty-one subjects out of 164 (25%) fell asleep at least once. Of 39 subjects with severe obstructive sleep apnea (respiratory disturbance index > 40/h), 19 fell asleep (48.7%). Of 13 subjects with a minimum oxygen saturation level below 65%, 7 fell asleep (53%). In the MWT20, only 7% of patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea fell asleep at least once.

- **Conclusions**: We conclude that the MWT40 is superior to the MWT20 in detecting difficulties maintaining wakefulness in a highly motivated population. However, our results yield a significantly lower detection of difficulties maintaining wakefulness than those reported in healthy subjects, suggesting that the MWT40 is also highly affected by motivation. We believe that, for a highly motivated population, such as for driving license candidates, the MWT40 should be considered a more effective tool.

### Influence of a post-test factor on the results of the multiple sleep latency test [^112CDqHQ]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) is the standard method for the objective measurement of excessive daytime sleepiness. It is well established that preceding factors may influence the MSLT result. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential influence of a post-test factor on the MSLT outcome.

For this retrospective study, we reviewed polysomnography (PSG) reports conducted between 2012 and 2013. PSG reports, including MSLT with at least four runs, were included. Patients were stratified into two groups: (1) those discharged immediately after the MSLT and (2) those discharged on the following day. For further analysis, we categorized the patients into three subgroups according to mean MSLT sleep latency: < 5 minutes, 5–9.9 minutes, and 10–19.9 minutes, corresponding to a pathological, borderline, and normal MSLT result.

A total of 2,749 PSG records were reviewed; 262 included MSLT and 241 met the inclusion criteria for the study. Of those, 152 patients were discharged immediately after the last MSLT run, while 89 were discharged on the following day. MSLT mean sleep latency and sleep latency of the last run only did not differ between both groups (p = 0.070 and p = 0.065). In the subgroup of patients with pathological MSLT, there was a trend towards prolonged sleep latency in the last run in patients discharged immediately after the test (p = 0.055).

Our findings suggest that the MSLT post-test factor of discharge timing has no major impact on the MSLT outcome.

Regarding medical management for narcolepsy, particularly the management of sleep paralysis and sleep-related hallucinations, the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) 2021 guidelines recommend considering the following medications for treating moderate-to-severe sleep paralysis and/or sleep-related hallucinations in patients with narcolepsy:

- **Sodium oxybate**: An effective treatment for improving symptoms.
- **Pitolisant**: Offers benefits through its action as a histamine receptor antagonist.
- **Antidepressants**: May be useful in some patients to alleviate symptoms.

### Validation of multiple sleep latency test for the diagnosis of pediatric narcolepsy type 1 [^116y5F5P]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

The objective of the study was to validate polysomnographic markers, specifically sleep latency and sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs) at the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and nocturnal polysomnography (PSG), for pediatric narcolepsy type 1 (NT1). This was measured against CSF hypocretin-1 (hcrt-1) deficiency and the presence of cataplexy, as no criteria are currently validated in children.

Clinical, neurophysiological, and, when available, biological data, such as HLA-DQB1✱06:02 positivity and CSF hcrt-1 levels, were collected from 357 consecutive children under 18 years of age who were evaluated for suspected narcolepsy. Best MSLT cutoffs were obtained through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis by contrasting patients with available CSF hcrt-1 assays (n = 228), with and without CSF hcrt-1 deficiency, and further validated against those patients without available CSF hcrt-1 but with cataplexy (n = 129).

Patients with CSF hcrt-1 deficiency were best recognized using the following criteria:

- **Mean MSLT sleep latency ≤ 8.2 minutes**: This had an area under the ROC curve of 0.985.
- **At least 2 SOREMPs at the MSLT**: This had an area under the ROC curve of 0.975.
- **Combined PSG + MSLT**: This had an area under the ROC curve of 0.977.

Although the specificity and sensitivity of reference MSLT sleep latency ≤ 8 minutes and ≥ 2 SOREMPs (including nocturnal SOREMPs) were 100% and 94.87%, respectively, the combination of MSLT sleep latency and SOREMP counts did not improve diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, variables such as age or sex did not significantly influence these results in the pediatric population.

Conclusions suggest that at least two SOREMPs or a mean sleep latency ≤ 8.2 minutes at the MSLT are valid and reliable markers for pediatric NT1 diagnosis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of autonomic failure, pain and sleep disturbances in Parkinson's disease: guideline "Parkinson's disease" of the German Society of Neurology [^113av4SA]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

How to diagnose excessive daytime sleepiness in PD?

The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) are considered the gold standard for objectively evaluating daytime sleepiness. Both tests require a sleep laboratory setting. The MWT measures the ability to stay awake in a monotonous situation, whereas the MSLT evaluates the time it takes to fall asleep in a monotonous situation. Due to these opposing concepts, the concordance between both tests is low. Of note, neither the MSLT nor the MWT have been validated in PD.

Assessments in individuals with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) also showed discrepancies between ESS scorings and objective measurements. MWT and driving simulation tests in OSA patients correlated with regard to driving capability. However, there is no evidence that MWT results correspond to driving accidents in the real world. ESS and MSLT did not correlate, but TAP-test and Psychomotor Vigilance Test Reaction Time results did correlate to driving simulator performance in OSA patients.

In PD, studies show that the subjective perception of sleepiness and the objectively measured probability of falling asleep unintentionally may deviate: every fourth PD individual did not perceive any sleepiness prior to daytime sleep tests, which objectively demonstrated sleep episodes. Evaluation of driving capability or potentially accident-prone daytime sleepiness in the work environment should therefore not rely on subjective perception, although there is no objective gold standard for diagnosing daytime sleepiness in PD individuals at present.

### Nuvigil [^116VBtPU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

The primary measures of effectiveness were: 1) sleep latency as assessed by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT), and 2) the change in the patient's overall disease status as measured by the CGI-C at the final visit [see Clinical Studies (14.1) for a description of these measures]. Each MWT test session was terminated after 20 minutes if no sleep occurred or immediately after sleep onset in this study.

Patients treated with NUVIGIL showed a statistically significant enhanced ability to remain awake on the MWT at each dose compared to placebo at the final visit. A statistically significant greater number of patients treated with NUVIGIL at each dose showed improvement in overall clinical condition as rated by the CGI-C scale at the final visit.

The two doses of NUVIGIL produced statistically significant effects of similar magnitudes on the CGI-C. Although a statistically significant effect on the MWT was observed for each dose, the magnitude of effect was greater for the higher dose.

Nighttime sleep measured with polysomnography was not affected by the use of NUVIGIL.

### Eszopiclone [^117TDNnK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Eszopiclone tablets are indicated for the treatment of insomnia. In controlled outpatient and sleep laboratory studies, eszopiclone tablets administered at bedtime decreased sleep latency and improved sleep maintenance. The clinical trials performed in support of efficacy were up to 6 months in duration. The final formal assessments of sleep latency and maintenance were performed at 4 weeks in the 6-week study (adults only), at the end of both 2-week studies (elderly only), and at the end of the 6-month study (adults only). Eszopiclone tablets have been shown to decrease sleep latency and improve sleep maintenance.

### Hypersomnia and depressive symptoms: Methodological and clinical aspects [^117AJ9Br]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective assessment of hypersomnia

A few studies have used objective methods to investigate extended nocturnal sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in mood disorders, but all reported no difference in mean sleep latency or sleep duration between patients with mood disorders and healthy controls. REM sleep was almost absent during daytime naps in the depressed phase of patients with bipolar disorder (BD). Hypersomnia complaints were independent of the mean sleep latency and were related more to lack of interest and decreased energy due to depression in BD.

Another study revealed neither pathological sleep latencies on the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) nor abnormal total sleep time on prolonged polysomnography (PSG) in patients with hypersomnia associated with mood disorders, such as dysthymia, BD, and recurrent major depressive disorder (reMDD). Normal MSLT latency was also reported in dysthymic patients compared to patients with idiopathic hypersomnia and healthy controls.

Using PSG and a non-conventional objective measure of EDS (two 60-minute naps at 9:00 and 12:30), Vgontzas and co-workers have compared the nighttime and objective sleepiness of drug-free patients diagnosed with primary (idiopathic) versus psychiatric hypersomnia (including mood, somatoform, anxiety, and personality disorders). This group found that patients with psychiatric hypersomnia, although having complaints of EDS, showed both during the day and night lower sleep propensity (higher sleep latency and total wake time) than patients with idiopathic hypersomnia and controls.

### A randomized study of solriamfetol for excessive sleepiness in narcolepsy [^113jYdve]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

This phase 3 study demonstrated the robust effects of solriamfetol for improving wakefulness on the MWT and reducing ES on the ESS in a large population of patients with narcolepsy. This study also supports the safety and tolerability profile of solriamfetol. Solriamfetol demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy that was significantly superior to placebo on both coprimary endpoints at the 150 and 300 mg doses. The 75 mg dose resulted in significantly greater improvement than placebo on the ESS but not on the MWT.

Importantly, improvements on both coprimary endpoints were observed at week 1, and these effects were maintained at the 150 and 300 mg doses over the study duration, indicating that there was no apparent tolerance over the 12 weeks of the study. Onset of efficacy at week 1 is consistent with what was observed previously in individuals with narcolepsy. Furthermore, on the MWT, significant effects were observed across all 5 of the individual MWT trials at the 150 and 300 mg doses, effects that were maintained over a 9-hour duration following dosing at the 12-week time point. This effect across the day may be longer in duration than what was observed in prior studies of the wake-promoting agents armodafinil and modafinil in patients with narcolepsy, where the effect appeared to diminish during the 4th and 5th time trials later in the day. However, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn in the absence of comparative trials.

### Residual sleepiness and impaired alertness in treated obstructive sleep apnoea: Role of hypoxic burden and sleep fragmentation [^116gPe7D]. Thorax (2025). High credibility.

The methodology of this cohort of consecutive patients referred for MWT in the Center for Sleep Medicine and Respiratory Disease, Lyon Academic Hospital from 2017 to 2022 has been published previously. The present work focused on factors associated with sleepiness and alertness in CPAP-treated patients. Subjective sleepiness was defined by an ESS score ≥ 11 and objective impaired alertness by the only American Academy of Sleep Medicine incontrovertible mean sleep latency limit of 40 min at MWT.

Sleep parameters were extracted from the polysomnography performed the night preceding the MWT. HB was calculated from the same polysomnography as the area under the curve of the baseline saturation associated with apnoea or hypopnea. The baseline saturation was the maximum oxygen saturation during the 100 s before the event. Also, to decipher the specific role of hypoxia linked to OSA, we measured the 'SpO2 < 90% burden' (integral of night-time spent < 90% regardless of sleeping or respiratory event).

Qualitative variables were described as numbers and percentages, whereas quantitative variables were presented as median and interquartile range (IQR, i.e. the 25% and 75% quartiles). The variables analyzed according to the binary status of objective wakefulness and subjective sleepiness were compared using the Pearson's χ² test for categorical variables with all expected cell counts ≥ 5 (or Fisher's test when expected cell counts < 5) and the Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables, using R 4.0.5 software.

Two logistic models were used to assess variables that may be explanatory of MWT and ESS results: HB, arousal index, and other potentially significant factors.

### Xyrem [^113mDB17]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The primary efficacy measure in Trial N4 was the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test. This test measures latency to sleep onset (in minutes) averaged over four sessions at two-hour intervals following nocturnal polysomnography. For each test session, the subject was asked to remain awake without using extraordinary measures. Each test session is terminated after 20 minutes if no sleep occurs or after 10 minutes if sleep does occur. The overall score is the mean sleep latency for the four sessions.

In Trial N4, a statistically significant improvement in the change in the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test score from baseline at week 8 was observed in the Xyrem and Xyrem plus modafinil groups compared to the placebo group.

This trial was not designed to compare the effects of Xyrem to modafinil because patients receiving modafinil were not titrated to a maximally effective dose.

### Importance of urinary drug screening in the multiple sleep latency test and maintenance of wakefulness test [^113MsvtK]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT) and the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) are gold-standard objective tests of daytime sleepiness and alertness. However, there is marked variability in their interpretation and practice. This study aimed to determine the incidence of positive drug screens and their influence on MSLT, MWT, and polysomnographic variables.

All patients attending Eastern Health Sleep Laboratory for MSLT or MWT over a 21-month period were included in the study. Urinary drug screening for amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, methadone, and opiates was performed following overnight polysomnography (PSG). Demographics and PSG variables were compared.

Of 69 studies (43 MSLT and 26 MWT), 16% of patients had positive urinary drug screening (7 MSLT; 4 MWT). Drugs detected included amphetamines, cannabinoids, opiates, and benzodiazepines. No patient self-reported using these medications prior to testing. No demographic, MSLT or MWT PSG data, or overnight PSG data showed any statistical differences between positive and negative drug screen groups. Of seven MSLT patients testing positive for drug use, one met criteria for the diagnosis of narcolepsy and five for idiopathic hypersomnia. On MWT, three of the four drug-positive patients had a history of a motor vehicle accident and two patients were occupational drivers.

These findings indicate drug use is present in patients attending for daytime testing of objective sleepiness and wakefulness. These data support routine urinary drug screening in clinical assessments.

### Improved neurobehavioral performance during the wake maintenance zone [^115rGNX5]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Although impairment of daytime functioning is a symptom of many sleep disorders, there are limited data on their nature for some patient groups. The role of the circadian system on impaired functioning, specifically the wake maintenance zone (WMZ) — a ∼3-hour window of reduced sleep propensity that occurs shortly before the onset of melatonin synthesis — has received little attention. The study examined the influence of the WMZ on neurobehavioral performance under normal conditions and following sleep deprivation.

- **Methods**: Thirty-one adults (8 females; 18–29 years) completed an in-patient protocol including a baseline day (8-hour sleep: 16-hour wake) and a ∼50-hour constant routine (CR), including regular assessment of plasma melatonin and neurobehavioral performance (i.e. auditory and visual psychomotor vigilance tests [aPVT, vPVT], Digit Symbol Substitution Test [DSST], and subjective sleepiness).

- **Results**: Performance in the 3 hours before the onset of melatonin secretion (i.e. the expected WMZ) was significantly improved compared to performance during a 3-hour block earlier in the biological day, despite a longer time awake. The improvement during WMZ was most prominent after extended wakefulness (i.e. day 2 of the CR).

- **Conclusions**: These results suggest that alignment of circadian phase with respect to sleep-wake timing may affect cognitive performance, particularly when homeostatic sleep pressure is high, and especially when performance is assessed in the evening, near the predicted WMZ. The potential contribution of the WMZ to sleep-onset insomnia complaints should be further investigated.

### Solriamfetol for excessive daytime sleepiness in Parkinson's disease: Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial [^113kHC2a]. Movement Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Improvement on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was greater among those taking dopamine agonists, while improvement on the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) was greater among those not taking these agents. Although the use of dopamine agonists is associated with subjective sleepiness, it is difficult to speculate about the reasons for these apparent differences. These findings illustrate the challenge of using outcome measures that only weakly to moderately correlate.

Other agents have been evaluated in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in studies with varying designs and methodologies, generally including small sample sizes; larger trials are warranted. Modafinil improved ESS scores in some studies, but not all. A meta-analysis found an overall treatment effect of −2.24 (95% CI −3.90 to −0.57) for modafinil versus placebo. Modafinil has not demonstrated improvements on MWT or mean sleep latency test (MSLT). Sodium oxybate significantly improved ESS scores (−4.2 vs. placebo) and MSLT sleep latency (+2.9 minutes vs. placebo), but has been associated with small, though significant, increases in apneic events. Atomoxetine significantly improved ESS scores (−2.9 vs. placebo) in patients with PD and depression. Finally, caffeine showed minimal improvement on ESS (mean difference −1.71); findings were not significant.

### Multiple sleep latency test: When are 4 naps enough [^113U5RXK]? Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) is central to the diagnosis of narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia. This study is the first to assess the impact of a 5-nap protocol on meeting MSLT-derived diagnostic criteria in a general cohort referred for MSLT, without selection bias.

- **Methods**: Data for all MSLTs performed at two tertiary sleep units in Australia between May 2012 and May 2018 were retrospectively assessed for the impact of the fifth nap on mean sleep latency (MSL) and sleep onset rapid eye movement periods.

- **Results**: There were 122 MSLTs included. The MSL was 8.7 ± 5.1 minutes after 4 naps, compared with 9.2 ± 5.2 minutes for 5 naps (P < .0001). In 8 cases, inclusion of the fifth nap changed the MSL to a value above the diagnostic threshold of 8 minutes. There were no instances in which the MSL moved to ≤ 8 minutes based on fifth nap data. A sleep onset rapid eye movement period occurred in the fifth nap in 9 patients and altered the interpretation in 2 cases.

- **Conclusions**: The fifth nap in an MSLT is associated with an increased MSL, although this difference is rarely clinically significant. In patients with borderline MSL or one sleep onset rapid eye movement period after 4 naps, a fifth nap can alter the outcome and should be performed. However, for many cases, a 4-nap MSLT protocol will suffice, potentially allowing resource savings without compromising diagnostic accuracy. We propose the adoption of a conditional 4-nap or 5-nap protocol based on specific criteria.

### Sleep tendency as a measure of recovery after drugs used for ambulatory surgery [^111WQCYa]. Anesthesiology (2002). Low credibility.

Although tests of psychomotor function indicate that drug effects after ambulatory anesthesia are short-lived, patients often feel washed out for extended periods. Among the psychomotor tests that measure various motor and cognitive functions, none directly measures sleepiness or alertness. The authors hypothesized that sleepiness, assessed by a sleep latency test, would be a more sensitive indicator of drug effect post-anesthetic than psychomotor tests. The second objective was to determine a sedation regimen that minimized residual effects.

- **Methods**:
	- **On four separate occasions, volunteers (N = 12) were administered**: (1) propofol 2.5 mg/kg, (2) propofol 2.0 mg/kg plus fentanyl 2 microg/kg, (3) propofol 2.0 mg/kg plus midazolam 2 mg/70 kg, or (4) midazolam 0.07 mg/kg plus fentanyl 2 microg/kg. Dependent measures included the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), Maddox Wing, digit symbol substitution tests, auditory and visual reaction times, and a divided attention task.

- **Results**:
	- The multiple sleep latency test demonstrated sleepiness up to 4 hours after injection, and in some patients, sleepiness continued up to 8 hours afterward. Psychomotor function was impaired only 2 hours after the injection of the drug combination.

- **Conclusion**:
	- The multiple sleep latency test may be a more sensitive measure of a drug's effect than other tests of psychomotor function. For up to 8 hours after an injection of midazolam and fentanyl, patients must consider driving or operating heavy machinery as unsafe activities.

### Effectiveness of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics in treatment of adult insomnia: Meta-analysis of data submitted to the Food and Drug Administration [^116yfgF1]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

For both measures of sleep latency (polysomnographic and subjective) and the eight other sleep-related outcomes, we calculated effect sizes as the mean difference between pre-test and post-test, divided by the standard deviation (SD) of the pre-test value for each group separately; this approach utilizes repeated measures effect sizes, correcting for sample size bias. The standardized mean change in the placebo group was subtracted from that of the intervention group to evaluate the drug effect concerning the placebo effect for each comparison, i.e. effect size between groups adjusted for baseline.

We calculated multiple effect sizes if the study reported more than one drug group or multiple outcomes. The latter were analyzed separately to investigate main effects and moderators. For multiple dose studies, with the same or different drug but with the same control group, we controlled multi-treatment dependence by estimating the covariance among them to analyze the effect of different drug and dose combinations. The sign of the effect size was set so that negative values signified a decrease in waking after sleep onset, sleep latency, and number of awakenings (all both polysomnographic and subjective). Conversely, the sign of the effect size was positive for increases in polysomnographic and subjective total sleep time, polysomnographic sleep efficiency, and sleep quality.

We obtained repeated measures effect sizes for each group for those comparisons reporting means and SDs and used medians and interquartile ranges as the best approximation for those studies missing standard deviations.

### Provigil [^114Ctind]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

In both studies, the primary measures of effectiveness were: 1) sleep latency, as assessed by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT), and 2) the change in the patient's overall disease status, as measured by the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C). For a successful trial, both measures had to show statistically significant improvement.

The MWT measures latency (in minutes) to sleep onset averaged over four test sessions at two-hour intervals following nocturnal polysomnography. For each test session, the subject was asked to attempt to remain awake without using extraordinary measures. Each test session was terminated after 20 minutes if no sleep occurred, or 10 minutes after sleep onset. The CGI-C is a 7-point scale, centered at 'No Change', and ranges from 'Very Much Worse' to 'Very Much Improved'. Patients were rated by evaluators who had access only to their baseline disease severity, without specific guidance on rating criteria.

Both studies demonstrated improvement in objective and subjective measures of excessive daytime sleepiness for both the 200 mg and 400 mg doses compared to placebo. Patients treated with Provigil showed a statistically significant enhancement in the ability to remain awake on the MWT at each dose compared to placebo at the final visit. A statistically significantly greater number of patients treated with Provigil at each dose showed improvement in overall clinical condition as rated by the CGI-C scale at the final visit.

### Neural network analysis of sleep stages enables efficient diagnosis of narcolepsy [^1134mCtR]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Using these features, we were able to determine an optimal cut-off that discriminated narcolepsy from controls and any other patients with as high specificity and sensitivity as the MSLT (Supplementary Table 6), notably when HLA typing is added. This is true for both the test and the never-seen replication samples. Although we observe a small drop in specificity in the replication sample, the efficacy of the detector was tested in the context of naive patients with hypersomnia (high pretest probability sample), and performance was found to be similar to the MSLT.

MSLT testing requires that patients spend an entire night and day in a sleep laboratory. The use of this novel biomarker could reduce time spent to a standard 8-hour night recording, as done for the screening of other sleep pathologies (e.g. OSA), allowing improved recognition of T1N cases at a fraction of the cost. A positive predictive value could also be provided depending on the nature of the sample and known narcolepsy prevalence (low in general population screening, intermediary in overall clinic population sample, and high in hypersomnia cohorts). It also opens the possibility of using home sleep recordings for diagnosing narcolepsy. In this direction, because of the probabilistic and automatic nature of our biomarker, estimates from more than one night could be automatically analyzed and combined over time, ensuring improved prediction. However, it is important to note that this algorithm will not replace the MSLT in the ability to predict excessive daytime sleepiness through the measure of mean sleep latency.

### Fatigue, sleepiness and depression in multiple sclerosis: Defining the overlaps for a better phenotyping [^116a8FUH]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Study design**: At the screening visit, patients were interviewed concerning their medical history and received a complete clinical and neurological examination, including the EDSS evaluation and an MMSE assessment.

- **Self-report measures**: All patients filled in the following self-administered validated questionnaires:
	- Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) (range: 0–24; cutoff for normality: ≤ 10)
	- Beck Depression Inventory — Second Edition (BDI-II) (range: 0–63; cutoff for normality: ≤ 9; cutoff for moderate depression ≥ 20)
	- Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (range: 0–60; cutoff for normality: ≤ 13)
	- Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) (range: 9–63; cutoff for normality: < 36)
	- Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) (range: 0–84; cutoff for normality: < 38)
	- **Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 54 (MSQoL-54) (range**: 0–00)
	- Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (range: 0–21; cutoff for normality: < 5)

- **Polysomnography and maintenance of wakefulness test**: Within one week from the screening visit, participants underwent a full night polysomnography (PSG) using a portable device (Embletta ST + Proxy), followed by a Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) the following day. The PSG montage included EEG, electrooculogram, electromyogram (EMG) of the chin and both tibialis anterior muscles, electrocardiogram, body position, oro-nasal airflow (nasal pressure cannula), thoracic and abdominal movements, and oxygen saturation. The MWT explores the ability to remain awake in sleep-promoting environmental conditions objectively. The montage included EEG (6 channels) and other signals.

### Actigraphy prior to multiple sleep latency test: Nighttime total sleep time predicts sleep-onset latency [^1179NHce]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

To evaluate the clinical utility of actigraphy compared with sleep questionnaires prior to the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) in a sleep disorders clinic population, twenty-eight clinically referred participants (mean age: 42.3 ± 18.8 years) completed the study protocol.

On day 1, participants completed the following questionnaires: Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Insomnia Severity Index, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Visual Analog Scale (affect, vigor), Patient Health Questionnaire, and Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form. On days 1–8, participants wore an actigraph and completed a sleep diary to assess mean nighttime and mean daytime total sleep time and sleep efficiency or sleep percentage. On day 9, participants repeated the ESS and completed an MSLT. Correlations assessed mean MSLT sleep-onset latency (MSLT-SOL) vs actigraphy, sleep diary, and questionnaires. Chi-square analyses assessed abnormal MSLT-SOL (≤ 8 minutes) or daytime sleepiness (ESS ≥ 10) and referral question (i.e. sleep-disordered breathing vs hypersomnolence disorder).

Mean MSLT-SOL was correlated with nighttime total sleep time assessed via both actigraphy and diary, but not with questionnaires. Significant correlations emerged for ESS score on day 1 vs 9, actigraphy vs sleep diary mean nighttime total sleep time, and PSQI vs mean sleep diary sleep efficiency. There was no significant relationship between mean MSLT-SOL and referral question.

Our finding that total sleep time measured by actigraphy was associated with MSLT-SOL suggests potential clinical value in using actigraphy in assessments.

### Association of rapid eye movement sleep latency with multimodal biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease [^113AovD2]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Low credibility.

Patients who visited the clinic for concerns such as sleep disturbances, memory decline, dizziness, or headaches and voluntarily participated with written informed consent were required to complete a comprehensive clinical diagnostic process. This process included a thorough medical history, symptomatology evaluation, physical and neurological examinations, cognitive scale assessments, lab tests, and cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All assessments were conducted by neurologists with specialized training and extensive experience in diagnosing and managing cognitive disorders.

The cognitive tests included the Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Digit Span Test (DST), Trail Making Test (TMT), Color Word Test (CWT), Clock Drawing Test (CDT), Rey‐Osterrieth Complex Figure Test, Verbal Fluency Test (VFT), and Boston Naming Test (BNT). The lab tests included complete blood count (CBC), blood glucose, thyroid function tests, folate and vitamin B12 levels, renal and liver function tests, and infectious disease screening (e.g. HIV and syphilis).

Additional tests were determined based on physician's judgment. If infections or neurological conditions were suspected, a lumbar puncture was conducted to analyze CSF. Participants who met the inclusion criteria and did not meet any exclusion criteria were enrolled in the study. All participants underwent blood sample collection for p‐tau181, NfL, BDNF, and APOE ε4 genotype analysis.

### Provigil [^115za9PH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Patients treated with PROVIGIL showed a statistically significant improvement in the ability to remain awake compared to placebo-treated patients, as measured by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) at the final visit. A statistically significant greater number of patients treated with PROVIGIL showed improvement in overall clinical condition, as rated by the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) scale at the final visit. The 200 mg and 400 mg doses of PROVIGIL produced statistically significant effects of similar magnitude on the MWT, and also on the CGI-C.

In the second study, a 4-week trial, 157 patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) were randomized to receive PROVIGIL 400 mg/day or a placebo. Documentation of regular continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) use (at least 4 hours/night on 70% of nights) was required for all patients. The primary measure of effectiveness was the change from baseline on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) at the final visit. The baseline ESS scores for the PROVIGIL and placebo groups were 14.2 and 14.4, respectively. At week 4, the ESS was reduced by 4.6 in the PROVIGIL group and by 2.0 in the placebo group, a difference that was statistically significant.

Nighttime sleep measured with polysomnography was not affected by the use of PROVIGIL.

### Test-retest reliability of the multiple sleep latency test in narcolepsy without cataplexy and idiopathic hypersomnia [^1141te1h]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The differentiation of narcolepsy without cataplexy from idiopathic hypersomnia relies entirely upon the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). However, the test-retest reliability for these central nervous system hypersomnias has never been determined.

- **Methods**: Patients with narcolepsy without cataplexy, idiopathic hypersomnia, and physiologic hypersomnia who underwent two diagnostic multiple sleep latency tests were identified retrospectively. Correlations between the mean sleep latencies on the two studies were evaluated, and we probed for demographic and clinical features associated with reproducibility versus change in diagnosis.

- **Results**: Thirty-six patients (58% women, mean age 34 years) were included. The inter-test interval was 4.2 ± 3.8 years (range 2.5 months to 16.9 years). Mean sleep latencies on the first and second tests were 5.5 (± 3.7 SD) and 7.3 (± 3.9) minutes, respectively, with no significant correlation (r = 0.17, p = 0.31). A change in diagnosis occurred in 53% of patients and was accounted for by a difference in the mean sleep latency (N = 15, 42%) or the number of sleep onset REM periods (N = 11, 31%). The only feature predictive of a diagnosis change was a history of hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations.

- **Conclusions**: The multiple sleep latency test demonstrates poor test-retest reliability in a clinical population of patients with central nervous system hypersomnia evaluated in a tertiary referral center. Alternative diagnostic tools are needed.

### Non-random temporal distribution of sleep onset REM periods in the MSLT in narcolepsy [^1149iRmi]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of narcolepsy is supported by the presence of two or more sleep onset REM periods (SOREMPs) in the multiple latency sleep test (MSLT). The distribution of SOREMPs throughout the MSLT has not been systematically studied in narcolepsy. This study examined the temporal distribution of SOREMPs in the MSLT of a large series of narcoleptics and calculated the effects of age and the diagnostic value of shorter versions of the test.

- **Patients**: 129 patients consecutively diagnosed with narcolepsy (73.4% with cataplexy) underwent nocturnal polysomnography followed by a five-nap MSLT.

- **Results**: 429 SOREMPs were recorded in 645 MSLT naps (66.5%). The probability of presenting SOREMPs in the fourth nap (3:30 pm) was significantly lower than in the remaining naps, with 22.4% SOREMPs in the first nap, 20.5% in the second, 20.5% in the third, 16% in the fourth, and 20.5% in the fifth nap (p < 0.034). Patients older than 29 years had fewer SOREMPs than the younger ones (p:0.045). Shortening the MSLT to three or four naps decreased the capability of the test to support the diagnosis of narcolepsy by 14.7% and 10%, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: The temporal distribution of SOREMPs in the MSLT is not even in narcolepsy, with the fourth nap having the lowest probability of presenting a SOREMP. This should be taken into account when evaluating the results of the MSLT, particularly when using shorter versions of the test.

### Sleep propensity in psychiatric hypersomnolence: A systematic review and meta-analysis of multiple sleep latency test findings [^114MW1ze]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Hypersomnolence plays a sizeable role in the course and morbidity of psychiatric disorders. Sleep medicine nosology relies on the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) to segregate hypersomnolence associated with psychiatric disorders from other central nervous system causes. However, the evidence base regarding sleep propensity in psychiatric hypersomnolence, as measured by the MSLT, has not been systematically evaluated. This evaluation is vital to clarify the utility and validity of nosological schema. In this review, the use of sleep propensity assessed by the MSLT in patients with psychiatric hypersomnolence is systematically evaluated using both qualitative and quantitative assessment.

Findings demonstrate high heterogeneity and potential for bias among studies, with a pooled estimate of sleep propensity among patients with psychiatric hypersomnolence similar to normative values. Additionally, approximately 25% of patients with psychiatric hypersomnolence demonstrate a mean sleep latency below 8 minutes, the cutpoint to define pathologic sleepiness. These data underscore the limitations of the MSLT in segregating psychiatric hypersomnolence from other central nervous system hypersomnias. Further research is warranted to evaluate novel measures and biomarkers of excessive sleepiness to advance clinical practice, as well as dimensional approaches to the classification of hypersomnolence disorders.

### European guideline and expert statements on the management of narcolepsy in adults and children [^111YfrP8]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of narcolepsy, particularly in managing excessive daytime sleepiness, the EAN 2021 guidelines recommend considering methylphenidate or amphetamines as alternatives. These are suggested for adults with narcolepsy who experience insufficient benefit or side effects from first-line wake-promoting agents. It is essential to regularly assess the benefit-risk ratio and to use the lowest efficacious doses.

### Fatigue, sleepiness and depression in multiple sclerosis: Defining the overlaps for a better phenotyping [^114iguDZ]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

The mean age of patients was 48.9 ± 10.5 years. Fifty-one (71.8%) were women, and the mean disease duration was 10.6 ± 8.1 years. Sixty-one (85.9%) patients had relapsing-remitting MS, and 9 (12.7%) had a moderate–severe disability (EDSS ≥ 4).

- **Demographic and clinical parameters**:
	- MS: multiple sclerosis; CIS: clinically isolated syndrome; RR-MS: relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis; SP-MS: secondary progressive multiple sclerosis; PPMS: primary progressive multiple sclerosis; EDSS: expanded disability status scale; MSQoL-54: multiple sclerosis quality of life 54; ESS: Epworth Sleepiness Scale; MWT: maintenance of wakefulness test; SL: sleep latency; FSS: Fatigue Severity Scale; MFIS: modified fatigue impact scale; BDI-II: Beck Depression Inventory — Second Edition; MADRS: Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale; PSQI: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; SD: standard deviation.

- **Significant findings**:
	- Bold values denote statistical significance (p < .05). Fatigue, defined by FSS > 4 or MFIS > 10, affected 32 (45%) patients. At the MWT, 8 (11.2%) patients showed a mean sleep latency < 20 minutes (severely sleepy), and 18 (25.4%) had a pathological threshold.

### Sleep, 24-hour activity rhythms, and cognitive reserve: A population-based study [^111i98ZB]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Low credibility.

All participants completed a cognitive test battery of five cognitive tests, assessing multiple cognitive domains, at the research center. The 15-word verbal learning test (15-WLT), a Dutch version of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning task, measured aspects of verbal memory. We used the total number of words named during the three trials of the immediate recall test. The Stroop task, which measures the interference of automatic processes and attention, was employed, with the time in seconds to complete the third task — the interference task — being recorded. The Word Fluency Test (WFT) measures searching efficiency in long-term memory, and we used the total amount of correct and unique animals named. The Letter-Digit Substitution Task (LDST) assesses processing speed, and we recorded the number of correct matches of digits to letters. Lastly, the Purdue Pegboard Test (PPB) measures fine motor skill, for which we used the number of correctly placed pins across the three conditions.

Brain imaging was conducted with a 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner equipped with an 8-channel head coil at the research center. The scans consisted of a T1-weighted sequence, a proton density sequence, and a fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence. The T1-weighted and proton density sequences were used for the segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid, grey matter, and white matter to calculate intracranial volume and total brain volume. The FLAIR sequence was utilized to segment white matter lesions and assess total white matter hyperintensity volume. Details regarding the MRI processing have been described in further detail elsewhere.

### Outcome measurement in sleep medicine practice and research. Part 1: Assessment of symptoms, subjective and objective daytime sleepiness, health-related quality of life and functional status [^113kC1wp]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

The documentation of treatment outcomes has gained increased importance as those responsible for paying for healthcare focus on the delivery of cost-effective care. The practitioner and researcher, challenged with documenting the clinical significance of their endeavors, must depend on conceptually appropriate, valid, and reliable instruments. Outcomes of particular relevance for sleep disorders include self-reported general symptoms, subjective and objective daytime sleepiness, neurobehavior, health-related quality of life (HRQL) or functional status, incidence of accidents and cardiovascular morbidity, and healthcare utilization and cost.

This paper will limit its focus to the outcomes of self-reported general symptoms, subjective and objective daytime sleepiness, and HRQL or functional status. In addition to describing measures that could be applied to evaluate these outcomes, this paper will also discuss factors affecting the selection of outcome measures for use in research and practice and consider evidence generated with the application of these instruments in research.

Reductions in self-reported symptoms, such as snoring and daytime hypersomnolence following treatment, have been documented with the application of measures with strong psychometric properties, such as the Survey Screen for Sleep Apnea and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. In addition to statistical reliability, the calculation of the effect size and standardized response mean indicate that these changes are also clinically meaningful. Similar improvements have also been demonstrated using the Multiple Sleep Latency Test.

### Nocturnal rapid eye movement sleep latency for identifying patients with narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency [^116ciPTi]. JAMA Neurology (2013). High credibility.

Narcolepsy, a disorder associated with HLA-DQB1✱06:02 and caused by hypocretin (orexin) deficiency, is diagnosed using the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) following nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG). In many patients, a short rapid eye movement sleep latency (REML) during the NPSG is also observed but not used diagnostically.

The objective of this study was to determine diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of nocturnal REML measures in narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Observational study using receiver operating characteristic curves for NPSG REML and MSLT findings (sleep studies performed between May 1976 and September 2011 at university medical centers in the United States, China, Korea, and Europe) to determine optimal diagnostic cutoffs for narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency compared with different samples: controls, patients with other sleep disorders, patients with other hypersomnias, and patients with narcolepsy with normal hypocretin levels.

Increasingly stringent comparisons were made:

- **First comparison**: 516 age- and sex-matched patients with narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency were selected from 1749 patients and compared with 516 controls.

- **Second comparison**: 749 successive patients undergoing sleep evaluation for any sleep disorders (low pretest probability for narcolepsy) were compared within groups by final diagnosis of narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency.

- **Third comparison**: 254 patients with a high pretest probability of having narcolepsy were compared within group by their final diagnosis.

Finally, 118 patients with narcolepsy and…

### Recommended protocols for the multiple sleep latency test and maintenance of wakefulness test in adults: guidance from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine [^115t6NY3]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2021). High credibility.

This article updates the American Academy of Sleep Medicine protocols for the administration of the Multiple Sleep Latency Test and the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine commissioned a task force of clinical experts in sleep medicine to review published literature on the performance of these tests since the publication of the 2005 American Academy of Sleep Medicine practice parameter paper. Although no evidence-based changes to the protocols were warranted, the task force made several changes based on consensus. These changes included guidance on patient preparation, medication and substance use, sleep before testing, test scheduling, optimum test conditions, and documentation. This article provides guidance to providers who order and administer the Multiple Sleep Latency Test and the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test.

### Fatigue, sleepiness and depression in multiple sclerosis: Defining the overlaps for a better phenotyping [^114QrW8g]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Diagnostic diagram to assess clinical phenotype in patients with multiple sclerosis suffering from fatigue. Whether a patient with MS complains of fatigue, a clinical interview and questionnaires are advisable to exclude somnolence, bad mood, as well as major sleep disorders. A test of vigilance is recommended to better distinguish somnolence from depression if the two symptoms coexist (phenotype 4). If the patient is depressed, psychiatric counselling is recommended. In cases of drowsiness or pathological MWT, a sleep evaluation at the sleep lab is suggested to exclude specific sleep disorders. MWT refers to the maintenance of wakefulness test, with a cutoff of a 30-minute sleep latency. EDS stands for excessive daytime sleepiness, F for fatigue, D for depression, and min for minutes.

This study has some limitations. First, the exclusion of subjects with an EDSS ≥ 7 and the relatively low median EDSS (2.6) in this MS population limits the generalizability of our results. There is also the absence of an age/sex-matched control group to compare symptom overlap and correlations between MS and healthy subjects. The linear multiple regression included only fatigue, sleepiness, and depression, without considering other possible confounders like sleep disturbances (especially RLS) and symptomatic therapy. Given the cross-sectional design of this study, we could not conclude the causality direction among fatigue and depression/sleepiness in MS patients. Finally, the small sample size decreases the statistical power and, therefore, reduces the possibility of reliably characterizing each sub-group.

### Nightly sleep duration in the 2-week period preceding multiple sleep latency testing [^111DNrWP]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the usual nightly sleep duration of patients referred for a Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). This retrospective chart review was conducted in a military, hospital-based sleep center, involving fifty-four patients with excessive daytime sleepiness referred for an MSLT. No interventions were applied.

Measurements and results indicated that self-reported average nightly sleep duration was 6.13 ± 1.23 hours, sleep log-recorded average nightly sleep duration was 6.99 ± 0.85 hours, and actigraphy-measured average nightly sleep duration was 5.56 ± 1.50 hours for the 2-week period immediately preceding an MSLT. A one-way analysis of variance revealed a significant difference in the three estimates of nightly sleep duration (p < 0.0001), and only actigraphy-measured average nightly sleep duration correlated with mean sleep latency on the MSLT (r = 0.4258, p = 0.0016). Subgroup analysis showed that patients with a mean sleep latency shorter than 8 minutes slept an average of 1.57 hours less per night than those with a mean sleep latency of 8 minutes or longer (4.53 ± 1.37 vs. 6.10 ± 1.37 hours per night, p < 0.001) as measured by actigraphy. There was no difference in either self-reported average nightly sleep duration or sleep log-recorded average nightly sleep duration between the two subgroups.

Conclusions suggest that prolonged actigraphy monitoring may provide useful clinical information about pre-MSLT sleep, not always obtainable from patient self-reporting or sleep logs.

### The maintenance of wakefulness test in pediatric narcolepsy [^112nPqeo]. Pediatric Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective tools are needed to assess treatment response in pediatric narcolepsy. This article presents a single-center experience documenting the use of the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT) in a pediatric series. This study reviewed the charts of children with narcolepsy who had an MWT performed between January 2008 and June 2012. A cutoff was used for mean sleep latency: 20 minutes to indicate adequate control on medications. Thirteen tests were performed on 10 children (median age 15.8 years, range 8.7–20.3 years) with narcolepsy, of which six had cataplexy and three were boys. Comorbid conditions included Prader-Willi syndrome, bipolar affective disorder, and epilepsy (n = 1 each). The median mean sleep latency for all studies was 16 minutes (range 5.8–40 minutes). Sleep-onset rapid eye movement sleep events were seen in three of 13 studies. In seven patients, findings from the MWT resulted in changes in management. These data suggest that the MWT may be a useful and feasible test for assessing response to treatment in children with narcolepsy. Future research is needed to obtain normative MWT data on children with and without narcolepsy.

### Orexin receptor antagonism, a new sleep-enabling paradigm: A proof-of-concept clinical trial [^114nyrvV]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

The study's end points focused on sleep efficiency (SE) as the primary measure, determined by polysomnography. SE (%) was calculated as (total sleep time [TST] in minutes/total time in bed fixed to 480 minutes) × 100. Secondary end points included latency to persistent sleep (LPS), defined as the time from the start of recording to the beginning of the first 20 non-wake epochs, and wake after sleep onset (WASO), which measures the time awake after sleep onset until the end of the recording. Sleep onset is marked by the first occurrence of three consecutive epochs in sleep stage 1 (S1) or the first occurrence of sleep stage 2 (S2).

Exploratory end points were also determined through polysomnography. These included TST (the actual sleep time in minutes during the sleep period), latency to various sleep stages (time from recording start to the first occurrence of each stage, including REM [rapid eye movement] sleep latency), as well as time spent and percentage of TST for each sleep stage. Subjective measures of SE, sleep latency, WASO, TST, and overall sleep quality were evaluated using the sleep self-assessment (SSA) tool.

Next-day performance and alertness following treatment nights were assessed using the Bond and Lader visual analog scale, examining 16 subjective feelings. Additional assessments included fine-motor testing, reaction time testing, and both forward and backward digit span testing.

### Fatigue, sleepiness and depression in multiple sclerosis: Defining the overlaps for a better phenotyping [^116WnFUo]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

To define the boundaries and the overlaps between fatigue, sleepiness, and depression in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), various tools, including instrumental sleep analysis, were utilized.

- **Methods**: In this cross-sectional, observational study, 71 MS patients (20 males and 51 females; mean age: 48.9 ± 10.5 years) completed clinical questionnaires and underwent polysomnography followed by the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT). The frequency and reciprocal overlap of sleepiness, fatigue, and depression in MS were expressed using Eulero-Venn diagrams. Standard multiple regression was employed to assess the predictive ability of symptoms on each other.

- **Results**: A significant percentage of patients were observed to be fatigued (70%), somnolent (45%), and depressed (27%). Fatigue showed the strongest overlap, correlating with both depression (beta: 0.52, p < 0.001) and sleepiness (beta: 0.74, p < 0.001). Somnolence and depression were nearly always accompanied by fatigue and were well differentiated from each other using MWT. Four MS subgroups were identified: (1) fatigue only; (2) fatigue and sleepiness; (3) fatigue and depression; (4) fatigue, sleepiness, and depression.

- **Discussion**: The subjective and objective tools were unable to clearly distinguish fatigue from sleepiness and depression. However, a test of vigilance proved helpful in differentiating somnolence from depression.

Effect of orexin agonist on wakefulness in NT1 during MWT and baseline comparison of microsleeps between NT1 and NT2

Background and aims: The Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) is utilized in clinical trials to assess excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), primarily using mean sleep latency (SL) as the endpoint. However, SL does not fully capture the quality of wakefulness (QoW) prior to sleep. Microsleeps, defined as brief sleep episodes lasting 3 to 15 seconds before sleep onset, may serve as a sensitive biomarker for EDS. This study compares baseline microsleep features between NT1 and NT2 participants in Phase 2 randomized trials NCT05687903 and NCT05687916. Additionally, we examined microsleep changes in NT1 patients receiving the orexin receptor 2-selective agonist TAK-861 in trial NCT05687903.

Methods: Baseline MWT, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and microsleep features were compared between 112 NT1 and 71 NT2 participants. In trial NCT05687903, NT1 participants received TAK-861, with dosing conditions as follows: placebo (n = 22), 0.5mg/0.5mg (n = 23), 2mg/2mg (n = 21), 2mg/5mg (n = 23), and 7mg (n = 23). Four 40-minute MWT sessions were conducted at baseline and after 28 and 56 days of treatment. Microsleeps were manually scored from the MWT data. Changes in microsleep rates and time-to-first microsleep were assessed using mixed-effect models.

### Evaluation of sleep health in children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency [^111FQiMg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Descriptive statistics for all sleep health variables are presented as mean and standard deviation. Differences between subjective sleep health variables for children with CAH and the community and clinical samples previously reported in the literature were assessed using two-sample t-tests. Equal-variance t-tests were reported except when the unequal-variance test yielded a qualitatively different result, in which case the latter is reported, as it is more conservative.

Objective sleep health variables for children with CAH were compared to sleep duration recommendations and normative data in healthy children for sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency, and minutes of wake after sleep onset, using two-sample t-tests with standard errors computed as the width of the 95% confidence interval divided by 3.92. Associations between bone age z-scores, BMI z-scores, and evening hydrocortisone dose with objective sleep health variables were examined with multiple linear regression, adjusting for age, sex, puberty status, and height for BMI z-score. Adjusted associations of sleep outcomes with the child's average time of the last dose were estimated and tested using multiple linear regression.

All analyses were conducted using JMP (v. 16.1.0 Pro, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA).

### Impact of motivation on multiple sleep latency test and maintenance of wakefulness test measurements [^112T8mL8]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) are standard clinical tests used to measure sleep tendency in clinical populations in which test results may lead to significant life changes for patients. Loss of a driving license or drug-seeking behavior may provide significant motivation for patients to obtain specific results on these tests. In the study, the effect of motivation on the ability to fall asleep or stay awake was examined.

- **Methods**: Twelve subjects spent three nights and the following days in the laboratory. On the day following the first laboratory night (screen), subjects performed an MSLT and a 40-minute MWT with normal test instructions. On the second or third day, subjects were randomly motivated to appear as sleepy as possible (i.e. to fall asleep rapidly) on all of the tests. On the other day, subjects were motivated to be wakeful. The subject with the "best" performance in modifying their sleep latency was paid a bonus as motivation.

- **Results**: For the MSLT, latency was significantly longer than baseline in the wakeful condition. For the MWT, latency was significantly shorter in the sleepy condition compared to baseline.

- **Conclusions**: Subjects have the ability to increase but not decrease sleep latency on the MSLT, which implies that the MSLT is a better measure of sleepiness rather than alertness. Conversely, subjects have the ability to decrease but not increase sleep latency on the MWT, implying that the MWT is a better measure of alertness compared to sleepiness.
