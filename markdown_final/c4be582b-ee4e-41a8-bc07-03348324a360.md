## Question

memory loss in 66 year old workup and plan

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a workup and management plan for a 66-year-old with memory loss. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial history, collateral information, and cognitive screening. Then, I should verify the focused examination and core laboratory tests. Next, I will review structural imaging and determine whether this is subjective decline, MCI, or dementia. After that, I need to consider advanced biomarkers and functional imaging when indicated, refine the differential diagnosis, and outline pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic management. Finally, I will set a monitoring plan, define referral criteria, and plan counseling and care coordination, ensuring each step aligns with high-quality guidelines and evidence-informed consensus statements [^113gFjCH] [^111Xg868] [^113M3Src].

> Let me first confirm the fundamentals of the clinical history, and I need to ensure we capture a reliable collateral history because patient insight may be limited and family initiation of evaluation is common; I should double-check that we document onset, tempo, cognitive domains affected, functional impact, and behavioral symptoms, while also reviewing medications and vascular, psychiatric, and neurologic risk factors to avoid premature closure on a single etiology [^117UTyiM] [^117NDWci] [^1151oeFo].

> Next, I should review brief cognitive testing strategy; the MoCA is generally more sensitive than the MMSE for detecting MCI and has fewer ceiling effects, so I would favor it when time permits, with Mini-Cog as a quick alternative in constrained settings, and I need to check for educational and language considerations to reduce misclassification risk; wait, I almost said to avoid the MMSE entirely — let me correct that: MMSE can still be used, but it should not be the only tool given its limitations and copyright issues, and performance should be interpreted alongside function and collateral history rather than in isolation [^116SYo2v] [^111GS32s] [^113gFjCH].

> I will now examine the physical and focused neurological examination, looking for focal deficits, parkinsonism, gait disturbance, sensory-motor signs, or features pointing to Lewy body disease, frontotemporal syndromes, normal pressure hydrocephalus, or vascular contributions; hold on, I should verify that exam findings are explicitly tied to imaging and etiologic hypotheses to avoid anchoring bias during subsequent testing [^111Xg868] [^112StRwc].

> Let me consider the core laboratory evaluation to exclude reversible contributors; I should confirm we obtain CBC, TSH, B12, and a comprehensive metabolic panel including renal, hepatic, and glucose parameters, with targeted tests such as syphilis serology, HIV, and urinalysis when clinically indicated, because missing a reversible cause would be a preventable error [^113M3Src] [^115DZWaA].

> Now I need to ensure appropriate structural neuroimaging; MRI without contrast is preferred to assess for vascular burden, mass lesions, subdural collections, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and regional atrophy patterns, with noncontrast CT acceptable if MRI is contraindicated; wait, I should verify follow-up needs — serial MRI can document progression or mixed pathology when clinically useful [^111Xg868] [^113gFjCH] [^1136uEX5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I must differentiate subjective cognitive decline from MCI and dementia by integrating objective test performance with functional status, because ADLs define the threshold to dementia, whereas preserved independence suggests MCI; I should confirm that "objective impairment" is present before invoking biomarker pathways and that classification drives subsequent testing and counseling [^1156i2xt] [^1115uthu] [^113gFjCH].

> Let me think about age context; at 66 years, I initially thought "young-onset", but wait, I should correct myself — strict definitions use onset before 65 years; nevertheless, being near the threshold with atypical or rapid features should lower my threshold for specialist referral and broader differential workup including genetic or inflammatory etiologies [^114XqazZ].

> Next, I should review advanced testing only when indicated; if the clinical picture or MRI pattern leaves etiologic uncertainty or high-confidence etiologic assignment is needed, FDG-PET can help differentiate AD from FTD or LBD, whereas amyloid PET may clarify AD pathology and can alter diagnostic trajectories when used at an early decision point; I need to check whether a blood-based biomarker could serve as a triage step with confirmatory CSF or amyloid PET as appropriate, and I should consider EEG when seizures are suspected and CSF for atypical/rapidly progressive presentations, including autoimmune or paraneoplastic encephalitides that can present with isolated memory loss [^115Tbpip] [^112gv8s9] [^111gJQTX] [^115YhDdH] [^112h4634].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis systematically; I must consider common neurodegenerative causes such as AD, vascular contributions, DLB, and FTD, but I need to check for reversible or secondary etiologies including depression presenting as "pseudodementia", endocrine and nutritional deficiencies, medication effects (especially anticholinergics and sedatives), normal pressure hydrocephalus, autoimmune encephalitis, and paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis, tailoring tests to the clinical signal to avoid unnecessary broad panels [^1142qCWS] [^111Xg868] [^117XZ4YJ] [^112Qcyv2].

> Moving to management, I should confirm that treatment is etiology-specific; if AD dementia is diagnosed, cholinesterase inhibitors for mild-to-moderate stages and memantine for moderate-to-severe disease can be offered after discussing benefits and risks, while optimizing vascular risk factors, sleep, mood, and sensory impairments; I need to consider the evolving role of disease-modifying anti-amyloid antibodies in carefully selected patients with biomarker-confirmed AD under specialist care and with appropriate safety monitoring, ensuring shared decision-making given uncertainties and eligibility constraints [^113WxWT4] [^116F5fMB].

> But wait, nonpharmacologic strategies should be emphasized early; I should verify counseling on regular aerobic and resistance exercise at least twice weekly, cognitive and social engagement, nutrition patterns consistent with Mediterranean-style diets, alcohol moderation, and smoking cessation, and I need to ensure safety planning for driving, falls, and medication management while providing caregiver education and support resources from the outset [^1115hmBs] [^113gFjCH].

> For follow-up, I need to ensure a structured surveillance plan that includes reassessment of cognition every 6–12 months with the same instrument to reduce measurement noise, periodic functional assessment and BPSD screening, medication efficacy and adverse effect reviews, and caregiver burden checks; hold on, I should verify that we do not falsely reassure based on a single normal test — persistent symptoms warrant continued monitoring and re-evaluation, with imaging or biomarker re-assessment if the trajectory changes [^116vaVk7] [^113gFjCH] [^1156i2xt].

> Now, I should define referral and care coordination triggers; atypical features, rapid progression, fluctuating courses, complex comorbidities, polypharmacy, or diagnostic uncertainty after the initial workup should prompt referral to a memory clinic or dementia specialist, and I need to consider specialty input for advanced biomarker testing, clinical trials, or genetic counseling where appropriate [^1147y65Y] [^117UTyiM].

> Finally, I will confirm the counseling approach; I should disclose the working diagnosis and uncertainty transparently, provide written information on prognosis and planning, and initiate early legal and financial planning including advance directives and powers of attorney, while connecting the patient and family with community resources and support groups to mitigate distress and enhance care continuity [^113gFjCH].

A 66-year-old with memory loss needs a **structured workup** to identify reversible causes and distinguish MCI from dementia. Start with a detailed history, exam, and cognitive screening (MoCA or MMSE) [^111GS32s] [^116SYo2v], then order labs (CBC, CMP, TSH, B12, folate, HbA1c, LFTs, RPR, HIV) and **MRI brain** [^111Xg868] to exclude structural causes. If cognitive impairment is confirmed, refer for neuropsychological testing [^117D8ZRZ] and consider CSF or PET biomarkers [^115YhDdH] [^115Tbpip] if diagnosis remains uncertain. Management includes treating reversible causes, optimizing vascular risk factors [^117XZ4YJ], and initiating cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine if Alzheimer's is diagnosed [^113WxWT4], with regular follow-up to monitor progression and adjust care [^116vaVk7].

---

## Clinical history and examination

- **Onset and progression**: Determine if acute, subacute, or chronic; rapid progression suggests delirium, encephalitis, or prion disease [^1147y65Y].

- **Cognitive domains**: Assess memory, language, executive function, visuospatial skills, and attention [^116SYo2v].

- **Functional status**: Evaluate ADLs and IADLs to distinguish MCI from dementia [^1156i2xt].

- **Neuropsychiatric symptoms**: Screen for depression, anxiety, psychosis, and behavioral changes [^117NDWci].

- **Medical history**: Review vascular risk factors, head trauma, seizures, alcohol/drug use, and medications (especially anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, opioids) [^113M3Src].

- **Family history**: Inquire about dementia, Parkinson's, or psychiatric disorders [^114s3VcE].

- **Neurological examination**: Look for focal deficits, parkinsonism, ataxia, or motor neuron signs [^113gFjCH].

---

## Cognitive screening tools

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) **is highly sensitive** for MCI and early dementia and is preferred over the MMSE for mild impairment [^111GS32s]. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is widely used but is less sensitive for MCI [^111GS32s] [^116SYo2v]. The Mini-Cog is a quick screening tool that combines three-word recall with clock drawing [^116SYo2v].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

Routine laboratory tests to exclude **reversible causes** include:

| **Test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|
| CBC | - Anemia <br/> - Infection |
| CMP | - Electrolytes <br/> - Renal <br/> - Hepatic function |
| TSH | Hypothyroidism |
| - Vitamin B12 <br/> - Folate | Deficiency states |
| HbA1c | Diabetes control |
| LFTs | Hepatic encephalopathy |
| - RPR <br/> - HIV | - Syphilis <br/> - HIV-associated cognitive impairment |

---

## Neuroimaging

MRI brain is the **preferred initial imaging modality** to exclude structural lesions, vascular disease, and normal pressure hydrocephalus, and to assess hippocampal atrophy [^111Xg868]. CT brain is an alternative if MRI is contraindicated or unavailable [^113gFjCH]. FDG-PET is considered if the diagnosis remains uncertain after the initial workup [^1147y65Y], particularly to differentiate Alzheimer's from frontotemporal dementia or Lewy body dementia [^115Tbpip].

---

## Neuropsychological testing

A formal **neuropsychological assessment** is indicated when cognitive screening is inconclusive, to differentiate MCI from dementia, or in atypical or rapidly progressive presentations; it also documents baseline cognitive function for future comparison [^117D8ZRZ].

---

## Biomarkers

CSF analysis of amyloid-beta, tau, and phosphorylated tau **can support an Alzheimer's diagnosis**, especially in atypical presentations [^115YhDdH]. Blood-based biomarkers are emerging in specialized settings but are not yet standard in primary care [^1115uthu] [^111gJQTX].

---

## Differential diagnosis

- **Neurodegenerative**: Alzheimer's, Lewy body, frontotemporal, Parkinson's dementia [^114s3VcE].

- **Vascular**: Multi-infarct dementia, strategic infarcts [^117XZ4YJ].

- **Psychiatric**: Depression, anxiety, functional cognitive disorder [^1142qCWS].

- **Metabolic**: Hypothyroidism, vitamin deficiencies, hepatic/renal dysfunction [^113M3Src].

- **Structural**: Tumors, normal pressure hydrocephalus, subdural hematoma [^111Xg868].

- **Infectious**: HIV, syphilis, prion diseases [^1147y65Y].

---

## Management plan

- **Treat reversible causes**: Correct metabolic abnormalities, adjust medications, treat depression/anxiety [^113M3Src].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Regular exercise, cognitive stimulation, social engagement, Mediterranean diet [^1115hmBs].

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's; memantine for moderate-to-severe disease [^113WxWT4].

- **Safety assessment**: Driving, firearms, medication management, home safety [^117UTyiM].

- **Advance care planning**: Discuss prognosis, advance directives, and caregiver support [^113gFjCH].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular **follow-up** should track cognitive decline, functional status, and behavioral symptoms [^116vaVk7]. Repeat cognitive testing and, when indicated, imaging help document progression [^1136uEX5]. Management should be adjusted based on progression and patient needs.

---

In sum, **use a structured workup** to identify reversible causes and distinguish MCI from dementia; combine history, exam, cognitive screening, targeted labs [^113M3Src], and **MRI brain** [^111Xg868] as first-line imaging. Tailor **management** by treating reversible contributors and initiating evidence-based dementia therapies [^113WxWT4] when indicated, with regular follow-up [^116vaVk7] to monitor progression and support patients and caregivers.

Dementia is defined by significant chronic or acquired impairment in a single domain or the loss of two or more cognitive functions due to brain disease or injury. It is a common chronic syndrome in adults and constitutes the fifth leading cause of death in patients over 65 years of age. Multiple etiologies of dementia exist, most notably Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies, as well as other neurologic diseases such as vascular dementia and normal pressure hydrocephalus.

This document aids clinicians in selecting the most appropriate imaging test for patients suspected of having one of these dementia syndromes. It highlights the most appropriate initial imaging tests for patients with suspected mild cognitive impairment and rapidly progressive dementia. It also addresses the most appropriate pre- and post-treatment imaging tests for patients undergoing therapy with antiamyloid monoclonal antibodies.

A 56-year-old man with no medical comorbidities, who used to work as an electrician, was initially brought by his family to our psychiatry hospital walk-in clinic seeking help for memory loss over the past 10 years. During this time, the patient's family endorsed mood swings, social isolation, an unsteady gait, and word-finding difficulties.

Several months after symptom onset, the patient's family noticed that his memory loss became more prominent and that he was unable to follow timelines of past events. For instance, he argued that long-ago events had happened only days prior. The patient also forgot the names of close relatives, maintained poor sleep (less than three hours per night), and altered his normal daily routines, such as religious rituals. The family also endorsed increased agitation and anxiety at this time. The patient's functional skills began to gradually decline, and he lost the skills required to do his job, ultimately resulting in his being laid off. Furthermore, the patient's family reported that he lost his way home on two occasions and was ultimately brought home after one day by strangers both times.

Finally, the patient's family reported one incident approximately five years prior to the presentation. The incident happened during a family gathering when the patient lost consciousness for a few minutes. The patient was later taken to a neurologist in his home country. An MRI and EEG were performed upon the first examination by a neurologist. The MRI revealed some brain atrophy while the EEG was normal. The patient was started t

### European consensus for the diagnosis of MCI and mild dementia: Preparatory phase [^111TM27D]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Low credibility.

Etiological diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders of middle-old age relies on biomarkers, although evidence for their rational use is incomplete. A European task force is defining a diagnostic workflow where expert experience fills evidence gaps for biomarker validity and prioritization. We report methodology and preliminary results.

- **Methods**: Using a Delphi consensus method supported by a systematic literature review, 22 delegates from 11 relevant scientific societies defined workflow assumptions.

- **Results**: We extracted diagnostic accuracy figures from literature on the use of biomarkers in the diagnosis of main forms of neurocognitive disorders. Supported by this evidence, panelists defined the clinical setting (specialist outpatient service), application stage (MCI-mild dementia), and detailed pre-assessment screening (clinical-neuropsychological evaluations, brain imaging, and blood tests).

- **Discussion**: The Delphi consensus on these assumptions set the stage for the development of the first pan-European workflow for the use of biomarkers in the etiological diagnosis of middle-old age neurocognitive disorders at MCI-mild dementia stages.

- **Highlights**: Rational use of biomarkers in neurocognitive disorders lacks consensus in Europe. A consensus of experts will define a workflow for the rational use of biomarkers. The diagnostic workflow will be patient-centered and based on clinical presentation. The workflow will be updated as new evidence accrues.

### Initial cognitive changes in Parkinson's disease [^1143Kktz]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

The focus on cognitive impairment in neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), is shifting from the dementia stage to earlier stages of impairment, including mild cognitive impairment. This shift is driven primarily by the desire to improve long-term outcomes by delivering therapeutic interventions earlier in the clinical course, even presymptomatically in those at highest risk, and at the initial stage in the pathophysiological cascade that underpins common dementia syndromes. This article focuses on key findings and challenges in studying the earliest stages of cognitive decline in PD, including a detailed examination of neuropsychological testing, cognitive performance in early and prodromal PD, epidemiological research for PD mild cognitive impairment at the time of writing, and expert recommendations for assessment.

### Dementia: Timely diagnosis and early intervention [^115qkEqA]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

Diagnosing dementia can be challenging due to its insidious onset, symptoms resembling "normal aging" memory loss, and a diversity of other presenting symptoms, such as difficulty in finding words or making decisions. An individual's ability to accommodate, compensate, or even deny his or her symptoms in the early stages should also be considered. The individual's family may have noticed difficulties in communication, as well as personality or mood changes, and family concern is of particular importance. Increasing frequency of patients' visits to their general practice, missed appointments, or confusion over medications may also be warning signs.

- **Diagnosis of subtype**: This is important given differences in management, disease course, and outcomes for different dementias. Awareness of early symptoms in less common dementias can assist generalists in deciding to which specialist services patients are referred. The duration over which symptoms have developed is also important, with Alzheimer's disease tending to have a more insidious onset than vascular dementia.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: Clinical and radiological manifestations, pathophysiology, and outstanding questions [^116wEimm]. The Lancet Neurology (2015). High credibility.

The diagnostic criteria for Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) is a clinical tool designed to aid in the identification and diagnosis of PRES in patients presenting with specific neurological symptoms and risk factors. This tool is particularly useful in differentiating PRES from other neurological conditions with similar presentations.

The primary components of this diagnostic criteria include the presence of at least one acute neurological symptom, at least one risk factor, specific findings on brain imaging, and the absence of an alternative diagnosis. Acute neurological symptoms may include seizures, encephalopathy, confusion, headache, or visual disturbances. Risk factors encompass severe hypertension or blood pressure fluctuations, renal failure, immunosuppressant therapy, chemotherapy, eclampsia, or an autoimmune disorder. The brain imaging should either be normal, show bilateral vasogenic edema, or show cytotoxic edema with a pattern indicative of PRES.

The diagnostic criteria for PRES are met if all four components are present. If any of these components are absent, the diagnostic criteria for PRES are not met, suggesting the need for further investigation into alternative diagnoses. This diagnostic tool thus provides a structured approach to the diagnosis of PRES, facilitating early recognition and appropriate management of this condition.

### Nationally informed recommendations on approaching the detection, assessment, and management of mild cognitive impairment [^112EtkpT]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). High credibility.

Before the onset of the usual clinical symptoms of dementia, there can be subtle changes in cognitive function that differ from normal age-related cognitive decline, a condition termed mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The number of individuals with possible MCI presenting to healthcare professionals, particularly General Practitioners (GPs), is expected to rise dramatically in the coming years. With increasing demands on GPs, it is essential to provide accessible information that can assist healthcare professionals in making accurate diagnoses and providing the most relevant, evidence-based treatment options.

We have compiled a comprehensive list of recommendations to address key aspects of MCI in primary care. These specifically relate to detection and diagnosis, sharing the diagnosis, monitoring and follow-up, practical interventions to potentially delay progression, and personalizing care planning, engagement, and patient motivation for the long term.

### The emergence of a new conceptual framework for Alzheimer's disease [^116a87iJ]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

The new criteria for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), published by a group of experts in 2007, have resulted in a revolution in the comprehension of the disease. Before 2007, the diagnosis of AD dementia was done through a process of exclusion: it was considered in the case of patients with a dementia syndrome without identified etiologies. This traditional algorithm had three major limitations that penalized the disease: 1) a low accuracy of the performance, which may share responsibility for negative results in clinical trials; 2) a late identification of the patients only when they reach the threshold of dementia, which may delay the activation of optimal care; and last but not least, 3) an absence of clear recognition of AD as a disease because of the lack of specific arguments for its identification.

Since 2007, the disease has gained a clear definition based on positive evidence: a specific clinical phenotype (the amnestic syndrome of the hippocampal type) and the presence of biomarkers, considered a biological signature of the disease. Thanks to these positive arguments, AD is a clinically and biologically well-delineated disease, no longer defined as "probable". It is now possible to certify that a given patient has or does not have the disease. Like diabetes, cancer, hyperthyroidism, or any other disorder, AD now has a clear definition with well-defined borders. The disease has entered the world of medicine with identified diseases with a biological fingerprint. This is the story of this adventure that we will present now.

### Test your memory (TYM test): Diagnostic evaluation of patients with non-Alzheimer dementias [^112L8gxt]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Dementia is a major health problem with the prevalence increasing as the population ages. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, but many patients have non-Alzheimer dementias. Together, the non-Alzheimer diseases represent up to 50% of dementia cases and are substantial causes of morbidity and mortality globally. Examples include dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), behavioral and language variants of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), vascular dementia (VaD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and corticobasal syndrome (CBS). Additionally, AD pathology can present atypically as posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) or logopaenic aphasia. The diagnosis of non-Alzheimer dementia is challenging, as patients with early dementia often present to non-specialists who have limited knowledge of less common dementias and the myriad ways they present.

Diagnosing dementia requires a clinical assessment and examination, which in most healthcare settings includes the completion of a short cognitive test (SCT). It is important that any SCT used is sensitive to different forms of dementia, not just AD. There has been little research into the use of SCTs in the diagnosis of non-Alzheimer dementias. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is widely used and has been extensively investigated as a diagnostic test for dementia but may be insensitive to some non-Alzheimer dementias. More recently devised tests, such as the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examinations (ACE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), are sensitive to some non-Alzheimer forms.

### Alzheimer's Association clinical practice guideline on the use of blood-based biomarkers in the diagnostic workup of suspected Alzheimer's disease within specialized care settings [^1115uthu]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Low credibility.

The population and setting for this guideline include individuals with objective cognitive impairment (i.e. mild cognitive impairment or dementia) presenting to specialized care settings due to cognitive complaints. Objective cognitive impairment requires objective evidence of cognitive deficits detected by cognitive assessment tools and/or medical examination and provider assessment. It does not include subjective cognitive decline, in which the patient perceives changes in memory or other cognitive domains but performs as expected on cognitive testing, and a trained provider does not detect notable deficits (e.g. aphasia, disinhibition, executive dysfunction) in assessment.

The panel developed recommendations for blood-based biomarker (BBM) testing only in individuals with objective cognitive impairment who have already completed a comprehensive clinical workup. This guideline does not extend to cognitively unimpaired individuals, given the lack of clinical relevance for BBM use in this population. The panel made the a priori decision not to use data for cognitively impaired and unimpaired populations combined to inform recommendations, to minimize indirectness and because test performance could appear more favorable in populations with a bimodal distribution of brain amyloid (i.e. individuals with very low [cognitively unimpaired] or very high [Alzheimer's disease-like dementia] brain amyloid levels).

### Diagnosing and managing patients with dementia [^114guqMi]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

As the number of older Americans grows, the prevalence of dementia is increasing. Older patients who present to primary care offices often have some form of dementia, but various factors can cause the diagnosis to be missed or delayed. Physicians can work to proactively assess dementia in their patients and provide a timely diagnosis. The diagnostic process for dementia includes screening for pathology and, when indicated, conducting a cognitive evaluation and performing a differential diagnosis. Several brief but reliable tools are available to aid in screening and evaluating patients for dementia.

### Renal cell carcinoma presenting with paraneoplastic hallucinations and cognitive decline from limbic encephalitis [^112Qcyv2]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

We present a 66-year-old woman with 2 months of visual hallucinations, unintentional weight loss, and short-term memory decline, whose clinical presentation and EEG supported a diagnosis of limbic encephalitis. Subsequent evaluation for a paraneoplastic etiology revealed a renal mass, which was resected and identified as clear cell renal carcinoma. The patient's clinical condition improved after resection of the mass. When patients present with incongruous subacute neuropsychiatric symptoms, clinicians should be mindful of paraneoplastic neurological disorders, as early diagnosis and treatment of malignancy may lead to symptomatic improvement.

### Pseudodementia, pseudo-pseudodementia, and pseudodepression [^1142qCWS]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2020). Low credibility.

When evaluating a patient who shows signs of cognitive decline, it is crucial to exclude a number of reversible causes before diagnosing a neurodegenerative pathology. A well-known cause that needs to be excluded is depression. Depression can significantly impair cognition, especially in older adults, and if severe, may be mistaken for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative pathologies. Less commonly, other psychiatric conditions such as mania, other psychoses, and conversion disorder can also impair cognition and produce a similar clinical picture.

Historically, this phenomenon has been known as "pseudodementia", defined as a psychiatric condition masquerading as a neurodegenerative disease but largely reversible when the psychiatric condition resolves or is successfully treated. The term was attributed to Wernicke, although this diagnostic possibility was known well before then. Despite a flurry of academic activity on the topic in the 1980s and 1990s, interest has now largely subsided. In this article, we reconsider the empirical evidence for the construct and reasons for this decline. We argue that pseudodementia and other related terms, while not supplanting modern diagnostic criteria, are essential for identifying unique groups of patients with atypical presentations of their disorders and for highlighting potential pitfalls in clinical decision-making.

### Isolated memory loss in anti-NMDAR encephalitis [^112h4634]. Neurology (2022). High credibility.

To report a case of anti-NMDAR encephalitis presenting with isolated memory dysfunction, a 29-year-old woman was admitted to the Neurology Department, referring memory impairment with a subacute onset. The initial assessment included EEG, neuropsychological tests, and brain MRI. Serum and CSF samples were collected for immunologic studies. The diagnostic evaluation was completed with a total body PET scan.

The patient's neurologic examination was unremarkable apart from an episodic memory deficit confirmed by a neuropsychological examination. The EEG revealed epileptiform discharges in the temporal lobes, whereas the brain MRI showed bilateral temporal lobes hyperintense lesions on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images and T2-weighted images. NMDAR-IgG was detected in the patient's serum and CSF by cell-based assay, confirming the diagnosis of definite anti-NMDAR encephalitis. The total body PET showed only slight hypometabolism in the right temporal cortex and in the cerebellar hemispheres. After a course of IV immunoglobulin and corticosteroid therapy, a marked improvement in the memory deficit was observed.

This case shows that anti-NMDAR encephalitis can present with isolated memory loss. Neural antibody testing in these patients could play a pivotal role in early diagnosis and prompt treatment.

### Is the time ripe for new diagnostic criteria of cognitive impairment due to cerebrovascular disease? Consensus report of the International Congress on Vascular Dementia working group [^117XZ4YJ]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Long before Alzheimer's disease was established as the leading cause of dementia in old age, cerebrovascular lesions were known to cause cognitive deterioration and associated disability. Since the middle of the last century, different diagnostic concepts for vascular dementia and related syndromes were put forward, yet no widely accepted diagnostic consensus exists at the time of writing.

- **Discussion**: Several international efforts, reviewed herein, are ongoing to define cognitive impairment due to cerebrovascular disease in its different stages and subtypes. The role of biomarkers is also being discussed, including cerebrospinal fluid proteins, structural and functional brain imaging, and genetic markers. The influence of risk factors, such as diet, exercise, and different comorbidities, is emphasized by population-based research, and lifestyle changes are considered for the treatment and prevention of dementia.

- **Conclusion**: To improve the diagnosis and management of vascular cognitive impairment, further progress has to be made in understanding the relevant pathomechanisms, including shared mechanisms with Alzheimer's disease; bringing together fragmented research initiatives in coordinated international programs; testing if known risk factors are modifiable in prospective interventional studies; and defining the pre-dementia and pre-clinical stages in line with the concept of mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease.

### Relationship between the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Mini-Mental State Examination for assessment of mild cognitive impairment in older adults [^111GS32s]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was developed to enable earlier detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) relative to familiar multi-domain tests like the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Clinicians need to better understand the relationship between MoCA and MMSE scores.

- **Methods**: For this cross-sectional study, we analyzed 219 healthy control (HC), 299 MCI, and 100 Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia cases from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-GO/2 database to evaluate MMSE and MoCA score distributions. The goal was to select MoCA values that capture early and late MCI cases. Stepwise variable selection in logistic regression evaluated the relative value of four test domains for separating MCI from HC. The Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) was evaluated as a strategy to separate dementia from MCI. Equi-percentile equating produced a translation grid for MoCA against MMSE scores. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses evaluated lower cutoff scores for capturing the most MCI cases.

- **Results**: Most dementia cases scored abnormally, while MCI and HC score distributions overlapped on each test. Most MCI cases scored ≥ 17 on MoCA (96.3%) and ≥ 24 on MMSE (98.3%). The ceiling effect (28–30 points) for MCI and HC was less using MoCA (18.1%) versus MMSE (71.4%). MoCA and MMSE scores correlated most for dementia (r = 0.86), compared to MCI (r = 0.60) and HC (r = 0.43). Equi-percentile equating showed a MoCA score of 18 was equivalent to MMSE of 24. ROC analysis found MoCA ≥ 17 as the cutoff between MCI and dementia that emphasized high sensitivity (92.3%).

### Alzheimer's Association clinical practice guideline on the use of blood-based biomarkers in the diagnostic workup of suspected Alzheimer's disease within specialized care settings [^111gJQTX]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

- **Guideline scope**: The panel identified two key clinical questions that warrant recommendation in this first iteration of the guideline: Should a blood-based biomarker (BBM) test be incorporated as a triaging test to determine the presence or absence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in the diagnostic workup of individuals with cognitive impairment (including those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia) presenting for specialized care for memory disorders? Should a BBM test serve as a substitute for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis or amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) as a confirmatory test to determine the presence or absence of AD pathology in the diagnostic workup of patients with cognitive impairment (MCI or dementia) presenting for specialized care for memory disorders?

A triaging test refers to a test in which a negative result rules out AD pathology with a high probability, whereas a positive result should be confirmed using another method, such as CSF AD biomarkers or amyloid PET. A confirmatory test refers to a test for which a negative result rules out AD pathology, and a positive test confirms AD pathology with a high probability.

Input on these questions was gathered during the 2024 Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC), where experts in the field provided insights to inform the development of this guideline.

This guideline is not intended to serve as a comprehensive clinical pathway or appropriate use recommendations for the broader diagnostic workup or treatment decision‐making in individuals with MCI or dementia. It does not address the use of BBMs for screening purposes, use in non‐specialty settings, or use in people with no cognitive impairment.

### Biomarkers for cognitive impairment and dementia in elderly people [^112rtZE8]. The Lancet Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

The threat of a looming pandemic of dementia in elderly people highlights the compelling need for the development and validation of biomarkers that can be used to identify pre-clinical and prodromal stages of the disease, in addition to fully symptomatic dementia. Although predictive risk factors and correlative neuroimaging measures will have important roles in these efforts, this review describes recent progress in the discovery, validation, and standardization of molecular biomarkers — small molecules and macromolecules whose concentration in the brain or biological fluids can aid diagnosis at different stages of the more common dementing diseases and in the assessment of disease progression and response to therapeutics. An approach that efficiently combines independent information from risk-factor assessment, neuroimaging measures, and biomarkers might soon guide clinicians in the early diagnosis and management of cognitive impairment in elderly people.

### Confabulation, amnesia and motor memory loss as a presentation of apparent ITPR1 antibody autoimmune encephalitis [^111fG3k8]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 59-year-old woman presented to the hospital with acute, hypoactive altered mental status. Her symptoms began three days earlier, characterized by hallucinations, urinary and fecal incontinence, and somnolence. She also exhibited confabulations, amnesia, motor memory loss, and a wide-based gait. Medical, psychiatric, and neurological evaluations, including imaging and laboratory workup, were unrevealing.

Treatment for possible Wernicke encephalopathy and psychosis with high-dose intravenous thiamine and antipsychotic medications did not lead to improvement. After discharge, a send-out cerebrospinal fluid autoimmune encephalitis panel returned positive for the newly identified neuronal inositol triphosphate receptor one (ITPR1) antibody. This prompted readmission for intravenous steroids, plasmapheresis, and intravenous immunoglobulin, which yielded mild clinical improvement.

We describe confabulations and psychiatric symptoms as novel manifestations of the primary presentation of anti-ITPR1 encephalitis. This is in an effort to promote faster recognition of this disease and early initiation of treatment in suspected cases.

**Key points**: Initiating the diagnostic workup for dementia is a delicate process influenced by various factors. Some complexities, such as fear, stigma, and reluctance, complicate shared decision-making with patients and families. The different strategies that primary care practitioners (PCPs) use to address these complexities cannot be captured by a single correct approach. Recommendations include ensuring consistent communication, clarifying roles, and promoting interprofessional collaboration. PCPs' confidence could be enhanced, particularly in managing conflicting priorities and interpreting cognitive test results.

### A 73-year-old woman with confusion, visual field disturbances, and edematous white matter lesions: From the National Multiple Sclerosis Society case conference proceedings [^111B6R1o]. Neurology (2024). High credibility.

A leptomeningeal biopsy was performed. Histopathologic analysis showed transmural inflammation of amyloid-β (Aβ)-laden arterioles, consistent with a diagnosis of Aβ-related angiitis (ABRA; Figure 2). The patient received IV methylprednisolone 1,000 mg daily for 5 days. Levetiracetam was started for the treatment of focal nonmotor seizures with impaired awareness. Upon hospital discharge, she was prescribed prednisone 60 mg daily, tapered over 6 months, and mycophenolate mofetil 1,000 mg twice daily.

- **Neuropathology**: There was extensive immunohistochemical Aβ staining within leptomeningeal arterioles (A, arrow; 10× magnification). Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed vessel mural thickening with replacement of the vessel media with Aβ (B, arrowhead; 100× magnification). Transmural, angiodestructive inflammation with multinucleated giant cells was consistent with amyloid-β–related angiitis (C; 100× magnification).

Three months after hospital discharge, the patient's cognition and bradyphrenia had substantially improved. There were no further seizures. Her left homonymous hemianopia was unchanged. She had also developed visual release hallucinations in her left visual hemifields characterized by continuous streams of colors and light. Repeat brain MRI showed improvement in the right temporo-occipital T2-hyperintense lesion and resolution of leptomeningeal enhancement.

### Diagnostic evaluation of elderly patients with mild memory problems [^111PyVxr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

This case-based discussion focuses on the clinical presentation and diagnostic assessment of a uniquely challenging group of elderly patients: those with symptoms of mild memory problems. Such patients present a challenge to clinicians because of flux in our understandings of normal, age-related cognitive changes; of cognitive changes due to neurodegenerative illnesses; and of the relationships between depression and cognitive impairment. In addition, symptoms of memory problems may be reported by an observer rather than by the patient. These challenges warrant stepwise evaluation of elderly patients who present with symptoms of memory loss.

### The Alzheimer's Association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): Executive summary of recommendations for specialty care [^1147y65Y]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

**Which patients might be considered for a referral to a specialist**: Some patients — especially those who are relatively young — may not only present with an unusual history of subtle, atypical, or rapidly progressive symptoms but may also exhibit unusual signs on office‐based examination. An evaluation by a specialist or a dementia subspecialist should be strongly considered if a patient presents with atypical cognitive abnormalities (e.g. aphasia, apraxia, agnosia), sensorimotor dysfunction (e.g. cortical visual abnormalities, movement or gait disorders), accompanying mood/behavioral disturbance (e.g. profound anxiety, depression, apathy, psychosis, or changes in personality), rapid progression, or fluctuating course (e.g. suggestive of potential superimposed delirium, LBD, or VCID; Figure 3). Delirium and rapidly progressive dementia (usually defined as developing within weeks or months) are urgent medical problems requiring prompt examination, and in some cases, in‐patient evaluation and management. Patients with atypical forms of neurodegenerative dementias may have substantially different care and management needs and considerations regarding safety than patients with typical presentations of dementia due to AD. Delays in accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of patients with atypical and young‐onset dementias may cause substantial distress, harm, and costs to patients, families, and society, especially when a patient is working and/or raising children at home.

### Should older adults be screened for dementia? It is important to screen for evidence of dementia [^111Tt9Ju]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2007). Low credibility.

Multiple arguments have been presented for considering routine dementia screening. Dementia diagnoses are widely unrecognized, resulting in individuals with dementia missing important clinical care and treatment interventions. In contrast, the challenges of defining, diagnosing, and treating mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remain unresolved, precluding a screening recommendation for MCI.

- **Dementia screening approaches**: These, including cognitive testing and functional assessment, must be evaluated on scientific merits like sensitivity and specificity for recognizing affected individuals in at-risk populations.

- **Cost-worthiness of screening tests**: The benefits of true-positive results must justify the costs of testing and resolving false-positive cases. This must be done with consideration for proper diagnostic evaluation and potential harms.

Given the projected rise in new dementia cases and the anticipated emergence of beneficial therapies, significantly more research is necessary to develop efficient screening systems.

### Advancing diagnostic certainty in Alzheimer's disease: A synthesis of the diagnostic process [^112p4jMf]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2023). Low credibility.

The most common clinical presentation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a slowly progressive amnestic syndrome. However, a proportion of patients present with atypical phenotypes, including dysfunction in visual, language, executive, behavioral, or motor domains. Early-onset AD is defined as the onset of symptoms before the age of 65 years. Atypical presentations are more common in early-onset AD. Much of clinical diagnosis within medicine is based on pattern recognition. A combination of younger onset, which is rare, and an atypical presentation may lead to a reduction in such cases of AD being identified and a subsequent delay in diagnosis. In a cohort of young-onset cases with neuropathological AD confirmation, there was a misdiagnosis rate of 53% for those with atypical presentations versus 4% for patients with a more typical presentation.

The quality of the clinical assessment and access to a comprehensive history impact the pre-test probability of a diagnosis of AD. This can prove challenging when patients attend clinic alone or may not have an available or reliable informant. Access to a collateral history is essential for making a diagnosis of AD. Patients with cognitive impairment are less likely to be able to convey information regarding their premorbid level of function and cognition and how this has changed over time. Additionally, the patient may lack insight into the degree of difficulties they are experiencing. Despite collateral history being a cornerstone of diagnostic assessment, there is little research available.

### Status of memory loss [^114SKQGh]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

A 72-year-old woman presented with the first onset of seizure, with no prior history of cognitive dysfunction. EEG revealed focal non-convulsive status epilepticus. MRI brain showed a left temporal non-enhancing lesion. Temporal pole biopsy showed acute neuronal necrosis and astrocyte hyperplasia, together with extensive amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Perivascular oligodendroglial hyperplasia was present.

Postmortem examination revealed extensive plaque and tangle disease. Perivascular oligodendroglial hyperplasia was limited to the left temporal area. The presence of focal perivascular oligodendroglial hyperplasia in the left temporal cortex, combined with extensive plaque and tangle disease, may have contributed to the focal status epilepticus in this patient. Although the presence of focal perivascular oligodendroglial hyperplasia has been reported in cases of temporal lobe epilepsy, it has not been reported as a cause of seizures in patients with Alzheimer's disease previously. Further studies for clinical-pathologic correlation would be required to confirm this hypothesis.

### Alzheimer's disease [^114s3VcE]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2015). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Alzheimer's disease:

- **Definition**: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, and functional impairment.

- **Pathophysiology**: Alzheimer's disease is characterized by two primary pathophysiological mechanisms: the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. In addition, neuroinflammation, characterized by alterations in the functional responses of microglia and astrocytes and dysregulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, also plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease worldwide is estimated at 598.97 per 100,000 population.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for Alzheimer's disease include advancing age, a family history of the disease, and a genetic predisposition, particularly the presence of the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, Alzheimer's disease presents with progressive memory decline as well as cognitive deficits with executive dysfunction, language, visual perceptual difficulties, apraxia, and agnosia. Emotional and behavioral symptoms may also emerge in the moderate-to-severe stages of the disease.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Alzheimer's disease is a chronic condition with no known cure. The prognosis is typically poor as the disease progressively worsens over time. The life expectancy following a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can vary between 3 to 10 years, with age being a significant factor.

### Young-onset Alzheimer dementia due to a novel pathogenic variant initially misdiagnosed as autoimmune encephalitis [^115LvqbD]. Neurology (2024). High credibility.

In 2016, a 32-year-old woman presented with progressive memory loss, interfering with her daily activities. She had a medical history of hepatitis C, treated accordingly. There was no family history of neurologic diseases or autoimmunity. Initially, a primary psychiatric disorder was suspected. After two years, her neurologic condition continued to deteriorate slowly, and she was referred for her first neurologic evaluation in July 2018. By that time, neuropsychological evaluation showed severe amnestic impairment, along with moderate deficits in executive functions, visual perception, and visuoconstruction; her MMSE score was 23. The remainder of the neurologic examination was unremarkable.

Brain MRI revealed FLAIR-hyperintense foci in the white matter and FLAIR-hyperintensity of the left hippocampus. The initial CSF analysis was normal, and EEG demonstrated a frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA pattern). Commercial antineural antibody tests were negative (additional data are listed in eAppendix 1). An initial diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis (AE) was made, and the patient was treated with IV immunoglobulin (IVIg) and corticosteroids for two months with no response. In the ensuing months, she developed generalized seizures, well controlled with valproate.

After four years from the onset of symptoms, she was referred for our evaluation. Her cognitive assessment showed an MMSE score of 16. A new CSF examination revealed mild pleocytosis (7 white cells per mm³, lymphocytic), with no other abnormalities, including absent oligoclonal bands. Further testing and evaluation were conducted to reassess her condition.

### Screening for mild cognitive impairment: Comparison of "MCI specific" screening instruments [^112BYJxJ]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

As society ages, the prevalence of cognitive impairment (CI) is expected to rise, resulting in increased numbers of older people presenting with memory complaints. Memory loss is a spectrum from subjective memory complaints (SMC), which are characterized by normal cognition on neuropsychological testing, to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. SMCs are common, increase with age, and are associated with cognitive decline. MCI represents a heterogeneous group of disorders of memory impairment, characterized by objective and subjective memory loss but preserved function, with variable progression to dementia. Different treatment approaches are recommended depending on where patients fall on the spectrum. Thus, sensitive and specific instruments are required to screen for CI, particularly in busy clinical settings.

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a well-established cognitive screen, highly sensitive at differentiating MCI from normal cognition and dementia and is widely validated against the most commonly used instrument, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), in multiple settings, disorders, and languages. Normative population data are also available. The MoCA overcomes the high ceiling effects and educational bias associated with the MMSE, has fewer practice effects, and is available in multiple formats. Although the MoCA is increasingly considered the short cognitive instrument of choice, its use as a screen presents some challenges. It is long, taking at least 10 minutes to complete, and its subtest scores are criticized for having low accuracy.

- **When should FDG PET imaging be considered**: FDG PET is a measure of cellular glucose metabolism, which is usually reduced with particular patterns in patients with dementia due to AD, FTLD, LBD, and other neurodegenerative diseases, indicating synaptic dysfunction. As detailed in Recommendation 16, FDG PET may be considered in cognitively or behaviorally impaired patients in whom the etiological diagnosis is equivocal when there is only an intermediate level of diagnostic confidence, or when having very high confidence in the etiological diagnosis is needed. This may include individuals at very early clinical stages (e.g. early MCI) or those with atypical clinical presentations or syndromes. The interpretation of FDG PET images requires proficiency and clinical-radiographic correlation; it is not always straightforward, and like other biomarkers, should incorporate pretest probability based on the clinical presentation and risk profile of the patient, considering the possibility of multiple pathologies.

- **Historical context and accuracy**: In 2004, CMS approved reimbursement of FDG PET for the purposes of differential diagnosis of AD versus FTLD. For differentiating AD versus FTLD, autopsy studies have shown that FDG PET has 80% to 99% sensitivity, 63% to 98% specificity, and 87% to 89.2% accuracy. For AD versus LBD, FDG PET has 70% to 92% sensitivity, 74% to 100% specificity, and 72% to 96% accuracy. The preponderance of high-level evidence and consensus recommendations indicates that FDG PET adds value to the diagnostic workup of patients with MCI or dementia suspected of being due to neurodegenerative disease.

### Diagnostic profile of young and middle-aged memory clinic patients [^117F7C8d]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

With the objective of characterizing the underlying conditions in younger patients with cognitive symptoms, 314 consecutive patients were studied. These patients, aged under 60 years, were referred to a multidisciplinary memory clinic over a period of 54 months. Fifteen percent of the patients fulfilled the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV criteria for dementia, 17% had selective cognitive deficits, and 55% had no cognitive deficits. Cognitive symptoms in younger patients rarely reflect dementia but more often indicate other medical and psychiatric conditions.

### Early diagnosis of dementia [^111EaCa4]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Until recently, the most significant issue facing a family physician regarding the diagnosis and treatment of dementia was ruling out delirium and potentially treatable etiologies. However, as more treatment options become available, it will become increasingly important to diagnose dementia early. Dementia may be suspected if memory deficits are exhibited during the medical history and physical examination. Information from the patient's family members, friends, and caregivers may also point to signs of dementia. Distinguishing among age-related cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease may be difficult and requires evaluation of cognitive and functional status.

Careful medical evaluation to exclude treatable causes of cognitive impairment is important. Patients with early dementia may benefit from formal neuropsychologic testing to aid in medical and social decision-making. Follow-up by the patient's family physician is appropriate for most patients. However, a subspecialist may be helpful in the diagnosis and management of patients with dementia with an unusual presentation or following an atypical course.

### Harmonized diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease: Recommendations [^116D88Ze]. Journal of internal medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Two major sets of criteria for the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have recently been published: one from an International Working Group (IWG) and the other from working groups convened by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the Alzheimer's Association (AA) in the United States. These criteria aim to support a clinical diagnosis with in vivo evidence of AD pathology using imaging methods and the detection of biofluid biomarkers. They emphasize an etiological diagnosis even in the prodromal stages of the disorder. Nonetheless, there are substantial differences between these two sets of criteria.

- **Methods**: An international group of investigators with experience in the clinical diagnosis of AD met at the Key Symposium in Stockholm, Sweden, on December 6 and 7, 2012, to develop recommendations to harmonize these criteria. Led by individuals integral to the development of both the IWG and the NIA-AA criteria, the group identified the similarities and differences between the two sets. Open discussions focused on resolving the differences to yield a harmonized set of criteria.

- **Results**: Based on published evidence and the group's collective clinical experience, they were tasked with achieving consensus, if not unanimity, as they developed recommendations for harmonized clinical diagnostic criteria for AD.

- **Conclusion**: The recommendations are to: (i) define AD as a brain disorder, regardless of clinical status; (ii) refer to the clinically expressed disorder, including its prodromal stages, as symptoms.

### Social representation of dementia: An analysis of 5,792 consecutive cases evaluated in a memory clinic [^1151oeFo]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2017). High credibility.

Access to the diagnostic process involves various pathways. For 79.6% of all people diagnosed with dementia, the family initiated access to the diagnostic process; for 1.8%, the affected individuals themselves initiated it; and for 18.6%, a medical professional started the process. These proportions vary according to the disease status measured by MMSE and GDS. We found a statistically significant difference in the patient's stage of dementia depending on who started the diagnostic process. When a relative or healthcare practitioner triggered the process, 32.3% or 30.9% of individuals with dementia were in a moderate stage, and 7.7% or 8.1% were in a moderately severe stage, respectively. Conversely, when the patient themselves initiated the process, dementia was in a mild stage in 86.4% of the cases and in a moderate or moderately severe stage in 13.6% of the cases (p = 0.03).

- **Cognition, disease status, and access to diagnostic process**: When clinicians initiated the diagnostic process, relatives often did not observe any alteration in the patient's normal state or dismissed deficiencies as age- or mood-related rather than disease-related:

	- "He has better memory than myself, he even remembers when he was a child. I do not know why the doctor says that he is losing his memory".
	- "If she is not well, she would have told us. She has not said anything".
	- "What happens is that she does not remember knowing. She is not unsound".
	- "It's normal, she is getting older".

### The Italian guideline on diagnosis and treatment of dementia and mild cognitive impairment [^113gFjCH]. Age and Ageing (2024). High credibility.

A timely, accurate diagnosis allows for targeted interventions and appropriate care for people with suspected dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), as well as their caregivers. Although most people prefer to be informed about their dementia diagnosis, it can cause emotional distress for both people with dementia (PwD) and their families.

- **Research questions included**: Four research questions (RQs) were addressed: two from NG97 and two new ones. Two RQs focused on diagnostic studies evaluating the accuracy of tests used in non-specialist, primary care settings, while the other two concentrated on tests utilized in specialist settings. All the diagnostic tests considered in the included studies are listed in Supplementary Table S4.

Overall, 10 studies (three from the literature update) were included for non-specialist settings and 151 studies for specialist settings.

- **Evaluation in non-specialist settings**: The initial evaluation in a non-specialist setting should include medical history, physical examination, blood tests, and either Computer Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to exclude potentially reversible or secondary causes of cognitive decline. Cognitive tests should also be administered. For suspected cognitive decline, physicians in non-specialist settings should use brief, validated cognitive tests, preferring those translated into Italian (e.g. 6-CIT, TYM) or validated in the Italian population (e.g. GPCOG).

Physicians should not rule out cognitive decline based solely on normal cognitive test scores, and cognitive function should be regularly monitored.

### Outcome measures for Alzheimer's disease: A global inter-societal Delphi consensus [^11254UVw]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Low credibility.

It should be noted that cognitive tests, such as the MMSE and MoCA, have limitations. For example, at initial assessment, these measures are unable to determine whether a person's performance represents a decline from prior function. Cognitive tests cannot capture decline (unless obtained serially, which is not possible when a person initially presents for diagnosis) but are able to show a comparison of a person's performance on cognitive tests with the test performance of normative groups (inter-individual comparison). Because almost all normative groups are composed mainly of white people (and many are limited to English-speaking white people), cognitive test assessment of non-white people is further complicated by test bias. Ideally, a measure would capture intra-individual change and use the patient as his or her own control, which would reduce the bias currently seen with norm-referenced tests.

### Is the time ripe for new diagnostic criteria of cognitive impairment due to cerebrovascular disease? Consensus report of the International Congress on Vascular Dementia working group [^1115b52Z]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Validated clinical diagnostic criteria are important to identify suitable subjects for clinical trials to develop new drugs for VCI. Their relevance increases further if treatment strategies are to be developed that target specific pathogenic cerebrovascular mechanisms leading to VCI. Furthermore, lifestyle interventions and other non-pharmacological approaches can only be developed if the target populations are clearly defined. Efforts towards a consensus on diagnostic criteria and guidelines to account for the heterogeneous nature of VCI, such as the recent International Society for Vascular Behavioural and Cognitive Disorders statement, must be encouraged. However, despite considerable recent advances, there are significant gaps in our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underpinning the various dementia forms. Further research is therefore required before definitive criteria and guidelines can be formulated. Additionally, the success of such criteria will ultimately depend on robust pathological and clinical validation and the support of the international research community.

The present paper summarizes recent major developments concerning the clinical diagnosis of VCI. We discuss how this entity is handled in the new DSM-V criteria, how our knowledge about the relevant neuro-pathological changes impacts the concepts surrounding this diagnosis, and what role fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers play. Further, we briefly summarize the knowledge about risk factors and how they should be addressed in the context of the clinical diagnosis.

### A 76-year-old man with cognitive and neurological symptoms [^115gTnfs]. Brain Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

A 76-year-old man presented with cognitive symptoms, followed by headache and weakness of the lower limbs and left arm. The clinical course was progressive but fluctuating. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a contrast-enhancing lesion 1 cm in diameter was seen in the left temporal lobe. This lesion became attenuated, and a new contrast-enhancing lesion measuring 1 x 2 cm was observed in the left frontal lobe on a subsequent MRI. Following additional tests, treatment with corticosteroids for presumptive neurosarcoidosis was started; however, he soon expired. At autopsy, a tumor-like mass was found in the left frontal lobe. Pathologic evaluation revealed a primary T-cell lymphoma of the central nervous system (CNS). CNS T-cell lymphomas may be difficult to diagnose, even histologically, due to their frequent small cell morphology and lack of significant atypia.

### Early-onset dementia: diagnostic challenges [^116FHnu2]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A 56-year-old man was brought to our hospital by his family, seeking medical treatment for his long-standing progressive word-finding difficulties, forgetfulness, agitation, and social withdrawal. After multiple previous physician consultations, the patient was mistakenly diagnosed with epilepsy and prescribed multiple anticonvulsants, to which his aforementioned symptoms were unresponsive. His condition progressed over the next 10 years, resulting in severe cognitive impairments and complete dysfunctionality. An electroencephalogram (EEG) assessment revealed persistent spike and wave activity in the left temporal lobe. Brain MRI revealed multiple small bright T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) foci within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres surrounding the ventricular system, as well as some widening of extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid spaces. The patient was finally diagnosed with early-onset dementia and temporal lobe epileptiform abnormalities. This case emphasizes the need for diagnostic consideration of dementia in cognitively impaired patients, even when they are not of an advanced age.

### Recommendations for clinical implementation of blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease [^115vbm1K]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Low credibility.

- **Determining the need for initial workup and determining the level of concern for AD**: The healthcare provider (HCP) should assess whether the patient has objective cognitive symptoms that warrant further evaluation. If no objective cognitive symptoms are present and/or the patient declines further workup, no additional follow-up should be conducted. It may be suggested that the patient be reassessed in 6 to 12 months if the cognitive symptoms persist. If the patient has objective cognitive symptoms and is amenable to further testing, an initial workup should be initiated. The initial workup may occur during the same visit or at a follow-up visit.

	- The initial workup should include cognitive screening, depression and/or neurobehavioral screening, and routine bloodwork to evaluate potential treatable causes of cognitive impairment (e.g. vitamin B12 deficiency, thyroid abnormalities). Upon reviewing the results of the initial workup, the HCP should determine the patient's level of risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in accordance with local clinical and practice standards. If AD is suspected as the cause of cognitive impairment, the HCP should discuss the results with the patient and care partner, ensuring their interest in continued workup before proceeding. Conversely, if the patient's cognitive impairment is not thought to be caused by AD, the patient should be evaluated for non-AD causes of cognitive impairment.

- **Conducting a BBM test in primary or secondary care**: The next step is to conduct a blood-based biomarker (BBM) test in either primary or secondary care.

### A 60-year-old woman with mild memory impairment: Review of mild cognitive impairment [^114AyTeM]. JAMA (2008). Low credibility.

Many older individuals experience cognitive impairment that is significantly abnormal for their age and education yet beneath the threshold for a diagnosis of dementia. This mild cognitive impairment causes minimal functional impairment and is often overlooked in clinical settings, yet affected individuals are at heightened risk for a range of adverse outcomes, including conversion to dementia. The case of Ms. E, a 60-year-old woman with mild memory impairment and white matter lesions on magnetic resonance imaging, provides an opportunity to consider the questions that face patients, families, and clinicians when mild cognitive symptoms prompt a search for diagnosis and management options.

Discussion of her case reviews mild cognitive impairment with an emphasis on an evidence-based approach to evaluation and treatment, including management of comorbid medical conditions, lifestyle changes, and pharmacotherapy.

### Nationally informed recommendations on approaching the detection, assessment, and management of mild cognitive impairment [^116NWTcQ]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Prior to the usual clinical symptoms of dementia, there can be subtle changes in cognitive function that differ from the normal age-related cognitive decline, which has been termed mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The increase in the numbers of individuals with possible MCI presenting to health care professionals, notably general practitioners (GPs), is going to rise dramatically in the coming years. With ever-increasing demands on GPs, it is therefore timely to provide information that can be accessed by health care professionals to assist them in making appropriate diagnoses and to provide the most relevant, evidence-based treatment options.

We have provided a comprehensive list of recommendations that aim to address key aspects of MCI in primary care. Specifically, these relate to detection and diagnosis; sharing the diagnosis, monitoring, and follow-up; practical interventions to potentially delay progression; and personalizing care — planning, engagement, and patient motivation for the long term.

### The diagnosis of young-onset dementia [^114XqazZ]. The Lancet Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

A diagnosis of dementia is devastating at any age, but diagnosis in younger patients presents a particular challenge. The differential diagnosis is broad, as late presentation of metabolic disease is common, and the burden of inherited dementia is higher in these patients than in those with late-onset dementia. The presentation of common degenerative diseases of late life, such as Alzheimer's disease, can be different when presenting in the fifth or sixth decade. Moreover, many of the young-onset dementias are treatable. The identification of causative genes for many of the inherited degenerative dementias has led to an understanding of the molecular pathology, which is also applicable to later-onset sporadic disease. This understanding offers the potential for future treatments to be tailored to a specific diagnosis of both young-onset and late-onset dementia.

### Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis: Ovarian cancer presenting as an amnesic syndrome [^112jxDeq]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (PLE) is a rare neurologic manifestation of malignancy, typically presenting with short-term memory loss, seizures, or other limbic system abnormalities. The majority of PLE cases are associated with lung and testicular cancer.

- **Case**: We present the first case of PLE attributable to epithelial ovarian cancer. The 58-year-old woman presented with rapidly progressing short-term memory loss and amnesia. The diagnosis of ovarian cancer was suspected based on computed tomography scan findings. The patient showed dramatic clinical improvement within two weeks of debulking surgery and following the initiation of plasmapheresis and chemotherapy.

- **Conclusion**: Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis is a rare complication of ovarian tumors that is potentially reversible with prompt surgical management of the primary tumor, plasmapheresis, and chemotherapy.

### Alzheimer's Association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): Executive summary of recommendations for primary care [^117UTyiM]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

For each recommendation, a series of bullet points describing the rationale and considerations for implementation were written, followed by a narrative citing evidence for the recommendation, considerations for how to operationalize the actions represented by that recommendation, and specific situations that may be exceptions. The DETeCD‐ADRD CPG Report was then circulated to a panel of external reviewers for peer review. Based on feedback from the external reviewers and developments in the field (particularly related to advances in and accessibility of cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] and positron emission tomography [PET] biomarkers in the United States from 2020–2023), the 19 DETeCD‐ADRD CPG Recommendations underwent several revisions. The final 19 DETeCD‐ADRD CPG Recommendations achieved unanimous consensus for adoption on October 25, 2023. The DETeCD‐ADRD CPG Report was revised accordingly, with point‐by‐point responses to reviews documented. The final DETeCD‐ADRD CPG Comprehensive Report was unanimously approved by workgroup members and is available online.

### Initial evaluation of the patient with suspected dementia [^117D8ZRZ]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Dementia is a common disorder among older individuals, with projections indicating that the number of patients with dementia in the United States will continue to grow. Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia account for the majority of dementia cases. After conducting a thorough history and physical examination, including discussions with family members, a baseline measurement of cognitive function should be obtained. The Mini-Mental State Examination is the most commonly used instrument to document cognitive impairment.

Initial laboratory evaluation should include tests for thyroid-stimulating hormone and vitamin B12 levels. Structural neuroimaging, with noncontrast computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, is also recommended. Further testing should be guided by the history and physical examination. Neuropsychological testing can help ascertain the extent of cognitive impairment but is not recommended on a routine basis. It is most helpful when screening tests are normal or equivocal, yet there remains a high level of concern about possible cognitive impairment.

### Advances in diagnosis of Alzheimer disease and emerging treatment targets [^115RmPUR]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Until recently, the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) could not be truly made until an autopsy was done. Patients' diagnosis relied on clinicians' skills to recognize signs and symptoms of AD, and the diagnosis was often incorrect. The rate of misdiagnosis was higher in earlier disease stages when symptoms are milder. Researchers have made great strides over the past two decades in identifying diagnostic biomarkers and treatment targets. Can AD now be diagnosed before patients show symptoms? What do potential treatments look like? This CME presentation highlights exciting developments.

### Mci-to-normal reversion using neuropsychological criteria in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [^111DV796]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2019). Low credibility.

The low mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to cognitively normal (CN) reversion rate in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (2–3%) suggests the need to examine reversion by other means. We applied comprehensive neuropsychological criteria (NP criteria) to determine the resulting MCI to CN reversion rate.

- **Methods**: Participants with CN (n = 641) or MCI (n = 569) were classified at baseline and year 1 using NP criteria. Demographic, neuropsychological, and Alzheimer's disease biomarker variables, as well as progression to dementia, were examined across stable CN, reversion, and stable MCI groups.

- **Results**: NP criteria produced a one-year reversion rate of 15.8%. Reverters had demographics, Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, and risk-of-progression most similar to the stable CN group and showed the most improvement on neuropsychological measures from baseline to year 1.

- **Discussion**: NP criteria produced a reversion rate that is consistent with, albeit modestly improved from, reversion rates in meta-analyses. Reverters' biomarker profiles and progression rates suggest that NP criteria accurately tracked with underlying pathophysiologic status.

### Multicenter validation of an MMSE-MoCA conversion table [^115xwySW]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2017). Low credibility.

Accumulating evidence points to the superiority of the MoCA over the MMSE as a cognitive screening tool. To facilitate the transition from the MMSE to the MoCA in clinical and research settings, authors have developed MMSE-MoCA conversion tables. However, it is unknown whether a conversion table generated from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients would apply to patients with other dementia subtypes like vascular dementia or frontotemporal dementia. Furthermore, the reliability and accuracy of MMSE-MoCA conversion tables have not been properly evaluated.

- **Method**: We retrospectively examined the MMSE-MoCA relationship in a large multicenter sample gathered from three Memory Clinics in Quebec, Canada (1492 patients). We produced an MMSE-MoCA conversion table using the equi-percentile method with log-linear smoothing. We then cross-validated our conversion table with the ADNI dataset (1202 patients) and evaluated its accuracy for future predictions.

- **Results**: The MMSE-MoCA conversion table is consistent with previously published tables and has an intra-class correlation of 0.633 with the ADNI sample. However, we found that the MMSE-MoCA relationship is significantly modified by diagnosis (P < .01), with dementia subtypes associated with a dysexecutive syndrome showing a trend towards higher MMSE than other dementia syndromes for a given MoCA score. The large width of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for a new prediction suggests questionable reliability for clinical use.

- **Conclusion**: In this study, we validated a conversion table between MMSE and MoCA using a large multicenter sample.

### A review of the non-Alzheimer dementias [^112StRwc]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006).

The objective of this review is to examine the clinical and neuropathologic features, clinical course, differential diagnosis, evaluation, and management strategies of primary non-Alzheimer degenerative and prion disorders that cause dementia.

- **Data sources**: The PubMed MEDLINE search engine was used to query all published articles written in English from January 1990 to August 2005, using keywords such as non-Alzheimer, tau, tauopathy, synuclein, synucleinopathy, prion, cognitive impairment, and dementia syndrome. Additional searches were conducted on On-Line Mendelian Inheritance in Man and GeneTests. Reputable organizations promoting education and research in specific syndromes and disorders were also queried using Google.

- **Study selection**: Original articles on the disorders and syndromes, along with subsequent articles and consensus papers discussing in detail the clinical features, pathologic features, differential diagnosis, evaluation, management strategies, or combinations thereof, were chosen for this review.

- **Data extraction**: Data were extracted from articles that include generally accepted concepts and guidelines on non-Alzheimer degenerative and prion disorders, as viewed by the author.

- **Data synthesis**: The synthesized data emphasized cardinal clinical features, differential diagnosis, findings from ancillary studies that help establish accurate diagnoses, diagnostic criteria, and key management principles.

In conclusion, this article offers an up-to-date overview of the non-Alzheimer dementias.

### The differential diagnosis and treatment of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease [^116F5fMB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2022). High credibility.

Identifying patients at risk for developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD) remains challenging in clinical practice, even as scientific understanding of dementia advances generally. Successfully navigating the associated differential diagnosis in AD is essential, as various causes of cognitive impairment require different treatment strategies. In recent years, the treatment options in AD have expanded with the regulatory approval of a disease-modifying therapy — aducanumab — and may be shifting away from symptomatic treatments such as cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. Concurrently, the role of biomarkers in AD is increasing, and these entities may soon play a greater role in determining patient eligibility for prophylactic interventions and the likelihood of disease progression.

As the standard of care progresses, clinicians should educate patients and their care providers on the implications of these advances and reinforce lifestyle changes that can delay or prevent the onset of disease in those at risk of AD. In doing so, care providers can deliver the best care possible.

### The Alzheimer's Association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): Validated clinical assessment instruments [^116SYo2v]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Comparison of selected brief cognitive tests to detect cognitive impairment or dementia:

- **The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)**: This is the most widely known and best-studied brief test of cognition, taking usually less than 10 minutes to administer. However, it currently has copyright restrictions on its use. Alternative tools are available for medical practice that offer comparable diagnostic accuracy for dementia or better accuracy for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), such as the MoCA.

- **The Mini-Cog**: A very quick test, taking 2 to 3 minutes, containing two items: a measure of short-term memory (short-delay recall of three words) and a measure of visuospatial ability and executive functions (Clock Drawing Test). It has acceptable diagnostic accuracy for detecting cognitive impairment and has been evaluated in four large systematic reviews. It is validated as a screening test, not a diagnostic test, and, like the MMSE, may have low sensitivity for detecting MCI in more intellectually capable individuals.

- **The MoCA**: This 20-item test assesses multiple cognitive domains, including orientation, memory, language, attention, visuospatial, and executive functions, and typically takes 12 to 15 minutes to administer. The diagnostic accuracy of the MoCA for identifying individuals with cognitive impairment or dementia has been studied in systematic reviews involving up to 34 studies and appears to be more accurate than the MMSE for detecting MCI. Performance on the MoCA effectively detects MCI in most individuals of average or above-average education levels.
