## Question

Protonix IV to oral same dose?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Protonix IV can be converted to the same oral dose, and how to handle the transition safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the indications and standard adult dosing for IV versus oral pantoprazole. Then, I should verify pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic equivalence between routes. Next, I will review clinical trial data that directly tested switching from oral to IV and vice versa. After that, I need to check for any exceptions, such as pathological hypersecretory states or special populations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation with timing and monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm the labeled dosing so I don't jump to conclusions. For adults with GERD and erosive esophagitis, the standard dose is 40 mg once daily for both IV and oral formulations, typically for 7–10 days IV and up to 8 weeks orally, which already suggests dose parity across routes for this indication [^1149AB2i] [^111EVXZG] [^116renMv]. For pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, IV dosing is 80 mg every 12 hours and can be increased to every 8 hours if needed, whereas oral maintenance is commonly 40 mg twice daily, indicating that the oral-to-IV ratio is not 1:1 in this special case, so I need to keep that exception in mind [^1118mANZ] [^11794LtY].

> Wait, let me verify the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic rationale for dose equivalence in typical GERD/EE. Pantoprazole exhibits linear PK from 10–80 mg and similar terminal half-life across routes, with oral bioavailability around 77% and comparable AUC/Cmax profiles supporting similar clinical effect when doses are matched milligram-for-milligram in extensive metabolizers, which underpins a same-dose conversion in standard indications [^111tTuGy] [^116t3UpZ] [^1143ijXL]. Mechanistically, pantoprazole produces irreversible H+/K+-ATPase inhibition with an antisecretory effect that persists beyond 24 hours, so the duration of acid suppression is similar between oral and IV when the same dose is given, reinforcing the feasibility of a same-dose switch [^113gMjtX] [^112BNe8W].

> Next, I should review direct clinical evidence. A randomized, double-blind, two-period study in GERD patients with a history of erosive esophagitis showed that after 10 days of oral pantoprazole 20 or 40 mg, switching to the same milligram dose of IV pantoprazole maintained comparable acid suppression, with no clinically meaningful difference in maximum or basal acid output between routes, supporting a 1:1 conversion strategy in this population [^117UvqFM] [^112328Wp]. Conversely, patients switched from oral pantoprazole to IV placebo experienced a significant rise in acid output within 48 hours, underscoring that the pharmacodynamic continuity is maintained when the same pantoprazole dose is continued across routes [^117UvqFM] [^1155wfiL].

> Hold on, I should verify that this equivalence extends to clinical outcomes, not just acid metrics. In a randomized study of acute reflux esophagitis, 5 days of IV pantoprazole 40 mg produced symptom relief and endoscopic healing rates comparable to 5 days of oral pantoprazole 40 mg, and both arms converged on similar outcomes when all patients completed 8 weeks of oral therapy, reinforcing that same-dose IV-to-oral transitions are clinically appropriate [^1127kKZm]. Additional pharmacodynamic work also shows similar 24-hour gastric pH control between oral and IV 40 mg regimens, further validating a same-dose switch in routine care [^113gMjtX] [^112ikXGP].

> But wait, what if the patient is on a high-dose IV regimen for a hypersecretory state. I need to ensure I don't overgeneralize. In Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, oral maintenance is often 40 mg twice daily, whereas IV therapy is typically 80 mg every 12 hours, so a direct 1:1 milligram conversion would under-treat if moving from IV to oral; in this scenario, I should convert 80 mg IV every 12 hours to 40 mg orally twice daily to preserve acid control, and titrate to acid output if needed [^1118mANZ] [^11794LtY]. Let me reconsider: for standard GERD/EE, same-dose conversion is fine; for pathological hypersecretion, match total daily dose and frequency rather than a strict milligram-for-milligram rule to avoid loss of control [^1118mANZ] [^11794LtY].

> I should double-check special populations and drug–drug interactions that might alter this plan. No dose adjustment is required for renal impairment or mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, and CYP2C19 poor metabolizer status increases exposure but generally does not necessitate a dose change with once-daily regimens, so the same-dose IV-to-oral switch remains appropriate in these groups for GERD/EE indications [^115Wu2ij] [^116kpnbW] [^117DmE5n] [^112NJxJU] [^115C8BpQ]. Regarding clopidogrel, pantoprazole has minimal CYP2C19 interaction compared with omeprazole, so a same-dose pantoprazole switch is unlikely to disrupt antiplatelet pharmacodynamics, though I should still confirm the patient's antithrombotic regimen when planning the transition [^112ibKDV].

> Next, I should review administration timing because it affects clinical performance even when the dose is the same. Oral pantoprazole should be taken 30–60 minutes before a meal to optimize acid suppression, whereas IV administration timing is less critical due to direct systemic delivery; therefore, when converting IV to oral, I need to counsel on pre-meal dosing to avoid a perceived loss of efficacy after the switch [^113WZvd9] [^111fWdus]. Let me verify: both FDA labeling and ACG guidance align on pre-meal timing for once-daily PPIs, which supports this counseling point during conversion [^113WZvd9] [^1127gHmu].

> I will now examine practical transition logistics to ensure continuity. The IV should be discontinued as soon as the patient can tolerate oral intake, and the first oral dose can be given at the next scheduled dosing time without a washout, given pantoprazole's irreversible binding and overlapping duration of effect; if there is concern about a gap, a same-day overlap is reasonable in high-risk scenarios, though this is not strictly required in stable patients [^1149AB2i] [^113gMjtX]. Hold on, I should verify that no special taper is needed; abrupt switches are acceptable because rebound risk is low in short transitions, though guidelines advise using the lowest effective dose long term and stepping down when feasible, which is a separate issue from acute IV-to-oral conversion [^112ZuRta] [^115MLZE5].

> Putting this together, my final recommendation is as follows: for adults with GERD or erosive esophagitis who are stable on pantoprazole 40 mg IV once daily, convert to pantoprazole 40 mg orally once daily, ideally 30–60 minutes before breakfast, with no dose adjustment needed for renal impairment or mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment. For pathological hypersecretory states such as Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, convert 80 mg IV every 12 hours to 40 mg orally twice daily and titrate to acid output if needed, recognizing that a strict milligram-for-milligram switch would be inadequate in this context [^1149AB2i] [^1118mANZ] [^11794LtY] [^113WZvd9]. I should confirm the indication and current IV dose before finalizing the oral order, and I will monitor for symptom recurrence after the switch, adjusting therapy per guideline-based reassessment if symptoms persist despite appropriate timing and adherence [^113ZvqX9] [^114QP5yk].

In most cases, **Protonix IV can be converted to the same oral dose** (40 mg once daily) [^116renMv] when the patient can tolerate oral intake, as IV and oral pantoprazole have similar pharmacokinetics and acid suppression [^111tTuGy] [^113gMjtX]. For hypersecretory conditions (e.g. Zollinger-Ellison), **higher oral doses may be needed** (e.g. 40 mg twice daily) to match IV acid control [^11794LtY] [^1118mANZ]. No dose adjustment is required for renal impairment, mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, or advanced age [^115Wu2ij] [^117DmE5n] [^1119JMVT]. Monitor for symptom recurrence after switching and adjust the dose if needed [^113ZvqX9].

---

## Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic equivalence

- **Bioavailability**: Oral pantoprazole has ~77% bioavailability [^116t3UpZ], and IV administration achieves 100% bioavailability; however, both routes provide similar systemic exposure and acid suppression at the same dose [^112W9ytL] [^1143ijXL] [^113gMjtX].

- **Acid suppression**: Clinical studies show comparable acid suppression between IV and oral pantoprazole at the same dose, supporting a 1:1 conversion in most cases [^113gMjtX] [^112ikXGP].

- **Clinical outcomes**: Switching from IV to oral pantoprazole at the same dose maintains therapeutic efficacy in GERD and erosive esophagitis [^1127kKZm].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

ACG guidelines recommend switching from IV to oral pantoprazole at the same dose when the patient can tolerate oral intake, with **no dose adjustment** needed in most cases [^113WZvd9]. FDA labeling likewise states that **no dose adjustment is required** when switching from IV to oral pantoprazole in adults with normal organ function [^1149AB2i].

---

## Exceptions and special considerations

- **Hypersecretory conditions**: For Zollinger-Ellison syndrome or other hypersecretory states, higher oral doses (e.g. 40 mg twice daily) may be needed to match IV acid control [^11794LtY] [^113ZzdMo].

- **Hepatic impairment**: No dose adjustment is needed for mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment; limited data exist for severe impairment, so caution is advised [^117DmE5n] [^113twLV7].

- **Renal impairment**: No dose adjustment is required for renal impairment [^115Wu2ij] [^116kpnbW].

- **Elderly patients**: No dose adjustment is needed based on age alone [^1119JMVT] [^114LQxPA].

## Clinical evidence supporting dose conversion

| **Study** | **Design** | **Findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study | Randomized controlled trial | IV and oral pantoprazole 40 mg produced similar acid suppression and clinical outcomes [^117UvqFM] [^112328Wp] |
| Randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study | Clinical trial | IV and oral pantoprazole 40 mg had similar symptom relief and healing rates in erosive esophagitis [^1127kKZm] |
| Pharmacokinetic studies | Clinical pharmacology | Similar systemic exposure and acid suppression with IV and oral pantoprazole at the same dose [^112W9ytL] [^1143ijXL] [^113gMjtX] |

---

## Practical considerations for dose conversion

- **Timing**: Administer oral pantoprazole 30–60 minutes before a meal for optimal absorption and acid suppression [^113WZvd9] [^111fWdus].

- **Monitoring**: Watch for symptom recurrence after switching; adjust the dose if needed [^113ZvqX9].

- **Patient education**: Emphasize adherence and correct timing to maintain efficacy [^114QP5yk].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In most patients, **Protonix IV can be converted to the same oral dose** (40 mg once daily) without loss of efficacy [^117UvqFM]. Higher oral doses may be needed for hypersecretory conditions, and no dose adjustment is required for renal impairment, mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, or advanced age [^11794LtY] [^115Wu2ij] [^117DmE5n] [^1119JMVT]. Monitor for symptom recurrence and adjust therapy as needed [^113ZvqX9].

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of PROTONIX for short‑term treatment (up to eight weeks) of erosive esophagitis (EE) associated with GERD have been established in pediatric patients 1 year through 16 years of age. Effectiveness for EE has not been demonstrated in patients less than 1 year of age. In addition, for patients less than 5 years of age, there is no appropriate dosage strength in an age-appropriate formulation available. Therefore, PROTONIX is indicated for the short-term treatment of EE associated with GERD for patients 5 years and older. The safety and effectiveness of PROTONIX for pediatric uses other than EE have not been established.

1 year through 16 years of age

Use of PROTONIX in pediatric patients 1 year through 16 years of age for short-term treatment (up to eight weeks) of EE associated with GERD is supported by: a) extrapolation of results from adequate and well-controlled studies that supported the approval of PROTONIX for treatment of EE associated with GERD in adults, and b) safety, effectiveness, and pharmacokinetic studies performed in pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Safety of PROTONIX in the treatment of EE associated with GERD in pediatric patients 1 through 16 years of age was evaluated in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-treatment studies, involving 249 pediatric patients, including 8 with EE (4 patients ages 1 year to 5 years and 4 patients 5 years to 11 years). The children ages 1 year to 5 years with endoscopically diagnosed EE (defined as an endoscopic Hetzel-Dent score greater than or equal to 2) were treated once daily for 8 weeks with one of two dose levels of PROTONIX (approximating 0.6 mg/kg or 1.2 mg/kg). All 4 of these patients with EE were healed (Hetzel‑Dent score of 0 or 1) at 8 weeks. Because EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, predominantly pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also included in these studies. Patients were treated with a range of doses of PROTONIX once daily for 8 weeks. For safety findings see Adverse Reactions (6.1). Because these pediatric trials had no placebo, active comparator, or evidence of a dose response, the trials were inconclusive regarding the clinical benefit of PROTONIX for symptomatic GERD in the pediatric population. The effectiveness of PROTONIX for treating symptomatic GERD in pediatric patients has not been established.

After endoscopic hemostasis for high-risk stigmata ulcer bleeding, 194 patients across 6 centers in Thailand were randomized to oral vonoprazan 20 mg twice daily for 3 days then 20 mg once daily for 28 days versus high-dose PPI with pantoprazole intravenous infusion 8 mg/h for 3 days then omeprazole 20 mg twice daily for 28 days; the vonoprazan regimen was noninferior to PPI for rebleeding at 3 days, 7 days, and 30 days (7.1% vs 10.4%, risk difference, 3.3%; 95% CI, −11.2% to 4.7%). Higher doses of P-CABs for short periods, for prophylaxis against high-risk upper GI ulcer rebleeding, warrant further study.

14.1	Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Associated with a History of Erosive Esophagitis (EE)

A multicenter, double-blind, two-period placebo-controlled study was conducted to assess the ability of PROTONIX®I.V. to maintain gastric acid suppression in patients switched from pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets to PROTONIX I.V. GERD patients (n = 65, 26 to 64 years; 35 female; 9 Black, 11 Hispanic, 44 White, 1 other) with a history of EE were randomized to receive either 20 or 40 mg of oral pantoprazole once per day for 10 days (period 1), and then were switched in period 2 to either daily PROTONIX I.V. or placebo for 7 days, matching their respective dose level from period 1. Patients were administered all test medication with a light meal. Maximum acid output (MAO) and basal acid output (BAO) were determined 24 hours following the last day of oral medication (day 10), the first day (day 1) of intravenous administration and the last day of intravenous administration (day 7). MAO was estimated from a 1 hour continuous collection of gastric contents following subcutaneous injection of 6.0 mcg/kg of pentagastrin.

This study demonstrated that, after 10 days of repeated oral administration followed by 7 days of intravenous administration, the oral and intravenous dosage forms of pantoprazole 40 mg are similar in their ability to suppress MAO and BAO in patients with GERD and a history of EE (see Table 5). Also, patients on oral PROTONIX who were switched to intravenous placebo experienced a significant increase in acid output within 48 hours of their last oral dose (see Table 5). However, at 48 hours after their last oral dose, patients treated with PROTONIX I.V. had a significantly lower mean basal acid output (see Table 5) than those treated with placebo.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

PROTONIX Delayed-Release Tablets are prepared as enteric-coated tablets so that absorption of pantoprazole begins only after the tablet leaves the stomach. Peak serum concentration (Cmax) and area under the serum concentration time curve (AUC) increase in a manner proportional to oral and intravenous doses from 10 mg to 80 mg. Pantoprazole does not accumulate, and its pharmacokinetics are unaltered with multiple daily dosing. Following oral or intravenous administration, the serum concentration of pantoprazole declines biexponentially, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately one hour.

In extensive metabolizers with normal liver function receiving an oral dose of the enteric-coated 40 mg pantoprazole tablet, the peak concentration (Cmax) is 2.5 μg/mL; the time to reach the peak concentration (tmax) is 2.5 h, and the mean total area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) is 4.8 μg•h/mL (range 1.4 to 13.3 μg•h/mL). Following intravenous administration of pantoprazole to extensive metabolizers, its total clearance is 7.6‑14.0 L/h, and its apparent volume of distribution is 11.0‑23.6 L.

A single oral dose of PROTONIX For Delayed-Release Oral Suspension, 40 mg, was shown to be bioequivalent when administered to healthy subjects (N = 22) as granules sprinkled over a teaspoonful of applesauce, as granules mixed with apple juice, or mixed with apple juice followed by administration through a nasogastric tube. The plasma pharmacokinetic parameters from a crossover study in healthy subjects are summarized in Table 5.

### Pantoprazole sodium injection (Pantoprazole sodium) [^1118mANZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Recommended Dosage for GERD Associated with a History of EE

Adult Patients

The recommended adult dosage of pantoprazole sodium for injection is 40 mg once daily by intravenous injection (over at least 2 minutes) or intravenous infusion (for 15 minutes) for up to 10 days. Discontinue pantoprazole sodium for injection as soon as the patient is able to tolerate oral treatment. Switch to an appropriate oral medication within 10 days of starting pantoprazole sodium for injection.

Pediatric use information is approved for Pfizer Inc.'s PROTONIX® I.V. (pantoprazole sodium) for Injection. However, due to Pfizer Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information.

2.2 Recommended Dosage for Pathological Hypersecretion Including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome

The recommended adult dosage of pantoprazole sodium for injection is 80 mg every 12 hours by intravenous injection (over at least 2 minutes) or intravenous infusion (for 15 minutes).
Adjust the frequency of dosing to individual patient needs based on acid output measurements. In those patients who need a higher dosage, 80 mg intravenously every 8 hours is expected to maintain acid output below 10 mEq/h.
When switching between intravenous to oral formulations of gastric acid inhibitors, consider the pharmacodynamic action of the drugs to ensure continuity of acid suppression.

### Pantoprazoel sodium (Protonix) [^115XsaVu]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that suppresses the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. The binding to the (H+, K+)-ATPase results in a duration of antisecretory effect that persists longer than 24 hours for all doses tested (20 mg to 120 mg).

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

PROTONIX (pantoprazole sodium) For Delayed-Release Oral Suspension, 40 mg has been shown to be comparable to PROTONIX (pantoprazole sodium) Delayed-Release Tablets in suppressing pentagastrin-stimulated MAO in patients (n = 49) with GERD and a history of EE. In this multicenter, pharmacodynamic crossover study, a 40 mg oral dose of PROTONIX For Delayed-Release Oral Suspension administered in a teaspoonful of applesauce was compared with a 40 mg oral dose of PROTONIX Delayed-Release Tablets after administration of each formulation once daily for 7 days. Both medications were administered thirty minutes before breakfast. Pentagastrin-stimulated (MAO) was assessed from hour 23 to 24 at steady state.

Antisecretory Activity

Under maximal acid stimulatory conditions using pentagastrin, a dose-dependent decrease in gastric acid output occurs after a single dose of oral (20–80 mg) or a single dose of intravenous (20–120 mg) pantoprazole in healthy volunteers. Pantoprazole given once daily results in increasing inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Following the initial oral dose of 40 mg pantoprazole, a 51% mean inhibition was achieved by 2.5 hours. With once-a-day dosing for 7 days, the mean inhibition was increased to 85%. Pantoprazole suppressed acid secretion in excess of 95% in half of the subjects. Acid secretion had returned to normal within a week after the last dose of pantoprazole; there was no evidence of rebound hypersecretion.

### AGA clinical practice update on De-prescribing of proton pump inhibitors: expert review [^115MLZE5]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — step-down dosing for chronic PPI users: Most patients with an indication for chronic PPI use who take twice-daily dosing should be considered for step down to once-daily PPI. Double-dose PPIs (standard dose twice daily or double-strength dose once daily) have not been studied in any RCT and are not US Food and Drug Administration–approved; nonetheless, up to 15% of PPI users are on a higher-than-standard dose. In a trial of 171 patients using higher-than-standard doses of PPIs for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), 80% successfully stepped down to standard doses of PPI without significant recurrence of symptoms or the need to again increase the PPI dose. High-dose PPIs are indicated for Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, which is exceedingly rare (1/1,000,000).

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of 286 patients in clinical studies of intravenous pantoprazole sodium in patients with GERD and a history of EE, 86 (43%) were 65 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these geriatric and younger adult patients, and other reported clinical experience with oral pantoprazole sodium has not identified differences in responses between geriatric and younger adult patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of pantoprazole were observed in geriatric subjects compared to younger adult subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Oral versus intravenous proton pump inhibitors in preventing re-bleeding for patients with peptic ulcer bleeding after successful endoscopic therapy [^114xgc9R]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

In this randomized comparative trial, we found patients with oral and intravenous PPI have a similar clinical outcome, including recurrent bleeding, blood transfusion, surgery and mortality. Interestingly, we found that patients in the oral PPI group have a shorter hospital stay compared with the IV group (1.8 days vs. 3.9 days). This is the first study to suggest the finding of similar intragastric pH via different routes of administration may suggest for similar clinical outcomes. The low rebleeding rate of 4% in both groups is lower than our previous study of regular dose PPIs but is comparable to a multicenter study with high dose intravenous esomeprazole. This suggests that high doses rather than regular doses of PPI via the oral route may achieve comparable clinical outcomes with high dose intravenous PPI.

This is important in two ways. First, the cost associated with the pharmacotherapy can be reduced. The cost of oral PPI is one tenth the cost of the intravenous PPI in Taiwan. In addition, a patient with oral PPI can be discharged earlier in our study. Taking both together, approaches with high dose oral PPI can be more economical than high dose intravenous PPI. Second, the oral route administration of PPI is easy and dose not require frequent monitoring for the infusion site reactions (such as edema, thrombophlebitis, and so on). In addition, the use of oral disintegrating lansoprazole can be taken without water and repeated endoscopy can be performed without waiting for gastric emptying.

### A clinical guide to using intravenous proton-pump inhibitors in reflux and peptic ulcers [^1121uVKF]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Intravenous (IV) proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are potent gastric acid suppressing agents, and their use is popular in clinical practice. Both IV and oral PPIs have similarly short half-lives, and their effects on acid secretion are similar, thus their dosing and dosage intervals appear to be interchangeable. The possible exception is when sustained high pHs are required to promote clot stabilization in bleeding peptic ulcers. Continuous infusion appears to be the only form of administration that reliably achieves these high target pHs. IV PPI is indicated in the treatment of high-risk peptic ulcers, complicated gastroesophageal reflux, stress-induced ulcer prophylaxis, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and whenever it is impossible or impractical to give oral therapy. The widespread use of PPIs has been controversial. IV PPIs have been linked to the development of nosocomial pneumonia in the intensive care setting and to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients. This review discusses the use of IV PPI in different clinical scenarios, its controversies, and issues of appropriate use.

### Inappropriate use of intravenous pantoprazole: extent of the problem and successful solutions [^113gpkD7]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Indications for intravenous proton pump inhibitors (IV PPI) include upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) from peptic ulcer disease with high-risk stigmata and patients receiving nothing by mouth (NPO). The objectives were to assess the extent of errors in indications for IV PPI use and to determine whether multidisciplinary interventions could improve IV PPI use and costs.

Methods

Part 1: Patients prescribed IV PPI during a period of 4 months were divided into 2 settings, UGIB or non-UGIB. The setting-specific appropriateness of the IV PPI indication and dosing regimen was determined. Part 2: Patients prescribed IV PPI before and after multidisciplinary interventions (educating physicians, a computerized dose template, pharmacists altering IV PPI orders in non-UGIB patients who were not NPO, and recommending a GI consult when a continuous infusion was ordered) were studied. Incidence of prescribing errors, IV PPI costs, and potential confounders were compared.

Results

Part 1: Only 50% of UGIB (n = 145) patients received IV PPI for an appropriate indication. Both indication and dosing regimen were appropriate in 21%. In the non-UGIB group (n = 95), 33% were truly NPO; 51% had a correct dosing frequency. Part 2: The postintervention (n = 105) group (vs the preintervention group, n = 113) showed a significant absolute reduction in the degree of inappropriate indication in the UGIB (26%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 10%-42%; P < .0001) and in the non-UGIB (41%; 95% CI, 24%-58%; P < .0001) subgroups. However, a greater improvement in underspending than overspending meant that overall costs were unchanged.

Conclusions

IV PPI was frequently prescribed inappropriately and incorrectly; simple maneuvers resulted in reductions in errors.

### Pharmacology of acid suppression in the hospital setting: focus on proton pump inhibition [^112DKKdV]. Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The more potent and longer-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion provided by proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) as compared with histamine-2-receptor antagonists is caused in large part by differences in their mechanism of action. PPIs block histamine-2-, gastrin-, and cholinergic-mediated sources of acid production and inhibit gastric secretion at the final common pathway of the H+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase proton pump. In contrast, histamine-2-receptor antagonists cannot block receptor sites other than those mediated by histamine. It seems that the rapid loss of acid suppression activity by the histamine-2-receptor antagonists may be attributed to tolerance. Such tolerance has not occurred in patients receiving PPIs because these agents are irreversible inhibitors of the H+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase proton pump. For these reasons, patients who have acid-related disorders that require high levels of acid suppression do not respond well to intravenous histamine-2-receptor antagonists and would be excellent candidates for intravenous PPI therapy. Candidates for intravenous PPIs also include patients who cannot receive oral PPIs and those who may need the higher acid suppression therapy provided by the intravenous rather than the oral route. Clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of intravenous pantoprazole in maintaining adequate control of gastric acid output during the switch from oral to intravenous therapy in patients with severe gastroesophageal reflux disease or the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Intragastric administration of solutions prepared from oral PPIs has been used as an alternative to the intravenous route in critical care settings. However, decreased bioavailability may limit the value of intragastric delivery of PPIs because of the high frequency of gastric emptying problems in critically ill patients.

### Pantoprazole sodium (Protonix) [^1171wioc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

To evaluate the effectiveness of PROTONIX I.V. as an initial treatment to suppress gastric acid secretion, two studies were conducted.

Study 1 was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study of the pharmacodynamic effects of PROTONIX I.V. and pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets. Patients with GERD and a history of EE (n = 78, 20 to 67 years; 39 females; 7 Black, 19 Hispanic, 52 White) were randomized to receive either 40 mg PROTONIX I.V., 40 mg pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets, or placebo once daily for 7 days. Following an overnight fast, test medication was administered and patients were given a light meal within 15 minutes. MAO and BAO were determined 24 hours following the last day of study medication. MAO was estimated from a 1 hour continuous collection of gastric contents following subcutaneous injection of 6.0 mcg/kg of pentagastrin to stimulate acid secretion. This study demonstrated that, after treatment for 7 days, patients treated with PROTONIX I.V. had a significantly lower MAO and BAO than those treated with placebo (p < 0.001), and results were comparable to those of patients treated with pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets (see Table 6).

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of pantoprazole for short-term treatment (up to eight weeks) of EE associated with GERD have been established in pediatric patients 1 year through 16 years of age. Effectiveness for EE has not been demonstrated in patients less than 1 year of age. In addition, for patients less than 5 years of age, there is no appropriate dosage strength in an age-appropriate formulation available. Therefore, pantoprazole is indicated for the short-term treatment of EE associated with GERD for patients 5 years and older. The safety and effectiveness of pantoprazole for pediatric uses other than EE have not been established.

1 year through 16 years of age

Use of pantoprazole in pediatric patients 1 year through 16 years of age for short-term treatment (up to eight weeks) of EE associated with GERD is supported by: a) extrapolation of results from adequate and well-controlled studies that supported the approval of pantoprazole for treatment of EE associated with GERD in adults, and b) safety, effectiveness, and pharmacokinetic studies performed in pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Safety of pantoprazole in the treatment of EE associated with GERD in pediatric patients 1 through 16 years of age was evaluated in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-treatment studies, involving 249 pediatric patients, including 8 with EE (4 patients ages 1 year to 5 years and 4 patients 5 years to 11 years). The children ages 1 year to 5 years with endoscopically diagnosed EE (defined as an endoscopic Hetzel-Dent score ≥ 2) were treated once daily for 8 weeks with one of two dose levels of pantoprazole (approximating 0.6 mg/kg or 1.2 mg/kg). All 4 of these patients with EE were healed (Hetzel-Dent score of 0 or 1) at 8 weeks. Because EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, predominantly pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also included in these studies. Patients were treated with a range of doses of pantoprazole once daily for 8 weeks. For safety findings see Adverse Reactions (6.1). Because these pediatric trials had no placebo, active comparator, or evidence of a dose response, the trials were inconclusive regarding the clinical benefit of pantoprazole for symptomatic GERD in the pediatric population. The effectiveness of pantoprazole for treating symptomatic GERD in pediatric patients has not been established.

Endocrine Effects

In a clinical pharmacology study, pantoprazole 40 mg given orally once daily for 2 weeks had no effect on the levels of the following hormones: cortisol, testosterone, triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyronine-binding protein, parathyroid hormone, insulin, glucagon, renin, aldosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, prolactin and growth hormone.

In a 1-year study of GERD patients treated with pantoprazole 40 mg or 20 mg, there were no changes from baseline in overall levels of T3, T4, and TSH.

12.3	Pharmacokinetics

Pantoprazole peak serum concentration (Cmax) and area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) increase in a manner proportional to intravenous doses from 10 mg to 80 mg. Pantoprazole does not accumulate and its pharmacokinetics are unaltered with multiple daily dosing. Following the administration of PROTONIX I.V., the serum concentration of pantoprazole declines biexponentially with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately one hour. In CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)] with normal liver function receiving a 40 mg dose of PROTONIX I.V. by constant rate over 15 minutes, the peak concentration (Cmax) is 5.52 ± 1.42 mcg/mL and the total area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) is 5.4 ± 1.5 mcg hr/mL. The total clearance is 7.6 to 14 L/h.

Distribution

The apparent volume of distribution of pantoprazole is approximately 11 to 23.6 L, distributing mainly in extracellular fluid. The serum protein binding of pantoprazole is about 98%, primarily to albumin.

The result of this study suggests a similar clinical outcome between oral and intravenous large dose PPIs as adjuvant therapy to prevent re-bleeding for patients with high-risk bleeding peptic ulcers after successful endoscopic therapy. Patients with oral PPIs have a shorter hospital stay. However, the study was not powered to prove equivalence or non-inferiority. A larger trial is required to further clarify the role of oral PPIs in patients with high-risk bleeding ulcers.

### Pharmacologic features of proton pump inhibitors and their potential relevance to clinical practice [^115gqemD]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

In conclusion, PPIs differ slightly in their PK and PD properties and in their propensity to interact with other medications. Inhibition of acid secretion is a function of proton pump inhibition, and PPIs work in a similar fashion to achieve this goal. PK/PD principles can be used to optimize PPI therapy when considering issues related to administration, such as timing of drug delivery relative to the number of active pumps and the drug's AUC.

GERD management — there is conceptual rationale for a trial of switching proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for patients who have not responded to one PPI, but more than one switch cannot be supported. Use of the lowest effective dose is recommended and logical but must be individualized. Abrupt PPI discontinuation may lead to potential rebound acid hypersecretion and increased reflux symptoms, yet strong evidence for an increase in symptoms after abrupt PPI withdrawal is lacking.

### Pantoprazole (pantoprazole sodium) [^116ixuWM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Although the data from the clinical trials support use of pantoprazole sodium for the short-term treatment of EE associated with GERD in pediatric patients 1 year through 5 years, there is no commercially available dosage formulation appropriate for patients less than 5 years of age [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, clearance values in the children 1 to 5 years old with endoscopically proven GERD had a median value of 2.4 L/h. Following a 1.2 mg/kg equivalent dose (15 mg for ≤ 12.5 kg and 20 mg for > 12.5 to < 25 kg), the plasma concentrations of pantoprazole were highly variable and the median time to peak plasma concentration was 3 to 6 hours. The estimated AUC for patients 1 to 5 years old was 37% higher than for adults receiving a single 40 mg tablet, with a geometric mean AUC value of 6.8 mcg•hr/mL.

Neonates to less than one year of age

Pantoprazole sodium was not found to be effective in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, treatment-withdrawal study of 129 pediatric patients 1 through 11 months of age. Patients were enrolled if they had symptomatic GERD based on medical history and had not responded to non-pharmacologic interventions for GERD for two weeks. Patients received pantoprazole sodium daily for four weeks in an open-label phase, then patients were randomized in equal proportion to receive pantoprazole sodium treatment or placebo for the subsequent four weeks in a double-blind manner. Efficacy was assessed by observing the time from randomization to study discontinuation due to symptom worsening during the four-week treatment-withdrawal phase. There was no statistically significant difference between pantoprazole sodium and placebo in the rate of discontinuation.

In a series of dose-response studies, pantoprazole, at oral doses ranging from 20 to 120 mg, caused dose-related increases in median basal gastric pH and in the percent of time gastric pH was > 3 and > 4. Treatment with 40 mg of pantoprazole produced significantly greater increases in gastric pH than the 20 mg dose. Doses higher than 40 mg (60, 80, 120 mg) did not result in further significant increases in median gastric pH. The effects of pantoprazole on median pH from one double-blind crossover study are shown in Table 5.

Serum Gastrin Effects

Fasting serum gastrin levels were assessed in two double-blind studies of the acute healing of EE in which 682 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) received 10, 20, or 40 mg of pantoprazole for up to 8 weeks. At 4 weeks of treatment there was an increase in mean gastrin levels of 7%, 35%, and 72% over pretreatment values in the 10, 20, and 40 mg treatment groups, respectively. A similar increase in serum gastrin levels was noted at the 8-week visit with mean increases of 3%, 26%, and 84% for the three pantoprazole dose groups. Median serum gastrin levels remained within normal limits during maintenance therapy with pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets.

### Potentially inappropriate proton-pump inhibitor prescription in the general population: a claims-based retrospective time trend analysis [^115KftXv]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Definition and assessment of potentially inappropriate proton-pump inhibitor prescribing

Based on a literature review covering 34 clinical practice guidelines in 2017, we extracted PPI dosage and treatment regimens on 57 different PPI indications. Thereof we derived a 365-day cumulative pantoprazole dose equivalent of 11.5 g as a cut-off for inappropriateness. This cut-off reflects an evidence-based maximal-dose scenario, based on three hypothetical sequential phases: (1) an 8-week double-dose therapeutic treatment phase (2 × 40 mg of pantoprazole dose equivalents, i.e. for severe erosive esophagitis), (2) a 4-week tapering to a therapeutic dose (1 × 40 mg), (3) a maintenance dose (1 × 20 mg) for the remainder of the year. The resulting cumulative yearly dose of 11.2 g of pantoprazole equivalents was rounded up to 11.5 g. PIPPI was then determined by screening every observed person day for a preceding 365-day cumulative dose exceeding 11.5 g. To clarify we give a practical example: if 100 tablets pantoprazole 40 mg were dispensed 1 December 2016, this corresponded to 4000 mg added to the balance sheet of one patient. If the same patient repeated this process twice (i.e. adding another 8000 mg and therefore 12,000 mg in total) before 30 November 2017, then this patient would be regarded as a dispenser of PIPPI for 2017 (on the day of the third dispensing, i.e. when 11.5 g are exceeded).

14.1 Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Associated with a History of Erosive Esophagitis

A multicenter, double-blind, two-period placebo-controlled study was conducted to assess the ability of pantoprazole sodium injection to maintain gastric acid suppression in patients switched from pantoprazole delayed-release tablets to pantoprazole sodium injection GERD patients (n = 65, 26 to 64 years; 35 female; 9 Black, 11 Hispanic, 44 White, 1 other) with a history of EE were randomized to receive either 20 or 40 mg of oral pantoprazole once per day for 10 days (period 1), and then were switched in period 2 to either daily pantoprazole sodium injection or placebo for 7 days, matching their respective dose level from period 1. Patients were administered all test medication with a light meal. Maximum acid output (MAO) and basal acid output (BAO) were determined 24 hours following the last day of oral medication (day 10), the first day (day 1) of intravenous administration and the last day of intravenous administration (day 7). MAO was estimated from a 1 hour continuous collection of gastric contents following subcutaneous injection of 6.0 mcg/kg of pentagastrin.

This study demonstrated that, after 10 days of repeated oral administration followed by 7 days of intravenous administration, the oral and intravenous dosage forms of pantoprazole 40 mg are similar in their ability to suppress MAO and BAO in patients with GERD and a history of EE (see Table 4). Also, patients on oral pantoprazole who were switched to intravenous placebo experienced a significant increase in acid output within 48 hours of their last oral dose (see Table 4). However, at 48 hours after their last oral dose, patients treated with pantoprazole sodium injection had a significantly lower mean basal acid output (see Table 4) than those treated with placebo.

2.1 Recommended Dosage for GERD Associated with a History of EE

Adult Patients

The recommended adult dosage of PROTONIX I.V. is 40 mg once daily by intravenous injection (over at least 2 minutes) or intravenous infusion (for 15 minutes) for up to 10 days. Discontinue PROTONIX I.V. as soon as the patient is able to tolerate oral treatment. Switch to an appropriate oral medication within 10 days of starting PROTONIX I.V.

Pediatric Patients

The recommended dosage for pediatric patients 3 months of age and older is based on age and actual body weight as shown in Table 1 below.
Administer as an intravenous infusion over 15 minutes once daily.

Discontinue PROTONIX I.V. as soon as the patient is able to tolerate oral treatment. Switch to an appropriate oral medication within 7 days of starting PROTONIX I.V.

2.2	Recommended Dosage for Pathological Hypersecretion Including Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome

The recommended adult dosage of PROTONIX I.V. is 80 mg every 12 hours by intravenous injection (over at least 2 minutes) or intravenous infusion (for 15 minutes).
Adjust the frequency of dosing to individual patient needs based on acid output measurements. In those patients who need a higher dosage, 80 mg intravenously every 8 hours is expected to maintain acid output below 10 mEq/h.
When switching between intravenous to oral formulations of gastric acid inhibitors, consider the pharmacodynamic action of the drugs to ensure continuity of acid suppression.

Proton pump inhibitor dosing and potency — enteric-coated proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) control intragastric pH best when given before meals, specifically "30–60 minutes before breakfast for once-daily dosing and 30–60 minutes before breakfast and dinner for twice-daily dosing", and "Bedtime dosing is discouraged". Relative antisecretory potency differs across agents, with "pantoprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, esomeprazole, and rabeprazole" estimated at "0.23, 0.9, 1.00, 1.60, and 1.82 OEs, respectively". For persistent symptoms, switching PPIs is reasonable, and in a randomized study of patients on lansoprazole 30 mg once daily, "double the dose of lansoprazole" vs "switch to esomeprazole 40 mg once daily" were "equally effective", with "approximately 55%" in each arm improving; an omeprazole–sodium bicarbonate bedtime formulation "provides good control of intragastric pH in the first 4 hours of sleep".

### Oral versus intravenous proton pump inhibitors in preventing re-bleeding for patients with peptic ulcer bleeding after successful endoscopic therapy [^1126TLj2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Although high doses intravenous PPI are demonstrated to be superior to placebo, there is no evidence showing high doses of intravenous PPIs are superior to oral PPIs with regards to the clinical outcome of bleeding peptic ulcer patients following endoscopic therapy. As compared with the intravenous route administration of PPI, oral PPI is more attractive because of its availability and cost-effectiveness. In our previous study, we found that both oral and intravenous administration of regular doses of PPIs have a similar re-bleeding rate (16.7% vs. 15.4% for IV omeprazole vs. oral rabeprazole) following endoscopic therapy for bleeding peptic ulcers. Banerjee et al found that oral buffered esomeprazole (40 mg po) is superior to IV pantoprazole (40 mg IV every 12 h) to achieve intragastric pH > 6 in healthy volunteers. Laine et al conducted the first study to compare the acid suppression effect of oral and intravenous lansoprazole in bleeding peptic ulcer patients. They randomized patients into two groups: (a) intravenous lansoprazole (90 mg bolus followed by 9 mg/h) and (b) intermittent high dose oral lansoprazole (120 mg bolus followed by 30 mg every three hours). Patients were monitored with a 24-hour pH monitor. They found that a mean pH above 6 was achieved 1 hour earlier (2–3 hours vs. 3–4 hours) in the intravenous compared with oral group. They concluded that frequent oral PPI can replace currently recommended intravenous PPI. Javid et al from India found there is no difference among different PPIs and different routes of these PPIs (omeprazole, pantoprazole and rabeprazole) in intragastric pH above 6 for 72 hours after endoscopic therapy for bleeding peptic ulcers. A pilot study from Bajaj et al suggests oral pantoprazole is similar to IV pantoprazole on 30-day re-bleeding rate. Based on these studies, we conducted this study to clarify the clinical efficacy of high dose oral and intravenous PPIs after successful endoscopic therapy for patients with bleeding peptic ulcers.

Administration of PPIs in internal medicine sector during study Phases I and III

During study Phase I, the average cost of PPIs (omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, esomeprazole) administered in our hospital was 3.435 euro and 0.235 euro for the iv and the per os dose, respectively. During the same period, we detected that 1850 iv and 430 per os doses of PPIs were administered in 193 patients without indication during the 10 (mean value) days of their hospitalization. Of these patients, 80% received the medications iv (80% q.d. and 20% b.i.d.) and the rest orally (90% q.d. and 10% b.i.d.). Assuming that these numbers and rates of inappropriate PPI use could be applied to all 90 on-call days of the hospital per year, the annual expenses of the hospital due to PPI overuse was calculated at 193,674 euros. Using the same model, we estimated that 1200 patients (40 patients every 3 hospital on-call days) would be at risk of GI complications annually, due to under-prescribing of PPIs at discharge from the hospital.

12.5	Pharmacogenomics

CYP2C19 displays a known genetic polymorphism due to its deficiency in some subpopulations (e.g., approximately 3% of Whites and African-Americans and 17% to 23% of Asians are poor metabolizers). Although these subpopulations of pantoprazole poor metabolizers have elimination half-life values of 3.5 to 10 hours in adults, they still have minimal accumulation (23% or less) with once daily dosing. For adult patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, no dosage adjustment is needed.

Similar to adults, pediatric patients who have the poor metabolizer genotype of CYP2C19 (CYP2C19 *2/✱2) exhibited greater than a 6-fold increase in AUC compared to pediatric extensive (CYP2C19 *1/✱1) and intermediate (CYP2C19 *1/*x) metabolizers.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) trial — best practice advice, clinicians should provide patients presenting with troublesome heartburn, regurgitation, and/or non-cardiac chest pain without alarm symptoms a 4- to 8-week trial of single-dose PPI therapy (BPA 4). Patients should be counseled to take the PPI 30 to 60 minutes prior to a meal. Education on literature emphasizing safety of PPIs for the treatment of GERD should be provided (BPA 3). Patient symptoms should be reassessed after a 4- to 8-week trial. With inadequate response, dosing can be increased to twice a day or switched to a more effective acid suppressive agent once a day (BPA 4). These can include PPIs that are more potent, less metabolized through the CYP2C19 pathway (eg, rabeprazole, esomeprazole), or available in an extended release formulation (eg, dexlansoprazole), as well as potassium competitive acid blockers when available. Routine re-evaluation of the treatment should be performed, and the PPI should be tapered to the lowest effective dose when there is adequate response (BPA 4) (Figure 1).

Fasting serum gastrin levels generally remained at approximately 2 to 3 times baseline for up to 4 years of periodic follow-up in clinical trials.

Following short-term treatment with pantoprazole, elevated gastrin levels return to normal by at least 3 months.

In 39 patients treated with oral pantoprazole 40 mg to 240 mg daily (majority receiving 40 mg to 80 mg) for up to 5 years, there was a moderate increase in ECL-cell density, starting after the first year of use, which appeared to plateau after 4 years.

In a nonclinical study in Sprague-Dawley rats, lifetime exposure (24 months) to pantoprazole at doses of 0.5 to 200 mg/kg/day resulted in dose-related increases in gastric ECL-cell proliferation and gastric neuroendocrine (NE)-cell tumors. Gastric NE-cell tumors in rats may result from chronic elevation of serum gastrin concentrations. The high density of ECL cells in the rat stomach makes this species highly susceptible to the proliferative effects of elevated gastrin concentrations produced by PPIs. However, there were no observed elevations in serum gastrin following the administration of pantoprazole at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day. In a separate study, a gastric NE-cell tumor without concomitant ECL-cell proliferative changes was observed in 1 female rat following 12 months of dosing with pantoprazole at 5 mg/kg/day and a 9 month off-dose recovery [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

### Intragastric acidity after switching from 5-day treatment with intravenous pantoprazole 40 mg / D to 5-day treatment with oral esomeprazole 40 mg / D or pantoprazole 40 mg / D: an open-label crossover study in healthy adult volunteers [^112JBiq6]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

After a course of IV proton pump inhibitor therapy, patients might require continued oral antisecretory therapy. A direct comparison of therapeutic alternatives could assist physicians in decisions regarding optimal acid-suppressive therapy. Oral esomeprazole might control intragastric acidity more effectively compared with other acid-suppressive agents after IV therapy.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare intragastric acid control on day 5 of administration of esomeprazole magnesium versus pantoprazole 40 mg PO QD after switching from 5 days of treatment with pantoprazole 40 mg IV in healthy volunteers.

Methods

This randomized, open-label, comparative, 2-way crossover study was conducted at the Oklahoma Foundation for Digestive Research, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, between October and December 2004. Healthy, Helicobacter pylori-negative adults were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dosing sequences: pantoprazole IV followed by esomeprazole PO or pantoprazole IV followed by pantoprazole PO. All study medications were administered for 5 days at a dose of 40 mg QD. IV pantoprazole was administered over 2 minutes; all medications were administered 30 minutes before breakfast. There was a 10- to 21-day washout period between each 10-day dosing period. All doses were administered at the study site. Before oral study drug administration on days 1 and 5, 24-hour pH monitoring was performed using a pH catheter positioned 10 cm distal to the lower esophageal sphincter in the stomach. The primary end point was percentage of time with pH > 4 (%t pH > 4) during the 24-hour pH-monitoring period. Tolerability was assessed using spontaneous reporting, laboratory analysis, and vital-sign measurement.

Results

Of 42 subjects randomized to treatment sequences, 4 were withdrawn during the study because of invalid pH data; 38 subjects (24 men, 14 women; mean [SD] age, 25.2 [8.1] years) had assessable data. Day-5%t pH > 4 was 68.5% with esomeprazole and 53.3% with pantoprazole (P < 0.001). Day-1%t pH > 4 was 62.5% with esomeprazole and 51.0% with pantoprazole (P < 0.001). The most common adverse events were rhinitis (2 subjects each with pantoprazole IV and PO; 1 subject with esomeprazole) and headache (2 subjects with esomeprazole; 1 subject with pantoprazole IV).

Conclusions

The results of this study in healthy adult volunteers suggest that switching from pantoprazole 40 mg IV to esomeprazole 40 mg PO QD more effectively suppresses intragastric acid compared with switching from pantoprazole 40 mg IV to pantoprazole 40 mg PO QD. All 3 treatments were well tolerated.

Excretion

After administration of a single intravenous dose of 14C-labeled pantoprazole sodium to healthy, extensive CYP2C19 metabolizers, approximately 71% of the dose was excreted in the urine with 18% excreted in the feces through biliary excretion. There was no renal excretion of unchanged pantoprazole.

Specific Populations

Geriatric Patients

After repeated intravenous administration in elderly subjects (65 to 76 years of age), the AUC and elimination half-life values of pantoprazole were similar to those observed in younger subjects.

Male and Female Patients

After oral administration there was a modest increase in the AUC and Cmaxof pantoprazole in women compared to men. However, weight-normalized clearance values are similar in women and men.

Patients with Renal Impairment

In patients with severe renal impairment, pharmacokinetic parameters for pantoprazole were similar to those of healthy subjects.

Patients with Hepatic Impairment

In patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A to C), maximum pantoprazole concentrations increased only slightly (1.5-fold) relative to healthy subjects when pantoprazole sodium was administered orally. Although serum half-life values increased to 7 to 9 hours and AUC values increased by 5- to 7-fold in hepatic-impaired patients, these increases were no greater than those observed in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, where no dosage adjustment is warranted. These pharmacokinetic changes in hepatic-impaired patients result in minimal drug accumulation following once daily, multiple-dose administration. Oral pantoprazole doses higher than 40 mg per day have not been studied in hepatically impaired patients.

### Interchangeable use of proton pump inhibitors based on relative potency [^116wxLyh]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Although proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used, their relative potency and ideal dosing regimens remain unclear. We analyzed data from randomized clinical trials that performed pH testing in patients receiving solid-dose PPI formulations (omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole) for a minimum of 5 days. We used omeprazole equivalency and the surrogate biomarker, percentage time pH > 4 over a 24-hour period (pH4time), to compare PPI effectiveness for different PPIs given once, twice, or 3 times daily. We found that increasing strength of once-daily PPIs (9–64 mg omeprazole equivalents) increased pH4time linearly from approximately 10.0 to 15.6 hours; higher doses produced no further increase in pH4time. Increasing the frequency to twice-daily PPI increased pH4time linearly, from approximately 15.8 to 21.0 hours. Three-times daily PPIs performed similarly to twice-daily PPIs. The costs of PPIs varied greatly, but the cost variation was not directly related to potency. We conclude that PPIs can be used interchangeably based on potency. Using twice-daily PPIs is more effective in increasing efficacy increasing once-daily PPI dosage. Omeprazole and lansoprazole (30 mg) and 20 mg of esomeprazole rabeprazole are functionally equivalent.

### Use of intravenous proton pump inhibitors in community practice: an explanation for the shortage? [^115K9t21]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Since 2001, one intravenous proton pump inhibitor (pantoprazole) has been available in the United States. A drug shortage bulletin was issued for this agent in 2003.

Aim

To evaluate the patterns of use of intravenous proton pump inhibitors (IV PPIs) in routine clinical practice.

Methods

Prospective evaluation of IV PPI use in two community-based teaching hospitals. A computerized pharmacy ordering system was used to identify all patients for whom an IV PPI was ordered. Trained investigators obtained clinical data from patient records and these data were mapped to establish clinical criteria for the use of IV PPIs.

Results

Intravenous PPIs were prescribed in 238 patients over a 30-day period and a total of 1,631 doses were prescribed. Primary care providers prescribed 46% of prescriptions. Fifty-six percent of patients who received IV PPIs had no acceptable indication for their use. Of the 126 (81%) patients who were started on PPIs for the first time during their hospital stay, 102 were discharged on a PPI.

Conclusions

Intravenous PPIs are widely used for poor indications, which may contribute to the shortage of these agents.

Absorption

After administration of a single or multiple oral 40 mg doses of PROTONIX Delayed-Release Tablets, the peak plasma concentration of pantoprazole was achieved in approximately 2.5 hours, and Cmaxwas 2.5 μg/mL. Pantoprazole undergoes little first-pass metabolism, resulting in an absolute bioavailability of approximately 77%. Pantoprazole absorption is not affected by concomitant administration of antacids.

Administration of PROTONIX Delayed-Release Tablets with food may delay its absorption up to 2 hours or longer; however, the Cmaxand the extent of pantoprazole absorption (AUC) are not altered. Thus, PROTONIX Delayed-Release Tablets may be taken without regard to timing of meals.

Administration of pantoprazole granules, 40 mg, with a high-fat meal delayed median time to peak plasma concentration by 2 hours. With a concomitant high-fat meal, the Cmaxand AUC of pantoprazole granules, 40 mg, sprinkled on applesauce decreased by 51% and 29%, respectively. Thus, PROTONIX For Delayed-Release Oral Suspension should be taken approximately 30 minutes before a meal.

Distribution

The apparent volume of distribution of pantoprazole is approximately 11.0–23.6 L, distributing mainly in extracellular fluid. The serum protein binding of pantoprazole is about 98%, primarily to albumin.

2.1 Recommended Dosing Schedule

Pantoprazole sodium is supplied as delayed-release granules in packets for preparation of oral suspensions. The recommended dosages are outlined in Table 1.

* For adult patients who have not healed after 8 weeks of treatment, an additional 8-week course of pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension may be considered.

 Dosage regimens should be adjusted to individual patient needs and should continue for as long as clinically indicated. Doses up to 240 mg daily have been administered.

* Controlled studies did not extend beyond 12 months

2.2 Administration Instructions

Directions for method of administration are presented in Table 2.

Take a missed dose as soon as possible. If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the regular scheduled time. Do not take 2 doses at the same time.

Pantoprazole Sodium For Delayed-Release Oral Suspension

Administer pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension approximately 30 minutes prior to a meal via oral administration in apple juice or applesauce or nasogastric tube in apple juice only.

### Pantoprazole sodium (Protonix) [^113gMjtX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1	Mechanism of Action

Pantoprazole is a PPI that suppresses the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion irrespective of the stimulus. The binding to the (H+, K+)-ATPase results in a duration of antisecretory effect that persists longer than 24 hours for all doses tested (20 mg to 120 mg).

Antisecretory Activity

The magnitude and time course for inhibition of pentagastrin-stimulated acid output (PSAO) by single doses (20 to 120 mg) of PROTONIX I.V. were assessed in a single-dose, open-label, placebo-controlled, dose-response study. The results of this study are shown in Table 4. Healthy subjects received a continuous infusion for 25 hours of pentagastrin (PG) at 1 mcg/kg/h, a dose known to produce submaximal gastric acid secretion. The placebo group showed a sustained, continuous acid output for 25 hours, validating the reliability of the testing model. PROTONIX I.V. had an onset of antisecretory activity within 15 to 30 minutes of administration. Doses of 20 to 80 mg of PROTONIX I.V. substantially reduced the 24-hour cumulative PSAO in a dose-dependent manner, despite a short plasma elimination half-life. Complete suppression of PSAO was achieved with 80 mg within approximately 2 hours and no further significant suppression was seen with 120 mg. The duration of action of PROTONIX I.V. was 24 hours.

In one study of gastric pH in healthy subjects, pantoprazole was administered orally (40 mg enteric coated tablets) or PROTONIX I.V. (40 mg) once daily for 5 days and pH was measured for 24 hours following the fifth dose. The outcome measure was median percent of time that pH was ≥ 4 and the results were similar for intravenous and oral medications; however, the clinical significance of this parameter is unknown.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of pantoprazole sodium for short-term treatment (up to eight weeks) of EE associated with GERD have been established in pediatric patients 1 year through 16 years of age. Effectiveness for EE has not been demonstrated in patients less than 1 year of age. In addition, for patients less than 5 years of age, there is no appropriate dosage strength in an age-appropriate formulation available. Therefore, pantoprazole sodium is indicated for the short-term treatment of EE associated with GERD for patients 5 years and older. The safety and effectiveness of pantoprazole sodium for pediatric uses other than EE have not been established.

1 year through 16 years of age

Use of pantoprazole sodium in pediatric patients 1 year through 16 years of age for short-term treatment (up to eight weeks) of EE associated with GERD is supported by: a) extrapolation of results from adequate and well-controlled studies that supported the approval of pantoprazole sodium for treatment of EE associated with GERD in adults, and b) safety, effectiveness, and pharmacokinetic studies performed in pediatric patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Safety of pantoprazole sodium in the treatment of EE associated with GERD in pediatric patients 1 through 16 years of age was evaluated in three multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-treatment studies, involving 249 pediatric patients, including 8 with EE (4 patients ages 1 year to 5 years and 4 patients 5 years to 11 years). The children ages 1 year to 5 years with endoscopically diagnosed EE (defined as an endoscopic Hetzel-Dent score ≥ 2) were treated once daily for 8 weeks with one of two dose levels of pantoprazole sodium (approximating 0.6 mg/kg or 1.2 mg/kg). All 4 of these patients with EE were healed (Hetzel-Dent score of 0 or 1) at 8 weeks. Because EE is uncommon in the pediatric population, predominantly pediatric patients with endoscopically-proven or symptomatic GERD were also included in these studies. Patients were treated with a range of doses of pantoprazole sodium once daily for 8 weeks. For safety findings [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Because these pediatric trials had no placebo, active comparator, or evidence of a dose response, the trials were inconclusive regarding the clinical benefit of pantoprazole sodium for symptomatic GERD in the pediatric population. The effectiveness of pantoprazole sodium for treating symptomatic GERD in pediatric patients has not been established.

Although the data from the clinical trials support use of Pantoprazole for the short-term treatment of EE associated with GERD in pediatric patients 1 year through 5 years, there is no commercially available dosage formulation appropriate for patients less than 5 years of age [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, clearance values in the children 1 to 5 years old with endoscopically proven GERD had a median value of 2.4 L/h. Following a 1.2 mg/kg equivalent dose (15 mg for ≤ 12.5 kg and 20 mg for > 12.5 to < 25 kg), the plasma concentrations of pantoprazole were highly variable and the median time to peak plasma concentration was 3 to 6 hours. The estimated AUC for patients 1 to 5 years old was 37% higher than for adults receiving a single 40 mg tablet, with a geometric mean AUC value of 6.8 mcg•hr/mL.

Specific Populations

Geriatric Patients

After repeated intravenous administration in elderly subjects (65 to 76 years of age), the AUC and elimination half-life values of pantoprazole were similar to those observed in younger subjects.

Pediatric Patients

The pharmacokinetics of pantoprazole were studied in 40 pediatric patients 1 to less than 16 years of age in three open-label clinical trials in pediatric patients with GERD following intravenous administration and 180 pediatric patients from birth to 16 years of age in four randomized, open-label clinical studies in pediatric patients with GERD following oral administration.

Population PK analyses predicted the following dosage regimens would achieve comparable steady-state plasma exposures (AUC0–24) to those observed in adult patients administered 40 mg of PROTONIX I.V. once daily: 0.8 mg/kg once daily for pediatric patients 3 months to less than 1 year, 10 mg once daily for pediatric patients 1 year to 17 years with body weight less than 15 kg, 20 mg once daily for pediatric patients 1 year to 17 years with body weight greater than 15 kg but less than 40 kg, and 40 mg once daily for pediatric patients 1 year to 17 years with body weight of 40 kg and greater. The pharmacokinetics of pantoprazole following intravenous administration in pediatric patients less than 3 months of age have not been characterized.

Male and Female Patients

After oral administration there was a modest increase in the AUC and Cmaxof pantoprazole in women compared to men. However, weight-normalized clearance values are similar in women and men.

Patients with Renal Impairment

In patients with severe renal impairment, pharmacokinetic parameters for pantoprazole were similar to those of healthy subjects.

Patients with Hepatic Impairment

In patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A to C), maximum pantoprazole concentrations increased only slightly (1.5-fold) relative to healthy subjects when pantoprazole sodium was administered orally. Although serum half-life values increased to 7 to 9 hours and AUC values increased by 5- to 7-fold in hepatic-impaired patients, these increases were no greater than those observed in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, where no dosage adjustment is warranted. These pharmacokinetic changes in hepatic-impaired patients result in minimal drug accumulation following once daily, multiple-dose administration. Oral pantoprazole doses higher than 40 mg per day have not been studied in hepatically impaired patients.

### Pantoprazole sodium delayed-release [^112BNe8W]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Pantoprazole is a PPI that suppresses the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. The binding to the (H+, K+)-ATPase results in a duration of antisecretory effect that persists longer than 24 hours for all doses tested (20 mg to 120 mg).

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension, 40 mg has been shown to be comparable to pantoprazole delayed-release tablets in suppressing pentagastrin-stimulated MAO in patients (n = 49) with GERD and a history of EE. In this multicenter, pharmacodynamics crossover study, a 40 mg oral dose of pantoprazole sodium for delayed-release oral suspension administered in a teaspoonful of applesauce was compared with a 40 mg oral dose of pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets after administration of each formulation once daily for 7 days. Both medications were administered thirty minutes before breakfast. Pentagastrin-stimulated (MAO) was assessed from hour 23 to 24 at steady state.

Antisecretory Activity

Under maximal acid stimulatory conditions using pentagastrin, a dose-dependent decrease in gastric acid output occurs after a single dose of oral (20–80 mg) or a single dose of intravenous (20–120 mg) pantoprazole in healthy subjects. Pantoprazole given once daily results in increasing inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Following the initial oral dose of 40 mg pantoprazole, a 51% mean inhibition was achieved by 2.5 hours. With once-a-day dosing for 7 days, the mean inhibition was increased to 85%. Pantoprazole suppressed acid secretion in excess of 95% in half of the subjects. Acid secretion had returned to normal within a week after the last dose of pantoprazole; there was no evidence of rebound hypersecretion.

### American Gastroenterological Association medical position statement on the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^113btZcj]. Gastroenterology (2008). Medium credibility.

GERD — antisecretory drug selection and on-demand therapy highlights that circumstances in which one antisecretory drug might be preferable to another primarily relate to side effects or when the onset of effect is a prime consideration. The most common side effects of PPIs are headache, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain, and switching among alternative PPI drugs or to a lower dose can usually circumvent these side effects. For on-demand use, if a patient intends to take a drug only in response to symptoms, then it should be a rapidly acting drug, and the most rapidly acting agents are antacids, the efficacy of which can be sustained by combining them with an H2RA or a PPI.

Conclusions

In summary, Scarpignato et al. should be commended for this remarkable effort. In addition to the major points detailed above, there are numerous pearls pertinent to comparative PPI pharmacology and metabolism contained within the text. However, the overwhelming message is that the problem with PPIs is that they are good, very good. Consequently, there are a lot of valid indications for their use. However, clinicians cannot be complacent, thinking that the overwhelming efficacy of the drugs in the treatment of peptic esophagitis and ulcer disease will be matched in all other putative applications. Decisions to start, properly dose, continue, or discontinue PPI therapy should be personalized based on indication, effectiveness, patient preferences, and risk assessment. Guidelines are important, but they should not be inflexible. Clinicians need flexibility to tailor therapy to specific patient circumstances and experience. Only then does one achieve the optimal balance between risk and benefit.

### Pantoprazole [^111tTuGy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets are prepared as enteric-coated tablets so that absorption of pantoprazole begins only after the tablet leaves the stomach. Peak serum concentration (Cmax) and area under the serum concentration time curve (AUC) increase in a manner proportional to oral and intravenous doses from 10 mg to 80 mg. Pantoprazole does not accumulate, and its pharmacokinetics are unaltered with multiple daily dosing. Following oral or intravenous administration, the serum concentration of pantoprazole declines biexponentially, with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately one hour.

In extensive metabolizers with normal liver function receiving an oral dose of the enteric-coated 40 mg pantoprazole tablet, the peak concentration (Cmax) is 2.5 mcg/mL; the time to reach the peak concentration (tmax) is 2.5 h, and the mean total area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) is 4.8 mcg•h/mL (range 1.4 to 13.3 mcg•h/mL). Following intravenous administration of pantoprazole to extensive metabolizers, its total clearance is 7.6 to 14.0 L/h, and its apparent volume of distribution is 11.0 to 23.6 L.

### Differential effects of omeprazole and pantoprazole on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel in healthy subjects: randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover comparison studies [^112ibKDV]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Four randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover studies were conducted among 282 healthy subjects to investigate whether an interaction exists between clopidogrel (300-mg loading dose/75-mg/day maintenance dose) and the proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) omeprazole (80 mg) when they are administered simultaneously (study 1); whether the interaction, if any, can be mitigated by administering clopidogrel and omeprazole 12 h apart (study 2) or by increasing clopidogrel to 600-mg loading/150-mg/day maintenance dosing (study 3); and whether the interaction applies equally to the PPI pantoprazole (80 mg) (study 4). Relative to levels after administration of clopidogrel alone in studies 1,2,3, and 4, coadministration of PPI decreased the AUC(0–24) of the clopidogrel active metabolite H4 by 40, 47, 41, and 14% (P ≤ 0.002), respectively; increased maximal platelet aggregation (MPA) induced by 5 micromol/l adenosine diphosphate (ADP) by 8.0, 5.6, 8.1, and 4.3% (P ≤ 0.014), respectively; and increased the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation-platelet reactivity index (VASP-PRI) by 20.7, 27.1, 19.0 (P < 0.0001), and 3.9% (P = 0.3319), respectively. The results suggest that a metabolic drug-drug interaction exists between clopidogrel and omeprazole but not between clopidogrel and pantoprazole.

b: Inhibition of gastric acid output and the percent inhibition of stimulated acid output in response to pantoprazole sodium for injection may be higher after repeated doses.

NA = not applicable.

In one study of gastric pH in healthy subjects, pantoprazole was administered orally (40 mg enteric coated tablets) or pantoprazole sodium for injection (40 mg) once daily for 5 days and pH was measured for 24 hours following the fifth dose. The outcome measure was median percent of time that pH was ≥ 4 and the results were similar for intravenous and oral medications; however, the clinical significance of this parameter is unknown.

Serum Gastrin Effects

Serum gastrin concentrations were assessed in two placebo-controlled studies.

In a 5-day study of oral pantoprazole with 40 and 60 mg doses in healthy subjects, following the last dose on day 5, median 24-hour serum gastrin concentrations were elevated by 3- to 4-fold compared to placebo in both 40 and 60 mg dose groups. However, by 24 hours following the last dose, median serum gastrin concentrations for both groups returned to normal levels.

In another placebo-controlled, 7-day study of 40 mg intravenous or oral pantoprazole in patients with GERD and a history of EE, the mean serum gastrin concentration increased approximately 50% from baseline and as compared with placebo, but remained within the normal range.

14.1 Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Associated with a History of Erosive Esophagitis (EE)

A multicenter, double-blind, two-period placebo-controlled study was conducted to assess the ability of pantoprazole sodium for injection to maintain gastric acid suppression in patients switched from pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets to pantoprazole sodium for injection GERD patients (n = 65, 26 to 64 years; 35 female; 9 Black, 11 Hispanic, 44 White, 1 other) with a history of EE were randomized to receive either 20 or 40 mg of oral pantoprazole once per day for 10 days (period 1), and then were switched in period 2 to either daily pantoprazole sodium for injection or placebo for 7 days, matching their respective dose level from period 1. Patients were administered all test medication with a light meal. Maximum acid output (MAO) and basal acid output (BAO) were determined 24 hours following the last day of oral medication (day 10), the first day (day 1) of intravenous administration and the last day of intravenous administration (day 7). MAO was estimated from a 1 hour continuous collection of gastric contents following subcutaneous injection of 6.0 mcg/kg of pentagastrin.

This study demonstrated that, after 10 days of repeated oral administration followed by 7 days of intravenous administration, the oral and intravenous dosage forms of pantoprazole 40 mg are similar in their ability to suppress MAO and BAO in patients with GERD and a history of EE (see Table 5). Also, patients on oral PROTONIX who were switched to intravenous placebo experienced a significant increase in acid output within 48 hours of their last oral dose (see Table 5). However, at 48 hours after their last oral dose, patients treated with pantoprazole sodium for injection had a significantly lower mean basal acid output (see Table 5) than those treated with placebo.

In an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study, we evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of pantoprazole (0.3mg/kg [low dose (LD)], 0.6 mg/kg [medium dose (MD)], and 1.2 mg/kg [high dose (HD)]) for delayed-release oral suspension (granules) in patients 1 to 5 years with documented symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and endoscopic evidence of reflux-related erosive esophagitis (EE) or histologic esophagitis (HE) consistent with GERD. Patients with HE were randomly assigned to LD, MD, or HD, and patients with EE, to MD or HD. A daily eDiary captured 5 individual GERD symptoms. A total of 60 patients (56 HE, 4 EE) were randomized. Mean weekly GERD symptom score (WGSS, sum of weekly mean frequency scores for 5 individual GERD symptoms) for the modified intention-to-treat HE population at the final week was improved with LD (P < .001), MD (P = 0.063), and HD (P < 0.001) (paired t-tests). Patients with EE were healed at week 8. Adverse event incidences did not increase with dose.

### Switching between intravenous and oral pantoprazole [^116X9ab3]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most effective antisecretory drugs available for controlling gastric acid acidity and volume. They are the drugs of choice in the treatment of moderate-to-severe gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypersecretory disorders, and peptic ulcers. Currently in the United States, they are only available in an oral formulation. However, pantoprazole will soon be available in an intravenous formulation and will extend the power of PPIs to inpatient hospital settings. Intravenous pantoprazole has been shown to be effective and safe in clinical trials. Intravenous pantoprazole is indicated for the treatment of patients who require PPI therapy but who are unable to take oral medication. Intravenous pantoprazole has been shown to maintain acid suppression in patients switched from oral PPIs, so no change in dosage is required when switching from one formulation to the other. Potential hospital-based uses for intravenous PPI therapy include perioperative use as prophylaxis for acid aspiration syndrome during induction of anesthesia, prophylaxis for stress-related mucosal disease, and management of gastrointestinal bleeding from stress or acid peptic disease.

### Pantoprazole sodium (Protonix) [^117JSGWF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of pantoprazole sodium IV (also known as Protonix, Protonix):
- **Acute interstitial nephritis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as PPIs have been associated with an increased risk of acute interstitial nephritis.
- **Bone fracture**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as PPIs have been associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis-related fractures, especially with high-dose (multiple daily doses) or long-term (≥ 1 year) treatment.
- C. difficile infection: maintain a high level of suspicion, as PPIs have been associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients.
- **Cutaneous lupus erythematosus, SLE**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as PPIs have been associated with an increased risk of systemic and cutaneous lupus erythematosus.
- **Decreased serum calcium**: use caution in patients at risk of hypocalcemia, such as with hypoparathyroidism. Consider monitoring calcium levels before initiating pantoprazole and periodically during treatment. Administer calcium supplementation as necessary.
- **Decreased serum magnesium**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as long-term (≥ 3 months) treatment with PPIs has been associated with an increased risk of hypomagnesemia. Consider monitoring magnesium levels before initiating PPIs and periodically during treatment in patients expected to receive prolonged treatment or taking concomitant drugs (such as digoxin) or agents causing hypomagnesemia (such as diuretics).
- **Exacerbation of zinc deficiency**: use caution in patients with zinc deficiency, as pantoprazole injection product contains edetate disodium, a chelator of metal ions including zinc. Consider administering zinc supplementation in patients treated with pantoprazole IV prone to zinc deficiency. Use caution when other EDTA-containing products are co-administered IV.
- **Fundic gland polyps**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as long-term treatment with PPIs has been associated with an increased risk of funds gland polyps.
- **Increased serum chromogranin A**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as serum chromogranin A levels may be increased secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity and lead to false-positive results in diagnostic evaluation for neuroendocrine tumors.
- **Increased serum methotrexate levels**: use caution in patients receiving high-dose methotrexate.
- **Mask symptoms of gastric cancer**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as symptomatic response to PPIs does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy.
- **Positive urine THC test**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as PPIs have been reported to cause false-positive urine screening results for THC.
- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as pantoprazole has been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS syndrome, and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis.

### Pantoprazole sodium (Protonix) [^1127kKZm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Study 2 was a single-center, double-blind, parallel-group study to compare the clinical effects of PROTONIX I.V. and pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets. Patients (n = 45, median age 56 years, 21 males and 24 females) with acute endoscopically proven reflux esophagitis (Savary/Miller Stage II or III) with at least 1 of 3 symptoms typical for reflux esophagitis (acid eructation, heartburn, or pain on swallowing) were randomized to receive either 40 mg PROTONIX I.V. or 40 mg pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets once daily for 5 days. After the initial 5 days, all patients were treated with 40 mg oral pantoprazole daily to complete a total of 8 weeks of treatment. Symptom relief was assessed by calculating the daily mean of the sums of the average scores for these 3 symptoms and the daily mean of the average score for each of the symptoms separately. There was no significant difference in symptom relief between PROTONIX I.V. and pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets within the first 5 days. A repeat endoscopy after 8 weeks of treatment revealed that 20 out of 23 (87%) patients treated with PROTONIX I.V. plus pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets and 19 out of 22 (86%) of the patients treated with pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets had endoscopically proven healing of their esophageal lesions.

Data comparing PROTONIX I.V. to other PPIs (oral or intravenous) or H2-receptor antagonists (oral or intravenous) are limited, and therefore, are inadequate to support any conclusions regarding comparative efficacy.

### Replacement of oral proton pump inhibitors with intravenous pantoprazole to effectively control gastric acid hypersecretion in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome [^113ZzdMo]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

In patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) or other conditions requiring oral doses of proton pump inhibitors, it frequently becomes necessary to use parenterally administered gastric acid inhibitors. However, i.v. histamine-2 receptor antagonists are not effective at usual doses and lose their effectiveness because of tachyphlaxis. With the approval in the United States of i.v. pantoprazole, a substituted benzimidazole available in i.v. formulation, it will become possible to acutely manage gastric acid secretion in the acute care setting of a hospital. This study was developed to monitor the safety and establish the efficacy of i.v. pantoprazole as an alternative to oral proton pump inhibitors for the control of gastric acid hypersecretion in patients with ZES.

Methods

The efficacy of replacing oral PPI therapy with i.v. pantoprazole was evaluated in 14 ZES patients. After study enrollment, patients taking their current doses of oral PPI (omeprazole or lansoprazole) were switched to pantoprazole i.v. for 6 days during an 8-day inpatient period in the clinical research center. Effective control was defined as an acid output (AO) of < 10 mEq/h (< 5 mEq/h in patients with prior gastric acid-reducing surgery).

Results

The mean age of the 14 patients enrolled in the study was 52.4 yr (range = 38–67). Mean basal AO was 0.55 ± 0.32 mEq/h and mean fasting gastrin was 1089 pg/ml (range = 36–3720). Four patients were also diagnosed with the multiple endocrine neoplasia type I syndrome, nine were male, and two had previously undergone acid-reducing surgery. Before study enrollment, gastric acid hypersecretion was controlled in nine of 14 patients with omeprazole (20–200 mg daily) and five of 14 with lansoprazole (30–210 mg daily). In the oral phase of the study all patients had adequate control of gastric acid secretion, with a mean AO of 0.55 ± 0.32 mEq/h (mean ± SEM). Thereafter, 80 mg of i.v. pantoprazole was administered b.i.d. for 7 days by a brief (15 min) infusion and the dose was titrated upward to a predetermined maximum of 240 mg/24 h to control AO. A dose of 80 mg b.i.d. of i.v. pantoprazole controlled AO in 13 of 14 of the patients (93%) for the duration of the study (p > 0.05 compared to baseline values for all timepoints). One sporadic ZES patient (oral control value = 0.65 mEq/h on 100 mg of omeprazole b.i.d. p.o.) was not controlled with 80 mg of i.v. pantoprazole b.i.d. and dosage was titrated upward to 120 mg b.i.d. after day 2.

Conclusions

There were no serious adverse events observed. Intravenous pantoprazole provides gastric acid secretory control that is equivalent to the acid suppression observed with oral proton pump inhibitors. Most ZES patients (93%) maintained effective control of AO previously established with oral PPIs when switched to 80 mg of i.v. pantoprazole b.i.d.; however, for difficult-to-control patients, doses > 80 mg b.i.d. may be required.

### Shortcomings of the first-generation proton pump inhibitors [^114CXoWE]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely prescribed for the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) as well as gastric and duodenal ulcers, and these agents are now considered the drugs of choice for managing such acid-related disorders. Despite their well-documented efficacy and safety, first-generation PPIs (omeprazole, pantoprazole and lansoprazole) have notable limitations. These drugs exhibit substantial interpatient variability in pharmacokinetics and may have significant interactions with other drugs. The time of dosing and ingestion of meals may also influence the pharmacokinetics of these agents as well as their ability to suppress gastric acid secretion. First-generation PPIs also have a relatively slow onset of pharmacological action and may require several doses to achieve maximum acid suppression and symptom relief, possibly limiting their usefulness in on-demand GORD therapy. First-generation PPIs may also fail to provide 24-h suppression of gastric acid, and noctural acid breakthrough can occur even with twice-daily dosing. Both first- and second-generation PPIs may be associated with adverse events consequent to gastric acid suppression, but newer PPIs have the potential to overcome some critical pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and clinical limitations of the first-generation drugs.

### Efficacy and safety of pantoprazole delayed-release granules for oral suspension in a placebo-controlled treatment-withdrawal study in infants 1–11 months old with symptomatic GERD [^115y42gE]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of pantoprazole in infants with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Materials and Methods

Infants ages 1 through 11 months with GERD symptoms after 2 weeks of conservative treatment received open-label (OL) pantoprazole 1.2 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) for 4 weeks followed by a 4-week randomized, double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled, withdrawal phase. The primary endpoint was withdrawal due to lack of efficacy in the DB phase. Mean weekly GERD symptom scores (WGSSs) were calculated from daily assessments of 5 GERD symptoms. Safety was assessed.

Results

One hundred twenty-eight patients entered OL treatment, and 106 made up the DB modified intent-to-treat population. Mean age was 5.1 months (82% full-term, 64% male). One third of patients had a GERD diagnostic test before OL study entry. WGSSs at week 4 were similar between groups. WGSSs decreased significantly from baseline during OL therapy (P < 0.001), when all patients received pantoprazole. The decrease in WGSSs was maintained during the DB phase in both treatment groups. There was no difference in withdrawal rates due to lack of efficacy (pantoprazole 6/52; placebo 6/54) or time to withdrawal during the DB phase. The greatest between-group difference in WGSS was slightly worse with placebo at week 5 (P = 0.09), mainly due to episodes of arching back (P = 0.028). No between-group differences in adverse event frequency were noted. Serious adverse events in 8 patients were considered unrelated to treatment.

Conclusions

Pantoprazole significantly improved GERD symptom scores and was well tolerated. However, during the DB treatment phase, there were no significant differences noted between pantoprazole and placebo in withdrawal rates due to lack of efficacy.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^112ZuRta]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

GERD key concepts — switching and dosing of PPIs are addressed: There is conceptual rationale for a trial of switching PPIs for patients who have not responded to one PPI. For patients who have not responded to one PPI, more than one switch to another PPI cannot be supported. Use of the lowest effective PPI dose is recommended and logical but must be individualized. One area of controversy relates to abrupt PPI discontinuation and potential rebound acid hypersecretion, resulting in increased reflux symptoms. Although this has been demonstrated to occur in healthy controls, strong evidence for an increase in symptoms after abrupt PPI withdrawal is lacking.

### Effects of 3-day IV pantoprazole versus omeprazole on 24-hour intragastric acidity at 3 days in Chinese patients with duodenal ulcer: a single-center, prospective, randomized, comparative, pilot trial [^114YCshb]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Pantoprazole and omeprazole are irreversible proton pump inhibitors that have been found to significantly reduce intragastric acidity in patients with peptic ulcer and/or esophagitis. It has been reported that gastric acid secretion is lower in the Chinese patients compared with the Western population. Based on a MEDLINE search, no studies of the treatment of intragastric acidity with IV pantoprazole have been conducted in the Chinese population to date.

Objective

This trial was performed to compare the effects of IV pantoprazole versus omeprazole on 24-hour intragastric acidity in Chinese patients with endoscopically confirmed duodenal ulcer.

Methods

This single-center, randomized, pilot study was conducted at the Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. Chinese patients aged 18 to 80 years with endoscopically confirmed duodenal ulcer were randomly assigned to receive a continuous IV infusion of pantoprazole or omeprazole 160 mg/d for 3 days. On days 4 to 14, patients received pantoprazole 40 mg/d or omeprazole 20 mg/d orally. During endoscopic examination at enrollment, an antral biopsy specimen was obtained for rapid urease test, with each patient's agreement, by a blinded investigator. The primary end point was 24-hour intragastric pH on day 3. Secondary end points were percentage of the total time during the 24-hour period (%t) pH < 3 and < 4 and proportions of patients with healed ulcers on day-14 endoscopy. Endoscopic examination for monitoring of adverse effects of both drugs was repeated 8 weeks after study completion.

Results

A total of 40 patients were enrolled (35 men, 5 women; mean age, 63.3 years; 20 per treatment group). Twenty-four-hour intragastric pH was not significantly different between the omeprazole and pantoprazole groups (mean [SD], 6.61 [1.27] vs 6.84 [0.78]). The %t pH < 3 (mean [SD], 8.01% [19.60%] vs 2.70% [7.18%]) and pH < 4 (mean [SD], 9.28% [21.41%] vs 3.87% [9.79%]) were not significantly different between the omeprazole and pantoprazole groups. On day-14 endoscopy, ulcers were found to be healed in 3 (15%) patients in each group. In the omeprazole group, 1 (5%) patient experienced mild diarrhea, and 1 (5%) experienced mild abdominal fullness. These adverse effects were considered treatment related. No adverse effects were reported in either treatment group at 8 weeks after the study.

Conclusions

The results of this pilot study of 3-day treatment with a continuous IV infusion of pantoprazole or omeprazole 160 mg/d found that these 2 treatments had similar effects on 24-hour intragastric pH in this small population of Chinese patients with duodenal ulcer. Both treatments were well tolerated.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^116ubztN]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Currently available PPIs are not able to maintain the intragastric pH above 6 for prolonged periods. As a consequence, intravenous infusion has often been used in clinical studies. Intravenous esomeprazole is faster and more effective in raising intragastric pH than i.v. lansoprazole or i.v. pantoprazole. Even by the oral route, esomeprazole 40 mg, which provides the most effective control of intragastric pH amongst the class, achieves greater acid inhibition than intravenous pantoprazole (40 mg/daily) on both day 1 and day 5. The Peptic Ulcer Bleed study, involving 91 hospital emergency departments in 16 countries, showed that high-dose intravenous esomeprazole (80 mg, followed by 8 mg/h infusion, over 72 hours), given after successful endoscopic therapy to patients with high-risk stigmata of PU bleeding, reduced recurrent bleeding at 72 hours and had sustained clinical benefits for up to 30 days while patients were on maintenance oral esomeprazole (40 mg daily).

PPI treatment, initiated prior to endoscopy in patients with upper GI bleeding, significantly reduces the proportion of patients with stigmata of recent hemorrhage at index endoscopy: pooled rates were 37.2% and 46.5%, respectively (OR = 0.67). Although there is no evidence that PPI treatment affects clinically important outcomes (mortality, re-bleeding, or need for surgery), pre-endoscopic (or even pre-hospital), oral or intravenous, administration of a PPI could downgrade high-risk stigmata of recent hemorrhage. This might increase the success of endoscopic hemostatic therapy and/or reduce the requirement for it.

PPIs in patients with cancer

Summary of the current evidence

In cancer patients, PPI use could be indicated to treat and/or prevent chemotherapy-induced GERD and gastroduodenal ulceration, with accompanying symptoms. Patients with GI mucositis or dysphagia might also benefit from these drugs. Due to the low number or poor quality of the available studies, the evidence supporting these indications is low.

Amongst the adverse effects of cancer chemotherapy, GI symptoms are the most common and have the greatest impact on the quality of life. Fewer than 20% of affected patients are referred to a GI specialist since clear management algorithms and routine referral pathways are not in place due to limited research in this topic. As a consequence, some treatable symptom complexes go unrecognized and/or ineffective and potentially harmful treatments are prescribed. Sometimes, persistent symptoms do compromise or prevent ongoing anticancer treatment.

Excretion

After a single oral dose of14C-labeled pantoprazole to healthy, normal metabolizer subjects, approximately 71% of the dose was excreted in the urine, with 18% excreted in the feces through biliary excretion. There was no renal excretion of unchanged pantoprazole.

Specific Populations

Geriatric Patients

Only slight to moderate increases in the AUC (43%) and Cmax(26%) of pantoprazole were found in elderly subjects (64 to 76 years of age) after repeated oral administration, compared with younger subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Pediatric Patients

The pharmacokinetics of pantoprazole were studied in children less than 16 years of age in four randomized, open-label clinical trials in pediatric patients with presumed/proven GERD. A pediatric granule formulation was studied in children through 5 years of age, and Pantoprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets were studied in children older than 5 years.

In a population PK analysis, total clearance increased with increasing bodyweight in a non-linear fashion. The total clearance also increased with increasing age only in children under 3 years of age.

Neonate through 5 Years of Age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]

Children and Adolescents 6 through 16 Years of Age

The pharmacokinetics of Pantoprazole Sodium Delayed-Release Tablets were evaluated in children ages 6 through 16 years with a clinical diagnosis of GERD. The PK parameters following a single oral dose of 20 mg or 40 mg of Pantoprazole tablets in children ages 6 through 16 years were highly variable (%CV ranges 40 to 80%). The geometric mean AUC estimated from population PK analysis after a 40 mg Pantoprazole tablet in pediatric patients was about 39% and 10% higher respectively in 6 to 11 and 12 to 16 year-old children, compared to that of adults (Table 7).

Male and Female Patients

There is a modest increase in pantoprazole AUC and Cmaxin women compared to men. However, weight-normalized clearance values are similar in women and men. In pediatric patients ages 1 through 16 years there were no clinically relevant effects of gender on clearance of pantoprazole, as shown by population pharmacokinetic analysis.

Patients with Renal Impairment

In patients with severe renal impairment, pharmacokinetic parameters for pantoprazole were similar to those of healthy subjects.
