## Question

What are the recommended antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and severity stratification. Then, I should verify outpatient versus inpatient management. Next, I will review empiric therapy choices by scenario, including special populations and stewardship. After that, I need to check duration, de-escalation, and follow-up. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, practical algorithm and highlight controversies and evidence gaps, ensuring each assertion is supported by guidelines or high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and severity framework, because empiric therapy hinges on severity, comorbidities, and site of care. CAP spans outpatient and inpatient settings, with severity typically categorized as nonsevere, severe, or critical, and this stratification guides both diagnostic intensity and antibiotic breadth; I should confirm that the 2019 ATS/IDSA guideline explicitly uses severity and risk factors for MRSA/Pseudomonas to shape empiric choices, which it does, and that the 2025 update refines some nuances around viral-bacterial co-infection and stewardship, which it also does [^112hi12x] [^115qR2bM].

> Next, I should review outpatient management for immunocompetent adults without comorbidities. The first-line options are high-dose amoxicillin 1 g three times daily or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily, with macrolide monotherapy reserved only where local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is under 25 percent; wait, let me verify the resistance threshold, yes, it is less than 25 percent, and I need to ensure I note that macrolide monotherapy is otherwise discouraged due to high resistance and inferior outcomes, which the guideline emphasizes [^113g1GAS] [^116R7qqa] [^116EUyQ5].

> Hold on, I should verify the rationale for amoxicillin monotherapy here. The 2019 guideline prioritizes narrow-spectrum agents when appropriate because RCTs show no superiority among outpatient regimens and stewardship benefits favor Access agents; I initially thought macrolides were outright contraindicated, but wait, that's too strong — they are not absolutely contraindicated, they are conditionally acceptable only if local resistance is low, which I should correct explicitly [^115eTVAH] [^113g1GAS].

> For outpatients with comorbidities, I need to ensure broader coverage. The recommended empiric regimens include either a beta-lactam such as amoxicillin/clavulanate or a third-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide, or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone; I should double-check that both strategies are acceptable and that the choice should be individualized to comorbidities, prior antibiotics, and local resistance, which the guideline and AAFP review support [^111GDt9s] [^112hi12x].

> Now, I will examine inpatient nonsevere CAP without MRSA or Pseudomonas risk. The preferred empiric options are a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy; I should confirm that beta-lactam monotherapy is not routinely recommended for inpatients, which the guideline states, and that the evidence base for combination therapy includes mortality signals in observational data, particularly for bacteremic pneumococcal disease, even though RCTs are limited [^117DLH1Y] [^112LnUKE].

> For severe CAP, I need to ensure combination therapy is prioritized. The guideline recommends a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or a beta-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone, and explicitly advises against fluoroquinolone monotherapy or beta-lactam plus doxycycline for severe disease; let me verify that the mortality benefit signal is stronger with macrolide-containing regimens, which observational meta-analyses and the guideline narrative support, albeit with low-to-moderate quality evidence [^111VxjWa] [^112LnUKE].

> But wait, what if there are risk factors for MRSA or Pseudomonas? I should confirm that the HCAP category has been abandoned and that empiric coverage should be driven by locally validated risk factors and prior cultures. When indicated, add vancomycin or linezolid for MRSA and piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, ceftazidime, meropenem, imipenem, or aztreonam for Pseudomonas, and obtain cultures to enable de-escalation at 48–72 hours if negative and the patient is improving [^114uuCmt] [^115bxj19].

> Next, I should review duration and the concept of clinical stability. The minimum duration is 5 days for most patients, provided they achieve clinical stability and remain afebrile for 48–72 hours; for MRSA or Pseudomonas, extend to 7 days, and I need to ensure I note that switching to oral therapy with the same class or agent is acceptable once stable, which the guideline endorses [^11422hz5] [^112RuRoF].

> I will now examine special populations, starting with pediatrics. For children, amoxicillin is first-line for suspected bacterial CAP, with macrolides added when atypical pathogens are suspected, particularly in school-aged children; I should confirm that this aligns with IDSA/PIDS and AAFP guidance, which it does, and remember that stewardship principles still apply to minimize unnecessary macrolide exposure [^115h6tNF] [^114DFwpz].

> For immunocompromised adults, I need to check that standard CAP guidelines do not directly apply and that consensus statements recommend broader empiric coverage tailored to the degree of immunosuppression, with early involvement of infectious diseases consultation and aggressive diagnostic workup; this is consistent with the Chest consensus and the ATS/IDSA scope statement excluding immunocompromised hosts [^117F8r49] [^115TSttT].

> Regarding aspiration pneumonia, let me reconsider whether routine anaerobic coverage is needed. The 2019 ATS/IDSA guideline does not recommend routine anaerobic coverage for CAP, but the 2023 BTS statement supports a 5-day antibiotic course for aspiration pneumonia and reassessment if the patient fails to improve; I should clarify that anaerobic coverage may be reasonable in select cases with clear risk factors or failure of standard therapy, but it is not a blanket requirement [^116N89Kk].

> I should confirm the stance on influenza co-infection. Even with a positive influenza test, adults with radiographically confirmed CAP should receive standard antibacterial therapy initially, with consideration of stopping at 48–72 hours if no bacterial pathogen is identified and the patient is clinically stable; the 2025 ATS update further advises avoiding empiric antibiotics in outpatients without comorbidities who have viral-confirmed CAP, which I need to integrate into outpatient decision-making [^113tR9LR] [^112S2QnK].

> Next, I should review diagnostic testing and stewardship. Routine sputum cultures are not recommended for outpatients, but in severe inpatients or those empirically covered for MRSA/Pseudomonas, obtain respiratory cultures and blood cultures to enable de-escalation; I need to ensure I emphasize that procalcitonin should not be used to decide whether to start antibiotics, though it may help guide duration in select contexts, and that abandoning the HCAP label helps reduce unnecessary broad-spectrum use [^115hg7iB] [^1129tjB2] [^114uuCmt].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm without oversimplifying. For immunocompetent adults with CAP, first determine site of care and severity, then comorbidities and MRSA/Pseudomonas risk. Outpatients without comorbidities get amoxicillin or doxycycline, with macrolide monotherapy only if local macrolide resistance is under 25 percent. Outpatients with comorbidities get amoxicillin/clavulanate or a third-generation cephalosporin plus a macrolide, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Inpatients with nonsevere CAP get a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or fluoroquinolone monotherapy. Severe CAP gets a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or a beta-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone. Add MRSA or Pseudomonas coverage only when locally validated risk factors are present, and treat for a minimum of 5 days once clinically stable, extending to 7 days for MRSA or Pseudomonas [^113g1GAS] [^117DLH1Y] [^111VxjWa] [^11422hz5].

> Finally, I should acknowledge controversies and evidence gaps so we do not overstate certainty. The benefit of macrolide combination therapy in severe CAP is supported largely by observational data, and while multiple analyses show mortality signals, high-quality RCTs are limited; similarly, the optimal duration remains debated, with some studies supporting even shorter courses in select patients, though 5 days is the conservative, guideline-endorsed minimum; and stewardship tensions persist, with critics arguing for greater emphasis on Access agents like amoxicillin and doxycycline, which the 2019 guideline included but did not prioritize as aggressively as some would prefer [^112LnUKE] [^116m9x7m] [^115ZzQTE].

Empiric therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) should be tailored to patient setting, severity, and comorbidities, with **amoxicillin or doxycycline as first-line options for healthy outpatients** [^113g1GAS] and **beta-lactam plus macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone for inpatients** [^117DLH1Y]. For severe CAP, use a **beta-lactam plus macrolide or a beta-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone** [^111VxjWa]; avoid fluoroquinolone monotherapy in severe disease [^111VxjWa]. Treat for a minimum of 5 days, ensuring clinical stability before discontinuation [^11422hz5] [^112RuRoF]. Adjust therapy to local resistance patterns and obtain cultures in severe cases to enable de-escalation [^115hg7iB] [^112nw1MB].

---

## Special considerations

### Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) coverage

Add **vancomycin or linezolid** when MRSA risk factors are present (e.g. prior respiratory isolation of MRSA, recent hospitalization, or recent parenteral antibiotics) [^114uuCmt].

---

### Pseudomonas aeruginosa coverage

Add **piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, ceftazidime, meropenem, or imipenem** when Pseudomonas risk factors are present (e.g. prior respiratory isolation of Pseudomonas, recent hospitalization, or recent parenteral antibiotics) [^114uuCmt].

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

Treat for a **minimum of 5 days**, ensuring clinical stability (afebrile for 48–72 hours, heart rate ≤ 100 bpm, respiratory rate ≤ 24 breaths/min, systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg, and oxygen saturation ≥ 90% on room air) before discontinuation [^11422hz5] [^112RuRoF]. Extend therapy to 7 days for MRSA or Pseudomonas infections [^11422hz5].

---

## Role of diagnostic testing

Routine sputum cultures are not recommended for outpatients [^115hg7iB]. Obtain **blood and sputum cultures** in severe CAP or when MRSA or Pseudomonas is suspected [^115hg7iB] [^114VuhzV]. Procalcitonin is not recommended to guide initial antibiotic therapy [^1129tjB2].

### Review of treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia [^111wTGxs]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a costly disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The growing prevalence of this disease has resulted in various advances in diagnosis and treatment. The most common pathogens of CAP include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and atypical pathogens; however, the underlying pathogen often is unknown. Treatment of CAP has evolved because of changing etiologic patterns and increasing antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Among the groups that have established treatment guidelines for CAP are the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These guidelines establish risk factors associated with drug resistance or infection with specific pathogens. In addition, each guideline provides unique recommendations that are similar in some ways, yet different in others. By understanding the various risk factors for drug resistance and the treatment options endorsed by these guidelines, physicians can treat patients with the most appropriate antimicrobial available.

### Update in adult community-acquired pneumonia: key points from the new American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019 guideline [^11421XKj]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America recently released their joint guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The co-chairs of the guideline committee provide a summary of the guideline process, key recommendations from the new guideline and future directions for CAP research.

Recent Findings

The guideline committee included 14 experts from the two societies. Sixteen questions for the guideline were selected using the PICO format. The GRADE approach was utilized to review the available evidence and generate recommendations. The recommendations included expanded microbiological testing for patients suspected of drug-resistant infections, empiric first-line therapy recommendations for outpatients and inpatients including use of beta-lactam monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, elimination of healthcare-associated pneumonia as a treatment category, and not recommending corticosteroids as routine adjunct therapy.

Summary

CAP is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Effective antibiotic therapy is available and remains largely empirical. New diagnostic tests and treatment options are emerging and will lead to guideline updates in the future.

Background

Understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has evolved thanks to new evidence, experience, and emerging technologies. This document updates evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on four key questions for the diagnosis and management of adult patients with CAP.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel integrated systematic reviews of comparative evidence with other relevant research and clinical experience, then applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to produce recommendations using the Evidence to Decision Framework.

Results

The panel formulated clinical recommendations that address questions related to CAP, including lung ultrasound for diagnosis, empiric antibacterial therapy if a test for a respiratory virus is positive, antibiotic duration, and the use of systemic corticosteroids.

Conclusions

The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult patients with CAP.

### New guidelines for the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia [^117D5zA2]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and is the leading cause of death from an infectious disease. International societies have published and revised guidelines aiming to improve the management of adult community-acquired pneumonia, based on the best available evidence. The aim of this review is to compare the current guideline recommendations.

Recent Findings

Aspects of guidelines differ based on local factors including resources and antimicrobial factors, as well as the differences in interpretation of existing evidence.

Summary

The lack of robust evidence behind aspects of guideline recommendations as well as the lack of adherence to published guidelines both need to be addressed if the management of community-acquired pneumonia is to be improved.

### Antimicrobial therapy of community-acquired pneumonia [^111TaSjW]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disorder that is potentially life-threatening, especially in older adults and patients with comorbid disease. Despite substantial progress in therapeutic options, CAP remains a primary cause of death from infectious disease in the United States. The mainstay of treatment for most patients is appropriate antimicrobial therapy This article reviews the principles for initial antimicrobial therapy, highlights some of the differences in approaches to antimicrobial drug selection in selected guidelines, and includes new recommendations for empiric and pathogen-directed therapy of CAP.

### Community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization: rational decision making and interpretation of guidelines [^1143zzhv]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review focuses on the evidence base for guideline recommendations on the diagnosis, the optimal choice, timing and duration of empirical antibiotic therapy, and the use of microbiological tests for patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): issues for which guidelines are frequently used as a quick reference. Furthermore, we will discuss possibilities for future research in these topics.

Recent Findings

Many national and international guideline recommendations, even on critical elements of CAP management, are based on low-to-moderate quality evidence.

Summary

The diagnosis and management of CAP has hardly changed for decades. The recommendation to cover atypical pathogens in all hospitalized CAP patients is based on observational studies only and is challenged by two recent trials. The following years, improved diagnostic testing, radiologically by low-dose Computed Tomography or ultrasound and/or microbiologically by point-of-care multiplex PCR, has the potential to largely influence the choice and start of antibiotic therapy in hospitalized CAP patients. Rapid microbiological testing will hopefully improve antibiotic de-escalation or early pathogen-directed therapy, both potent ways of reducing broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Current guideline recommendations on the timing and duration of antibiotic therapy are based on limited evidence, but will be hard to improve.

### New guidelines for severe community-acquired pneumonia [^116nZujz]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We highlight the recent advances in the guidelines for treating patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (sCAP).

Recent Findings

sCAP is a significant cause of hospital admissions. We performed an extensive review of the literature, covering studies from the last several years, to summarise the most important points in the diagnosis and treatment of patients hospitalised with sCAP.

Summary

sCAP is associated with a high clinical burden. Therefore, deep knowledge is necessary for its management. In general, diagnosis, treatment and management are based on many published guidelines. However, the mortality rate is still unacceptably high, indicating the need for clear recommendations in the management of patients with sCAP. The choice of empirical antibiotic therapy for sCAP depends on multiple factors, such as national and local antimicrobial susceptibility data and the characteristics of the patients, including their risk factors for acquiring infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens. Currently, there are several published international guidelines. The aim of this review is to explore the areas that require further knowledge and new recommendations for current clinical practice.

### What is the role of antimicrobial stewardship in improving outcomes of patients with CAP? [^111Z9J6W]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most common infectious diagnoses encountered in clinical practice and one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Adherence to antibiotic treatment guidelines is inconsistent and the erroneous diagnosis of CAP and misuse of antibiotics is prevalent in both inpatients and outpatients. This review summarizes interventions that may be promoted by antimicrobial stewardship programs to improve outcomes for patients with CAP.

### Advances in antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia [^1135HPLU]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major public health problem all over the world. The increasing number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a matter of concern for physicians when choosing antibiotic treatment in patients with CAP. This review focuses on the current recommendations of antibiotic treatment, recent information concerning antibiotic resistance of pathogens, and the advances in antibiotic therapy in the field of CAP.

Recent Findings

A significant increase in the frequency of resistance to the antibiotics commonly used against causative pathogens of CAP, such as β-lactams or macrolides, has been reported in recent years. At present, the prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae remains low. Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 have been reported as causes of severe CAP. Several newly-developed antibiotics, including cepholosporins, ketolides and quinolones, present marked activity in vitro against the main causative pathogens of CAP. Many randomized controlled trials have demonstrated equivalent efficacy of the newer antibiotics compared with conventional antimicrobial therapy in mild-to-moderate CAP.

Summary

An increase of resistance to the antibiotics used in CAP has been documented over the years. Several new antibiotics have been developed for treating CAP, with promising results. However, data regarding their efficacy and safety in patients with severe CAP are lacking.

### Emergency management of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia: what is new since the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America / American Thoracic Society guidelines [^113ED6Wg]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major health problem in the United States and is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Patients with CAP commonly present to emergency departments where physicians must make critical decisions regarding diagnosis and management of pneumonia in a timely fashion, with emphasis on efficient and cost-effective diagnostic choices, consideration of emerging antimicrobial resistance, timely initiation of antibiotics, and appropriate site-of-care decisions. In light of the burden that pneumonia places on health care systems and the emergency department in particular, this article reviews significant developments in the management of CAP in the United States 5 years since the publication of the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society consensus guidelines on the management of CAP in adults, focusing on recent studies and recommendations for managing CAP, the primary bacterial pathogens responsible for CAP, and trends in resistance, new diagnostic technologies, and newer antimicrobials approved for the treatment of CAP. These new data and additional guidelines pertaining to the treatment of CAP further our knowledge and understanding of this challenging infection. Furthermore, appreciation of the availability of new diagnostic testing and therapeutic options will help meet the demand for improved management of CAP.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: what is relevant and what is not? [^116LA8Eg]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is the most common cause of death from infectious diseases in North America. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in epidemiology, risk factors, severity criteria and antibiotic therapeutic regimens used for community-acquired pneumonia management.

Recent Findings

All guidelines recommend early and appropriate empiric therapy directed against common typical organisms, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other atypical organisms, but clinicians should be aware of newer emerging pathogens such as community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative pathogens.

Summary

The optimum outcome in community-acquired pneumonia can be achieved by careful risk stratification using prediction rules together with appropriate antibiotic regimens. The mainstay of community-acquired pneumonia prevention is influenza and pneumococcal immunization. Promotion of smoking cessation will also help curtail the incidence of pneumococcal disease.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^114anNs8]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

This seminar reviews important features and management issues of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) that are especially relevant to immunocompetent adults in light of new information about cause, clinical course, diagnostic testing, treatment, and prevention. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most important pathogen; however, emerging resistance of this organism to antimicrobial agents has affected empirical treatment of CAP. Atypical pathogens have been quite commonly identified in several prospective studies. The clinical significance of these pathogens (with the exception of Legionella spp) is not clear, partly because of the lack of rapid, standardised tests. Diagnostic evaluation of CAP is important for appropriate assessment of severity of illness and for establishment of the causative agent in the disease. Until better rapid diagnostic methods are developed, most patients will be treated empirically. Antimicrobials continue to be the mainstay of treatment, and decisions about specific agents are guided by several considerations that include spectrum of activity, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles. Several factors have been shown to be associated with a beneficial clinical outcome in patients with CAP. These factors include administration of antimicrobials in a timely manner, choice of antibiotic therapy, and the use of a critical pneumonia pathway. The appropriate use of vaccines against pneumococcal disease and influenza should be encouraged. Several guidelines for management of CAP have recently been published, the recommendations of which are reviewed.

### Viewing the community-acquired pneumonia guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship lens [^116NEoCU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

We read with interest the article titled "Diagnosis and Treatment of Adults with Community-acquired Pneumonia. An Official Clinical Practice Guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America". We congratulate the authors on their comprehensive review of the evidence. Although we understand that they are limited in their ability to establish recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system process, we believe it would be helpful for the practicing clinician to understand how to interpret the guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship (AS) lens. Below, we discuss three AS-guided recommendations that should be considered when interpreting the community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines.

### Viewing the community-acquired pneumonia guidelines through an antibiotic stewardship lens [^116xUUHf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic Recommendations and Influenza

The guidelines recommend antibiotics for both inpatients and outpatients with clinical and radiographic evidence of CAP who test positive for influenza, with a consideration to stop antibiotics within 72 hours if no bacterial pathogen is found and the patient achieves early clinical stability. This recommendation is likely to lead to increases in unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions for patients with influenza. In the outpatient setting, sputum cultures and chest X-rays are not routinely obtained; hence, providers may not know when to stop antibiotics. Additionally, the rate of bacterial complications of influenza is low (∼ < 2.5%). Antibiotics may not be necessary for most outpatients with influenza or those who are hospitalized but are not severely ill.

Guidelines regarding the use of antibiotics must balance treatment recommendations with AS considerations and specifically note when regimens are supported by clinical trials but may be suboptimal because of side effects or costs. Many providers regard the guidelines as strict recommendations rather than as a starting point for clinical decision-making. Thus, discussions about areas in which the available evidence is inconclusive should include the viewpoint of antibiotic stewards at the patient and population levels. We strongly encourage active engagement from AS on future guidelines to facilitate discussions about judicious prescribing of antibiotics and to inform practical interpretation and implementation of those guidelines.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112DXJyG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline — scope and initial questions: This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), developed by a multidisciplinary panel that conducted pragmatic systematic reviews and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations. The panel addressed 16 specific areas spanning diagnostic testing, determination of site of care, selection of initial empiric antibiotic therapy, and subsequent management decisions, formulating recommendations and rationale on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult CAP. Although some recommendations remain unchanged from the 2007 guideline, results from new therapeutic trials and epidemiological investigations led to revised recommendations for empiric treatment strategies and additional management decisions. The contents highlight early diagnostic questions for adults with CAP, including whether Gram stain and culture of lower respiratory secretions or blood cultures should be obtained at the time of diagnosis, and also list a third question beginning "Question 3: In Adults with CAP, Should Legionella and".

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with community-acquired pneumonia [^115qUt4N]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

This clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians is a revision of the 2009 "Clinical Policy: Critical Issues in the Management of Adult Patients Presenting to the Emergency Department With Community-Acquired Pneumonia". A writing subcommittee conducted a systematic review of the literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to answer the following clinical questions: (1) In the adult emergency department patient diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, what clinical decision aids can inform the determination of patient disposition?

### International perspective on the new 2019 American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline: a critical appraisal by a global expert panel [^115NsVZp]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2019, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) issued a substantial revision of the 2007 guideline on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Despite the fact that generalization of infectious disease guidelines is limited because of substantial geographic differences in microbiologic etiology and antimicrobial resistance, the ATS/IDSA guideline is frequently applied outside the United States. Therefore, this project aimed to give a perspective on the ATS/IDSA CAP recommendations related to the management of CAP outside the United States. For this, an expert panel composed of 14 international key opinion leaders in the field of CAP from 10 countries across five continents, who were not involved in producing the 2019 guideline, was asked to subjectively name the five most useful changes, the recommendation viewed most critically, and the recommendation that cannot be applied to their respective region. There was no formal consensus process, and the article reflects different opinions. Recommendations welcomed by most of the international pneumonia experts included the abandonment of the concept of "health-care-associated pneumonia", the more restrictive indication for empiric macrolide treatment in outpatients, the increased emphasis on microbiologic diagnostics, and addressing the use of corticosteroids. Main criticisms included the somewhat arbitrary choice of a 25% resistance threshold for outpatient macrolide monotherapy. Experts from areas with elevated mycobacterial prevalence particularly opposed the recommendation of fluoroquinolones, even as an alternative.

### Guidelines for empiric antimicrobial prescribing in community-acquired pneumonia [^116DFxue]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Empiric antimicrobial prescribing for community-acquired pneumonia remains a challenge, despite the availability of treatment guidelines. A number of key differences exist between North American and European guidelines, mainly in the outpatient setting. The North American approach is to use initial antimicrobial therapy, which provides coverage for Streptococcus pneumoniae plus atypical pathogens. Europeans tend to focus on providing pneumococcal coverage with less emphasis on covering for an atypical pathogen. Ambulatory patients without comorbidity are more likely to receive macrolide therapy in North America, whereas in Europe these patients would probably receive a beta-lactam agent. Major issues that are fundamental to this difference include the importance of providing therapy for atypical pathogens and the clinical significance of macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae. Prospective data are required to evaluate which of these two approaches offers clinical superiority.

### Antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia in adult outpatients [^115xQSYv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is the third leading cause of death worldwide and the first leading cause of death in low-income countries. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common condition that causes a significant disease burden for the community, particularly in children younger than five years, the elderly and immunocompromised people. Antibiotics are the standard treatment for CAP. However, increasing antibiotic use is associated with the development of bacterial resistance and side effects for the patient. Several studies have been published regarding optimal antibiotic treatment for CAP but many of these data address treatments in hospitalised patients. This is an update of our 2009 Cochrane Review and addresses antibiotic therapies for CAP in outpatient settings.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of different antibiotic treatments for CAP in participants older than 12 years treated in outpatient settings with respect to clinical, radiological and bacteriological outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March week 3, 2014), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2014), CINAHL (2009 to March 2014), Web of Science (2009 to March 2014) and LILACS (2009 to March 2014).

Selection Criteria

We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), fully published in peer-reviewed journals, of antibiotics versus placebo as well as antibiotics versus another antibiotic for the treatment of CAP in outpatient settings in participants older than 12 years of age. However, we did not find any studies of antibiotics versus placebo. Therefore, this review includes RCTs of one or more antibiotics, which report the diagnostic criteria and describe the clinical outcomes considered for inclusion in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (LMB, TJMV) independently assessed study reports in the first publication. In the 2009 update, LMB performed study selection, which was checked by TJMV and MMK. In this 2014 update, two review authors (SP, SM) independently performed and checked study selection. We contacted trial authors to resolve any ambiguities in the study reports. We compiled and analysed the data. We resolved differences between review authors by discussion and consensus.

Main Results

We included 11 RCTs in this review update (3352 participants older than 12 years with a diagnosis of CAP); 10 RCTs assessed nine antibiotic pairs (3321 participants) and one RCT assessed four antibiotics (31 participants) in people with CAP. The study quality was generally good, with some differences in the extent of the reporting. A variety of clinical, bacteriological and adverse events were reported. Overall, there was no significant difference in the efficacy of the various antibiotics. Studies evaluating clarithromycin and amoxicillin provided only descriptive data regarding the primary outcome. Though the majority of adverse events were similar between all antibiotics, nemonoxacin demonstrated higher gastrointestinal and nervous system adverse events when compared to levofloxacin, while cethromycin demonstrated significantly more nervous system side effects, especially dysgeusia, when compared to clarithromycin. Similarly, high-dose amoxicillin (1 g three times a day) was associated with higher incidence of gastritis and diarrhoea compared to clarithromycin, azithromycin and levofloxacin.

Authors' Conclusions

Available evidence from recent RCTs is insufficient to make new evidence-based recommendations for the choice of antibiotic to be used for the treatment of CAP in outpatient settings. Pooling of study data was limited by the very low number of studies assessing the same antibiotic pairs. Individual study results do not reveal significant differences in efficacy between various antibiotics and antibiotic groups. However, two studies did find significantly more adverse events with use of cethromycin as compared to clarithromycin and nemonoxacin when compared to levofloxacin. Multi-drug comparisons using similar administration schedules are needed to provide the evidence necessary for practice recommendations. Further studies focusing on diagnosis, management, cost-effectiveness and misuse of antibiotics in CAP and LRTI are warranted in high-, middle- and low-income countries.

### Community-acquired pneumonia: the evolving challenge [^11314Sjb]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2001). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disorder that has been the focus of a major international research effort to define its epidemiology, etiology and management. The microbial etiology of CAP is complex and severity assessment is important in identifying at-risk populations as well as defining therapeutic strategies. Laboratory investigations rarely influence initial therapy, which remains empirical. Guidelines have been developed in many countries in response to the need to optimize management and outcomes. However, many of these guidelines have been based on expert opinion rather than robust evidence. New evidence-based guidelines have been developed that take into account disease severity, the local distribution of pathogens and their likely susceptibility to antimicrobials, and that include newer treatment options. Macrolide and fluoroquinolone antimicrobials feature heavily in these new treatment recommendations. Promising new therapies continue to emerge that may offer advantages over fluoroquinolones and macrolides, in particular with regard to the problem of resistance. Of these, the ketolides are of special interest. Telithromycin, the first ketolide antibacterial, has been evaluated in the treatment of > 700 patients with CAP. A once-daily oral dose of telithromycin 800 mg for 7–10 days produces clinical and bacteriological success rates > 90% and equivalent to standard comparator agents, whilst maintaining efficacy against resistant pathogens.

### Clinical efficacy of newer agents in short-duration therapy for community-acquired pneumonia [^111prQpn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most important respiratory tract pathogen implicated in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), is becoming increasingly resistant in vitro to the beta -lactams and macrolides, and fluoroquinolone resistance has been detected. A growing body of evidence suggests that prolonged antimicrobial use may contribute directly and indirectly to increased antimicrobial resistance among common respiratory pathogens. Long-term exposure to antimicrobial agents, especially less-potent agents, directly increases selection pressure for resistance. Indirectly, poor patient compliance, multiple daily dosing, and the increased risk of adverse events further complicate the resistance issue and diminish the efficacy of long-term antimicrobial use. Controlled clinical trials addressing the appropriate duration of therapy for CAP are lacking. However, available data suggest that with appropriate antibiotic selection, based on appropriate spectrum, potency, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile, lower respiratory tract infections in outpatients can be successfully treated in < 7 days rather than the 7–14 days currently recommended.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^114cq6uM]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is not usually considered a high-priority problem by the public, although it is responsible for substantial mortality, with a third of patients dying within 1 year after being discharged from hospital for pneumoniae. Although up to 18% of patients with community-acquired pneumonia who were hospitalised (admitted to hospital and treated there) have at least one risk factor for immunosuppression worldwide, strong evidence on community-acquired pneumonia management in this population is scarce. Several features of clinical management for community-acquired pneumonia should be addressed to reduce mortality, morbidity, and complications related to community-acquired pneumonia in patients who are immunocompetent and patients who are immunocompromised. These features include rapid diagnosis, microbiological investigation, prevention and management of complications (eg, respiratory failure, sepsis, and multiorgan failure), empirical antibiotic therapy in accordance with patient's risk factors and local microbiological epidemiology, individualised antibiotic therapy according to microbiological data, appropriate outcomes for therapeutic switch from parenteral to oral antibiotics, discharge planning, and long-term follow-up. This Seminar offers an updated view on community-acquired pneumonia in adults, with suggestions for clinical and translational research.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^115ZzQTE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recently published updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the 12 years since the previous edition of the guidelines was published, the importance of incorporating antimicrobial stewardship principles into treatment guidelines has been increasingly recognized. In 2017, the U.S. Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee provided guidance regarding this issue for U.S. treatment guidelines. One of the recommendations states that "when multiple therapeutic options are available, a hierarchy of antibiotic treatment recommendations should be provided with 'first choice' options being those with adequate therapeutic efficacy, the lowest risk of facilitating antimicrobial resistance, and the lowest risk of promoting C. difficile and other adverse events, with consideration of healthcare value". The World Health Organization (WHO) recently developed the AWaRe (Access, Watch, and Reserve) framework for classifying antibiotics based on antibiotic stewardship principles, and recommends its use in treatment guidelines.

We are therefore concerned that the 2019 version of the ATS/IDSA CAP guidelines seems to give disappointingly little weight to such antibiotic stewardship principles while continuing to recommend WHO Watch and Reserve antibiotics as first-line options for CAP in most of the target populations. We suggest that Access antibiotics would be sufficient for many patients and would be preferable from an antibiotic stewardship perspective. Amoxicillin, which is the first-choice treatment for CAP based on the 2019 WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, and is also listed as a first-choice option in many guidelines outside the United States, is only recommended in the ATS/IDSA guidelines, together with doxycycline and macrolides as equivalent options, for patients without comorbidities (very broadly stated as "chronic heart, lung, liver, or renal disease; diabetes mellitus; alcoholism; malignancy; or asplenia").

### Reply to huttner: 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^117Dmz7Y]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

From the Authors:

We appreciate this additional letter submitted in response to the recently published guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults.

Huttner and colleagues emphasize the importance of antimicrobial stewardship principles in shaping antibiotic treatment guidelines. We strongly agree. The adult CAP guideline emphasizes that when multiple options are presented the final antibiotic choice should be influenced by local and individual patient factors. We also emphasized the importance of deescalating antibiotics when appropriate and limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy. However, our highest priority was to assure that adequate empiric treatment is provided, especially for patients with more severe CAP. We did recommend amoxicillin as monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, but the recommendation for expanded antibiotic therapy for outpatients with comorbidities reflected the need to cover for a broader range of potential pathogens. These outpatients represent a group that has not been clearly shown to be safely treated with β-lactam monotherapy. Ceftaroline was included as an option for treatment of inpatients with CAP given the available high-grade evidence (cited by Huttner and colleagues) that it is at least equivalent if not superior to ceftriaxone without evidence of an increased adverse event profile.

Finally, although we acknowledge that antimicrobial stewardship is relevant for all antibiotic prescribing decisions, it is important to highlight that, in a recent analysis of all outpatient antibiotic prescribing in the United States, pneumonia was only the 14th most common diagnosis, accounting for a small percentage of all antibiotics prescribed. For antimicrobial stewardship to actually impact the individual and population risks of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, including the risks attributed to respiratory fluoroquinolones, more gains will be achieved by focusing on treatment strategies for upper respiratory infections, urinary tract infections, and gastrointestinal infections.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113tR9LR]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who test positive for influenza — initial antibacterial therapy and potential early discontinuation. We recommend that standard antibacterial treatment be initially prescribed for adults with clinical and radiographic evidence of CAP who test positive for influenza in the inpatient and outpatient settings (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). Bacterial pneumonia can occur concurrently with influenza virus infection or present later as a worsening of symptoms in patients who were recovering from their primary influenza virus infection. However in patients with CAP, a positive influenza test, no evidence of a bacterial pathogen (including a low procalcitonin level), and early clinical stability, consideration could be given to earlier discontinuation of antibiotic treatment at 48 to 72 hours; randomized controlled studies are needed to establish whether antibacterial therapy can be stopped at 48 hours in such patients.

Outpatient community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) without comorbidities — initial antibiotic choices and macrolide use: For patients without comorbidities, the panel recommended amoxicillin 1 g every 8 hours or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily; some experts recommend that the first dose of oral doxycycline be 200 mg. In a departure from prior CAP guidelines, the panel did not give a strong recommendation for routine use of a macrolide antibiotic as monotherapy for outpatient CAP, citing a macrolide resistance rate of > 30% among S. pneumoniae isolates in the United States; however, in settings where macrolide resistance is documented to be low and there are contraindications to alternative therapies, a macrolide as monotherapy is a treatment option.

### Short treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia [^116m9x7m]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Lower respiratory tract infections are one of the most common indications for antibiotic use in community and hospital settings. Usual guidelines for adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) recommend 5-7days of antibiotic treatment. In daily practice, physicians often prescribe 9-10days of antibiotic treatment. Among available strategies to decrease antibiotic use, possibly preventing the emergence of bacterial resistance, reducing treatment durations is the safest and the most acceptable to clinicians. We aim to review data evaluating the efficacy of short antibiotic duration in adult CAP and which criteria can help clinicians to reduce antibiotic treatment.

Recent Findings

Several studies and meta-analyses demonstrated that the treatment duration of 7days or less was sufficient for CAP. Two trials found that 3-day treatments were effective, even in hospitalized CAP. To customize and shorten duration, clinical and biological criteria have been studied and reflect patient's response. Indeed, stability criteria were recently shown to be effective to discontinue antibiotic treatment. Procalcitonin was also studied but never compared with clinical criteria.

Summary

Treatment duration for CAP is still under debate, but several studies support short durations. Clinical criteria could be possibly used to discontinue antibiotic treatment.

### Unsolved problems in the approach to pediatric community-acquired pneumonia [^1168J2FA]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review discusses unsolved problems concerning pediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and identifies the areas of research that need to be developed.

Recent Findings

Diagnosing pediatric CAP and the required hospitalization are difficult problems especially in the presence of mild signs and symptoms. It is frequently not possible to identify the cause of this disease, and this explains why antibiotics are unnecessarily prescribed in some cases. The treatment recommendations for severe CAP are better defined than those for mild and moderate CAP.

Summary

It is possible to prepare recommendations for most of the problems that emerge in severe cases of pediatric CAP even though its cause can also be difficult to identify. However, the recommended approach to mild or moderate cases is always based on mainly moderate or poor quality evidence. There is an urgent need for further studies aimed at defining first-line and second-line antibiotic therapy for mild and moderate CAP. In the absence of new data, it is necessary to be aware that a substantial number of patients will not be optimally treated.

This clinical policy from the American College of Emergency Physicians focuses on critical issues concerning the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED)with community-acquired pneumonia. It is an update of the 2001 clinical policy for the management and risk stratification of adult patients presenting to the ED with community-acquired pneumonia. A subcommittee reviewed the current literature to derive evidence-based recommendations to help answer the following questions: (1) Are routine blood cultures indicated in patients admitted with community-acquired pneumonia? (2) In adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia without severe sepsis, is there a benefit in mortality or morbidity from the administration of antibiotics within aspecific time course? The evidence was graded and recommendations were given based on the strength of evidence.

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia: what's in a name? [^113heNcV]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Formerly, patients with community-acquired pneumonia admitted to an intensive care unit were considered as having the severe form of the disease. Recently, guidelines have distinguished severe and non-severe community-acquired pneumonia based on clinical definitions. In this review, we describe the different definitions of severe community-acquired pneumonia, and whether a differentiation based on these definitions reflects variation in etiology, risk factors, diagnostic approaches and treatment.

Recent Findings

New definitions do not seem to accurately identify patients with high risks of mortality; patients not admitted to an intensive care unit could also be diagnosed as having severe community-acquired pneumonia. Host-factors, such as genetic factors and underlying diseases, can influence severity of presentation of community-acquired pneumonia. Distribution of pathogens in severe and non-severe disease forms is comparable. Initial antibiotic therapy in patients with severe disease should provide coverage of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila, as delay is associated with worse outcomes. However, recent studies also suggested an additional benefit of atypical coverage in non-severe disease. As a result, initial therapy with a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or an anti-pneumococcal fluoroquinolone is recommended for all patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Furthermore, the value of vaccination against pneumococci to prevent episodes of severe disease is yet unknown.

Summary

As current guidelines do not adequately identify patients with high risk of mortality and intensive care unit admittance, clinical judgment remains important. Based on distribution of pathogens, investigational procedures and therapy recommended in recent guidelines, differentiation between severe and non-severe community-acquired pneumonia does not seem useful. Whether atypical coverage indeed has additional value in non-severe or pneumococcal CAP, however, remains to be determined. In addition, the preventive benefit of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination for development of SCAP awaits further evidence.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline — key changes versus 2007 — state that sputum culture is "Now recommended in patients with severe disease as well as in all inpatients empirically treated for MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa", and blood culture is "Now recommended in patients with severe disease as well as in all inpatients empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa". Macrolide monotherapy carries a "Conditional recommendation for outpatients based on resistance levels". Use of procalcitonin is "Not recommended to determine need for initial antibacterial therapy", and corticosteroids are "Recommended not to use. May be considered in patients with refractory septic shock". The healthcare-associated pneumonia category has a directive to "Recommend abandoning this categorization. Emphasis on local epidemiology and validated risk factors to determine need for MRSA or P. aeruginosa coverage. Increased emphasis on deescalation of treatment if cultures are negative". For standard empiric therapy for severe CAP, "Both accepted but stronger evidence in favor of β-lactam/macrolide combination", and follow-up chest imaging is "Recommended not to obtain. Patients may be eligible for lung cancer screening, which should be performed as clinically indicated".

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115bxj19]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adult community-acquired pneumonia — risk assessment for MRSA and P. aeruginosa and local validation — The most consistently strong individual risk factors for respiratory infection with MRSA or P. aeruginosa are prior isolation of these organisms, especially from the respiratory tract, and/or recent hospitalization and exposure to parenteral antibiotics; unfortunately, no validated scoring systems exist to identify patients with sufficiently high positive predictive value, and no scoring system has been demonstrated to improve patient outcomes or reduce overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We propose that clinicians need to obtain local data on whether MRSA or P. aeruginosa is prevalent in patients with CAP and what the risk factors for infection are at a local level and we recommend analyzing the frequency of MRSA or P. aeruginosa as a CAP pathogen relative to the number of all cases of CAP; we refer to this process as "local validation". Finally, routine cultures in patients empirically treated for MRSA or P. aeruginosa allow deescalation to standard CAP therapy if cultures do not reveal a drug-resistant pathogen and the patient is clinically improving at 48 hours, and deescalation of antibiotic therapy at 48 hours in accord with microbiological results that do not yield MRSA or P. aeruginosa is described as safe and reduces duration of antibiotic treatment, length of hospitalization, and complications of broad-spectrum therapy. Our recommendation against using the former category of HCAP as a basis for selecting extended-spectrum therapy is based on high-quality studies of patient outcomes.

### Options in community-acquired pneumonia… [^111hDJpi]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Consequently, treatment with antimicrobial agents is usually empiric, based on the most commonly encountered pathogens and the age of the patient. A variety of antibiotics is used to treat community-acquired pneumonia, although typically a second-generation cephalosporin, with or without a macrolide, is selected. Moola and colleagues conducted a large multicenter trial to evaluate the efficacy of clarithromycin, a second-generation macrolide, with grepafloxacin, a broad-spectrum quinolone antibiotic with activity against gram-positive, gram-negative and atypical pathogens. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila was performed. Follow-up evaluations were done on days 4 to 6 after the start of treatment, one to three days after completion of the antibiotics and again at 28 to 35 days post-treatment. The primary outcomes measured were clinical and radiographic responses at the follow-up visits.

These outcomes were assessed for all patients, regardless of whether a pathogen was identified. Of the 330 patients who completed the follow-up evaluations, 90 percent of the grepafloxacin group and 89 percent of the clarithromycin group had a satisfactory clinical response. Patients less than 65 years of age had response rates of 93 and 92 percent compared with rates of 81 and 74 percent among older patients. The overall response numbers in the intention-to-treat populations were 75 and 76 percent, respectively. A pretreatment pathogen was identified in 26 percent of patients, with. S. pneumoniae causing 22 percent and M. pneumoniae causing 25 percent of the identifiable infections. The overall clinical success rate for patients in whom a pathogen was identified was 92 percent for both antibiotics. In evaluating radiographic response, improvement was noted in 80 percent of the grepafloxacin patients and in 76 percent of those who received clarithromycin.

Of patients known to be infected with one of the three atypical pathogens, 100 percent responded to grepafloxacin and 88 percent to clarithromycin. The most common adverse events were abnormal taste, nausea and diarrhea. The authors conclude from this study that grepafloxacin and clarithromycin are effective in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. The first agent offers some advantage in that it can be given once daily and may be a more effective choice in older patients.

### Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompromised adults: a consensus statement regarding initial strategies [^117F8r49]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines have improved the treatment and outcomes of patients with CAP, primarily by standardization of initial empirical therapy. But current society-published guidelines exclude immunocompromised patients.

Research Question

There is no consensus regarding the initial treatment of immunocompromised patients with suspected CAP.

Study Design and Methods

This consensus document was created by a multidisciplinary panel of 45 physicians with experience in the treatment of CAP in immunocompromised patients. The Delphi survey methodology was used to reach consensus.

Results

The panel focused on 21 questions addressing initial management strategies. The panel achieved consensus in defining the population, site of care, likely pathogens, microbiologic workup, general principles of empirical therapy, and empirical therapy for specific pathogens.

Interpretation

This document offers general suggestions for the initial treatment of the immunocompromised patient who arrives at the hospital with pneumonia.

### Guidelines and quality measures: do they improve outcomes of patients with community-acquired pneumonia? [^1117WZg8]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has a significant impact in terms of morbidity, mortality, and cost of care. Guidelines play an important role in the management of this disease, and evidence supporting the positive effects of guidelines on outcomes in patients with CAP is substantial. However, evidence supporting many of the CAP quality indicators is low, and pay-for-performance measures do not seem to influence clinically important outcomes. Future CAP quality indicators should incorporate evidence-based interventions.

### Antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia in adult outpatients [^1131ADAR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common condition representing a significant disease burden for the community, particularly for the elderly. Because antibiotics are helpful in treating CAP, they are the standard treatment and CAP thus contributes significantly to antibiotic use, which is associated with the development of bacterial resistance and side-effects. Although several studies have been published concerning CAP and its treatment, the available data arises mainly from studies conducted in hospitalized patients and outpatients. There is no concise summary of the available evidence that can help clinicians in choosing the most appropriate antibiotic.

Objectives

Our goal was to summarize the evidence currently available from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning the efficacy of alternative antibiotic treatments for CAP in ambulatory patients above 12 years of age.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2003) which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's trial register; MEDLINE (January 1966 to September week 3, 2003), and EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2003). Studies were also identified by checking the bibliographies of studies and review articles retrieved as well as by perusing medical journals. To identify any additional published or unpublished studies, we contacted the following antibiotics manufacturers: Abbott, AstraZeneca, Aventis, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers-Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, Hoffmann-LaRoche, Lilly, Merck, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Novartis, Pfizer, Pharmacia, Sanofi, and Yamanouchi. No language restrictions were applied in any of the search strategies.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which one or more antibiotics were tested for the treatment of CAP in ambulatory adolescent or adult patients. Studies testing one or more antibiotic and reporting the diagnostic criteria used in selecting patients as well as the clinical outcomes achieved were included. No language restrictions were applied.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted and study reports assessed by two independent reviewers (LMB and TJMV). Authors of studies were contacted as needed to resolve any ambiguities in the study reports. The data were analyzed using the Cochrane Collaboration's RevMan 4.2.2 Software. Differences between reviewers were resolved by discussion and consensus.

Main Results

Three randomized controlled trials involving a total of 622 patients aged 12 years and older diagnosed with community acquired pneumonia were included. The quality of the studies and of the reporting was variable. A variety of clinical, radiological and bacteriological diagnostic criteria and outcomes were reported. Overall there was no significant difference in the efficacy of the various antibiotics under study.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Currently available evidence from RCTs is insufficient to make evidence-based recommendations for the choice of antibiotic to be used for the treatment of community acquired pneumonia in ambulatory patients. Pooling of study data was limited by the very low number of studies. Individual study results do not reveal significant differences in efficacy between various antibiotics and antibiotic groups. Multi-drug comparisons using similar administration schedules are needed to provide the evidence necessary for practice recommendations.

### The controversy of combination vs monotherapy in the treatment of hospitalized community-acquired pneumonia [^111U9tfC]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The majority of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients (about 80%) will be treated as outpatients, because therapy with a single agent will work. For the remaining 20% of patients requiring hospitalization, there is some growing debate regarding the efficacy of different management approaches. For hospitalized patients, monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone agent seems to be gaining popularity, but dual therapy combining a beta-lactam and an advanced macrolide still represents a good choice. Indeed, this regimen was recommended for all of the inpatient categories in the latest Infectious Disease Society of America CAP guidelines in 2003.

Aim

The purpose of this review was to examine the current clinical evidence to support one option or the other by gathering all of the available published literature. We will review the existing controversies in terms of microbiology, immunology, and clinical outcomes comparing dual therapy (ie, with any combination of beta-lactams, macrolides, or fluoroquinolones) with monotherapy in the treatment of CAP.

Results

For the vast majority of patients with CAP (ie, outpatients and inpatients on medical wards), the type of antibiotic regimen prescribed does not have any significant impact. For patients with severe pneumonia, for which there is no accepted definition so far, the controversy remains alive. Mortality from pneumococcal pneumonia has been reduced over the last decades, but despite improved medical care, bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia is still as lethal as ever, probably because of the aging population, the greater number of immunocompromised patients, and the number of patients with frequent comorbid conditions. Worldwide, the increasing rates of resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to antibiotics are also a serious concern, and the clinical implications are not always obvious. Although limited in number, the four studies showing the importance of adding a macrolide to a beta-lactam regimen for the treatment of bacteremic S pneumoniae pneumonia are retrospective and nonblinded, the findings are consistent, and they point to a trend that has to be explored more thoroughly. Studies published in the last few years suggest that combination therapy may be superior for bacteremic S pneumoniae pneumonia.

Conclusion

In the meantime, for practical purposes, patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of severe CAP may benefit from a dual antibiotic therapy combining a third-generation cephalosporin and a macrolide. For the majority of hospitalized patients with CAP who are not severely ill, fluoroquinolone monotherapy remains an approved, tested, and reliable option. Indeed, the time for more aggressive outpatient fluoroquinolone therapy may reduce the number of patients who are hospitalized with CAP. Independent prospective studies comparing combination therapy with standard monotherapy are urgently required for hospitalized patients with severe CAP.

### Principles of antibiotic treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in the outpatient setting [^115H89mJ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common illness with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Nearly 80% of the treatment for this condition is provided in the outpatient setting. Among the etiologic agents associated with bacterial CAP, the predominant pathogen is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Treatment of CAP for the most part is empirical; therefore, any antibiotic treatment should cover both typical and atypical pathogens. The beta-lactams have historically been considered standard therapy for the treatment of CAP. However, the impact of rising resistance rates is now a primary concern facing physicians. For patients with comorbidities or recent antibiotic therapy, current guidelines recommend either combination therapy with a beta-lactam and a macrolide or an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone alone. Fluoroquinolones are broad-spectrum antibiotics that exhibit high levels of penetration into the lungs and low levels of resistance. Evidence from clinical trials indicates clinical success rates of > 90% for moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and levofloxacin in the treatment of CAP due to S pneumoniae. Data from comparative clinical trials suggest fluoroquinolone monotherapy is as efficacious as beta-lactam-macrolide combination therapy in the treatment of CAP patients. The respiratory fluoroquinolone levofloxacin has also been shown to be effective in CAP patients for the treatment of macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae. The use of azithromycin, telithromycin, and fluoroquinolones in short-course regimens has been shown to be efficacious, safe, and tolerable in patients with CAP. Based on clinical evidence, high-dose, short-course therapies may represent a significant advance in the management of CAP.

### Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in an ambulatory setting [^113aEzsS]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia continues to be a significant cause of morbidity and mortality despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and advances in critical care. Frequently, the diagnosis is confounded by coexisting cardiac or pulmonary conditions. Recognition of patients at risk for complications from pneumonia is critical when making the decision of how and where to treat. This review summarizes the diagnosis and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia with oral antibiotics in an outpatient setting. Specific pathogens and clinical presentations in certain at-risk populations are highlighted. Also presented are validated algorithms for evaluating and identifying patients who may be at risk for serious complications of pneumonia and require treatment in an inpatient setting.

ATS/IDSA community-acquired pneumonia — Inpatient nonsevere CAP without risk factors for MRSA or P. aeruginosa is treated empirically with either a β-lactam plus a macrolide (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence) or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (strong recommendation, high quality of evidence). For adults with CAP who have contraindications to both macrolides and fluoroquinolones, a third option is a β-lactam plus doxycycline (conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). The panel suggests that β-lactam monotherapy should not be routinely used for inpatients with CAP over fluoroquinolone monotherapy or β-lactam/macrolide combination therapy.

### How would you treat this patient hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^111p1VTX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, leading to 1.5 million hospitalizations and at least 200 000 deaths annually. The 2019 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia provides an evidence-based overview of this common illness. Here, 2 experts, a general internist who served as the co-primary author of the guidelines and a pulmonary and critical care physician, debate the management of a patient hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. They discuss disease severity stratification methods, whether to use adjunctive corticosteroids, and when to prescribe empirical treatment for multidrug-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in casualty: etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management (or a look at the "new" in pneumonia since 2002) [^114BR9op]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia, because of its substantial treatment costs, incidence, and mortality, is an aggressively researched diagnosis. In this review, we highlight new developments in the diagnosis, etiology, pathophysiology, treatment, and prevention of community-acquired pneumonia published since April 2002.

Recent Findings

The combined end points of improved patient care and conservation of health care resources have prompted several studies examining current professional society community-acquired pneumonia guidelines. In general, patients treated with the recommended third-generation cephalosporin and macrolide or an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone when indicated have fared better, including reduced overall costs, inpatient days, and mortality, than those receiving alternative treatments. Etiologic identification efforts by traditional methods, blood and sputum cultures, are being questioned owing to poor success rates and, even when positive, are being underused or ignored in antibiotic selection and patient management. Newer diagnostic tests are becoming commercially available, along with tests for biologic markers that have been only recently identified as contributors to, or prognosticators of, community-acquired pneumonia. Because antibiotic resistance remains a major obstacle to successful patient treatment, prevention or mitigation of community-acquired pneumonia is gaining increasing popularity through more aggressive pneumococcal and influenza vaccination of at risk groups, even before hospital discharge from a community-acquired pneumonia admission.

Summary

Although prevention is our best defense, current community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines are effective for treatment and cost containment. However, they should be scrutinized in light of clinical utilization data now entering the literature regarding their testing recommendations. Providers should consider encouraging focused culturing of sicker patients and those with significant comorbidities.

### Procalcitonin guidance of antibiotic therapy in community-acquired pneumonia: a randomized trial [^11585mQF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Rationale

In patients with community-acquired pneumonia, guidelines recommend antibiotic treatment for 7 to 21 d. Procalcitonin is elevated in bacterial infections, and its dynamics have prognostic implications.

Objective

To assess procalcitonin guidance for the initiation and duration of antibiotic therapy in community-acquired pneumonia.

Methods

In a randomized intervention trial, 302 consecutive patients with suspected community-acquired pneumonia were included. Data were assessed at baseline, after 4, 6, and 8 d, and after 6 wk. The control group (n = 151) received antibiotics according to usual practice. In the procalcitonin group (n = 151), antibiotic treatment was based on serum procalcitonin concentrations as follows: strongly discouraged, less than 0.1 microg/L; discouraged, less than 0.25 microg/L; encouraged, greater than 0.25 microg/L; strongly encouraged, greater than 0.5 microg/L. The primary endpoint was antibiotic use; secondary endpoints were measures of clinical, laboratory, and radiographic outcome.

Results

At baseline, both groups were similar regarding clinical, laboratory, and microbiology characteristics, and Pneumonia Severity Index. Procalcitonin guidance reduced total antibiotic exposure (relative risk, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.48–0.55; p < 0.001), antibiotic prescriptions on admission (85 vs. 99%; p < 0.001), and antibiotic treatment duration (median, 5 vs. 12 d; p < 0.001) compared with patients treated according to guidelines. After adjustment for Pneumonia Severity Index, the hazard ratio of antibiotic discontinuation was higher in the procalcitonin group than in the control group (3.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.5 to 4.2). Outcome was similar in both groups, with an overall success rate of 83%.

Conclusions

Procalcitonin guidance substantially reduces antibiotic use in community-acquired pneumonia. These findings may have important clinical and public health implications.

### Initial use of one or two antibiotics for critically ill patients with community-acquired pneumonia: impact on survival and bacterial resistance [^112umhGA]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is among the most common severe infections in critically ill patients and is associated with a high death toll. Failure to use adequate antibiotics (that is, antibiotics active in vitro on the causative organism) considerably increases the risk of death, particularly in patients with severe sepsis. Consequently, the recommended antibiotic regimen for patients with CAP requiring hospital admission is either a fluoroquinolone alone or a combination of two antibiotics, including a macrolide. Many trials suggest greater efficacy of dual therapy (usually with a β-lactam and a macrolide or fluoroquinolone) compared to monotherapy (usually with a β-lactam). Macrolides may be particularly useful, as they blunt the inflammatory response via immunomodulating effects and may exert effects on bacteria not included in their spectrum. However, current recommendations are based chiefly on theoretical grounds, as opposed to high-quality studies. Furthermore, a systematic review of randomized controlled trials found no evidence that empirical antibiotic therapy covering atypical pathogens improved survival or clinical efficacy in patients admitted for CAP.

Our primary objective in this observational cohort study of a prospective database was to determine whether using two initial antibiotics instead of one improved 60-day mortality in patients admitted to the ICU for CAP. We also assessed the effect on 60-day mortality of receiving adequate antibiotic therapy initially versus secondarily. Subgroup analyses were done in patients with specific organisms and in those with the most severe acute-illness syndromes. The risks of nosocomial pneumonia and multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria were compared in patients given one versus two antibiotics.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guideline — scope and population focuses on management decisions from clinical diagnosis with radiographic confirmation through completion of antimicrobial therapy and follow-up chest imaging and does not address initial clinical diagnostic criteria or prevention. The guideline centers on patients in the United States without recent foreign travel and on adults without an immunocompromising condition, including those actively receiving cancer chemotherapy, patients infected with HIV with suppressed CD4 counts, and solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipients. Although CAP may be diagnosed without a chest radiograph in ambulatory settings, the guideline emphasizes studies using radiographic criteria given the known inaccuracy of clinical signs and symptoms alone. Empiric antibiotic recommendations are based on agents effective against major treatable bacterial causes, traditionally including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella species, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112RuRoF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who are improving — duration of therapy guided by clinical stability. We recommend that the duration of antibiotic therapy should be guided by a validated measure of clinical stability (resolution of vital sign abnormalities [heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and temperature], ability to eat, and normal mentation), and antibiotic therapy should be continued until the patient achieves stability and for no less than a total of 5 days (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In randomized trials, no difference was observed between 5 additional days of oral amoxicillin compared with placebo after 3 days of intravenous amoxicillin, or between 2 days of intravenous cefuroxime followed by 5 days versus 8 days of oral cefuroxime; similar results were obtained with 5 days of levofloxacin 750 mg daily compared with 10 days of levofloxacin 500 mg daily and 5 days of intravenous ceftriaxone compared with 10 days. Failure to achieve clinical stability within 5 days is associated with higher mortality and worse clinical outcomes, and serial procalcitonin measurement is therefore likely to be useful primarily in settings where the average length of stay for patients with CAP exceeds normal practice (e.g., 5–7 d).

### Managing CAP patients at risk of clinical failure [^115LsUQR]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a curable disease. Both the European and American clinical practice guidelines provide algorithms how to manage patients with CAP. However, as populations worldwide are ageing and bacteria are becoming multidrug resistant, it is necessary to address the major factors that put patients at risk of poor outcome. These may include age, comorbidities, the settings where pneumonia was acquired or treated, the need for hospitalisation or ICU admission, likely causative pathogen (bacteria or virus) in a certain region and their local susceptibility pattern. One complicating fact is the lack of definite causative pathogen in approximately 50% of patients making it difficult to choose the most appropriate antibiotic treatment. When risk factors are present simultaneously in patients, fewer treatment options could be rather challenging for physicians. For example, the presence of comorbidities (renal, cardiac, hepatic) may exclude certain antibiotics due to potential adverse events. Assessing the severity of the disease and monitoring biomarkers, however, could help physicians to estimate patient prognosis once diagnosis is confirmed and treatment has been initiated. This review article addresses the most important risk factors of poor outcome in CAP patients.

### Approach to common bacterial infections: community-acquired pneumonia [^114LjwMv]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) occurs more often in early childhood than at almost any other age. Many microorganisms are associated with pneumonia, but individual pathogens are difficult to identify, which poses problems in antibiotic management. This article reviews the common as well as new, emerging pathogens, as well as the guidelines for management of pediatric CAP. Current guidelines for pediatric CAP continue to recommend the use of high-dose amoxicillin for bacterial CAP and azithromycin for suspected atypical CAP (usually caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae) in children.

### Health economics of use fluoroquinolones to treat patients with community-acquired pneumonia [^113i9HTn]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Respiratory diseases account for approximately 10% of all hospital admissions in the United States. Pneumonia constitutes 35% of these cases, with an average length of stay (LOS) of 5.1 days. It is estimated that $8.4 billion to $10 billion of all annual US hospital expenditures are attributable to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). As such, medical decisions, including empiric antibiotic choice, potentially exert an impact on hospital LOS and associated costs. In this review, we focus on the empiric antibiotic choices and associated costs of treatment for hospitalized patients with CAP, focusing on the use of fluoroquinolone therapy as recommended by the CAP guidelines.

### Challenges for a broad international implementation of the current severe community-acquired pneumonia guidelines [^11471k5t]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Severe community-acquired pneumonia (sCAP) remains one of the leading causes of admission to the intensive care unit, thus consuming a large share of resources and is associated with high mortality rates worldwide. The evidence generated by clinical studies in the last decade was translated into recommendations according to the first published guidelines focusing on severe community-acquired pneumonia. Despite the advances proposed by the present guidelines, several challenges preclude the prompt implementation of these diagnostic and therapeutic measures. The present article discusses the challenges for the broad implementation of the sCAP guidelines and proposes solutions when applicable.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^111qgUpP]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause of morbidity, mortality and expenditure of resources. When followed, guidelines for CAP management have been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes; however, several issues are still open. This review summarizes the recent advances in this field and the priority needs for future research.

Recent Findings

Recently identified clinical and biochemical tools promise to improve the assessment of CAP severity; however, definition of the most accurate and feasible rule(s) for clinical practice is now necessary. Some empirical antimicrobial regimens are still being debated, such as the need for atypical pathogen coverage in home-treated and nonsevere hospitalized patients and the inclusion of respiratory fluoroquinolones among first-choice molecules. New drugs such as tigecycline and cethromycin appear promising. Pharmacokinetically enhanced amoxicillin/clavulanate is highly effective, even for treating CAP caused by multiple-drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Other aspects recently clarified include the inappropriateness of rigid time-to-first-antibiotic-dose rules, the advantages of shorter antibiotic treatments for nonsevere patients and the need of special clinical attention for acute myocardial infarction among patients with severe CAP or clinical failure.

Summary

Recent developments have significantly contributed to refine the management of CAP patients. However, various hot topics remain undefined as yet and urgently require ad-hoc research in order to optimize the outcomes and the costs of this highly social-impacting disease.

### Addition of macrolide antibiotics for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^1174pxsj]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics are the main treatment for bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the United Kingdom (UK), guidelines from the British Thoracic Society and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend amoxicillin for the empirical treatment of low- to moderate-severity pneumonia, and co-amoxiclav for high-severity pneumonia. For moderate- and high-severity pneumonia, these guidelines suggest combining macrolide antibiotics with amoxicillin or co-amoxiclav to provide coverage for atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma. Similarly, European and Latin American guidelines also recommend the addition of macrolides to β-lactams as empirical antibiotic therapy in hospitalized patients with severe CAP, while United States (US) guidelines recommend including atypical cover (which can be with a β-lactam + macrolide or respiratory fluroquinolone monotherapy) for all patients hospitalized with CAP.

Macrolides have also been hypothesized to improve outcomes from pneumococcal pneumonia, even when an active β-lactam is given, by means other than their antimicrobial activity (eg, anti-inflammatory effects). However, macrolide use is associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, adverse gastrointestinal events, and resistance against multiple antibiotics at both a population level and within individuals.

Existing population-based studies and clinical trials have yielded contradictory evidence.

Several retrospective and small prospective studies have suggested that dual therapy (β-lactam plus macrolide) is associated with lower mortality in patients with severe CAP. However, these findings have been challenged by other observational studies that reported no significant differences in outcomes, such as mortality and length of hospital stay, between monotherapy and combination therapy. Two meta-analyses of observational studies reported that macrolide use was associated with a significant reduction in mortality. In contrast, a noninferiority trial in non–intensive care unit (ICU) CAP patients found that monotherapy was noninferior to combination therapy in terms of 90-day mortality. Another noninferiority trial recruiting patients with moderately severe CAP reported delayed clinical stability with monotherapy but found no differences in mortality or length of stay. A recent randomized trial suggested that adding macrolides to β-lactam therapy improved clinical response and reduced the inflammatory burden, although mortality remained similar between groups.

Given these conflicting results, large observational studies may help by comparing treatment options in real-world representative populations. We therefore examined the effect of adjunctive macrolides on clinical outcomes in adults hospitalized for CAP receiving β-lactam therapy, using electronic healthcare records from a large UK teaching hospital group, extending the approach used in our recent analysis of the impact of β-lactam choice in CAP.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^114NCFtS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 6 in 10 adults have one chronic disease, and 4 in 10 adults have two or more chronic diseases, so the recommendation for amoxicillin will be applicable to a minority of adults with CAP. Therefore, U.S. physicians will most likely continue to treat many patients with the Watch group respiratory fluoroquinolones, a class of antibiotics with a well-documented propensity to favor the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance and Clostridioides difficile infections, as well as an increased risk of adverse events (U.S. Food and Drug Administration alert).

This will hamper the CDC's efforts to reduce overall antibiotic consumption and fluoroquinolone use in the United States. The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee also suggested that guidelines should include recommendations to educate patients about antibiotic therapy when appropriate. Accordingly, the developers of the CAP guidelines could have considered providing guidance to physicians regarding the use of Access group antibiotics such as amoxicillin and doxycycline in select patients with stable comorbid conditions, along with close monitoring and adequate patient education.

Even more surprising is the listing of the Reserve group fifth-generation cephalosporin ceftaroline as a first-choice empiric treatment option for CAP (in combination with a macrolide) in hospitalized adults without risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Efficacy data from phase III trials suggesting that ceftaroline is superior to ceftriaxone with regard to clinical cure require further scrutiny, and its current listing as a first-choice option violates basic antibiotic stewardship considerations.

Given that respiratory tract infections are one of the most frequent reasons for antibiotic prescriptions worldwide, and that in many countries the U.S. treatment recommendations are still considered an important reference, it seems to us, as members of the WHO EML Antibiotics Working Group, that this represents a lost opportunity for antibiotic stewardship. We believe there is a clear need to better align all treatment guidelines to the same guiding principles, and to establish a global set of evidence-based recommendations with a focus on enhancing the use of Access group antibiotics.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114uuCmt]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa coverage and HCAP category — adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the inpatient setting: we recommend abandoning use of the prior categorization of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) to guide selection of extended antibiotic coverage in adults with CAP (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence), and we recommend clinicians only cover empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa in adults with CAP if locally validated risk factors for either pathogen are present (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence); empiric treatment options for MRSA include vancomycin (15 mg/kg every 12 h, adjust based on levels) or linezolid (600 mg every 12 h), and for P. aeruginosa include piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g every 6 h), cefepime (2 g every 8 h), ceftazidime (2 g every 8 h), aztreonam (2 g every 8 h), meropenem (1 g every 8 h), or imipenem (500 mg every 6 h); if clinicians are currently covering empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa on the basis of published risk factors but do not have local etiologic data, we recommend continuing empiric coverage while obtaining culture data to justify continued treatment after the first few days of empiric treatment (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults — microbiologic testing stance and sampling strategy: Microbiological testing has yet to deliver fast, accurate, and affordable testing with proven benefit, with exceptions including rapid testing for MRSA and influenza; this guideline significantly increases the proportion of patients in whom we recommend routinely obtaining respiratory tract samples for microbiologic studies, a change largely aimed at correcting overuse of anti-MRSA and antipseudomonal therapy since the introduction of the HCAP classification (which we recommend abandoning) rather than based on high-quality evidence, and clinicians must validate any empiric approach based on local spectrum and frequency of resistant pathogens.

### Diagnosis and treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^1155ipN1]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with community-acquired pneumonia often present with cough, fever, chills, fatigue, dyspnea, rigors, and pleuritic chest pain. When a patient presents with suspected community-acquired pneumonia, the physician should first assess the need for hospitalization using a mortality prediction tool, such as the Pneumonia Severity Index, combined with clinical judgment. Consensus guidelines from several organizations recommend empiric therapy with macrolides, fluoroquinolones, or doxycycline. Patients who are hospitalized should be switched from parenteral antibiotics to oral antibiotics after their symptoms improve, they are afebrile, and they are able to tolerate oral medications. Clinical pathways are important tools to improve care and maximize cost-effectiveness in hospitalized patients.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with community-acquired pneumonia [^114DEUwS]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) without severe sepsis in the emergency department — antibiotic timing: Patient Management Recommendations state "Level A recommendations. None specified", "Level B recommendations. There is insufficient evidence to establish a benefit in mortality or morbidity from antibiotics administered in less than 4, 6, or 8 hours from ED arrival", and "Level C recommendations. Administer antibiotics as soon as feasible once the diagnosis of CAP is established; there is insufficient evidence to establish a benefit in morbidity or mortality from antibiotics administered within any specific time course". National guidance notes "for patients admitted through the ED, the first antibiotic dose should be administered while [the patient is] still in the ED". Evidence cited includes a retrospective multicenter Class III study of "13,771 Medicare patients" "older than 65 years", where antibiotics "administered within 4 hours" were associated with "a decreased 30-day mortality, with an OR of 0.85 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.95)". However, "Other cutoff times from 3 to 8 hours were associated with similar 30-day mortality", "adjusted ORs of the 4- and 8-hour cutoffs were identical", and "patients who received antibiotics between 0 and 2 hours did not have any significant mortality reduction". A prospective Class II study "confirmed the aforementioned association between time to first antibiotic dose less than 4 hours and mortality" in "patients older than 18 years".

1 Another study examined the clinical and laboratory data of 323 inpatient adults with radiographically confirmed CAP and tested sputum and endotracheal aspirates to identify pathogens. 22 Antibiotic therapy for outpatients is summarized in Table 3. 14 In patients with severe CAP, combination therapy with a beta-lactam antibiotic plus a macrolide or a beta-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone is recommended.
14. In patients with severe CAP who have had prior respiratory isolation of MRSA or were recently hospitalized and treated with parenteral antibiotics and have locally validated risk factors for MRSA infection, vancomycin or linezolid should be added to cover for MRSA infection. 14 In patients with severe CAP who have had prior respiratory isolation of a.

14. When MRSA or Pseudomonascoverage is added, blood and sputum cultures should be obtained to allow for de-escalation of this coverage if the pathogen is ruled out. 14 Antibiotics should be continued for a minimum of five days, and discontinued after the patient improves and remains clinically stable. 14 The IDSA recommends treating adults with oseltamivir when influenza virus is isolated in the inpatient setting, regardless of the duration of illness before CAP diagnosis. In the outpatient setting, oseltamivir should be initiated regardless of duration of illness.

### Antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia… [^113KGc1D]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia substantially affects patient morbidity and mortality, and has significant health care costs. This type of pneumonia has more impact on elderly patients, who tend to have longer hospital stays and a higher cost per stay compared with younger patients. Multiple published guidelines provide physicians with information about when to admit patients with community-acquired pneumonia, which antibiotic therapy is appropriate, how long to treat, and when it is suitable to discharge patients from the hospital. These treatment strategies do not take into account the emergence of resistant organisms and the poorly understood impact of community-acquired pneumonia on younger patients. Although various studies have looked at combination antibiotic therapy, they rarely have been comparative. Brown and colleagues examined the effect of initial antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia on selected clinical outcomes.

The authors analyzed a hospital database of adult patients with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. Outcomes assessed included 30-day mortality, total hospital costs, and length of stay. In addition, patients were stratified on the basis of severity of illness and age. Patients who received one antibiotic were divided into five monotherapy groups: ceftriaxone, "other" cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, or penicillin. Those who received dual therapy were divided into four groups: each of the above antibiotics plus a macrolide. Patients who were defined as severely ill were excluded from the study. There were 44, 814 patients who met the inclusion criteria for the study. Those who received monotherapy with macrolides had a lower mortality rate but also were considered less ill than the other monotherapy groups.

Patients who received dual therapy generally had a shorter length of stay, lower hospital costs, and decreased mortality compared with patients who received monotherapy. Those who were younger than 65 years also had better outcomes with dual therapy. Patients who received ceftriaxone and macrolide therapy had a lower length of stay and lower total hospital charges compared with other therapies. In the sickest patients, dual therapy with fluoroquinolones resulted in the least improvement in length of stay and total hospital charges. The authors conclude that dual therapy using a macrolide as the second agent decreases mortality, reduces length of hospital stay, and results in lower hospital charges in patients admitted for community-acquired pneumonia. These differences are true for patients younger and older than 65. The authors note that ceftriaxone plus a macrolide appears to provide the best outcome compared with other dual-therapy regimens.

Regarding specific circumstances for community-acquired pneumonia, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients, antibiotic therapy, general principles, BTS 2011 guidelines recommend to administer amoxicillin as the first-line oral antibiotic in all pediatric patients due to its effectiveness against the majority of pathogens causing CAP in this group, good tolerance profile, and cost. Administer amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefaclor, erythromycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin as an alternative.
