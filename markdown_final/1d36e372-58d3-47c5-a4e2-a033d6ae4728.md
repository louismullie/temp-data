## Question

Lamictal for ITP

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Lamictal (lamotrigine) is used to treat immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and what the relationship is between lamotrigine and thrombocytopenia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about lamotrigine's labeled indications and its hematologic safety profile. Then, I should review evidence-based ITP treatment guidelines to see if lamotrigine appears anywhere. Next, I will examine reports of drug-induced thrombocytopenia linked to lamotrigine. Finally, I'll synthesize these findings into a clear recommendation, making sure I verify each step against authoritative sources along the way.

> Let me first confirm the basics: lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant approved for epilepsy and for maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder; it is not labeled as a therapy for ITP, and nothing in the FDA prescribing information suggests a role in treating thrombocytopenia, which should already make me cautious about assuming any benefit in ITP [^116sHpRH].

> Wait, let me verify the hematologic safety warnings before drawing conclusions: the FDA labeling for lamotrigine explicitly cautions about blood dyscrasias, including aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), and lists hematologic adverse reactions such as decreased neutrophils, hemolytic anemia, and pure red cell aplasia; this profile tells me I should maintain a high index of suspicion for cytopenias in exposed patients, including potential thrombocytopenia as part of pancytopenia or immune syndromes like DIHS/HLH [^116szzRX] [^116sHpRH].

> Next, I should review what standard, evidence-based ITP management looks like to see if lamotrigine belongs anywhere in the algorithm; the ASH 2019 ITP guidelines outline corticosteroids, IVIG or anti-D as first-line options and recommend second-line therapies such as thrombopoietin receptor agonists (eltrombopag, romiplostim), rituximab, fostamatinib, or splenectomy, and lamotrigine does not appear as a treatment in any line of therapy, which I should explicitly note to avoid inappropriate off-label extrapolation [^116YKu42] [^111D26Sr] [^117MXzwT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check whether there is any credible off-label or case-series evidence supporting lamotrigine to treat ITP. Let me consider the literature: instead of therapeutic signals, the published data emphasize drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP) as a mechanism across many agents and include case reports of lamotrigine-associated purpura suggestive of platelet involvement; this aligns more with lamotrigine being a potential cause of thrombocytopenia rather than a treatment for it [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute — could lamotrigine's immune effects theoretically help an autoimmune condition like ITP? I briefly wondered about that, but when I double-check guideline repositories and reviews, there is no support for lamotrigine as an ITP therapy, and given its known links to blood dyscrasias and immune activation syndromes (including HLH), the risk-benefit calculus clearly points away from using it in ITP management [^111D26Sr] [^116szzRX].

> I will now examine causality considerations: DITP is typically diagnosed on clinical grounds with a careful exposure history and temporal relationship, because drug-dependent platelet antibody testing is limited; with lamotrigine's warning profile and case literature, if a patient with new or unexplained thrombocytopenia is taking lamotrigine, I should confirm timing, exclude other causes, and consider discontinuation when DITP is suspected, while managing bleeding risk per ITP/DITP algorithms [^113Y8WVM].

> Next, I should review practical management implications: for patients with established ITP who need an antiseizure or mood-stabilizing agent, I need to ensure their regimen does not add hematologic risk; if lamotrigine is clinically necessary, I should confirm baseline counts, monitor closely for cytopenias, and maintain vigilance for systemic hypersensitivity or HLH features, but if thrombocytopenia worsens or DITP is suspected, stopping lamotrigine and substituting with an alternative should be promptly considered while pursuing standard ITP therapies as indicated by severity and bleeding risk [^116szzRX] [^116YKu42].

> Putting this together, the relationship is essentially inverse to the premise that lamotrigine might treat ITP: lamotrigine is not an ITP treatment per evidence-based guidelines, and it carries warnings for serious hematologic adverse reactions, with literature describing platelet-related adverse events, so it is better considered a potential contributor to drug-induced thrombocytopenia rather than a remedy for it [^111D26Sr] [^116szzRX] [^113rQrpU].

> Final answer: Lamictal (lamotrigine) is not used to treat immune thrombocytopenia; standard ITP therapies include corticosteroids, IVIG/anti-D, thrombopoietin receptor agonists, rituximab, fostamatinib, and splenectomy, whereas lamotrigine has documented risks of blood dyscrasias and reported platelet-related adverse events, so in the context of thrombocytopenia it should raise suspicion for DITP rather than be considered a treatment option [^116YKu42] [^111D26Sr] [^116szzRX].

---

Lamotrigine (Lamictal) is **not indicated for** immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). It is an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer that can cause thrombocytopenia as a rare adverse effect. If thrombocytopenia occurs, **discontinue lamotrigine** and manage ITP with standard therapies such as corticosteroids [^116YKu42], IVIG [^111D26Sr], rituximab [^112NMVhK], or thrombopoietin receptor agonists [^117MXzwT]. It should be **avoided** in patients with a history of drug-induced thrombocytopenia [^113Y8WVM].

---

## Pharmacological profile of lamotrigine

Lamotrigine is **an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer** approved for epilepsy and bipolar disorder. It inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels, reducing glutamate release and neuronal excitability. It is **not indicated for ITP or other hematologic disorders**.

---

## Lamotrigine and thrombocytopenia

Lamotrigine has been **associated with thrombocytopenia** as a rare adverse effect, including immune-mediated forms [^113Y8WVM]. The FDA label warns of blood dyscrasias [^116szzRX] — thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, and aplastic anemia [^116sHpRH]. Thrombocytopenia usually occurs within weeks to months of initiation and resolves after discontinuation.

---

## Clinical evidence regarding lamotrigine and ITP

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting lamotrigine for ITP; rather, it has been implicated in drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP) [^113Y8WVM], which is distinct from primary ITP and is characterized by a rapid, often severe platelet drop that resolves after stopping the drug [^115DNAFT].

---

## Mechanisms of lamotrigine-induced thrombocytopenia

Lamotrigine-induced thrombocytopenia is thought to be **immune-mediated** [^113Y8WVM], with drug-dependent antibodies that bind platelets in the presence of lamotrigine, leading to destruction via complement activation or phagocytosis. This mechanism differs from primary ITP, which involves autoantibodies against platelet glycoproteins [^1172mBD5].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines do **not recommend** lamotrigine for ITP; it is not listed as a treatment option [^111D26Sr]. The American Society of Hematology (ASH) and other authorities recommend corticosteroids [^116YKu42], IVIG [^111D26Sr], rituximab [^112NMVhK], and thrombopoietin receptor agonists (eltrombopag, romiplostim) [^117MXzwT] as standard therapies.

---

## Risks and adverse effects of lamotrigine in ITP patients

Lamotrigine carries **significant risks** in patients with thrombocytopenia or ITP, including:

- **Thrombocytopenia**: Rare but potentially severe.
- **Pancytopenia**: Reduction in multiple blood cell lines [^116sHpRH].
- **Aplastic anemia**: Rare but serious [^116sHpRH].
- **Immune-mediated reactions**: Including DRESS and HLH [^116szzRX] [^116sHpRH] [^113u94dC].

Given these risks, **use lamotrigine cautiously** in patients with pre-existing thrombocytopenia or ITP, and monitor platelets regularly [^116szzRX] [^116sHpRH].

---

## Alternative treatments for ITP

Effective **alternatives** to lamotrigine for ITP include:

| **Treatment** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Corticosteroids | Immunosuppression and reduced platelet destruction | First-line therapy [^111D26Sr] [^1111QdM5] |
| IVIG | Immune modulation and rapid platelet increase | First-line therapy [^111D26Sr] [^116Qk9D1] |
| Rituximab | B-cell depletion and reduced autoantibody production | Second-line therapy [^112NMVhK] [^1172mBD5] |
| Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (eltrombopag, romiplostim) | Stimulate platelet production | Second-line therapy [^117MXzwT] [^116eFi4d] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where lamotrigine might be considered

Lamotrigine may be considered in ITP patients only for **coexisting epilepsy or bipolar disorder** requiring mood stabilization. In such cases, close monitoring of platelet counts is essential; consider alternative anticonvulsants or mood stabilizers if thrombocytopenia develops [^113Y8WVM].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

If lamotrigine is used in ITP patients, **the following strategies are recommended**:

- **Regular platelet monitoring**: Baseline and periodic CBCs [^1172mBD5].
- **Patient education**: Report bleeding, bruising, or petechiae promptly.
- **Immediate discontinuation**: Stop lamotrigine if significant thrombocytopenia occurs [^113Y8WVM].
- **Alternative therapies**: Use standard ITP treatments if thrombocytopenia persists [^111D26Sr].

---

Lamotrigine is **not indicated for ITP** and may cause thrombocytopenia. It should be **avoided** in patients with a history of drug-induced thrombocytopenia; standard ITP therapies should be used instead [^111D26Sr].

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: Challenges and best practices [^114dx3d8]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

In patients with immune thrombocytopenia who do not adequately respond to first-line therapy, there is no clear consensus on which second-line therapy to initiate and when. This situation leads to suboptimal approaches, including prolonged exposure to treatments that are not intended for long-term use (e.g. corticosteroids) and overuse of off-label therapies (e.g. rituximab) while approved, more efficacious options exist. These approaches may not only fail to address symptoms and the burden of disease, but may also worsen health-related quality of life. A better understanding of available second-line treatments may ensure the best use of therapeutic options and thereby optimize patient outcomes.

### Systematic literature review of treatments used for adult immune thrombocytopenia in the second-line setting [^113xXaiY]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Low credibility.

Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia that can lead to an increased tendency to bleed. Although it typically presents as a subtle-onset, chronic syndrome in adults, with no forewarning symptoms or illness, clinical manifestations can range from minor bruising to severe hemorrhaging. The primary goal of treatment is to achieve a safe platelet count, above which a patient does not experience bleeding episodes, and this is determined on a case-by-case basis. Common first-line therapies include corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and anti-D (Rho[D] immune globulin intravenous). Relapse or failure to respond to these may necessitate second-line treatment, which can include splenectomy or a variety of medical therapies, most of which have not been approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of ITP but have been used because of efficacy demonstrated in other autoimmune diseases or as immune suppressants.

Splenectomy has historically been considered the second-line therapy of choice in adult ITP. A systematic review was previously conducted to examine studies, published from 1966 to 2003, that assessed the efficacy/effectiveness of medical treatments for adult patients with ITP who have not responded to splenectomy. The review covered a total of 90 studies representing 656 patients who were splenectomized, aged over 16 years, had ITP for more than 3 months, and a platelet count below 50 × 10⁹/L. Only one study was a randomized controlled trial.

### Systematic literature review of treatments used for adult immune thrombocytopenia in the second-line setting [^11615BEK]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Low credibility.

This review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Comprehensive literature searches were conducted by several reviewers in October 2016 in the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews using multiple search strings to fully encompass all aspects of the inclusion criteria. Bibliographies of relevant reviews and meta-analyses were also searched for additional pertinent publications.

The flow diagram of study inclusion is presented in Figure 1. Study citations were downloaded into a database, and duplicates were removed from the search results using automated de-duplication methods and manual screening. Studies were reviewed for relevance at the levels of title, abstract, and full text by two independent reviewers. Articles designated as eligible for inclusion were abstracted into a database, and independent reviewers performed a quality control assessment for accuracy on each abstracted study. Disagreements were resolved by consensus adjudication.

If more than one article from the same study population was published, data from the publication with the longest follow-up, most recent data, and/or most specifically relevant population and/or outcomes were extracted. Data elements abstracted included study design, population characteristics, treatment description and dosage, and the aforementioned efficacy/effectiveness and safety outcomes.

### Systematic literature review of treatments used for adult immune thrombocytopenia in the second-line setting [^112XACYQ]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Low credibility.

Despite these limitations, this systematic review of the literature provides a comprehensive and updated view of the evidence around the safety and efficacy/effectiveness of second-line treatments for adult primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) based on nearly 200 studies conducted in several populations worldwide. It confirms that a gap remains: outside of the thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) eltrombopag and romiplostim, the majority of treatment options for managing recurrent or persistent thrombocytopenia lack rigorous evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to demonstrate safety and efficacy in this setting. Many treatments have limited supportive evidence of any kind.

These findings are echoed in a recent review, although not systematic in nature but based on extensive clinical experience, where Lambert and Gernsheimer conclude that for the second-line treatment of adult ITP patients with persistently low platelet counts and bleeding, evidence at the time of writing supports medical alternatives to splenectomy. This is specifically in the context of both TPO-RAs, which are now backed by long-term follow-up data on efficacy and safety.

### Treatment of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenias [^115dbmhu]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia after drug administration can be associated with bleeding or thrombosis, depending on the pathophysiology of platelet destruction. Significant progress has been made over the last two decades in understanding the pathogenetic mechanism of DITP. However, there are still numerous diagnostic and treatment challenges, especially in critically ill patients, including the difficulty in distinguishing drug-associated thrombocytopenia from secondary thrombocytopenia caused by underlying disorders.

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: Challenges and best practices [^117Qvw6E]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

- **Best practices**:

- **Transitioning to second-line therapy**: My approach to selecting patients for second-line therapy is depicted in Figure 1. If a first-line therapy has produced a response that lasted for more than six months and was tolerable, the patient could be re-treated with it. However, I generally discontinue first-line therapy and switch to second-line therapy if any of the following criteria are met: (1) the patient cannot tolerate first-line treatment; (2) the patient does not respond to first-line treatment within 2–4 weeks; (3) the patient's response to the last course of therapy is lost within six months, including a failure to taper corticosteroids to a low dose (i.e. prednisone ≤ 5 mg/day) due to loss of response. In addition to these criteria, patient preferences and treatment burden should also be incorporated into decision-making.

Clinicians should make individualized treatment decisions that take into account the patient's comorbidities, lifestyle, and personal values and preferences. Corticosteroids are standard first-line therapy. They may be combined with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) when a more rapid response is required. Either IVIg or anti-D may be used as first-line treatment if corticosteroids are contraindicated. Anti-D should be considered only in non-splenectomized, Rh+ patients who have a negative direct antiglobulin test.

### Fostamatinib for the treatment of adult persistent and chronic immune thrombocytopenia: Results of two phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trials [^114WU8aJ]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

Prior to randomization, patients had a washout period during which therapeutic agents, other than those allowed as concomitant ITP therapies, were discontinued for up to eight weeks. Patients were allowed to continue one concomitant ITP medication (corticosteroids at < 20 mg prednisone equivalent per day, azathioprine, or danazol) throughout the study without any changes if they were on a stable dose for 14 days prior to baseline. Rescue therapies, such as increased dosing of concomitant ITP therapy, IVIg, IV anti-D, steroids, and platelet transfusion, were allowed.

Fostamatinib was administered at 100 mg BID and could be increased to 150 mg BID after four weeks or later, depending on platelet count. Doses could be reduced to fostamatinib 100 or 150 mg once daily if a dose-limiting adverse event occurred. The need for dose modifications was determined during biweekly visits.

Patients who completed the 24-week study treatment could enroll in the long-term, open-label extension study (Study 049; NCT02077192). Non-responders who were treated for ≥ 12 weeks and received 150 mg BID of the study drug for ≥ 4 weeks could also enter the extension study.

The primary efficacy endpoint was a stable response by week 24, defined as platelet counts ≥ 50,000/μL on at least four of the six clinic visits occurring every two weeks during weeks 14–24 inclusive; patients receiving rescue medication after week 10 were considered non-responders. A secondary efficacy platelet endpoint was measured in patients with a baseline platelet count < 15,000/μL: achievement of platelet counts.

### Updated international consensus report on the investigation and management of primary immune thrombocytopenia [^111cUdiS]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for thrombocytopenia in pregnancy, particularly with respect to corticosteroids and IVIG, the ICR 2019 guidelines recommend considering the administration of IVIG in pregnant patients with immune thrombocytopenia to urgently increase platelet count during bleeding or for delivery. This is recognized as providing a rapid but often very transient increase in platelet count.

### Introduction to a review series on the treatment of thrombocytopenic disorders: something old, something new [^116VkjRU]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

We are confident that increased awareness of the relevance of the disorders discussed in this review series may stimulate further basic and clinical research. Cutting-edge technologies and bioinformatics applied to genomics will contribute to the identification of an increasing number of inherited thrombocytopenias, making their diagnosis easier and more precise. Perhaps more importantly, we need reinvigorated international collaboration to produce large cohorts of patients with long-term follow-up to better capture the most relevant outcomes of these disorders.

As to drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia, the recent unexpected emergence of thrombocytopenic disorders after COVID-19 vaccination or after the use of an increasing list of innovative drugs, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, calls for supranational pharmacovigilance systems and the creation of easily accessible, updated repertories of drugs identified or suspected to cause immune or non-immune thrombocytopenias. While waiting for artificial platelets to become available in clinical settings and potentially make platelet transfusion an obsolete practice, the potential benefit of increasing natural thrombopoiesis in chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia and other thrombocytopenias needs to be further exploited by well-designed prospective studies investigating old and new TPO-RA.

### On the horizon: Upcoming new agents for the management of ITP [^116sPt68]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2024). High credibility.

The treatment of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) has evolved over the last 20 years in response to our increased understanding of the pathophysiology of this complex immune disorder. New treatments in development have taken advantage of our evolving understanding of the biology of this disease to target new mechanisms and expand the available ways in which to approach patients with this disorder. This review focuses on novel therapeutics in the ITP pipeline and discusses the pathophysiology of ITP that has led to their development.

### Comparison of up-front treatments for newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia - a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^117ADBdy]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

This systematic review and network meta-analysis of the efficacy of up-front treatments for newly diagnosed ITP included 21 trials with 1898 randomly assigned participants. Our main findings showed significantly superior SR for the rhTPO + dexamethasone and rituximab + dexamethasone arms compared to those for the conventional therapies (PSL and dexamethasone monotherapy). Moreover, both rhTPO + dexamethasone and rhTPO + PSL also improved early OR compared to PSL, dexamethasone, or rituximab-containing regimens. Therapy-related adverse events showed similar profiles and were tolerable in all treatment arms.

The superior efficacy of rhTPO + dexamethasone compared to PSL or dexamethasone monotherapy as an initial treatment for newly diagnosed ITP with regards to long-term SR has been first shown in this meta-analysis. This methodology demonstrates more formally what some clinicians have suspected, and the result suggests that TPO-RA may possibly be a first choice for the treatment of newly diagnosed ITP, in addition to therapy-resistant or chronic ITP, in which the additive effects of TPO-RA have previously been shown in various RCT and systematic reviews.

Our results are partially supported by previous studies that analyzed blood thrombopoietin concentrations; serum thrombopoietin levels in patients with newly diagnosed ITP are within the normal range or only minimally elevated compared to those of healthy people, although data on serum thrombopoietin levels were not available in any RCT included in our study. Attention should be paid to the fact that in all trials…

### Rituximab in the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia: What is the role of this agent in 2019 [^111XNAAt]. Haematologica (2019). Low credibility.

Twenty years after the first use of rituximab in ITP, published studies show an overall response rate (ORR) of nearly 60% and a complete response (CR) rate of 50%. Long-term remissions occur in 20–30% of patients, with slightly different outcomes possibly related to different selection of patient populations.

In the interpretation of the results, it is worth noting that heterogeneous criteria for response were adopted across different studies, according to older or updated criteria. Moreover, older studies included mostly chronic, plurirefractory patients, while more recent studies also included patients with newly diagnosed or persistent ITP. The ability to compare studies is often only partial due to different follow-up periods.

The data from placebo-controlled studies seem discouraging, but some considerations should be made. In both the experimental treatment and placebo arms, patients were allowed to continue corticosteroid therapy, which could have biased the results. In the placebo arms, the ORRs were 67% (39% CR) and 73% (46% CR). A more meaningful observation is that the median time to relapse in patients who achieved an overall response was 36 weeks in the rituximab group and 7 weeks in the placebo group.

The main criticism, that only 20% to 30% of patients achieve long-term remission for more than 3–5 years, deserves further consideration. The main error was probably the mistaken belief that rituximab could represent the medical substitute for splenectomy: a single treatment administered once in a lifetime that could definitively cure many or even most patients.

### Insights on treatment of adult ITP: Algorithm for management and role of multimodal therapy [^114dntzB]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). Low credibility.

The management of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is continuously evolving with the development and introduction of newer therapies and a better understanding of the disease. Corticosteroids still represent the cornerstone of first-line treatment. Patients who fail to achieve remission with a short course of corticosteroids require subsequent therapy. Most guidelines recommend starting with either a thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA), rituximab, or fostamatinib since these agents have been investigated in randomized trials and have well-characterized efficacy and safety profiles.

Patients' involvement to reach a shared decision regarding the choice of therapy is essential, as these treatments have different modes of administration and mechanisms of action. Less than 10% of patients will fail to respond to and/or be intolerant of multiple second-line therapeutic options and thus be considered to have refractory ITP, requiring a third-line therapeutic option. Such patients may require drugs with different targets or a combination of drugs with different mechanisms of action. Combining a TPO-RA and an immunomodulatory agent may be an appropriate approach at this stage.

Many studies have been conducted during the last two decades investigating the efficacy and safety of combination strategies for first and later lines of therapies, yet none of these are recommended by guidelines or have gained wide acceptance and consensus.

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: Challenges and best practices [^1162FrCh]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

The agents listed above as "other treatments" have been utilized in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) as alternative treatments due to cost and availability considerations. However, these agents may produce highly variable responses in individual patients and may require weeks or months to be effective. Thus, they may potentially be of use as adjunct therapy in patients with insufficient response to second-line therapy. They are not recommended for most patients unless available second-line options have been exhausted. An important exception is patients in countries where access to thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) and rituximab may be limited.

### Clinical updates in adult immune thrombocytopenia [^1172mBD5]. Blood (2017). High credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) occurs in 2 to 4 per 100,000 adults and results in variable bleeding symptoms and thrombocytopenia. In the last decade, changes in our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder have led to the publication of new guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ITP, including standards for terminology. Evidence supports alternatives to splenectomy for second-line management of patients with persistently low platelet counts and bleeding. Long-term follow-up data suggest both the efficacy and safety of thrombopoietin receptor agonists, particularly in the occurrence of late remissions. Follow-up of patients who have undergone splenectomy for ITP reveals significant potential risks that should be discussed with patients, which may influence the choice of second-line therapy for both clinicians and patients. Novel therapeutics are in development to address ongoing treatment gaps.

### Localized purpura associated with lamotrigine [^113rQrpU]. Pediatric Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Antiepileptic drug hypersensitivity syndrome consists of fever, rash, and internal organ involvement and usually occurs within the first two months of initiation of therapy. This report describes a 13-year-old female with a right frontal high-grade glioma and complex partial seizures who developed localized purpura after 23 months of lamotrigine monotherapy. This case study is the second report of localized purpura after prolonged lamotrigine treatment, suggesting this may be an atypical lamotrigine-induced drug reaction.

- **Challenges in the transition to second-line treatment**: In patients who require additional treatment after first-line therapy, there is no consensus on when to stop first-line treatment and switch to a therapy more suitable for maintaining a long-term response. In addition, there is no consensus on which second-line option to try first. Perhaps because of this uncertainty, several common suboptimal treatment approaches have emerged in clinical practice.
- **Excessive duration of corticosteroid treatment**: As corticosteroid treatment is a familiar, low-cost, and efficacious option for many patients, some clinicians maintain their patients on corticosteroids for months or even years before transitioning to a second-line therapy. This practice may increase not only the risk of bleeding due to poor management of thrombocytopenia as the corticosteroid dose is tapered but also the risk of adverse events associated with prolonged exposure to corticosteroids, such as weight gain, diabetes, osteoporosis, cataracts, and infections.

Patients with ITP already experience a high burden of disease; thus, best efforts should be made to provide treatment options that do not augment the overall burden. Inadequate management of thrombocytopenia may cause emergencies that exacerbate a patient's fear of bleeding. Hospitalizations for emergencies or infusion treatments may also impact the patient's day-to-day functioning and be disruptive for work or school. Adverse events associated with corticosteroids are particularly burdensome. Brown et al. reported that nearly all patients who received corticosteroids experienced adverse events, highlighting the need for careful management of treatment duration.

### Doptelet [^1168PtTA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Use the lowest dose of Doptelet needed to achieve and maintain a platelet count greater than or equal to 50×10⁹/L to reduce the risk of bleeding. Dose adjustments are based on platelet count response. Do not use Doptelet to normalize platelet counts.
- **Initial dose regimen**: Begin Doptelet at a starting dose of 20 mg (1 tablet) once daily with food.
- **Monitoring**: After initiating therapy with Doptelet, assess platelet counts weekly until a stable platelet count greater than or equal to 50×10⁹/L has been achieved, and then obtain platelet counts monthly thereafter. Obtain platelet counts weekly for at least 4 weeks following the discontinuation of Doptelet. Dose adjustments are based on the platelet count response. Do not exceed a daily dose of 40 mg (2 tablets).

*Initial dose regimen applies to all patients except those taking moderate or strong dual inducers or moderate or strong dual inhibitors of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4.

In the case of a missed dose, patients should take the missed dose of Doptelet as soon as they remember. Patients should not take two doses at once to make up for a missed dose and should continue with the next dose per the regimen.
- **Discontinuation**: Discontinue Doptelet if the platelet count does not increase to greater than or equal to 50×10⁹/L after 4 weeks of dosing.

### Management of newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia: Can we change outcomes [^115cE4iR]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia resulting from antibody-mediated platelet destruction combined with impaired platelet production is a common cause of thrombocytopenia. The decision to treat newly diagnosed patients is based on several factors, including ceasing hemorrhagic manifestations, increasing the platelet count, preventing bleeding, and inducing remission.

Standard first-line therapy is a course of corticosteroids. Although this treatment paradigm increases the platelet count in the majority of patients, a high percentage relapse after discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy. For this reason, intensification of first-line therapy that results in superior long-term remission rates would be desirable.

This manuscript focuses primarily on adults with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), highlighting pediatric data and practice when applicable. The primary aim is to outline upfront strategies for treatment-naive patients with ITP to enhance remission rates, taking into account the assessment of the risks and benefits of these approaches.

### Efficacy and safety of treatments in newly diagnosed adult primary immune thrombocytopenia: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1111QdM5]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disease characterized by a decreased platelet count and an increased tendency for bleeding due to excessive platelet destruction and/or insufficient platelet production. The incidence of ITP is 3.3 per 100,000 adults per year, with a prevalence of 9.5 per 100,000 adults. The majority of patients are asymptomatic or experience only mild mucocutaneous hemorrhage, while about 5% of patients may suffer from lethal bleeding such as intracranial hemorrhage.

Since the first International Consensus Report on ITP released in 2008, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and Rho(D) immune globulin (Anti-D) have been listed as the first-line treatments. As the initial choice and most frequently used therapy, corticosteroids are recommended by the American Society of Hematology (ASH) for adults with newly diagnosed ITP (< 3 months) and a platelet count of < 30 × 10⁹/L, whether bleeding or not. Approximately 80% of patients with ITP respond to corticosteroids, but over 50% relapse after the steroids taper off. Over the last two decades, numerous investigations into the pathogenesis further emphasize the heterogeneity and complications of ITP.

In recent years, several novel drugs such as rituximab and thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs), including romiplostim, eltrombopag, and avatrombopag, have been developed and applied in the management of ITP. Moreover, scientists and clinicians have repurposed some readily available drugs based on updates on the pathogenesis of ITP, such as all-trans retinoic acid, tacrolimus, and oseltamivir.

### Rituximab in the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia: What is the role of this agent in 2019 [^117EyEcy]. Haematologica (2019). Low credibility.

In conclusion, based on what has been published in the last 20 years, it is still difficult to give clear indications on when, to whom, and how rituximab should be administered. In 2019, the choice of rituximab over other treatment options has to be weighed considering the individual patient's features and expectations, the disease's characteristics, the availability of the drug, and the single center's experience.

The authors of this review think that rituximab still represents a valuable therapeutic option for patients with ITP and, based on knowledge, believe that it should be considered especially (although not exclusively) at an early stage of the disease as second- or third-line therapy, in young patients (particularly young women) and in patients treated with curative purposes.

### Systematic literature review of treatments used for adult immune thrombocytopenia in the second-line setting [^116THFqQ]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Low credibility.

Although not formally studied as a treatment arm in any prospective RCT, splenectomy is widely covered in the literature. Importantly, it is still generally recommended as the standard therapy for patients with chronic ITP, given the high probability of durable platelet response. However, this invasive surgical procedure is not without risk; perioperative, short-term, and long-term postoperative complications, such as infections, thromboembolic events, and increased risk of certain malignancies — including buccal, esophageal, colon, liver, pancreatic, lung, prostate, and hematopoietic cancers — have been observed.

Additionally, there is currently no ability to reliably predict who will respond, and there is evidence that a portion of non-splenectomized patients will experience late remissions either spontaneously or with continuing medical treatment. Due to these issues and because of the availability of medical alternatives, splenectomy may not be the "go-to" treatment it once was for patients requiring second-line therapy, as evidenced by recent temporal trends in the uptake of splenectomy. For example, in a study conducted in Denmark, the 1-year cumulative incidence of splenectomy among patients with ITP for a duration of at least 6 months decreased in recent years, from 10% for those diagnosed in 1996 through 2001 to 3% for those diagnosed in 2008 through 2012.

With fewer patients undergoing splenectomy in the second-line setting, there is a need to further investigate the potential for medical treatments to delay or obviate the necessity for splenectomy.

### Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management [^113Y8WVM]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP) can be triggered by a wide range of medications. Although many cases of DITP are mild, some are characterized by life-threatening bleeding symptoms. The pathogenesis of DITP is complex, as at least six different mechanisms have been proposed by which drug-induced antibodies can promote platelet destruction.

It is possible in many cases to identify antibodies that react with platelets in the presence of the sensitizing drug, but the required testing is technically demanding and not widely available. Therefore, a decision on whether to discontinue an implicated medication in a patient suspected of having DITP must be made on clinical grounds. An algorithm is available that can be helpful in assessing the likelihood that a particular drug caused thrombocytopenia, but the most important aspects of patient management are a high index of suspicion and a careful history of drug exposure in an individual who presents with acute, often severe thrombocytopenia of unknown etiology.

How drugs induce platelet-reactive antibodies and how, once formed, the antibodies cause platelet destruction following exposure to the drug is poorly understood. Further studies to address these issues and to characterize more completely the range of drugs and drug metabolites that can cause DITP are needed.

### Pathophysiology and management of chronic immune thrombocytopenia: Focusing on what matters [^114voZcX]. British Journal of Haematology (2011). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a common autoimmune disease characterized by low platelet counts and an increased risk of bleeding. Antibody-mediated platelet destruction has been the prevailing hypothesis to explain ITP pathogenesis, supported by the efficacy of B-cell depletion therapy; however, the recent success of thrombopoietin receptor agonists lends support to the notion that platelet production is also insufficient. Best practice for the management of chronic ITP has not yet been established because data from comparative trials are lacking. Despite renewed interest in novel drugs capable of increasing platelet counts, the ultimate treatment goals for ITP patients must be kept in mind: to improve patients' health and well-being.

In this article, the pathophysiology of ITP is reviewed and key remaining questions about the mechanism are explored. A rational approach to the management of ITP in adults is outlined, acknowledging evidence and evidence gaps, and highlighting the need for clinically important endpoints in future clinical trials.

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: Challenges and best practices [^113djX1u]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

In patients with immune thrombocytopenia who do not adequately respond to first-line therapy, there is no clear consensus on which second-line therapy to initiate and when. This situation leads to suboptimal approaches, including prolonged exposure to treatments that are not intended for long-term use (e.g. corticosteroids) and overuse of off-label therapies (e.g. rituximab) while approved, more efficacious options exist. These approaches may not only fail to address symptoms and the burden of disease but may also worsen health-related quality of life. A better understanding of available second-line treatments may ensure the best use of therapeutic options and thereby optimize patient outcomes.

### Lamotrigine and anti-seizure medications in HLH: A systematic review [^113u94dC]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

The majority of medication-associated HLH presented with initial symptoms, such as fever, skin rash, and cytopenias, within three weeks of drug initiation (19 of the 20 lamotrigine-associated cases and 6 of the 11 multidrug cases), with a median time of two weeks. In all cases, the drug was discontinued upon recognition of DIHS or HLH.

- **Treatment regimens**: The most common treatments included the HLH-1994 chemotherapy protocol with etoposide and dexamethasone or other steroids (12 cases), high-dose corticosteroids only (12 cases), or in combination with intravenous immunoglobulin (7 cases). Other adjunctive treatments included intrathecal methotrexate (2 cases), anakinra (1 case), emapalumab (1 case), hydroxychloroquine (1 case), and mycophenolate (1 case). In one case, only drug discontinuation and supportive management were employed.
- **Outcomes**: Outcomes were favorable, with 26 of the 31 cases achieving complete clinical resolution. Two had a chronic relapsing recurring course, and three patients died.

Seven of the 31 ASM-associated HLH cases also had probable or definite DIHS, with one additional case formally diagnosed as DIHS, though it met the possible range with a score of 3. An additional 12 of the 31 cases had a score of 2–3, meeting a diagnosis of possible DIHS. The most common overlapping features included fever, transaminitis, and a diffuse erythematous skin rash. Lamotrigine and other aromatic ASMs accounted for 18 of the 20 cases.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^111TT4vg]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a complicated disease due to its heterogeneity and lack of diagnostic markers, making treatment selection difficult. Perhaps the most straightforward part of management is at the presentation of ITP. If the platelet count is very low and no other findings are present, the worldwide consensus treatment is steroids. Whether dexamethasone, prednisone/prednisolone (prednis[ol]one), or intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone is used, the response rate and side effects are relatively predictable. IV methylprednisolone or dexamethasone increases platelet counts faster and may have fewer side effects than weeks of prednis(ol)one treatment. Questions revolve around whether to add IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) and/or platelet transfusion. While the latter is rarely appropriate, if there is serious bleeding and/or the diagnosis is unclear, an analysis based on medical records in the United States identified that as many as 25% of ITP patients receive platelet transfusion, which is far too many.
- **Management complexities**: The management of ITP becomes more complicated if other findings arise, if patients do not respond to steroids, or if patients continue to require treatment. Both the American Society of Hematology guidelines and an international consensus report emphasize that continued steroid use beyond six weeks is to be avoided. Compliance with this strong recommendation entails earlier use of "second-line" therapy in patients with ITP, a practice already gaining traction. However, the definition of "early" remains fluid; "early" can be at one month of steroid treatment.

### Updated international consensus report on the investigation and management of primary immune thrombocytopenia [^117VSebh]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy, specifically concerning the fetus/neonate, the International Consensus Report (ICR) 2019 guidelines recommend administering intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and limited corticosteroids to maintain a platelet count greater than 100×10⁹/L for one week, if possible, and greater than 50×10⁹/L for another week in neonates with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). It is important to recognize that the use of platelet transfusion may increase neonatal risk.

### Refractory immune thrombocytopenia in adults: Towards a new definition [^114yhQbP]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune haematological disorder characterized by immune-mediated thrombocytopenia and a variable risk of bleeding. Despite the availability of multiple treatment options, some patients are considered refractory since they do not achieve a platelet count response to multiple treatments and are at risk of bleeding. The term 'refractory' has been used to identify this patient group; however, with the advent of multiple lines of treatment, its meaning has become ambiguous.

To address this issue, we reviewed previous definitions of refractory ITP, solicited the views of ITP experts, and collected data from registries to inform a definition. Twenty ITP experts who attended the 7th Expert Meeting of the Intercontinental Cooperative ITP Study Group in September 2022 answered a web-based survey; 95% felt that there was a need for a new definition of refractory ITP for clinical and research purposes. The use of the term refractory, accompanied by a clear indication of the type and timing of failed treatments, was supported by 85% of respondents.

Preliminary data on the frequency of refractory patients from the McMaster and Norwegian ITP registries demonstrated that the proportion of adult ITP patients who had failed first-line therapy, rituximab, thrombopoietin receptor agonists, any immune suppressant medication, and splenectomy ranged from 0.4% to 3.8%. We propose a definition of refractory ITP that could be evaluated in future studies.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^115HRcaT]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

- **A young female patient with immune thrombocytopenia: Second-line treatment options**: A 20-year-old female returns home from college. She notes heavier periods and easy bruising. Her internist observes that she is pale and has visible petechiae on her arms. Complete blood counts show mild anemia (hemoglobin 10.2 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 5 × 10⁹/L. Concerned about possible leukemia, the internist urgently sends her to the emergency room. There is no hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, or other abnormal findings on physical examination.

	- A review of a peripheral blood smear reveals no blasts or abnormalities of other cell lines, although her mean corpuscular volume is low (72 fL), and several of her few platelets are large. She is diagnosed with ITP and given prednisone 1 mg/kg. Over the next few days, she experiences typical steroid-related side effects, such as feeling "a little crazy", insomnia, and abdominal pain. Her bruises and petechiae disappear, and her period ends. Her hematologist prescribes oral iron supplements and changes her prednisone to dexamethasone 40 mg daily for 4 days. Her steroid-related side effects worsen during the 4 days on dexamethasone 40 mg; however, she soon feels better with no further petechiae, bruising, or menstrual bleeding noted. Her platelet count normalizes to 147×10⁹/L, and her hemoglobin improves to 11.2 g/dL. She begins checking her blood counts monthly. The improved complete blood count with a nearly normal mean corpuscular volume excludes bone marrow failure and also thalassemia.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^111d3nJz]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

What would we have liked to offer our two patients with immune thrombocytopenia? First, it would have been beneficial to predict their course, including factors such as the risk of bleeding, the likelihood of chronicity, which treatments would be most effective, and which would be most toxic.

Second, we would have preferred to provide a curative but non-toxic treatment. We discussed using rituximab in a younger woman due to the good likelihood of cure in a patient of this age and gender. However, in other patients, the likelihood of cure is very low, and vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 posed a problem for her. This leaves splenectomy as an option, which is remarkably effective. Recent studies suggest that splenectomy remains effective even in patients who have been treated with thrombopoietin agents. Why are patients so unwilling to undergo splenectomy? The primary reasons may be the uncertainty of spontaneous recovery, the success of the splenectomy, and its irreversibility. Additionally, the post-splenectomy risks of sepsis and thrombosis continue lifelong.

In the future, using combinations of agents — such as dexamethasone and rituximab, steroids and mycophenolate mofetil, or dexamethasone and eltrombopag — within one week of diagnosis may provide a higher level of cure and justify the extra expense and higher risks of these interventions.

Finally, treatment selection could be more rational with data from randomized, controlled trials comparing different agents and regimens.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^116reRJY]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

This article summarizes our approach to the diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), its secondary forms, and the choice of second-line treatment options. We briefly summarize first-line treatment and then utilize a case-based approach. We first explore persistent, chronic ITP in a younger female, considering possibilities beyond primary ITP, such as hypogammaglobulinemia, chronic infection, and anemia, and how to approach their diagnosis and management. The journey continues throughout pregnancy and the post-partum period and eventually includes fourth-line treatment following a late relapse.

We then consider an older male, emphasizing differences in diagnostic considerations and management. The focus is on the initiation and continuation of second-line treatment, the pros and cons of each option, and briefly, the impact of treatment choices related to the endemic presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. During the review of potential second-line treatment options, we also briefly touch upon novel treatments. Finally, there is a short section on refractory disease drawn from our previous extensive review published in February 2020. The clinical nature of the discussions, replete with figures and tables and interspersed with insights regarding efficacy and toxicity at different ages and genders, will assist the reader in the management of typical adult patients who develop persistent and chronic ITP.

### Cryptic conspirators: A conversation about thrombocytopenia and antiphospholipid syndrome [^112noEUs]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

What therapies are available for antiphospholipid syndrome patients with immune-mediated thrombocytopenia?

When ITP-like physiology is considered, therapy is generally initiated once the platelet count falls below 30,000/μl. For a comprehensive review of this topic, we refer the reader to the guidelines of the American Society of Hematology. It should be noted that these guidelines do not discuss APS beyond recommending that aPL testing not be routinely obtained in patients with idiopathic ITP. We would argue that this rule may be less applicable to the rheumatology clinician.

Given the absence of specific literature for the management of immune thrombocytopenia in APS, treatment recommendations for severe thrombocytopenia have typically been adapted from ITP guidelines. First-line treatment traditionally consists of corticosteroids and/or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). However, as thrombotic events are a potential adverse effect of IVIG, it is unclear if this therapy should be considered first-line in APS. Although very few studies have specifically investigated the safety of IVIG in APS, a recent case series reported on nine patients with autoimmune disease who received IVIG and developed thromboembolic disease, including two patients with secondary APS.

Based on relatively good success with rituximab (anti-CD20) in ITP — generally, a 60% response rate including 40% of patients developing complete response — there has recently been enthusiasm for its use in treating thrombocytopenia in APS.

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: Challenges and best practices [^114CLeMg]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

The risks and benefits of all second-line management options should be discussed with the patient before making a treatment decision. The approach to selecting optimal second and subsequent lines of treatment for patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is crucial.
- **Approach to selection of second-line treatment of ITP**: Clinicians should make individualized treatment decisions that take into account the patient's comorbidities, lifestyle, and personal values and preferences. For most patients who have had ITP for more than 1 year, thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) should be considered in the second-line setting. Splenectomy is also an important option for eligible patients who prefer surgical treatment. It is imperative to inform the patient of the long-term risks of splenectomy, which might require lifelong medical attention, including delayed relapse, infection, thromboembolism, and possibly cancer. The possibility of long-term remission or treatment holidays with TPO-RAs or rituximab should be discussed with the patient.

It is important to clarify that these medications are neither intended nor confirmed to cure the disease, and that the possibility of a long-term platelet response after discontinuation of therapy is much higher with splenectomy. For patients who have had ITP for less than 1 year, TPO-RAs remain a viable option regardless of age and gender. For adult women who have had ITP for less than 1 year, rituximab in combination with high doses is also considered an option, though the text is cut off mentioning specifics.

### Refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura: current strategies for investigation and management [^116qoLKU]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

There is currently no consensus on how best to manage refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). In part, this reflects the need for individualized treatment due to the wide spectrum of patients' requirements and responsiveness to therapies. The objective of this review is to provide a clinically useful guide to management strategies. This article suggests investigations to identify factors that may exacerbate thrombocytopenia and underlie poor therapeutic responses, and highlights emerging therapies, including thrombopoietic agents, which are anticipated to dramatically alter the natural history of "refractory" ITP. Morbidity, mortality, and health-related quality of life are also discussed.

### Promacta [^116eFi4d]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Persistent or chronic immune thrombocytopenia**: Use the lowest dose of Promacta to achieve and maintain a platelet count greater than or equal to 50 × 10⁹/L as necessary to reduce the risk for bleeding. Dose adjustments are based upon the platelet count response. Do not use Promacta to normalize platelet counts [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. In clinical trials, platelet counts generally increased within 1 to 2 weeks after starting Promacta and decreased within 1 to 2 weeks after discontinuing Promacta [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].
- **Initial dose regimen**: Adult and pediatric patients 6 years and older with ITP: Initiate Promacta at a dose of 50 mg once daily, except in patients who are of East-/Southeast-Asian ancestry or who have mild to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A, B, C).

	- For patients of East-/Southeast-Asian ancestry with ITP, initiate Promacta at a reduced dose of 25 mg once daily [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

	- For patients with ITP and mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A, B, C), initiate Promacta at a reduced dose of 25 mg once daily [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Characterization of drug-specific T cells in lamotrigine hypersensitivity [^111cidCJ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Lamotrigine is associated with hypersensitivity reactions, most commonly characterized by skin rash. An immune etiology has been postulated, though its nature remains unclear.
- **Objectives**: The aim of this study was to characterize the role of T cells in lamotrigine hypersensitivity.
- **Methods**: A lymphocyte transformation test was performed on four hypersensitive patients. Lymphocytes from three of four lamotrigine-hypersensitive patients proliferated when stimulated with lamotrigine. T-cell clones were generated from one patient to further characterize the nature of the T-cell involvement. Cells were characterized in terms of their phenotype, functionality, and mechanisms of antigen presentation and cytotoxicity.
- **Results**: Of the 44 drug-specific T-cell clones generated, most were CD4(+) with occasional CD8(+) cells. All clones expressed the alphabeta T-cell receptor; several Vbeta 5.1(+) or 9(+) T-cell clones were generated. All clones also expressed the skin-homing receptor cutaneous lymphocyte antigen. Lamotrigine-stimulated T cells were cytotoxic and secreted perforin, IFN-gamma, IL-5, macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta, RANTES, and I-309. Lamotrigine was presented on HLA-DR and HLA-DQ by antigen-presenting cells in the absence of drug metabolism and processing. The T-cell receptor of certain clones could accommodate analogs of lamotrigine, but no cross-reactivity was seen with other anticonvulsants.
- **Conclusions**: Our data provide evidence that T cells are involved in the pathogenesis of some lamotrigine hypersensitivity cases.

Previously published guidelines for the diagnosis and management of primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) require updating largely due to the introduction of new classes of therapeutic agents and a greater understanding of the disease pathophysiology. However, treatment-related decisions still remain principally dependent on clinical expertise or patient preference rather than high-quality clinical trial evidence. This consensus document aims to report on new data and provide consensus-based recommendations relating to the diagnosis and treatment of ITP in adults, in children, and during pregnancy. The inclusion of summary tables within this document, supported by information tables in the online appendices, is intended to aid in clinical decision making.

### Efficacy and safety of dapsone in adult primary immune thrombocytopenia [^115Emnv6]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

These results show that the place of dapsone as a second-line treatment for primary adult ITP is more limited than previously assessed in retrospective studies. Dapsone remains an affordable option, which might be useful for a subset of patients with ITP, potentially with nonsevere persistent ITP. In countries where other treatments for ITP are approved and readily available, its use should be restricted.

### Lamotrigine and anti-seizure medications in HLH: A systematic review [^115XZga1]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Low credibility.

Lamotrigine and other anti-seizure medications have been reported to cause both haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS). HLH and DIHS have many characteristic clinical, laboratory, and pathological findings and underlying mechanisms; we identified significant clinical overlap between these two syndromes in our systematic review. Of note, the presence of haemophagocytosis on bone marrow biopsy, while supportive, is not exclusive to or synonymous with a diagnosis of HLH.

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: Challenges and best practices [^114Zx88e]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) are conventionally considered lifelong therapies that need to be used continuously to maintain response. However, accumulating data suggest that some patients who use TPO-RAs may achieve long-term remissions that are sustained off treatment. Although randomized, placebo-controlled, long-term studies that would directly demonstrate the remission-inducing potential of TPO-RAs are not available, it appears unlikely that remissions observed in the TPO-RA discontinuation studies are purely spontaneous. Earlier studies showed that the rate of spontaneous remissions in adult patients is only about 9%, while the overall rate of long-term (≥ 6 months) remission in TPO-RA studies is nearly 30%.

Spontaneous remissions are less frequent following the first year after diagnosis, but most patients who achieved remission in TPO-RA studies had immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) for over one year, and some had been living with ITP for much longer (up to 54 years). The authors speculated that this putative disease-modifying activity of TPO-RAs could be linked to the TPO-RA–mediated restoration of impaired regulatory T-cell function and immune tolerance that was observed in patients with ITP.

### State of the art - how I manage immune thrombocytopenia [^116pGhdm]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

The management of patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is rapidly evolving. Over the last 15 years, a number of novel treatments have improved practice, with many steroid-sparing agents and a reduction in the progression to splenectomy. Although this has improved clinical care, many therapeutic challenges remain. There is no diagnostic test, no biomarkers to direct treatment, and few comparative studies to help management decisions.

The development of up-to-date guidelines is difficult due to limited high-grade evidence. First-line treatment continues to be steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), although both are often poorly tolerated and not curative. Common second-line treatments include rituximab, immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil, and the thrombopoietin receptor agonists romiplostim and eltrombopag. There are no comparative studies to decide between these agents, and treatment is generally individualized, depending on comorbidity.

Use of splenectomy has declined and is generally reserved for patients with chronic disease, although the exact position of splenectomy is subject to debate. Further understanding of the cause of disease in individual patients may help guide treatment. Randomized controlled studies of common treatments and novel treatments for refractory patients are urgently needed.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^115rnTag]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

What if none of the obvious options, such as thrombopoietin agents, rituximab, or splenectomy, helps and no single treatment, including fostamatinib and mycophenolate mofetil, is effective?

It is difficult to predict what approach will be effective in these "refractory" patients. If a patient has been on too low a dose or for too short a period, it may not be clear that a given medication will not be helpful.
- **Major principles**: The approach to difficult-to-treat patients, such as these examples, is discussed at great length in our review of refractory ITP and in another recent review.
	- Spend time reconfirming the diagnosis; reconsider all options if the response to treatments of ITP is absent or very limited.
	- Do a complete bone marrow examination, unless one was performed recently, with aspirate, biopsy, flow cytometry, and cytogenetics.
	- If a treatment is ineffective, continue the treatment and add another treatment, initiating combination therapy. In our opinion, this is preferable to discontinuing the ineffective treatment and starting another one.
	- If indeed the case is refractory ITP, combination approaches are often better than single treatments. Including treatments with different mechanisms of effect is useful; however, there are situations in which two agents targeting the same mechanism are effective, such as combining IVIG and IV anti-D.
	- When using combination treatments, it would be ideal to not give maximum doses and to select agents with differing toxicities. If an adverse event requiring a change in treatment occurs, it is then easier to choose.

### Cost-effectiveness of second-line therapies in adults with chronic immune thrombocytopenia [^114FXNRH]. American Journal of Hematology (2023). High credibility.

We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis from a healthcare sector perspective. Both cost and health outcomes were appropriately discounted by 3% annually. We measured the cost-effectiveness of the treatment strategies considered by estimating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), representing the difference in total costs divided by the difference in effectiveness associated with each pairing of the six treatment sequences considered.

We started by ordering the strategies by their costs in ascending order. Next, we identified and excluded strongly and weakly dominated strategies. A treatment strategy was deemed strongly dominated when, by definition, it was associated with higher costs and fewer QALYs relative to the next less costly strategy. A treatment strategy was deemed weakly dominated when, by definition, a combination of two alternative strategies was associated with improved costs and benefits.

Finally, we determined a cost-effective strategy using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $195,300 per QALY, derived from the 2019 per capita U.S. gross domestic product, as previously reported. We also report the net monetary benefit of each strategy. The net monetary benefit is calculated by multiplying the effectiveness in QALYs by the willingness-to-pay and subtracting the cost of the given strategy.

### Identifying and treating refractory ITP: Difficulty in diagnosis and role of combination treatment [^1142de7f]. Blood (2020). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is the most common acquired thrombocytopenia after chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. Existing guidelines describe the management and treatment for most patients, who generally do well even if they present with chronic disease, and they are usually not at high risk for bleeding. However, a small percentage of patients are refractory and difficult to manage. Patients classified as refractory either do not actually have ITP or have a form of the disease that is difficult to manage. ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion, as no specific tests exist to confirm the diagnosis. Response to treatment is the only affirmative confirmation, but refractory patients do not respond to front-line or other treatments, leaving the diagnosis unconfirmed.
- **Diagnostic considerations**: The first section of this review carefully evaluates the diagnostic considerations in patients with refractory ITP.
- **Combination treatment**: The second section describes combination treatment for refractory ITP cases. The reported combinations are divided into the era before thrombopoietin (TPO) and rituximab and the current era, showing increased effectiveness. However, the definition of refractory — which includes insufficient response to TPO agents — describes a group with more severe and difficult-to-treat disease. The biology of refractory ITP is largely unexplored and includes oligoclonality, lymphocyte pumps, and other possibilities. Newer treatments, especially rapamycin, fostamatinib, FcRn, and BTK inhibitors, may be useful components of future therapy given their mechanisms of action.

- **Immune thrombocytopenia in pregnancy**: Years later, our patient becomes pregnant. What are the treatment considerations for our patient during pregnancy?

As ITP is common in women of reproductive age, it is not surprising that it may complicate the course of pregnancy. For pregnant women with known ITP, management changes throughout the course of pregnancy. Figure 1 reviews treatment options available during each trimester, leading up to delivery and the post-partum period. In the first trimester of pregnancy, platelet counts may spontaneously increase, apparently because of the increased progestational hormones in the first trimester. For this reason, relatively few women with ITP require treatment in the first trimester, which is fortunate from a teratogenic point of view. The risk of cleft palate from steroid use in the first trimester appears to be small.

In the second and especially third trimesters, platelet counts decrease even in healthy women without ITP, resulting in "gestational" thrombocytopenia. Three large series suggest that the prevalence of gestational thrombocytopenia at the end of pregnancy is between 6.6% and 11.6%. This has been attributed to the increased volume of distribution in the later stages of pregnancy as well as "consumption". Recently, work from China presented at the 2021 European Hematology Association Congress hypothesized that very high estradiol levels towards the end of pregnancy inhibit platelet production. While requiring confirmation, this hypothesis fits with both falling platelet counts and cases of ITP in pregnancy becoming prog.

### Markers of refractory primary immune thrombocytopenia [^112XrQD4]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Low credibility.

Refractory immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a challenging disease characterized by refractoriness to second-line treatments. This review discusses the clinical and biological factors associated with refractoriness to various treatments, such as splenectomy, thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs), rituximab, and fostamatinib. Moreover, it explores factors linked with multirefractory ITP, defined as active disease with failure of rituximab, TPO-RAs, and splenectomy.

### The American Society of Hematology 2011 evidence-based practice guideline for immune thrombocytopenia [^116Qk9D1]. Blood (2011). High credibility.

When managing specific circumstances in immune thrombocytopenia, such as in patients with active hemorrhage, the ASH 2011 guidelines recommend considering the use of IVIG in combination with corticosteroids. This approach aims to maximize the possibility of a rapid increase in platelet count in patients experiencing active hemorrhage.

Other immunomodulators

Previously, immunomodulatory agents were widely used as second-line treatments, but drawbacks included the need to wait 1–3 months for the platelet count to increase, side effects such as hepatic toxicity (depending on the agent), and the requirement for consistent, long-term medication use. If a single agent is used, the risk of infection, despite immunosuppression, seems very small; however, the efficacy of these agents is less than 50%. This group is often treated as if all agents are equivalent, potentially including mycophenolate mofetil, danazol, dapsone, azathioprine, cyclosporine, and cyclophosphamide.

Recently, a randomized controlled trial of steroids, given with or without mycophenolate mofetil within one week of the diagnosis of ITP, showed a higher "cure" rate in the combination arm. One surprise was that the quality of life was significantly lower among patients treated with the combination, despite having a better platelet response. Another surprise was that more than 50% of patients in the steroid-alone arm were cured despite a low rate of dexamethasone usage, and 27% of the patients were over 65 years of age. The study nonetheless highlighted the potential advantage of earlier use of second-line treatment.

There are at least 20 studies of danazol, almost all demonstrating a positive effect on platelet counts. This drug induces facial hair and acne and may be toxic to the liver. Dapsone, beyond its immunosuppressive effect, induces hemolysis, which mimics IV anti-D in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.

- **Third-line therapy for immune thrombocytopenia and beyond**: What happens if the thrombopoietin agent used in the two patients does not work or cannot be tapered?

	- In the case of the young woman, her platelet count remained less than 20 × 10⁹/L, and she experienced heavy menses, bruising, and nosebleeds. The now 26-year-old woman opted for rituximab. She had a long-term response but unfortunately relapsed after four years. She considered repeating rituximab and undergoing splenectomy but chose to try a different thrombopoietin agent since she was not planning another pregnancy in the immediate future. She previously used eltrombopag, so she tried avatrombopag. On a dose of 20 mg/day, she was able to maintain an adequate platelet count and is very slowly tapering her dose. This choice was consistent with evidence suggesting that not responding well to one TPO-RA does not preclude a good response to another.

	- Our older male patient, given his continued bruising and minor nosebleeds, was afraid of major bleeding; he also felt very tired even though he was not anemic. The now 64-year-old man opted to try rituximab since avatrombopag did not work well for him. He received the standard dose of rituximab with dexamethasone. He responded with a platelet count of 60 × 10⁹/L six weeks after initiating treatment. However, his count started to fall monthly to 30 × 10⁹/L. He and his doctor decided to initiate mycophenolate mofetil, beginning with a dose of 500 mg twice daily and then increasing to 1000 mg twice daily. He tolerates this treatment well.

### Systematic literature review of treatments used for adult immune thrombocytopenia in the second-line setting [^112rVA9g]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Low credibility.

Since the publication of this systematic review, the management of ITP has evolved. Treatment decisions are now guided not only by platelet counts but also by a combination of factors, including platelet levels, shared decision-making between the physician and the patient, and patient-specific factors such as insurance coverage, lifestyle, history of bleeding, occupation, comorbidities, and expectations. Thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-RAs), such as eltrombopag and romiplostim, have entered the market following rigorous randomized trials in both splenectomized and non-splenectomized patients with persistent or chronic ITP. Additionally, the incidence of splenectomy has declined in recent years.

Despite these developments and trends, the International Consensus Report on the management of primary ITP, released in 2010, still lists medical treatment options in the second-line setting in alphabetical order to avoid indicating a preference for a specific treatment, which underscores the lack of sufficient data to rank the treatments by efficacy. Similarly, shortly after the publication of this report, the American Society of Hematology (ASH) published practice guidelines for ITP, concluding that there is no evidence to guide a sequence of treatment for patients who have persistent thrombocytopenia with bleeding after first-line treatment with corticosteroids, IVIg, or anti-D.

Indeed, clinical decision-making on optimal second-line ITP treatment is challenging and has been described as controversial.

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: Challenges and best practices [^111TE1pw]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) experience a high disease burden, making it essential to offer management options that enhance their quality of life. Treatment options should align with the personal preferences and lifestyle of the patient. For instance, some patients may prefer oral treatments taken once a day, while others might favor injections administered less frequently. Additionally, splenectomy could be the most desirable option for patients aiming to reduce their medication and monitoring needs.

An in-depth understanding of second-line treatment options is crucial for optimizing ITP management and patient outcomes by ensuring the best use of available therapeutic options.

### Contemporary management of primary immune thrombocytopenia in adults [^113mhdD2]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2012). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) comprises a syndrome of diverse disorders that have in common immune-mediated thrombocytopenia but differ with respect to pathogenesis, natural history, and response to therapy. ITP may occur in the absence of an evident predisposing etiology (primary ITP) or as a sequela of a growing list of associated conditions (secondary ITP). Primary ITP remains a diagnosis of exclusion and must be differentiated from non-autoimmune etiologies of thrombocytopenia and secondary causes of ITP.

The traditional objective of management is to provide a hemostatic platelet count (> 20–30 × 10⁹ L⁻¹ in most cases) while minimizing treatment-related toxicity. However, treatment goals should be tailored to the individual patient and clinical setting. Corticosteroids, supplemented with either intravenous immune globulin G or anti-Rh(D) as needed, are used as upfront therapy to stop bleeding and raise the platelet count acutely in patients with newly diagnosed or newly relapsed disease. Although most adults with primary ITP respond to first-line therapy, the majority relapse after treatment is tapered and require a second-line approach to maintain a hemostatic platelet count.

Standard second-line options include splenectomy, rituximab, and the thrombopoietin receptor agonists, romiplostim and eltrombopag. Studies that directly compare the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of these approaches are lacking. In the absence of such data, we do not favor a single second-line approach for all patients. Rather, we consider the pros and cons of each option.

### Identifying drugs that cause acute thrombocytopenia: an analysis using 3 distinct methods [^115DNAFT]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP) is often suspected in patients with acute thrombocytopenia that is unexplained by other causes, but documenting that a drug is the cause can be challenging. To provide a resource for the diagnosis of DITP and for drug safety surveillance, we analyzed three distinct methods for identifying drugs that may cause thrombocytopenia.
- **Published case reports**: DITP has been attributed to 253 drugs suspected of causing thrombocytopenia. Using defined clinical criteria, evidence identified 87 of these (34%) as causing thrombocytopenia.
- **Serum samples testing**: Serum samples from patients with suspected DITP were tested for 202 drugs. Drug-dependent, platelet-reactive antibodies were identified for 67 drugs (33%).
- **FDA's adverse event reporting system**: Data mining algorithms were used to search the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System database for drugs associated with thrombocytopenia. Of 1444 drugs with reported associations, 573 (40%) demonstrated a statistically distinctive reporting association with thrombocytopenia.

Among the 1468 drugs suspected of causing thrombocytopenia, 102 were evaluated by all three methods, and 23 of these had evidence for an association with thrombocytopenia by all methods. Multiple methods, each offering a distinct perspective, contribute significantly to identifying drugs that can cause thrombocytopenia.
