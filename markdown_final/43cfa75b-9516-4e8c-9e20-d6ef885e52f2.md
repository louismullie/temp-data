## Question

What laboratory tests and evaluation are recommended for poor nutrition?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what laboratory tests and overall evaluation are recommended for poor nutrition (malnutrition). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about universal screening with validated tools and where each tool fits best. Then, I should verify how to transition from screening to a comprehensive assessment that satisfies GLIM's phenotypic and etiologic criteria. Next, I will examine the precise role and limits of laboratory tests, including when CRP helps and why albumin should not be used diagnostically. After that, I will classify malnutrition by severity and etiology, tailor the approach to special populations, and set up a monitoring cadence. Finally, I will double-check that each step is congruent with consensus statements and high-credibility validations of GLIM and related guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the screening step before anything else, because missing risk at the front door undermines everything downstream. For hospitalized adults, NRS-2002 remains a high-grade tool; MUST, MNA-SF, and MST are also validated in varied settings, and in oncology, tools like PG-SGA or PG-SGA SF and MST have specific validated cut-points that I should respect rather than assume equivalence across populations and workflows, so I need to check that the chosen tool matches the clinical setting and re-screen at clinically meaningful intervals rather than as a one-off at admission [^117Fgfdd] [^113i7cuf] [^114wWZiD] [^114csJ1P].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions after a positive screen, because screening is not diagnosis; I should verify that a full nutrition assessment follows, using GLIM's two-step framework that requires at least one phenotypic plus one etiologic criterion to establish malnutrition and then grade its severity, which has been broadly validated and operationalized since its initial consensus publication and subsequent guidance documents [^113fbtQX] [^111PAW93].

> I will now examine the phenotypic side carefully. Let me check that non-volitional weight loss meets GLIM thresholds, that low BMI is considered in an age-appropriate way, and that reduced muscle mass is quantified with the best available method in the local context; when feasible, I should prioritize CT-derived L3 indices in oncologic or surgical cohorts, DXA, or BIA with population-specific equations, and when resources are limited, use anthropometry and a careful physical exam, while reminding myself that hand-grip strength assesses function after diagnosis and should not be used as a surrogate for mass in the diagnostic algorithm [^115xJmdZ] [^114HHeae] [^113nuxPu].

> Next, I should review the etiologic side and verify two domains: reduced intake or assimilation and the presence of disease burden or inflammation. Let me consider whether the clinical picture already establishes inflammation; if there is uncertainty, I should confirm with CRP and, where needed, repeat CRP to substantiate chronicity, but I need to remember GLIM's updated guidance explicitly states laboratory proof of inflammation is not always necessary when the disease context clearly implies it, so I must apply clinical judgment before ordering labs reflexively [^116WnfDX] [^1178xLbn].

> Wait, let me verify the precise role of laboratory testing, because there is a common pitfall here. Laboratory markers are ancillary, not primary diagnostic tools for undernutrition; CRP helps confirm inflammation when the clinical picture is equivocal, prealbumin may have a role in monitoring response if interpreted alongside CRP to separate inflammatory effects from nutrition effects, and routine labs like hemoglobin, creatinine, and RDW can contextualize disease burden and risk rather than diagnose malnutrition per se, which means I should avoid over-weighting biochemistry in the diagnostic step and prioritize clinical and body composition variables first [^112WsU7X] [^116kQyU5].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost leaned on serum albumin as a nutritional marker out of habit, but that would be a mistake; I should double-check the latest evidence. High-quality analyses show albumin is a negative acute-phase reactant that tracks illness severity and inflammation, not nutrition status, and it neither predicts the benefit from nutrition support nor reflects short-term nutrition repletion; it may be prognostic for mortality and complications, but it should not be used to diagnose malnutrition or to monitor response to nutrition therapy, so I need to correct that outdated reflex and rely on it only as a disease severity marker if used at all [^113rz2Vk] [^1124WPV8] [^116kQyU5].

> I will now synthesize the diagnosis using GLIM: if the patient fulfills at least one phenotypic criterion and at least one etiologic criterion, I should diagnose malnutrition and then grade severity by the magnitude of weight loss, degree of BMI reduction, and extent of muscle mass depletion; next, I should classify the etiology as starvation-related, chronic disease-related, or acute disease or injury-related, since that informs both prognosis and the aggressiveness and timing of nutrition intervention [^111PAW93] [^1178xLbn].

> But wait, what if the context demands population-specific nuance; I should verify tool selection and metrics accordingly. In oncology outpatients, I should use PG-SGA or similar validated tools and reassess monthly alongside body composition and inflammatory signals; in critical illness, early GLIM-based assessment is feasible and should be repeated given dynamic inflammation and catabolism; in geriatrics and dementia, regular weight monitoring and individualized assessment of eating behaviors are essential; in surgical pathways, preoperative risk identification with validated tools informs optimization; in IBD or other inflammatory diseases, initial labs for inflammation and anemia complement the clinical assessment; in tuberculosis programs, integrate anthropometry and hemoglobin at baseline with longitudinal weight monitoring as part of person-centered care [^114wWZiD] [^117Q3Vod] [^1175foEf] [^114csJ1P] [^1145wsgb] [^116kQyU5] [^114sUfGx].

> I need to ensure the monitoring cadence matches disease trajectory, so let me reconsider intervals and parameters. Inpatients generally warrant reassessment about weekly or with clinical change; many oncology programs target monthly reassessment; serial tracking should include weight and BMI, careful intake history with nutrition impact symptoms, functional measures such as hand-grip strength after diagnosis, and selective labs like CRP when inflammation status informs interpretation or treatment response, with prealbumin considered only for monitoring and always interpreted in parallel with CRP to avoid misattribution to nutrition status when inflammation is high [^116WnfDX] [^112WsU7X] [^11534jnP] [^115xJmdZ].

> To summarize and double-check alignment with consensus, the safest and most defensible pathway is to screen universally with a validated tool appropriate to the setting, proceed to a comprehensive GLIM-based assessment when screens are positive, use labs judiciously to clarify inflammation rather than to diagnose malnutrition, avoid albumin as a nutrition marker, classify malnutrition by severity and etiology, tailor implementation to the clinical population, and monitor serially to guide intervention effectiveness and detect deterioration, which is consistent with GLIM's framework and its broad validation across hundreds of studies and multiple international guidelines [^111PAW93] [^113nRFyZ].

For suspected malnutrition, use a **two-step approach** [^112RkrTY], first screening with a validated tool (NRS-2002, MUST, MST, or MNA-SF) to identify risk [^117Fgfdd] [^113i7cuf] [^114wWZiD], then confirming and grading severity with GLIM criteria (≥ 1 phenotypic plus ≥ 1 etiologic criterion) [^113fbtQX]. Do not use **albumin or prealbumin** to diagnose malnutrition; they reflect inflammation, not nutrition status [^113rz2Vk] [^116kQyU5] [^1124WPV8]. Instead, use CBC, CMP, CRP, and targeted micronutrients to identify deficiencies and **monitor refeeding risk** [^112xvnCD] [^112WsU7X]. Assess muscle mass with DXA, BIA, CT, or ultrasound, and use handgrip strength for function [^115xJmdZ] [^113nuxPu]. Reassess regularly and tailor interventions to the underlying cause and severity [^11534jnP].

## Recommended laboratory tests for malnutrition assessment

Laboratory tests identify deficiencies, monitor refeeding risk, and guide therapy, but **no single test diagnoses malnutrition** [^116kQyU5] [^112WsU7X].

| **Laboratory test** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| Complete blood count (CBC) | Detects anemia, infection, inflammation |
| Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) | Assesses electrolytes, renal/hepatic function, glucose |
| C-reactive protein (CRP) | Indicates inflammation; interpret nutrition markers accordingly [^112WsU7X] |
| Serum albumin and prealbumin | Reflect inflammation/disease severity, not nutrition status [^113rv9gM] [^113rz2Vk] [^116kQyU5] |
| Serum transferrin | Iron status; limited by inflammation |
| Serum ferritin | Iron stores; acute-phase reactant |
| Serum vitamin B12, folate, vitamin D | Identify specific deficiencies |
| Serum zinc, copper, selenium | Identify trace element deficiencies |
| Serum phosphate, magnesium, potassium | Monitor for refeeding syndrome risk [^116kQyU5] |

## Clinical assessment tools and criteria

Clinical tools complement labs by evaluating intake, weight change, and body composition, and **GLIM provides a standardized diagnosis** [^111PAW93].

- **GLIM criteria**: Requires ≥ 1 phenotypic (weight loss, low BMI, reduced muscle mass) and ≥ 1 etiologic (reduced intake/assimilation, inflammation) criterion [^112RkrTY] [^111H6dRb].
- **Subjective global assessment (SGA)**: Integrates history and exam to classify nutrition status [^114y8UH7].
- **Patient-generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA)**: Adds patient input, useful in oncology [^114y8UH7].
- **Handgrip strength**: Assesses function; not a surrogate for muscle mass [^113nuxPu] [^115xJmdZ].

---

## Recommended screening tools

Validated screening tools quickly identify risk and trigger assessment; **choose tools based on setting and population** [^113YzkwZ].

| **Screening tool** | **Population/setting** | **Clinical application** |
|-|-|-|
| Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) | Hospitalized adults | Identifies risk; guides intervention [^114wWZiD] [^117Fgfdd] [^113i7cuf] |
| Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) | Adults, community/hospital | Assesses risk; guides intervention [^113i7cuf] [^114wWZiD] |
| Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF) | Older adults | Screens risk; guides intervention [^1171ubdh] |
| Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST) | Oncology outpatients | Screens risk; guides intervention [^114wWZiD] [^112yPuNP] |

---

## Frequency of reassessment

Regular reassessment tracks changes and guides care; **the frequency depends on setting and risk** [^11534jnP] [^115jQxwi].

- **Hospitalized patients**: Reassess every 3–7 days or with clinical change.
- **Outpatients**: Reassess every 1–3 months or with clinical change [^11534jnP].
- **Critically ill patients**: Reassess daily or with clinical change.

---

## Clinical implications of malnutrition

Malnutrition increases complications, length of stay, and mortality, and **early identification improves outcomes** [^112WsU7X] [^117Fgfdd].

- **Increased complications**: Higher infection and complication rates [^113rz2Vk] [^112WsU7X].
- **Longer hospital stay**: Prolonged LOS and higher costs [^114cNDx7].
- **Higher mortality**: Increased short- and long-term mortality [^1171ubdh] [^112WsU7X].

---

## Conclusion

A structured approach — screening, assessment, and targeted labs — is essential for accurate diagnosis and management [^111PAW93]. Early **identification and intervention** reduce complications, LOS, and mortality, improving patient outcomes [^112WsU7X] [^113rz2Vk] [^114cNDx7].

Biochemical markers

In the past, serum albumin (Alb) was used as a nutritional indicator, but today we know that it leads to erroneous conclusions for two reasons. Firstly, it has a relatively long half-life (about 20 days), and secondly, its values are also impacted by the existence of inflammation. Alb is a potent alternative measure for underlying disease burden because inflammation is a prominent factor in the development of protein-energy undernutrition (PEU) through its impact on dietary intake, protein use, and net protein catabolism. It is well known that acute injury can significantly decrease Alb levels within 24 hours; therefore, Alb reflects the severity of disease but is not a direct measure of malnutrition. However, the concentrations of Alb and serum prealbumin are used as indicators of nutritional status, albeit with limited sensitivity. Nevertheless, they are recommended by ESPEN as prognostic tools for complications and for use in surgical patients.

Other biochemical markers include elevated C-reactive protein, high white blood cell count, and excessive blood glucose levels.

- **Clinical signs**: Clinical signs of inflammation may appear, including fever, hypothermia, or tachycardia, which may facilitate a causatively based diagnosis.

- **Subjective professional assessment**: This is a screening process that can detect malnutrition when performed by experienced specialists. Hand grip strength should be used to document the reduction in physical function.

Specific malnutrition evaluation indices have not been clearly defined, which complicates drawing safe conclusions about a patient's degree of malnutrition.

### Glim criteria for the diagnosis of malnutrition: A consensus report from the Global Clinical Nutrition Community [^112RkrTY]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Low credibility.

This initiative aims to build a global consensus around core diagnostic criteria for malnutrition in adults in clinical settings.

- **Methods**: The Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) was convened by several of the major global clinical nutrition societies. Empirical consensus was reached through a series of face-to-face meetings, telephone conferences, and email communications.

- **Results**: A 2-step approach for the malnutrition diagnosis was selected. The first step involves screening to identify at-risk status using any validated screening tool. The second step involves assessment for diagnosis and grading the severity of malnutrition. The malnutrition criteria for consideration were retrieved from existing approaches for screening and assessment. Potential criteria were subjected to a ballot among GLIM participants, which selected 3 phenotypic criteria (non-volitional weight loss, low body mass index, and reduced muscle mass) and 2 etiologic criteria (reduced food intake or assimilation, and inflammation or disease burden). To diagnose malnutrition, at least 1 phenotypic criterion and 1 etiologic criterion should be present. Phenotypic metrics for grading severity are proposed. It is recommended that the etiologic criteria be used to guide intervention and anticipated outcomes. The recommended approach supports the classification of malnutrition into four etiology-related diagnosis categories.

- **Conclusions**: A consensus scheme for diagnosing malnutrition in adults in clinical settings on a global scale is proposed. Next steps are to secure endorsements from leading nutrition societies.

### Malnutrition risk screening in adult oncology outpatients: An ASPEN systematic review and clinical recommendations [^114wWZiD]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2024).

Malnutrition screening is not widely practiced in outpatient cancer centers. This review aims to determine the validity of malnutrition screening tools and provide recommendations for clinical use.

- **Methods**: Studies identified by a systematic review assessed the general validity of screening tools in adult oncology outpatients from five databases through 2022. The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) convened a working group of members from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Academy of Oncology Nurse and Patient Navigators, American Cancer Society, American Society for Clinical Oncology, American Society for Nutrition, American Society for Radiation Oncology, Association of Cancer Care Centers, and Oncology Nursing Society to answer the following questions: (1) should clinicians screen for malnutrition, (2) which malnutrition screening tools are recommended, and (3) what are the clinical applications for malnutrition risk screening in adult oncology outpatients?

- **Results**: Twenty of 738 studies met the criteria and were reviewed. Six screening tools with specific cut-points demonstrated validity and are recommended, including the Mini Nutritional Assessment (≤ 23.5), Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST; MST ≥ 2 and patient-led MST ≥ 2), Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST; MUST ≥ 1 and MUST ≥ 2), Nutrition Risk Screening-2002 (NRS-2002; NRS-2002 ≥ 2 and NRS-2002 ≥ 3), NUTRISCORE ≥ 5, and Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment Short Form (PG-SGA SF; PG-SGA SF ≥ 7 and PG-SGA SF ≥ 8).

- **Conclusion**: Six screening tools are valid for malnutrition risk screening in adult oncology outpatients.

### Simple nutrition screening tool for pediatric inpatients [^116FQK9a]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Pediatric nutrition risk screening tools are not routinely implemented throughout many hospitals, despite prevalence studies demonstrating malnutrition is common in hospitalized children. Existing tools lack the simplicity of those used to assess nutrition risk in the adult population. This study reports the accuracy of a new, quick, and simple pediatric nutrition screening tool (PNST) designed to be used for pediatric inpatients.

- **Materials and methods**: The pediatric Subjective Global Nutrition Assessment (SGNA) and anthropometric measures were used to develop and assess the validity of four simple nutrition screening questions comprising the PNST. Participants were pediatric inpatients in two tertiary pediatric hospitals and one regional hospital.

- **Results**: Two affirmative answers to the PNST questions were found to maximize the specificity and sensitivity to the pediatric SGNA and body mass index (BMI) z scores for malnutrition in 295 patients. The PNST identified 37.6% of patients as being at nutrition risk, whereas the pediatric SGNA identified 34.2%. The sensitivity and specificity of the PNST compared with the pediatric SGNA were 77.8% and 82.1%, respectively. The sensitivity of the PNST at detecting patients with a BMI z score of less than -2 was 89.3%, and the specificity was 66.2%. Both the PNST and pediatric SGNA were relatively poor at detecting patients who were stunted or overweight, with the sensitivity and specificity being less than 69%.

- **Conclusion**: The PNST provides a sensitive, valid, and simpler alternative to existing pediatric nutrition screening tools.

### Which assessment method of malnutrition in head and neck cancer [^117X3G24]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the value of several diagnostic methods for evaluating nutritional status during the initial management of head and neck cancer. It was a single-center prospective study conducted in a tertiary referral center, involving ninety patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer. These patients underwent a series of assessments to evaluate their nutritional status, including anthropometric, biological, body, and muscle measurements. Muscle measurements were conducted using computed tomography to calculate the L3 muscle mass index (L3MMI).

Muscle performance, serving as a functional reflection of nutritional status, was evaluated using the Short Physical Performance Battery test. Malnutrition thresholds were established according to existing literature. The results showed that the mean body mass index (BMI) was 24.6 ± 5.4 kg/m², with a mean weight loss of -4.5 ± 10.5 kg and mean albumin levels of 37.1 ± 5.2 g/L. Fourteen percent of patients were diagnosed as malnourished based on BMI, 54% according to the Nutritional Risk Index (NRI), and 58% by L3MMI. There was a 64% agreement between NRI and L3MMI (P < .001).

Notably, all patients identified as malnourished by BMI were also considered malnourished by the other assessment methods. However, many patients deemed malnourished had a normal or high BMI. The Short Physical Performance Battery scores were particularly low among patients identified as the most undernourished by other methods. The conclusion drawn from this study indicates that NRI and L3MMI are superior methods for identifying malnutrition in patients. Additionally, functional muscle assessment aids in determining the severity of malnutrition.

### The Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) [^115kxsn5]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Low credibility.

A lack of global consensus on diagnostic criteria for malnutrition in adults across diverse healthcare settings limits our ability to share meaningful data and compare promising interventions. The Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) is a collaborative global effort to address this shortcoming. An understanding of the interplay between malnutrition, disease, and inflammation was used to create a simple diagnostic framework comprised of etiologic and phenotypic criteria.

The framework is specifically designed to accommodate healthcare settings where skilled nutrition expertise, laboratory assessments, and high technology body composition methodologies may not be readily available. The purpose of this paper is to present controversies, limitations, and research gaps that have been recognized through our ongoing review of GLIM-related research literature and procedures.

We share these issues and the ongoing efforts of GLIM working groups to address them. The use of GLIM malnutrition criteria, which closely resemble those found in other validated tools, raises the opportunity to further standardize malnutrition language and severity cutoffs used to characterize malnutrition criteria.

### Adult starvation and disease-related malnutrition: A proposal for etiology-based diagnosis in the clinical practice setting from the International Consensus Guideline Committee [^1178xLbn]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2010). Low credibility.

Multiple definitions for malnutrition syndromes are found in the literature, resulting in confusion. Recent evidence suggests that varying degrees of acute or chronic inflammation are key contributing factors in the pathophysiology of malnutrition associated with disease or injury.

- **Methods**: An International Guideline Committee was constituted to develop a consensus approach to defining malnutrition syndromes for adults in the clinical setting. Consensus was achieved through a series of meetings held at the A.S.P.E.N. and ESPEN Congresses.

- **Results**: It was agreed that an etiology-based approach that incorporates an understanding of inflammatory response would be most appropriate. The Committee proposes the following nomenclature for nutrition diagnosis in adults in the clinical practice setting: "starvation-related malnutrition", when there is chronic starvation without inflammation; "chronic disease-related malnutrition", when inflammation is chronic and of mild to moderate degree; and "acute disease or injury-related malnutrition", when inflammation is acute and of severe degree.

- **Conclusions**: This commentary is intended to present a simple etiology-based construct for the diagnosis of adult malnutrition in the clinical setting. The development of associated laboratory, functional, food intake, and body weight criteria and their application to routine clinical practice will require validation.

### Admission serum albumin concentrations and response to nutritional therapy in hospitalised patients at malnutrition risk: Secondary analysis of a randomised clinical trial [^1124WPV8]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). High credibility.

The main aims of our study were twofold: first, to investigate the role of albumin as a prognostic indicator for mortality, and second, as a predictor for the response to nutritional support. For this purpose, we divided the patient population into two groups based on their admission serum albumin concentration, choosing a cut-off of 30 g/L. Because albumin is highly influenced by inflammation, we further grouped patients according to the level of inflammation, based on a CRP cut-off value of 100 mg/L, following a previous study.

Endpoints were in line with the original publication, collected through a structured telephone interview at 30 and 180 days after inclusion in the trial. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality within 180 days for prognostic analyses and all-cause mortality within 30 days for the predictive analysis regarding treatment response. Secondary endpoints included the composite endpoint of adverse outcomes (consisting of all-cause mortality, admission to intensive care, readmission, major complications, functional decline); major complications (nosocomial infection or abscess requiring antibiotic treatment, major cardiovascular events, acute renal failure); length of hospital stay (LOS); and non-elective hospital readmission after 30 and 180 days.

### Global leadership initiative on malnutrition (GLIM): Guidance on validation of the operational criteria for the diagnosis of protein-energy malnutrition in adults [^113fbtQX]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

The Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) created a consensus-based framework consisting of phenotypic and etiologic criteria to record the occurrence of malnutrition in adults. This framework offers a minimum set of practicable indicators for characterizing a patient or client as malnourished. It considers global variations in screening and nutrition assessment and can be used across different healthcare settings. As with other consensus-based frameworks for diagnosing disease states, these operational criteria require validation and reliability testing, as they are currently based solely on expert opinion.

- **Methods**: Several forms of validation and reliability are reviewed in the context of GLIM, providing guidance on conducting retrospective and prospective studies for criterion and construct validity.

- **Results**: Some aspects of GLIM require refinement. Research using large databases can help achieve this goal. Machine learning is introduced as a potential method to identify the best cut points and combinations of indicators for different forms of malnutrition, which the GLIM criteria were created to denote. It is also noted that validation and reliability testing need to occur in various sectors and populations, with diverse individuals using GLIM criteria.

- **Conclusion**: The guidance presented supports the conduct and publication of quality validation and reliability studies for GLIM.

### Early identification of cancer-related malnutrition in patients with colorectal cancer before and after surgery: A literature review [^111HHXoo]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: Nutritional anthropometric measurements, laboratory chemistry diagnostics

A variety of nutritional anthropometric measurements have been performed in all studies, but not all researchers have undertaken measurement of muscle mass (see Table 2). Body composition analysis, including fat, protein, minerals, and body water, provides complementary and more accurate information about the nutritional status than just weight or BMI. Changes in fat-muscle mass and body fat percentage were described in these studies. In practice, this would mean that in addition to the parameters of weight or BMI, body composition would be essential for the early identification of malnutrition. Overweight and obesity are relevant risk factors for people suffering from cancer, such as colon cancer. Weight loss in these patients is often overlooked or not identified early enough, because fat may hide the loss of muscle mass. Comparison between the original weight and weight at diagnosis is therefore important to identify malnutrition early. As shown in Table 2, a number of the anthropometric measures are included in most available instruments. It remains unclear whether these were assessed twice or whether they have been adopted from the nutrition instruments.

### Is nutritional depletion by nutritional risk index associated with increased length of hospital stay? A population-based study [^114cNDx7]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Malnutrition is common at hospital admission and tends to worsen during hospitalization. This controlled population study aimed to determine if serum albumin or moderate and severe nutritional depletion by Nutritional Risk Index (NRI) at hospital admission are associated with increased length of hospital stay (LOS) and increased hospital cost in patients admitted to hospitals in two European countries.

- **Methods**: Serum albumin levels and recent weight loss were prospectively determined at hospital admission in Geneva (n = 652) and Berlin (n = 621). Patients were classified as no, mild, moderate, or severe risk by NRI. Multiple logistic regressions were used to determine the association between albumin and nutritional risk category and LOS.

- **Results**: Patients (24%) were at moderate or severe nutritional risk by NRI. Nutritional risk by NRI, adjusted for age, was associated with LOS of 11 days (moderate: odds ratio [OR] 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4 to 2.7, p = 0.01). The risk was significant in Geneva and Berlin patients. Nutrition screening should take place at hospital admission to determine nutritional risk and risk for longer LOS.

### Admission serum albumin concentrations and response to nutritional therapy in hospitalised patients at malnutrition risk: Secondary analysis of a randomised clinical trial [^113rz2Vk]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). High credibility.

This report is, to our knowledge, the first to conclusively assess the ability of albumin concentration to predict the effectiveness of nutritional support. Regarding our primary endpoint of 30-day mortality, there was no significant interaction between albumin concentration and response to nutritional support. When stratified according to inflammation, a stronger treatment response was found in patients with low to moderate inflammation compared to high inflammation (CRP ≥ 100 g/L), confirming previous reports. However, treatment response did not differ according to albumin concentrations within different groups of patients stratified by inflammation level. Thus, albumin concentrations did not provide additional information regarding the benefit of treatment and should not be viewed as a nutritional marker. These results align with a recent consensus paper and a meta-analysis concluding that albumin concentrations should be used in evaluating the severity of disease but not to assess nutritional status or diagnose malnutrition. This may be explained by serum albumin concentrations being affected by a variety of factors, mostly reflecting acute disease or inflammation but not reflecting plasma proteins or nutritional status. The visceral protein albumin is a negative acute-phase protein, and albumin concentrations are inversely correlated to CRP concentrations. Normalisation of albumin concentrations may, therefore, not depend on nutritional support or albumin treatment, but rather on the resolution of disease and inflammation.

### Biomarkers for individualized nutritional therapy in disease-related malnutrition: A narrative review [^112WsU7X]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Disease-related malnutrition in hospitalized adult medical patients is a syndrome associated with substantially higher morbidity, disability, both short- and long-term mortality, delayed recovery, and increased healthcare costs compared to individuals without malnutrition. Research on malnutrition has aimed to translate existing knowledge of its pathophysiology into improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The aim of this narrative review is to summarize evidence on the use of biomarkers to individualize nutritional therapy. There is particular interest in developing nutritional interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of disease-related malnutrition within hospital environments. Recent high-quality randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that nutritional therapy significantly reduces morbidity and other complications associated with malnutrition in selected patient populations. Additionally, there is growing evidence that phenotyping patients through assessing nutritional biomarkers or adapted risk screening scores may enhance our ability to characterize them in terms of prognosis and likelihood of treatment response.

Currently, several promising biomarkers have been identified, including markers of inflammation (e.g. C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)), indicators of chronic disease (e.g. creatinine, prealbumin, albumin, and red cell distribution width), measures of muscle health (e.g. hand grip strength and CT scan results), endocrine and exocrine markers, estimates of catabolism, as well as emerging metabolomic indicators.

### Effectiveness of dietary counseling with or without nutrition supplementation in hospitalized patients who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114YAFvU]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). Low credibility.

- **Study design**: Most studies used validated nutrition screening tools such as the Mini Nutritional Assessment–Short Form (MNA-SF), Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002), and Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST), or assessment tools like MNA, Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA), and SGA. Vázquez-Sánchez et al. and Sharan Kumar et al. recruited patients with a malnutrition diagnosis, whereas Neelemaat et al. used a combination of low BMI and weight loss as an indicator for malnutrition.

	- Study duration ranged from a few days (in the hospital) to six months. Six studies did not meet a priori planned sample-size recruitment; however, one study performed an interim analysis and indicated no significant differences in the primary outcome (mortality) between the study groups. Two studies did not perform sample-size and power calculations. Finally, 11 studies analyzed the results based on an intention-to-treat methodology.

	- The frequency of dietary counseling varied from one to three or more sessions. Seven studies did not report the frequencies of the follow-up sessions. Holyday et al. reported a mean of 43.0 ± 4.5 minutes per session, whereas Sharma et al. reported that each follow-up call lasted an average of 30 minutes. All studies used a face-to-face session for the first session. Four studies used telephone calls for follow-up sessions. Most dietary counseling was performed by dietitians or nutritionists, with two studies by nurses, and one by a physician.

- **RoB across RCTs**: Only 12.5% (2 of 16) of the RCTs had low RoB.

### Nutritional assessment: its role in the provision of nutritional support [^116kQyU5]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Generalised undernutrition is common in hospital patients and in the community. It is frequently unrecognised and is associated with a range of adverse consequences that contribute to increased morbidity and mortality. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends that all individuals engaging with healthcare or admitted to residential homes in the community should be screened for undernutrition. Laboratory investigations have little place in the diagnosis of undernutrition; this is primarily a clinical process.

In particular, the measurement of serum albumin concentration, though widely promulgated in the past as an index of nutritional status, is worthless for this purpose. Laboratory investigations are, however, important to diagnose specific nutritional deficiencies (e.g. of trace elements), to monitor the provision of nutritional support, to detect metabolic complications, and to assess its adequacy. For these, the measurement of serum prealbumin concentrations, particularly in conjunction with measurements of C-reactive protein, may be of value.

### Assessment and monitoring of uremic malnutrition [^112fUMJC]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Assessment and monitoring of protein and energy nutritional status are essential to prevent, diagnose, and treat uremic malnutrition. This condition is highly prevalent and associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced kidney failure. Comprehensive assessments can be achieved by several measurements to quantitatively and qualitatively estimate protein content in visceral and somatic body compartments, in addition to measurements of energy balance.

However, uremic malnutrition is a complex metabolic disorder where net nutrient intake is lower than nutrient requirements, leading to decreased tissue function and loss of body mass. It is also associated with many comorbid conditions. Therefore, a clinically meaningful assessment should include methods able to assess clinical outcomes, identify underlying diseases, and determine potential benefits from nutritional interventions. Such assessments usually require multiple measurements concurrently, with no definitive single method that can be considered a "gold standard".

In this review, we describe various methods to assess uremic malnutrition, expanding and updating data on readily available methods, and discuss more precise techniques to estimate protein and energy homeostasis. Special considerations of specific methods related to their clinical and research applicability as they pertain to renal failure are also addressed.

### Nutritional risk screening (NRS 2002): A new method based on an analysis of controlled clinical trials [^117Fgfdd]. Clinical Nutrition (2003). High credibility.

The Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS 2002) is a clinical calculator used to assess the risk of malnutrition in hospitalized adult patients. It is particularly useful in identifying patients who may benefit from nutritional intervention, thereby improving their clinical outcomes and reducing hospital stay. The NRS 2002 takes into account factors such as age, body mass index, weight loss, dietary intake, and severity of disease. It is not recommended for use in children, pregnant women, or patients with certain conditions such as edema or ascites, which can affect weight and therefore skew the results.

The Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS 2002) tool evaluates an individual's nutritional risk by considering four critical input factors: initial screening criteria, nutritional impairment, severity of disease, and age. Each factor's response corresponds to a predefined score that contributes to the overall risk assessment, guiding the necessary nutritional interventions.

Here's how the scoring works:

- **Initial screening**: All options under this category result in a score of 1, whether the criterion is a body mass index under 20.5 kg/m², recent weight loss, reduced dietary intake, or being in an intensive care unit.

- **Nutritional impairment**:
	- "None" scores 0.
	- "Weight loss > 5% in 3 months or food intake < 75% of normal requirement in preceding week" scores 1.
	- "Weight loss > 5% in 2 months or body mass index 18.5–20.5 kg/m² with impaired general condition or food intake < 50% of normal requirement in preceding week" scores 2.

### Clinical and biochemical markers of risk in uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition [^117T3sqy]. Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Use of mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) as a single screening tool for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) assumes that children with a low weight-for-height z score (WHZ) and normal MUAC have lower risks of morbidity and mortality. However, the pathophysiology and functional severity associated with different anthropometric phenotypes of SAM have never been well characterized. We compared clinical characteristics, biochemical features, and health and nutrition histories of nonedematous children with SAM who had a low WHZ only, both low WHZ and low MUAC, or low MUAC only.

- **Methods**: In Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, and Liberia, we conducted a multicentric cohort study in uncomplicated, nonedematous children with SAM and low MUAC only (n = 161), low WHZ only (n = 138), or a combination of low MUAC and low WHZ (n = 152). Alongside routine anthropometric measurements, we collected a wide range of critical indicators of clinical and nutritional status and viability; these included serum leptin, an adipocytokine negatively associated with mortality risk in SAM.

- **Results**: Median leptin levels at diagnosis were lower in children with low WHZ only (215.8 pg/mL; P < .001) and in those with combined WHZ and MUAC deficits (180.1 pg/mL; P < .001) than in children with low MUAC only (331.50 pg/mL). The same pattern emerged on a wide range of clinical indicators, including signs of severe wasting, dehydration, serum ferritin levels, and caretaker-reported health deterioration, and was replicated across study sites.

### Screening for malnutrition in lung cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy [^114ENsKz]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

The assessment of nutritional problems is vital to support patients undergoing radiotherapy. Poor nutritional status may occur as a result of preexisting problems, older age, the cancer itself, or treatment side effects. Malnutrition impairs the outcome of the disease and affects patients. This prospective study aimed at developing two simple tools to screen malnutrition before radiotherapy and to assess, prior to treatment, the risk of malnutrition after radiotherapy.

- **Methods**: Forty-seven lung cancer patients treated with curative intent were evaluated before radiotherapy and after completion of the treatment. To assess patients' malnutrition, two well-known screening tools (PG-SGA and NRS-2002) were used, complemented by patient-specific characteristics, yielding a 59-item questionnaire. Malnutrition status was defined using Thoresen's criteria. The two screening tools derived by multivariate analyses were validated by comparing anthropometric, biological, and nutritional variables between patients at risk of malnutrition and those who are not.

- **Results**: Malnutrition detection prior to radiotherapy was based on the equation "MDS = 5.88–0.20×BMI+0.05×(percent weight loss over past 6 months)", while malnutrition prediction after radiotherapy was given by "MPS = 3.67+0.98×(age ≥ 70) - 0.12×BMI+1.20×edema". Agreement between observed and estimated outcomes was quite high for the two scores (kappa coefficient 0.80 and 0.85, respectively).

- **Conclusions**: The two assessment tools were found parsimonious and easy to use. Further studies are needed to validate them in larger cohorts.

### Feasibility of accessing data in hospitalized patients to support diagnosis of malnutrition by the Academy-A.S.P.E.N. malnutrition consensus recommended clinical characteristics [^113LUaFk]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

The feasibility of accessing data in hospitalized patients to support a malnutrition diagnosis using the new Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics-American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (AND-A.S.P.E.N.) consensus recommended clinical characteristics of malnutrition is largely unknown. We sought to characterize baseline practice to guide the development of appropriate interventions for the implementation of the recommended approach.

- **Materials and methods**: A cross-sectional survey was conducted of 262 consecutive adults who were referred for dietitian or nutrition support team assessments at two tertiary teaching hospitals in Pennsylvania. The availability of data to support the proposed AND-A.S.P.E.N. approach and the resulting malnutrition diagnoses were examined.

- **Results**: The mean ± SD age was 58.2 ± 17.1 years, and half were female. Food intake history was available for 76%, weight history for 67%, and physical examination for loss of fat and muscle mass for 94% and for edema for 84%. Hand-grip strength was not available. The prevalence of malnutrition among the patients referred for nutrition assessment was 6.7% moderate, 7.6% severe with acute illness; 12.2% moderate, 11% severe with chronic illness; and 0.8% moderate, 0.4% severe with social circumstances. Decline in typical food intake and weight loss were the most commonly used clinical characteristics.

- **Conclusion**: Data could generally be accessed to support the AND-A.S.P.E.N. consensus clinical characteristics for malnutrition diagnosis, but further testing in multiple care settings is needed before a broad implementation can be recommended.

### A roadmap for integrating nutritional assessment, counselling, and support into the care of people with tuberculosis [^114sUfGx]. The Lancet Global Health (2025). High credibility.

Undernutrition — the leading risk factor for tuberculosis worldwide — is associated with impaired immunity, more extensive disease, delayed sputum conversion, and worse treatment outcomes, including mortality. In this Health Policy, we propose a comprehensive roadmap for integrating nutritional assessment, counselling, and support into tuberculosis treatment as part of person-centred care.

At treatment initiation, we recommend standard nutritional assessment with anthropometric measurements and haemoglobin estimation. Additionally, macronutrient and micronutrient support should be provided alongside nutritional counselling. Weight should be monitored during treatment; lack of weight gain at the end of the intensive phase should prompt an investigation of causes, such as food insecurity, poor treatment adherence, malabsorption, uncontrolled diabetes, or drug resistance. At the end of treatment, we recommend reassessing anthropometric measures to evaluate nutritional recovery. People with tuberculosis who remain underweight should receive close follow-up to detect early relapse.

We call for the annual reporting of nutritional metrics by the WHO, explicit inclusion of nutritional assessment and care in national strategic plans, domestic or international support of nutritional programs for people with tuberculosis, increased support for operational research initiatives, and integration of nutritional care into the WHO Multisectoral Accountability Framework at national and regional levels.

### Perioperative nutritional assessment and management of patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery [^1145wsgb]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Nutritional evaluation is the procedure of acquiring, validating, and interpreting data needed to determine any nutrition-associated challenges. This evaluation should be performed using the most appropriate tool, as judged by the attending physician. It is evident that the nutritional tool used should have previously been validated for the population to which it will be applied. However, the nutritional diagnosis depends not only on a single finding but also on the diagnosis of malnutrition, which is recommended as a two-stage procedure.

ASPEN reported that nutritional diagnosis is an integrated, multifactorial methodology to identify nutritional abnormalities using a combination of the following parameters: medical and nutritional history, medication, physical examination, anthropometric measurements, and laboratory data. Therefore, for an integrated approach to nutrition problems, a nutritional control tool is needed, comprising the following factors:

- **BMI**: According to the World Health Organization, a subject with a BMI of greater than or equal to 30 kg/m² is considered obese. In older adults, nutritional assessment should consider age-specific factors, such as those over 70 years with a weight loss of more than 10%.

- **Anthropometric measurements**: It is worth noting that various anthropometric measurements, such as the circumference of body parts (calf, thighs, hands) and the skin fold of the triceps, are significant.

### Defining pediatric malnutrition: A paradigm shift toward etiology-related definitions [^113JEW4n]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Lack of a uniform definition is responsible for the underrecognition of the prevalence of malnutrition and its impact on outcomes in children. A pediatric malnutrition definitions workgroup reviewed existing pediatric age group English-language literature from 1955 to 2011, for relevant references related to five domains of the definition of malnutrition that were a priori identified: anthropometric parameters, growth, chronicity of malnutrition, etiology and pathogenesis, and developmental/functional outcomes. Based on available evidence and an iterative process to arrive at multidisciplinary consensus in the group, these domains were included in the overall construct of a new definition.

Pediatric malnutrition (undernutrition) is defined as an imbalance between nutrient requirements and intake that results in cumulative deficits of energy, protein, or micronutrients that may negatively affect growth, development, and other relevant outcomes. A summary of the literature is presented, and a new classification scheme is proposed that incorporates chronicity, etiology, mechanisms of nutrient imbalance, severity of malnutrition, and its impact on outcomes.

Based on its etiology, malnutrition is either illness-related (secondary to one or more diseases/injury) or non-illness-related (caused by environmental/behavioral factors), or both. Future research must focus on the relationship between inflammation and illness-related malnutrition. We anticipate that the definition of malnutrition will continue to evolve with improved understanding of the processes that lead to and complicate the condition.

### Nutrition screening tools: an analysis of the evidence [^113i7cuf]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

In response to questions about tools for nutrition screening, an evidence analysis project was developed to identify the most valid and reliable nutrition screening tools for use in acute care and hospital-based ambulatory care settings. An oversight group defined nutrition screening and literature search criteria. A trained analyst conducted structured searches of the literature for studies of nutrition screening tools according to predetermined criteria. Eleven nutrition screening tools designed to detect undernutrition in patients in acute care and hospital-based ambulatory care were identified.

Trained analysts evaluated articles for quality using criteria specified by the American Dietetic Association's Evidence Analysis Library. Members of the oversight group assigned quality grades to the tools based on the quality of the supporting evidence, including reliability and validity data. One tool, the NRS-2002, received a grade I, and four tools — the Simple Two-Part Tool, the Mini-Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF), the Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST), and the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) — received a grade II. The MST was the only tool shown to be both valid and reliable for identifying undernutrition in the settings studied.

Thus, validated nutrition screening tools that are simple and easy to use are available for application in acute care and hospital-based ambulatory care settings.

### Malnutrition syndromes: A conundrum vs continuum [^113Pqmr9]. JPEN Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

This provocative commentary critically examines historic definitions for adult malnutrition syndromes as they apply to developed countries with modern healthcare. To stimulate further discussion, the authors propose an updated approach that incorporates an understanding of the systemic inflammatory response to help guide assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. An appreciation of a continuum of inflammatory response in relation to malnutrition syndromes is described. This discussion serves to highlight a research agenda to address deficiencies in diagnostics, biomarkers, and therapeutics of inflammation in relation to malnutrition.

### Glim consensus approach to diagnosis of malnutrition: A 5-year update [^116WnfDX]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

There is a strong consensus that many diseases or conditions are of inflammatory origin and/or elicit inflammatory responses. Malnutrition may result from inflammation-driven catabolic muscle loss, anorexia, altered metabolism, and associated micronutrient deficiencies. However, the original GLIM consensus papers did not provide the detailed guidance needed to assess inflammation in support of malnutrition diagnosis.

A GLIM working group, therefore, undertook a robust modified Delphi process to provide comprehensive guidance. Seven statements were developed that conclude that the occurrence of acute or chronic disease, infection, or injury, often/usually associated with inflammatory activity, may fulfill the GLIM disease burden/inflammation criterion, and confirmation by laboratory markers is not always necessary. Examples of acute and chronic conditions are provided. In cases of uncertainty, confirmation by C-reactive protein (CRP) analysis is recommended. Serial measurements of CRP are recommended, and repeated measures higher than the upper cutoff level of the selected clinical laboratory support the presence of chronic inflammation. Application of clinical judgment is encouraged.

### Multicentre prospective study on the diagnostic and prognostic validity of malnutrition assessment tools in surgery [^116RThQY]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

The absence of a gold standard for the diagnosis of malnutrition is a limitation. Alternative reference standards include a full nutritional evaluation by a trained professional and assessment methods like SGA and GLIM. Assessments by dieticians and muscle mass measurements are time-consuming and costly, making them difficult to implement in hospitals with limited resources.

In the present study, hand grip strength was used to indirectly assess muscle mass to calculate GLIM, which might explain the inferior construct and predictive validity of this tool. The SGA was employed as a reference standard and is arguably the most widely used method in studies evaluating nutritional screening tools. SGA is valid, comprehensive, and a good predictor of outcomes in different clinical settings. However, some components in all screening tests used in the present study are also included in the SGA, which may have raised the sensitivity, specificity, and AUC estimates. Moreover, SGA relies on clinical judgment and lacks objective measurements, potentially leading to heterogeneity in the results. To limit interrater variation, SGA was performed by a single surgical registrar in each study centre. Finally, the study was conducted on a Caucasian population, which might limit the generalizability of the findings.

The next step is to implement standardized malnutrition management strategies based on the MUST screening tool and assess its impact on long-term outcomes, including quality of life and healthcare costs. The potential of combining several screening tools, such as GLIM or expert consultations, should also be explored.

### A practical approach to identifying pediatric disease-associated undernutrition: A position statement from the ESPGHAN Special Interest Group on Clinical Malnutrition [^111SKi8R]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). Low credibility.

Disease-associated undernutrition (DAU) is still common in hospitalized children and is generally accepted to be associated with adverse effects on disease outcomes, making proper identification and assessment essential in the management of sick children. However, there are several barriers to routine screening, assessment, and treatment of children with poor nutritional status or DAU, such as limited resources, lack of nutritional awareness, and absence of agreed nutrition policies.

We recommend that all pediatric facilities:

- **Implement procedures** for identification of children with (or at risk of) DAU, including nutritional screening, criteria for further assessment to establish a diagnosis of DAU, and follow-up.
- **Assess weight and height** in all children as a minimum.
- **Provide the opportunity** for children at risk to be assessed by a hospital dietitian.

An updated descriptive definition of pediatric DAU is proposed: "Undernutrition is a condition resulting from imbalanced nutrition or abnormal utilization of nutrients which causes clinically meaningful adverse effects on tissue function and/or body size/composition, with subsequent impact on health outcomes".

To facilitate comparison of undernutrition data, it is advised that in addition to commonly used criteria for undernutrition, z scores over time should be considered as an indicator requiring further assessment to establish a DAU diagnosis. Since the etiology of DAU is multifactorial, it is crucial to address these factors in the management approach.

### Nutritional status at diagnosis of children with malignancies in Casablanca [^1157cf3Z]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Nutritional assessment is an essential component of the initial assessment of children with cancer. Malnutrition may be present at diagnosis due to the effects of the malignancy or, in low-income countries (LIC), due to poverty and an inadequate diet.

- **Purpose**: The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of malnutrition at diagnosis in children with cancer in Morocco.

- **Procedure**: The nutritional status of 100 children aged less than 18 years with newly diagnosed malignancy between January 2005 and January 2006 was evaluated by anthropometric and biochemical parameters before initiating therapy. We measured their weight, height, weight-for-height using z-scores index for children, and body mass index for adolescents, triceps skinfold thickness, mid-upper arm circumference, and serum albumin.

- **Results**: A total of 100 patients were included. The mean age was 7 years (range 1 to 18 years). Sixty percent were boys. The diagnosis was as follows: Burkitt lymphoma (n = 19), acute myeloblastic leukaemia (n = 18), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n = 14), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 13), Ewing sarcoma (n = 7), nephroblastoma (n = 6), Hodgkin disease (n = 5), osteosarcoma (n = 5), retinoblastoma (n = 4), neuroblastoma (n = 3), germ cell tumor (n = 3), orbital lymphoma (n = 1), cerebral lymphoma (n = 1), ependymoma (n = 1). The incidence of malnutrition ranged from 20 to 50%, depending upon the measurement used.

- **Conclusion**: The prevalence of malnutrition in this study was high, so interventions are being implemented to improve the nutritional status of these patients.

### Recognizing malnutrition in adults with critical illness: Guidance statements from the global leadership initiative on malnutrition [^1153QZys]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025).

Patients with critical illness are a heterogeneous population. Although some patients are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for observation after an elective surgical procedure or during a brief critical illness, others are medically complex with multiple organ failure. Pre-existing malnutrition in patients with critical illness is as high as 75% and is associated with negative ICU-related outcomes. The associations between malnutrition and adverse ICU outcomes make early identification of malnutrition crucial. Recognizing malnutrition may enable more effective identification of the optimal timing, dose, and composition of medical nutrition therapy with the potential to enhance clinical and functional outcomes.

Patients with critical illness experience varied metabolic and inflammatory challenges during the ICU stay and beyond. Muscle loss in patients with critical illness may result from anabolic resistance, immobilization, and accelerated catabolism. In the peri-ICU and post-ICU periods, patients do not meet prescribed nutrition targets. During critical illness, patients may cycle through multiple periods of dysregulated metabolic and inflammatory responses related to changes in organ function or infectious episodes. These dysregulated responses may complicate their ability to use nutrients effectively to maintain muscle mass and optimal immune function. Survival after critical illness is often complicated by ICU-acquired weakness and immunosuppression, components of post–intensive care syndrome (PICS), which includes physical, psychosocial, and cognitive impairments.

### Cancer cachexia in adult patients: ESMO clinical practice guidelines [^114csJ1P]. ESMO Open (2021). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for cancer-associated cachexia, especially with respect to screening for malnutrition risk, the ESMO 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining an objective assessment of nutritional and metabolic status. This includes evaluating weight, weight loss, body composition, inflammatory state, nutritional intake, and physical activity. Additionally, perform an examination for the presence of factors interfering with the maintenance or improvement of this status. Such factors include nutrition impact symptoms, gastrointestinal dysfunction, chronic pain, and psychosocial distress in patients identified as being at nutritional risk.

Repeat nutritional assessments regularly, typically monthly, to guide multicomponent anti-cachexia treatment.

### Guidance for assessment of the muscle mass phenotypic criterion for the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition diagnosis of malnutrition [^115xJmdZ]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

The Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) provides consensus criteria for the diagnosis of malnutrition that can be widely applied. The GLIM approach is based on the assessment of three phenotypic criteria (weight loss, low body mass index, and low skeletal muscle mass) and two etiologic criteria (low food intake and presence of disease with systemic inflammation), with diagnosis confirmed by any combination of one phenotypic and one etiologic criterion fulfilled.

Assessment of muscle mass is less commonly performed than other phenotypic malnutrition criteria, and its interpretation may be less straightforward, particularly in settings that lack access to skilled clinical nutrition practitioners or body composition methodologies. In order to promote the widespread assessment of skeletal muscle mass as an integral part of the GLIM diagnosis of malnutrition, the GLIM consortium appointed a working group to provide consensus-based guidance on assessment of skeletal muscle mass.

- **Measurement methods**: When such methods and skills are available, quantitative assessment of muscle mass should be measured or estimated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, computerized tomography, or bioelectrical impedance analysis. For settings where these resources are not available, the use of anthropometric measures and physical examination are also endorsed. Validated ethnic- and sex-specific cutoff values for each measurement and tool are recommended when available.

- **Function vs. mass**: Measurement of skeletal muscle function is not advised as a surrogate measurement of muscle mass. However, once malnutrition is diagnosed, skeletal muscle function can be assessed to determine the impact and extent of the condition.

### Nutritional risk in emergency-2017: A new simplified proposal for a nutrition screening tool [^116y8y52]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2018). High credibility.

There are many nutrition screening tools currently being applied in hospitals to identify the risk of malnutrition. However, multivariate statistical models are not usually employed to take into account the importance of each variable included in the instrument's development.

- **Objective**: To develop and evaluate the construct and predictive validities of a new screening tool for nutrition risk.

- **Methods**: A prospective cohort study was developed, in which four nutrition screening tools were applied to all patients. Length of stay in hospital and mortality were considered to test the predictive validity, and the construct validity was tested by comparing the Nutritional Risk in Emergency (NRE)-2017 to other tools.

- **Results**: A total of 748 patients were included. The final NRE-2017 score was composed of six questions (advanced age, metabolic stress of the disease, decreased appetite, changing of food consistency, unintentional weight loss, and muscle mass loss) with answers of yes or no. The prevalence of nutrition risk was 50.7% and 38.8%, considering the cutoff points of 1.0 and 1.5, respectively. The NRE-2017 showed a satisfactory power to identify risk of malnutrition (area under the curve > 0.790 for all analyses). According to the NRE-2017, patients at risk of malnutrition have twice as high relative risk of a very long hospital stay. The hazard ratio for mortality was 2.78 (1.03–7.49) when the cutoff adopted by the NRE-2017 was 1.5 points.

- **Conclusion**: NRE-2017 is a new, easy-to-apply nutrition screening tool that uses six bi-categorical features to detect the risk of malnutrition.

### Nascent to novel methods to evaluate malnutrition and frailty in the surgical patient [^114dSeQR]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

Assessing malnutrition requires a focus on novel and nascent methods. The first step in assessing malnutrition is nutrition screening. As summarized elsewhere and in Figure 3, screening for nutrition risk can be done using quick and simple methods to assess those at immediate risk for malnutrition. Any frontline personnel can perform nutrition screening. Nutrition assessment, however, is a more complex and resource‐intensive process, requiring a dietitian or nutrition professional to conduct a detailed evaluation of nutrition status (Figure 4). This step allows for a comprehensive assessment, which will inform the remainder of the nutrition care process (i.e. diagnosis, intervention, monitoring, and evaluation).

Nutrition assessment can be done using a variety of approaches, such as anthropometric and body composition measurements, food and nutrition-related history, clinical signs, biochemical data, medical tests, procedures, diagnosis, and functional assessment.

- **Summary of selected differences between nutrition screening vs. assessment**: Nutrition assessment can be done using a variety of approaches, such as anthropometric and body composition measurements, food and nutrition-related history, clinical signs, biochemical data, medical tests, procedures, diagnosis, and functional assessment. Please see supplementary material for an alternative version of the figure with North American spelling.

- **Overview of Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria**: GLIM is an effort to adopt a global consensus on criteria for malnutrition diagnosis.

### Glim consensus approach to diagnosis of malnutrition: A 5-year update [^112aswhX]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Is there a need to clarify the malnutrition screening procedure after the introduction of GLIM? The international clinical nutrition community has, until recently, focused on the introduction of procedures for nutrition screening into regular clinical practice in hospitals, outpatient care, primary care, and other care settings. This is intended to identify individuals at a higher risk for malnutrition who require nutrition assessment and intervention.

Many validated screening tools are now available, with most focusing on the identification of individuals who already have signs of malnutrition, whereas others identify risk factors for developing malnutrition. Tools focusing on identifying existing malnutrition mostly use similar sets of variables, such as weight loss, low BMI, and disease burden, but these variables are combined in various manners and applied with different cutoff values.

The experience collected after the introduction of the GLIM procedure indicates that the screening tool selected — e.g. tools that identify "risk of malnutrition" vs. tools that identify "malnutrition" — affects the prevalence of malnutrition diagnosed by GLIM. In addition, conservative screening methods with limited specificity might result in false negative diagnosis outcomes.

A global consensus to define the "risk of malnutrition" is not established. For this reason, a new GLIM working group initiative is ongoing with the aim to provide clarity on how, when, and if screening should be used within the GLIM approach. Results from this initiative are expected in 2025.

### Glim consensus approach to diagnosis of malnutrition: A 5-year update [^113nRFyZ]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Two meta-analyses focus on criterion validity. One included a general sample (mixed settings) of 20 studies with 10,781 patients from 13 countries, showing a sensitivity of 72% with a range of 51%–92% (i.e. capacity to identify true positive cases) and a specificity of 82% with a range of 73%–98% (i.e. capacity to identify true negative cases) relative to SGA or Patient-Generated SGA as the mainly used semi-gold standard. With an area under the curve of 0.82, the authors stated that GLIM has good diagnostic accuracy. Malnutrition prevalence was 44% in the total sample. A smaller meta-analysis that included five intensive care unit studies concluded that the small sample of 337 patients and the heterogeneity limited the resulting sensitivity to 65.5% (95% CI, 35%–86.8%) and specificity to 86.9% (95% CI, 59.3%–96.9%).

### Glim consensus approach to diagnosis of malnutrition: A 5-year update [^111H6dRb]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

In 2016, the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) was founded. GLIM builds on efforts to address the priority for the development of a consensus approach for diagnosis of malnutrition and to consolidate consensus around nutrition concepts and terminology. The lack of consensus has hindered the development of a common nutrition language to support the sharing of meaningful prevalence data, the testing of targeted interventions, and the monitoring of outcomes across the globe. Breakthroughs in our understanding of malnutrition in settings of disease and inflammation have supported a changing paradigm in how we fundamentally characterize malnutrition in clinical settings. These insights culminated in the 2019 GLIM consensus papers that provided a framework for a globally accepted diagnostic process that should be valid for adults in most settings, irrespective of methodological availability and resources.

Four major clinical nutrition societies — the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN); the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN); Federación Latinoamericana de Terapia Nutricional, Nutrición Clinica y Metabolismo (FELANPE); and the Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition Society of Asia (PENSA) — convened in 2016 to establish a core leadership committee composed of two representatives of each society and an expert working group composed of 24 physicians and dietitians.

### Should a single growth standard be used to judge the nutritional status of children under age 5 y globally? Debate consensus [^111JC5ti]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Low credibility.

- **Points of agreement**: Key points of agreement are summarized in Box 1. The need for target-based advocacy for countries' engagement and political commitments toward the reduction of child malnutrition across the globe is indisputable. Advocacy needs to be balanced, taking into consideration countries' priorities, available resources, and contexts. Furthermore, the tools used for monitoring progress should be accurate and not lead to any risk of harmful consequences. It is also agreed that physical growth is not the only dimension of nutritional status to be monitored in clinical and public health practice; anthropometry is thus only one of the diagnostic indicators of nutritional status.

When evaluating children in clinical settings, the entire spectrum of anthropometry needs to be considered, namely, stature-for-age, weight-for-age, weight-for-stature or BMI-for-age, and head circumference-for-age. Moreover, both authors agree that, for global monitoring of public health, there are standard definitions of the different indicators such as stunting, wasting, and overweight. However, to avoid misinterpretation and prevent misuse in routine clinical and public health settings, appropriate usage and implications of all growth-related indicators need to be understood by all stakeholders.

### Glim consensus approach to diagnosis of malnutrition: A 5-year update [^114HHeae]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

The skeletal muscles constitute the largest organ of the body and provide the major prerequisites for protein regulation, physical function, and activities of daily living. Muscle size and function are deeply dependent on an adequate and sufficient nutrient intake, including protein and energy, and loss of muscle mass is a devastating component of malnutrition. This loss may be especially profound in the malnourished patient with significant inflammation, as muscle catabolism is usually elevated in cases of severe illness or injury.

The original GLIM consensus did not provide detailed information on how to measure muscle mass or how to define low muscle mass. For this reason, a GLIM working group later published such guidance. Because the availability of specific methods and the feasibility of implementing them in clinical practice are highly prioritized by the GLIM framework, a range of methods was recommended. The choice of method should be based on the availability of expertise, resources, and valid applicable cutoffs for the intended population. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be considered a gold-standard method for accuracy, but MRI is not routinely available for the assessment of muscle mass. Thus, the working group recommended for GLIM implementation the use of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), computed tomography (CT), or ultrasound. CT evaluation of muscle mass can be an opportunity when the examination is performed for other indications, such as abdominal CT scans for oncologic or gastrointestinal purposes.

### Recognizing malnutrition in adults with critical illness: Guidance statements from the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition [^111vZB9j]. JPEN Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). Low credibility.

Patients with critical illness are at risk of malnutrition from admission to discharge and beyond. In critically ill adults, there are numerous research gaps that limit the harmonization of nutrition assessment and the implementation of personalized nutrition therapy practices. To optimize clinical practice and address these research gaps, studies are needed that uniformly report phenotypic and etiologic variables that identify malnutrition, enabling clinicians to map the arc of malnutrition and begin to explore impactful treatment modalities at each juncture.

The research questions focus on what is needed to translate expert opinion about malnutrition during critical illness into evidence-based recommendations.

### Poor nutritional habits are predictors of poor outcome in very old hospitalized patients [^1171ubdh]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2005). High credibility.

Malnutrition is prevalent in elderly populations. Recommended methods of nutritional screening are often too complicated and time-consuming for routine application in frail, very old, hospitalized patients.

- **Objective**: Our aims were to identify risk factors for development of malnutrition in very old hospitalized patients and to evaluate the total Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) score and MNA subscores as predictors of in-hospital and long-term mortality.

- **Design**: A prospective cohort study of patients aged ≥ 75 years was conducted in a geriatric hospital. Assessment included demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, as well as cognitive, functional, and nutritional status. Follow-up was conducted for ≤ 2.7 years.

- **Results**: Of the 414 patients studied, only 73 (17.6%) were well-nourished. Low serum albumin and phosphorus concentrations, dementia, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) were significant risk factors for malnutrition. Survival was significantly lower in malnourished patients and patients at risk of malnutrition than in well-nourished patients (P < 0.0001). Low MNA-3 subscores (dietary habits) were significantly correlated with laboratory indexes of malnutrition and were significantly lower in patients with infections, malignancy, pressure ulcers, dementia, recent orthopedic surgery, and CVA. Multivariate analysis showed that a low MNA-3 score was an independent predictor of mortality; scores < 7.5 increased the risk of death 2.05-fold.

- **Conclusions**: The prevalence of malnutrition was high in elderly hospitalized patients. Dietary habits were significant predictors of mortality and should be closely monitored to improve patient outcomes.

### Glim consensus approach to diagnosis of malnutrition: A 5-year update [^111PAW93]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Because the phenotypic and etiologic criteria were selected from widely accepted diagnostic models introduced over the past 50 years, the GLIM Consortium decided in 2019 to recommend immediate implementation while promoting ongoing validation studies. To support the performance of sound validation studies, the GLIM Consortium provided a guidance paper on how to perform studies targeting construct or criterion validity (i.e. to assure that the model identifies malnutrition) and predictive validity (i.e. that the model identifies cases with adverse clinical outcomes).

A literature search of PubMed used "Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition or GLIM" as the search term for the period of 2019 to May 2024. The search identified over 400 validity and feasibility studies, not taking reviews or commentaries into account. These publications provide evidence that GLIM has good criterion validity when compared with established models, such as Subjective Global Assessment (SGA), Mini Nutritional Assessment‐Short Form (MNA‐SF), and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and ASPEN Indicators to Diagnose Malnutrition (AAIM). Likewise, predictive validity is comparable to other malnutrition diagnostic instruments.

During the same period (2019 to May 2024), the three original GLIM consensus papers have been cited over 5000 times in Google Scholar, over 2300 times in Scopus, and over 3000 times in Web of Science. The large number of individual validation studies has provided substantial evidence for the model's efficacy.

### Nutritional screening tools in daily clinical practice: the focus on cancer [^112yPuNP]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Malnutrition is a common and under-recognized problem in cancer patients. It has been correlated with a large number of physical, psychological, and clinically relevant adverse effects in oncology patients, including impaired tolerance to anticancer therapy, adverse reactions, and reduced quality of life. Consequently, tailored strategies to identify patients at nutritional risk are essential to effectively implement nutritional support and reduce cancer morbidity.

- **Purpose of a nutritional screening tool**: A screening tool should be an easy, standardized, rapid, noninvasive, and cost-effective diagnostic tool to identify cancer patients at nutritional risk in daily clinical practice. If patients at risk for malnutrition are identified early, many cases may be treated or prevented, with beneficial effects on patient outcomes and subsequent reductions in health care costs.

- **Screening tools**: This article discusses the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool, the Nutritional Risk Screening, the Mini Nutritional Assessment — Short Form, the scored Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA), and the Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST) in an oncology setting.

- **Conclusions**: Clinical institutions should implement an appropriate and validated screening tool and assessment protocol, which should contain an action plan. At the time of writing, the MST and the PG-SGA are the best validated screening tools for use in oncology patients. The PG-SGA is an assessment tool with screening components, whereas the MST is a pure screening tool and, therefore, quick and easy to use for trained professionals.

### Examining guidelines and new evidence in oncology nutrition: A position paper on gaps and opportunities in multimodal approaches to improve patient care [^114y8UH7]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). High credibility.

- **Nutrition assessment to diagnose malnutrition**: Nutrition assessment can be conducted using several available tools to evaluate nutrition status, such as the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) and the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA). Nutrition assessment is different from nutrition screening in that it determines the presence, severity, and causes of malnutrition and is used to plan nutrition intervention, while screening indicates the presence or absence of malnutrition risk. Nutrition societies recommend early nutrition assessment for all at-risk patients before anticancer treatments, including surgery, begin, with reassessments at regular intervals throughout the cancer trajectory. ESPEN also recommends dual X-ray absorptiometry, anthropometry, bioelectrical impedance analysis, or CT scans to assess muscle mass, and walking tests or dynamometers (e.g. hand-grip strength) for muscle function.

	- With the lack of consensus on the diagnostic criteria for malnutrition, a framework such as the one proposed by the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) can be used to help diagnose malnutrition through (1) identifying at-risk patients using any validated screening tool and (2) conducting a nutrition assessment using validated assessment tools to diagnose and grade the severity of malnutrition. GLIM's diagnostic criteria include three phenotypic criteria (involuntary weight loss, low BMI, and reduced muscle mass) and two etiologic criteria (reduced food intake or assimilation and inflammation or disease burden).

### Clinical manifestations of nutrient deficiency [^1124uwBV]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2002). Low credibility.

Clinical manifestations of nutrient deficiencies are often overlooked by practitioners caring for patients receiving home nutritional therapies.

- **Methods**: A literature review was conducted, placing priority on identifying practical history and physical examination elements that may represent clinical manifestations of nutrient deficiency.

- **Results**: Summary tables are presented that highlight key history and physical examination elements.

- **Conclusions**: Appropriate care of the patient receiving home enteral or parenteral nutrition therapies requires routine surveillance of these elements.

### Aspen-FELANPE clinical guidelines [^114kvPT4]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for enterocutaneous fistula, particularly concerning nutritional evaluation, the ASPEN/FELANPE 2017 guidelines recommend assessing patients with ECF for malnutrition at the time of diagnosis. If malnutrition is not present at baseline, obtain periodic nutrition assessments, as patients with fistulas have a high likelihood of becoming malnourished. This is due to nutrient malabsorption, fluid and electrolyte losses, and the risk of sepsis.

### Recognizing malnutrition in adults with critical illness: Guidance statements from the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition [^117Q3Vod]. JPEN, Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

The Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) diagnostic approach was designed to provide a simple diagnostic tool for clinicians regardless of staffing levels or technological resources, with the intention to recognize malnutrition as the catalyst for eventual management. GLIM requires the identification of at least one phenotypic criterion (unintended weight loss, low body mass index, or low muscle mass) as evidence of loss of nutrition reserve and one etiologic criterion (disease‐ or injury‐related inflammation or inadequate food intake/assimilation). Thresholds are provided for the phenotypic criteria to discern whether malnutrition is moderate or severe in degree. GLIM phenotypic and etiologic variables are congruent with other approaches used by nutrition experts to identify malnutrition risk, such as the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002, and malnutrition diagnosis such as the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) indicators of malnutrition and Subjective Global Assessment. To the extent that variables used to diagnose malnutrition are evaluated and reported using consistent terminology, the global community will be empowered to identify optimal medical nutrition strategies to improve outcomes of patients experiencing malnutrition.

Although GLIM was not conceived for use primarily in critical illness, diagnosing malnutrition using GLIM criteria is feasible. The GLIM approach has construct validity in identifying malnutrition in this population when measured early upon ICU admission, with > 80% sensitivity.

### Prevalence and prognostic value of malnutrition in patients with IPF using three scoring systems [^116Fa1yP]. Respiratory Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

To describe the nutritional status of IPF patients, report clinical associations, and evaluate their prognostic value in IPF.

- **Methods**: 264 IPF patients diagnosed at the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University between January 2011 and January 2021 were recruited. Three different scoring systems, including the nutritional risk index (NRI), controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score, and prognostic nutritional index (PNI), were used to describe the nutritional status of IPF patients.

- **Results**: This study investigated the prevalence of malnutrition in 264 IPF patients, with the percentage of malnutrition varying from 37.5% with the NRI, to 47.4% with the CONUT score, and to 6.4% with the PNI. Moderate to severe malnutrition ranged from 10.2% to 31.1% across these indices, with PNI identifying only 4.9% in this category. Worsening malnutrition status was associated with a significantly higher incidence of all-cause mortality and IPF death regardless of the malnutrition index as NRI (p < 0.05). When normal nutrition according to the NRI was used as a reference, patients in the moderate to severe risk group remained at a higher risk of all-cause death (HR = 2.06 (1.25–3.41)) and IPF death (HR = 2.36 (1.35–4.15)). The adjusted multivariate analysis identified age (HR = 1.13 (1.08–1.20)), DLCO < 60% predicted (HR = 3.31 (1.24–9.42)), and the use of anti-fibrotic drugs (HR = 0.25 (0.10–0.60)) as independent predictors of mortality.

- **Conclusions**: Malnutrition is common among patients with IPF, and baseline diagnosis of IPF is strongly related to increased mortality.

### Quick and easy is not without cost: Implications of poorly performing nutrition screening tools in hip fracture [^116tfseB]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Low credibility.

This study aimed to evaluate the performance of commonly applied nutrition screening tools and measures and to consider the potential costs of undiagnosed malnutrition in a case-based reimbursement funding environment.

A diagnostic accuracy study was conducted to compare a variety of nutrition screening techniques against primary, secondary, and comparative measures of nutritional status. The setting was a public metropolitan hospital orthogeriatric unit. Participants included individuals with acute hip fracture admitted to the orthogeriatric unit. Out of 150 prospective, consecutively admitted individuals, eight were excluded, yielding a sample size of 142 participants.

Measurements involved several screening tools, including the Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form, Malnutrition Screening Tool, Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool, Nutrition Risk Screen 2002, anthropometric measures, and albumin. Malnutrition was diagnosed using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health-Related Problems, Tenth Edition, Australian Modification (ICD-10-AM) criteria. Healthcare coders costed malnutrition-related diagnostic-related groups and assessed cost-weight changes for individual participants.

The results indicated that the prevalence of malnutrition was 48%. Screening tools showed only slight to moderate agreement with the ICD-10-AM diagnosis of malnutrition, and none met the a priori requirement of 80% sensitivity and 60% specificity. The estimated cost effect of poor screening tool sensitivity on a 16-bed hip fracture unit ranged from AUS$46,506 to AUS$228,896 per year.

### Factors that impact patient outcome: Nutrition assessment [^116xjUa9]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Defining malnutrition and nutrition risk has been a topic of many papers and discussions throughout modern literature. Multiple definitions have been proposed, ranging from simple body weight measurements to a more comprehensive concept that considers disease-specific inflammatory states. Biochemical markers, elements of a history examination, physical examination findings, calculations, and technical tests have all been proposed to help further characterize and delineate those who might be at risk for malnutrition, translating to an increased risk of adverse outcomes after major surgery.

The purpose of this paper is to summarize some of the most utilized and reliable ways to determine nutritional status, as discussed at the North American Surgical Nutrition Summit (2012), and to discuss how to incorporate these methods into preoperative screening for elective surgery.

### Glim consensus approach to diagnosis of malnutrition: A 5-year update [^113nuxPu]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

The guidance papers clarified that low muscle strength, although often closely associated with loss of muscle mass and included in full nutrition assessment after malnutrition diagnosis, is not a component of the GLIM diagnostic algorithm. For this reason, it should not be used as a surrogate for muscle mass assessment. Still, muscle strength testing, i.e. hand dynamometry, is vital if sarcopenia is a diagnostic consideration.

Most body composition assessment tools have limitations in their application to adults living with obesity and may need specific adjustments for muscle mass assessment. Calf circumference with BMI adjustments has been proposed for use in clinical practice and could represent an appealing approach once additional validation is available. DXA and BIA with population-specific equations are also options for muscle mass assessment in patients with obesity that is not severe. A recent consensus initiative on sarcopenic obesity proposed to normalize muscle mass for total body weight. Validation of this approach to diagnose sarcopenic obesity and its relevant clinical outcomes is underway, and it could represent a potential future refinement for muscle mass assessment in persons with obesity and malnutrition.

Preliminary recommendations on cutoffs for muscle mass, using various methods, are provided. Cutoffs should be specific to sex, ethnicity, and device. As different approaches can be used to establish cutoffs for low muscle mass definition, global consensus initiatives on sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity are underway.

### Admission serum albumin concentrations and response to nutritional therapy in hospitalised patients at malnutrition risk: Secondary analysis of a randomised clinical trial [^113rv9gM]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Low credibility.

For decades, serum albumin concentration has been used as a surrogate marker to quantify the amount of circulating proteins in the plasma and was thought to reflect nutritional status. Historically, albumin was viewed as a nutrition marker, and patients with low albumin concentrations were considered malnourished and in need of nutritional support interventions. However, these assumptions were largely based on pathophysiological considerations, and more recent data suggest that albumin is also a negative acute phase protein and may reflect inflammation or acute disease severity and not necessarily nutritional status only. There is still an important lack of data from randomised controlled trials investigating whether low albumin concentrations would be helpful for identifying patients who would benefit from nutritional support.

Malnutrition is common among hospitalised elderly patients and is strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In the last few years, several trials and meta-analyses have provided evidence that nutritional support reduces risks associated with malnutrition. The largest trial, the Effect of Early Nutritional Therapy on Frailty, Functional Outcomes, and Recovery of Malnourished Medical Inpatients Trial (EFFORT), included 2028 medical inpatients at nutritional risk and reported significant reductions in severe complications and mortality for patients receiving nutritional support compared to those in the control group receiving usual care hospital nutrition.
