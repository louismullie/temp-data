## Question

What is the differential diagnosis for a sensation of bladder pressure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis for a sensation of bladder pressure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to characterize the sensation itself and separate pressure from pain and urgency. Then, I should categorize plausible etiologies by pathophysiological domain, including storage disorders like overactive bladder and IC or bladder pain syndrome, neurogenic dysfunction, obstruction, inflammatory or structural injury, functional or psychological factors, and systemic or medication effects. Next, I should consider contextual modulators such as bladder wall properties, posture, age, and urothelial signaling. Finally, I will outline an evidence-based diagnostic approach and initial management touchpoints, making sure to flag where guidelines support or discourage certain tests. I will align this with AUA or SUFU, EAU, and ICI-RS statements [^113T13FX] [^114en4r7] [^115y93RK] [^112uhXuT].

> Let me first confirm the nature of what the patient means by bladder pressure, because conflation with pain or urgency will misdirect the differential. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions, since healthy individuals often describe filling as progressive pressure or tingling, whereas OAB patients frequently report urgency but can label it as pressure or discomfort, and IC or BPS patients experience pain, pressure, and discomfort together as a unified noxious sensation. Healthy volunteers describe a continuous development of bladder pressure with filling, and OAB patients sometimes report pressure as the felt correlate of urgency, while IC or BPS definitions hinge on pain or unpleasant sensations linked to the bladder that persist over time after other causes are excluded [^116ckr4H] [^116uPcAm] [^115sH5HW] [^115y93RK].

> Wait, let me verify how often IC or BPS presents as pressure alone without pain, because that determines how much weight to give pressure-only complaints. In a cohort comparison, every IC or BPS patient endorsed pain along with pressure and discomfort, with very strong correlations among these descriptors, suggesting these terms reflect a single painful construct for IC or BPS, which means pressure without pain is uncommon in IC or BPS and should prompt me to reconsider OAB or other etiologies first. I initially thought that pressure might alone fit IC or BPS, but I should correct that assumption in light of the data showing pressure and discomfort co-travel with pain in IC or BPS patients, whereas a substantial minority of OAB patients describe their urgency as pressure or discomfort [^111jctX1] [^116uPcAm].

> I will now examine storage symptom disorders, starting with idiopathic OAB where urgency is cardinal and frequency and nocturia are common, while patients sometimes label the urgency as uncomfortable pressure. Let me think about the diagnostic pathway, and I should confirm that OAB is a clinical diagnosis after excluding infection and other causes, with symptom questionnaires or voiding diaries to document bother and patterns, and with consideration of post void residual to screen for incomplete emptying that might modify therapy. Urodynamics is not mandatory initially in straightforward OAB, and I need to ensure I do not over order it unless uncertainty or treatment failure emerges, because guidelines frame it as optional in most routine cases [^116uPcAm] [^115sH5HW] [^114en4r7] [^113T13FX].

> Next, let me consider IC or BPS when the story emphasizes chronic bladder related pain with or without co reported pressure or discomfort alongside frequency and urgency, after excluding infection and confounders. I should confirm that diagnosis remains clinical and cystoscopy or urodynamics are not required for uncomplicated presentations, reserving testing for diagnostic doubt or atypia. But wait, what if the patient has only a pressure sensation without pain for months, would that still fit IC or BPS, I should double check that the literature suggests this pattern is atypical, further pushing me to verify other causes before applying an IC or BPS label [^115y93RK] [^111jctX1].

> Hold on, I should verify the possibility of coexisting overactive underactive bladder when both storage and emptying symptoms coexist, since compensatory detrusor overactivity superimposed on impaired contractility can produce mixed signals including pressure sensations. Let me consider that urodynamics may be needed here to confirm both detrusor overactivity and underactivity if clinical clues are ambiguous or treatment responses are atypical, as COUB often requires a tailored approach beyond treating a single syndrome in isolation [^116PHoMt] [^116EEx1q].

> I need to check neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction next, especially if there are neurological diagnoses such as Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, spina bifida, or normal pressure hydrocephalus, because central processing of bladder afferents at the periaqueductal gray and higher centers can be disrupted and alter perceived pressure or urge. In unknown risk neurogenic presentations, I should confirm recommendations to obtain upper tract imaging, renal function, and multichannel urodynamics to stratify risk and guide management, since both storage and emptying pressures impact kidney safety and symptom mechanisms [^112uhXuT] [^1117gP7b].

> Let me consider peripheral neuropathy as well, particularly diabetic autonomic neuropathy, which can blunt normal sensation, alter compliance, and still produce discomfort or pressure sensations in a poorly emptying or distended bladder. I should double check comorbid conditions or surgeries linked with detrusor underactivity, because the pattern of diminished sensation with retention related pressure may point to neuropathic underactivity rather than primary sensory syndromes [^116EEx1q].

> I will now review outlet obstruction, because sustained filling against an obstructed outlet can increase detrusor pressures and distort compliance, leading to a sensation of pressure or heaviness. In women, nonneurogenic BOO is less common but not rare, requires pressure flow urodynamics to diagnose, and can be anatomical due to prolapse or stricture, or functional due to failed sphincter relaxation. Mechanistically, low compliance during filling can reflect an activated but controlled micturition reflex contracting against a closed outlet, which is perceived as pressure rather than classic pain, so I need to ensure I assess for obstruction when the story suggests hesitancy, straining, or elevated residuals [^111QaFRx] [^111L98hP].

> But wait, functional BOO from pelvic floor muscle overactivity or Fowler syndrome can mimic pressure laden urgency without obvious anatomic blockage, and I should confirm pelvic floor assessment when suspected. Let me verify that reliable evaluation methods include EMG, dynamics, manometry, palpation, and imaging to document overactivity or failure of relaxation, since accurate identification of functional obstruction changes therapy toward pelvic floor retraining rather than pure bladder directed pharmacotherapy [^111QaFRx].

> Next, I should review inflammatory or structural bladder wall injury, because infection, radiation, or fibrosis can reduce bladder compliance and capacity, translating into an early and uncomfortable pressure sensation during filling. I need to ensure I exclude infection in any acute pressure or discomfort presentation when considering OAB or IC or BPS, because OAB definitions explicitly require absence of infection and structural disease, and radiation scarring can create a low compliance storage pattern that feels like persistent pressure with small volumes [^115sH5HW] [^111L98hP].

> Let me think about functional sensory modulation and psychological contributors, because altered afferent transduction and central processing can reweight pressure signals without overt structural disease. TRP channel dysregulation in the urothelium and afferent nerves can heighten mechanosensory gain, and anxiety or chronic stress can amplify LUT sensations through CNS mechanisms, so I should confirm psychosocial screening and consider neuromodulatory strategies when appropriate [^1121UNUo] [^112uhXuT].

> I should confirm systemic and medication related contributors as well, because diabetes can cause neurogenic underactivity as noted, and medications such as diuretics may exacerbate volume related pressure while anticholinergics or opioids can precipitate retention with pressure discomfort. I need to check all current drugs, since EAU guidance emphasizes medication review in OAB evaluations and changes here can meaningfully modify symptoms and risks [^116EEx1q] [^115nWFe6].

> Next, I should review contextual factors that modulate the pressure sensation without changing volume, because bladder shape, posture, abdominal fullness, and gravity can alter regional wall stress and local afferent activation even at the same volume, especially in aging bladders with altered elasticity and sensory density. Let me verify that the urothelium and lamina propria function as a sensory transducer unit, releasing signaling mediators that modulate afferent firing, and that novel sensing mechanisms and CNS gating likely determine when volume signals translate into a conscious urge or pressure experience [^112gn6m8] [^112uhXuT] [^1123iaWg] [^113xpJ9t].

> Now I will outline the evaluation approach while double checking each step against guidelines. First, characterize the sensation with careful history to separate pressure from pain and urgency, use symptom questionnaires or voiding diaries to assess patterns and triggers, and obtain urinalysis to exclude infection and hematuria mimics. Second, measure post void residual when emptying symptoms coexist or initial therapy fails, and reserve urodynamics for diagnostic uncertainty, complex mixed storage and voiding pictures such as suspected COUB, neurogenic risk, or when invasive or irreversible treatments are contemplated. For suspected IC or BPS, proceed clinically and consider urodynamics or cystoscopy only when doubt persists rather than as routine, and for neurogenic unknown risk, ensure upper tract imaging, renal function, and multichannel urodynamics according to risk stratification [^114en4r7] [^113T13FX] [^111fvofq] [^115y93RK] [^1117gP7b].

> Wait, I should verify methods to measure bladder sensation itself, because relying on single threshold events during cystometry may miss the continuous nature of sensation development. Sensation related diaries, graded scales during cystometry, forced diuresis paradigms, and emerging tablet based sensation meters or neuroimaging can complement history, although there is no single gold standard and reproducibility is a challenge, so repeated measurements in stable conditions are prudent to improve reliability and to track change with therapy [^114VbUWe] [^1128dhur] [^114jMypb].

> Finally, while my main task is differential reasoning, I should confirm initial management anchors because they can clarify diagnosis by response. For OAB like pressure or urgency, start with bladder training and behavioral therapy, which have supportive evidence and minimal harm, and escalate with pharmacotherapy or combination approaches if needed, while tailoring to comorbidities and avoiding retention risks. If functional BOO is suspected, prioritize pelvic floor therapy, and if IC or BPS is likely with pain predominant features, follow guideline based multimodal management rather than antimuscarinic monotherapy meant for OAB [^111QaFRx] [^113RMZBc] [^115y93RK].

> In summary, I need to ensure that pressure as a descriptor is contextualized, because pressure alone often maps to urgency in OAB or to mechanical or compliance phenomena, whereas pressure coupled tightly with pain over time aligns with IC or BPS, and neurogenic, obstructive, inflammatory, functional, systemic, and medication factors all modulate this signal. Let me reconsider each case through this lens, verify the basics first, and deploy targeted testing only when it will change management, staying aligned with contemporary AUA or SUFU, EAU, and ICI-RS guidance to keep the diagnostic pathway safe, efficient, and evidence based [^116uPcAm] [^111jctX1] [^113T13FX] [^114en4r7] [^115y93RK] [^112uhXuT].

Bladder pressure is influenced by factors such as **detrusor activity**, **bladder compliance**, and **outlet resistance**. The **differential diagnosis** of abnormal bladder pressure includes:

- **Detrusor overactivity**: Involuntary contractions during filling [^111L98hP], causing urgency and incontinence [^111L98hP].
- **Detrusor underactivity**: Weak contractions leading to incomplete emptying and retention [^116EEx1q].
- **Bladder outlet obstruction**: Increased resistance [^111fvofq] from prostate enlargement, urethral stricture, or pelvic organ prolapse [^111QaFRx].
- **Low compliance bladder**: Reduced elasticity from fibrosis, radiation, or chronic inflammation [^111L98hP].
- **Neurogenic bladder**: Dysfunction from spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, or Parkinson's disease [^112uhXuT] [^1117gP7b].
- **Overactive bladder syndrome**: Urgency, frequency, and nocturia without infection or obstruction [^115sH5HW] [^1133xXKD].
- **Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome**: Chronic bladder pain with pressure and discomfort [^115y93RK] [^113FPBhy].

Evaluation includes **history and physical examination** [^113JpajA], **urinalysis**, measurement of **post-void residual** [^113T13FX], and **urodynamics** [^111fvofq] to distinguish these conditions and guide management.

### Systematic evaluation of lower urinary tract sensations to improve management of LUTS: ICI-RS 2024 [^112uhXuT]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). High credibility.

Reliable processing and evaluation of sensory information from the lower urinary tract (LUT) by the central nervous system (CNS) is essential for optimal storage and voiding of urine. Afferent sensory nerves carry information from the LUT to the spinal cord. LUT sensory information subsequently arrives in the brain at the level of the periaqueductal gray, from where it is relayed to higher cortical and subcortical areas. When needed, these higher brain centers ensure that we direct our attention toward the bladder and plan a timely visit to the toilet.

In conditions in which the structural integrity of the CNS is affected at the level of the spinal cord or brain — such as spina bifida, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, or Parkinson's disease — optimal voluntary control over the LUT and accurate processing of LUT sensations may be compromised, resulting in neurogenic LUT dysfunction. Psychological conditions, including anxiety, depression, and chronic stress, are also known to alter LUT sensations and can contribute to conditions like interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). Additionally, conditions that negatively impact the health of the bladder wall, such as the process of aging or bladder outlet obstruction, may alter the extent to which the bladder can effectively send sensory information toward the CNS and subsequently also diminish sensory processes at the level of the CNS.

It is evident that structural or functional impairment in one or more levels along the sensory pathways from bladder to brain is underlying a range of LUT dysfunctions.

Materials and methods

- **Population**: Patients who presented to the urology clinic and were diagnosed clinically with IC/BPS or OAB by one urologist (HHL) consented to participate in this questionnaire study between late 2012 and early 2014, as the timing of the enrollment was related to funding. The clinical diagnosis of IC/BPS and OAB was consistent with the AUA IC/BPS Guideline and the 2002 ICS definition, respectively. This diagnosis generally took into account all clinical factors, including chief complaint, history, physical examination findings, and laboratory and diagnostic workup as indicated.

IC/BPS patients experienced an unpleasant sensation (pain, pressure, discomfort) perceived to be related to the bladder, associated with lower urinary tract symptoms of more than six weeks' duration, in the absence of infection or other identifiable causes. OAB patients had urinary urgency, with or without urgency urinary incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia, and in the absence of infection or other identifiable causes. Consistent with the AUA Guidelines, cystoscopy and urodynamics were not performed on most of the patients, so we had no further information on detrusor overactivity for OAB or Hunner lesion status for IC/BPS.

- **Assessment**: Patients completed questions to rate their bladder pain, pressure, discomfort, and urinary urgency on separate 0–10 numeric rating scales (NRS). They were asked to think about the pain associated with their bladder and rate these symptoms on average over the past four weeks (0 = no pain, 10 = most severe pain imaginable).

### The AUA/SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^113T13FX]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for overactive bladder, especially with respect to post-void residual volume, the AUA/SUFU 2024 guidelines recommend considering the measurement of post-void residual volume in patients who have symptoms suggestive of overactive bladder. This is to exclude the possibility of incomplete emptying or urinary retention, particularly in patients with concomitant voiding or emptying symptoms.

### Assessment of bladder pressure and discomfort symptoms: How do overactive bladder differ from interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome patients [^113FPBhy]. BMC Urology (2023). Low credibility.

The descriptors "pain, pressure or discomfort" are used collectively to describe the abnormal bladder or pelvic sensations associated with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). For example, the AUA/SUFU guideline defines IC/BPS as "an unpleasant sensation (pain, pressure, discomfort) perceived to be related to the urinary bladder, associated with lower urinary tract symptoms". The ESSIC case definition of IC/BPS describes "chronic (> 6 months of) pelvic pain, pressure, or discomfort perceived to be related to the urinary bladder accompanied by at least one other urinary symptom such as persistent urge to void or frequency". Although the reference to bladder pain in IC/BPS is universally accepted, the reason why "pressure" or "discomfort" are also included in the descriptors of IC/BPS is not entirely clear.

Presumably, "pressure" or "discomfort" were included along with "pain" because not all IC/BPS patients complained of pain. Humphrey et al. noted that some IC/BPS patients mentioned bladder discomfort and pressure in addition to bladder pain during qualitative interviews. Bogart et al. performed a systematic review of symptom prevalence of IC/BPS and showed that although pain distinguished IC/BPS from overactive bladder (OAB), some patients characterized their pain as pressure, aching, or burning. Despite these studies, it is still not clear how often IC/BPS patients complain of "pressure" or "discomfort" without pain; and how severe the sensation of bladder "pressure" or "discomfort" is compared to pain.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for overactive bladder, specifically in relation to history and physical examination, the EAU/EAUN 2025 guidelines recommend eliciting a complete medical history. This should include symptoms and comorbidities, along with performing a focused physical examination in patients with LUTS.

### Observations relating to urinary sensation during detrusor overactivity [^1149uF6i]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2009). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to describe the temporal relationship between increases in lower urinary tract (LUT) sensation and changes in detrusor and/or urethral pressures measured in real time.

Methods involved a review of 33 multichannel urodynamic tracings that included a continuous recording of LUT sensation and demonstrated detrusor overactivity incontinence (DOI) or detrusor overactivity (DO). Four physicians reviewed each urodynamic tracing and reached an agreement on the temporal relationship between LUT sensation and detrusor contraction.

The results indicated a median age of 60 (range 36–82) years. Fourteen (42%) participants had urodynamic diagnoses of mixed incontinence, 18 (55%) had DOI, and 1 (3%) had DO without DOI. A total of 119 episodes of detrusor overactivity from the 33 recordings were reviewed. No difference in change in sensation level was found when comparing DO episodes with DOI episodes or between different urodynamic diagnoses (P > 0.5). There was no dominant temporal pattern observed for the whole group (P = 0.84); there was no evidence that the change in sensation level was more likely to occur before, during, or after DO/DOI episodes. When evaluating the changes in urethral pressure, the most common pattern observed was an increase in sensation level following a fall in urethral pressure, but no dominant pattern was seen.

The conclusions suggest that increased LUT sensation during DO/DOI is not reliably caused by measurable alterations in bladder or urethral pressure.

### Pathophysiology of overactive bladder [^111ATfAU]. International Urogynecology Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common disorder that negatively affects the quality of life of patients and carries a substantial socioeconomic burden. According to the International Continence Society, it is characterized by urinary urgency, with or without urge incontinence, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, in the absence of a causative infection. The pathophysiology of this disease entity varies between neurogenic, myogenic, or idiopathic factors. This paper provides a review of the contemporary theories behind the pathophysiology of OAB.

### Can the bladder itself "measure" volume, and thereby help to determine when initiation of voiding should occur? ICI-RS 2024 [^112gn6m8]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

- **Physical properties of the bladder wall that influence or modulate sensing**: Bladder shape is important for sensation related to bladder volume. Consider two latex balloons, one spherical and the other cylindrical. Filled to the same volume without external forces constraining their shape, they form a sphere and a cylinder, respectively, developing pressure related to the volume and material properties. If a cylindrical balloon is constrained to fill as a sphere, or squeezed from cylinder to sphere, internal pressure for that volume increases and some areas undergo increased stretch. Similarly, forcing a spherical balloon into a cylindrical shape alters its pressure and wall stretch.

Now, consider the bladder, which is more complex than a balloon. This review references various studies providing evidence for mechanisms responding to local strain, strain rate, and/or stress in the bladder wall layers or cell types. As illustrated by the balloon example, changes in isovolumetric bladder shape due to posture, fullness of the gut, and the size and positioning of other organs would influence bladder pressure and the relative stretch and stress in localized areas. Consequently, this affects the level of stimulation of local sensory mechanisms at that bladder volume.

### Can the bladder itself "measure" volume, and thereby help to determine when initiation of voiding should occur? ICI-RS 2024 [^1171wGYS]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

Important factors that may determine whether the bladder has the aforementioned functionality were proposed and discussed by a group of experts in the field. This occurred during a proposal session at the 2024 meeting of the International Consultation on Incontinence Research Society (ICI‐RS) in Bristol, UK.

- **Factors studied**: These factors comprise the sensors present in the bladder wall, the regulatory mechanisms inside the bladder wall driving and modulating afferent signaling, the physical properties such as shape and permeability of the bladder, communication with the central nervous system (CNS), and consecutive processing inside the CNS.

Remaining research questions and proposals for further research are suggested in the discussion following an overview of the factors discussed in the results section.

### Methods of assessing and recording bladder sensation: A review of the literature [^114VbUWe]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Over the last few years, there has been considerable interest in identifying the most valid and reliable method for measuring bladder perception. Unfortunately, despite extensive efforts, there is no consensus on which tool to use. Given that bladder filling is a continuous and increasing perception, we suggest employing a continuous method for recording it. Although a forced diuresis protocol is physiological and records sensation continuously, it is unlikely to be useful for clinical diagnosis. Currently, there is limited research utilizing the tool to study bladder sensation across different disease states.

### Methods of assessing and recording bladder sensation: A review of the literature [^112gyZ2J]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

The MEDLINE and PubMed databases were searched to identify articles for this literature review. Reference lists from those articles were also searched for additional references. Only articles in English were reviewed. The terms used for the search were: urinary bladder, sensation, cystometry, urodynamics, urinary incontinence, and focus group.

The search identified 850 abstracts from the MEDLINE and PubMed databases, and 12 from other sources from 1930 to 2017. Twenty-two duplicate articles were removed. Irrelevant articles were excluded after reading their titles. Although 54 articles were eligible on abstract screening, 17 were excluded after reading the full text, as bladder sensation was not the main outcome. We focused on 38 articles where assessment of bladder sensation was the main aim.

### Expert panel recommendations on lower urinary tract health of women across their life span [^116ymRcq]. Journal of Women's Health (2016). Low credibility.

- **Gaps in our understanding of LUT function**: To develop pathophysiologically based therapeutic options, a better understanding of the contributions of the bladder and the urethra to lower urinary tract (LUT) function is necessary. Historically, the approach has been to study the function of the entire LUT and to attribute changes in function to changes in bladder function without considering the contribution of urethral function. While this approach is problematic for understanding both compartments of the LUT, studies designed to study each compartment in isolation have focused disproportionately on bladder function. For example, the mechanisms that allow the female urethra to be functionally competent are not well studied, leading to an insufficient understanding of the pathophysiologies that underlie outlet obstruction and stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in women. Therefore, more research should focus on urethral function.

- **Bladder sensory signaling**: Another major gap in basic knowledge is bladder sensory signaling. Recent studies suggest that the primary cause of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs) may be due to alterations in sensory processing, including disorders in the brain. In addition, the urothelium that lines the bladder lumen has been suggested to act not only as a barrier but also as a sensory transducer of bladder filling, but the mechanisms of this putative role require further elucidation. Nonetheless, the bladder mucosa and the lamina propria have been suggested to be important functional centers of the bladder. The protective role of estrogen on the urothelium against urinary tract infections (UTIs) and bladder cancer has been suggested but is not fully understood.

### How dry is "OAB-dry"? Perspectives from patients and physician experts [^116TLHfq]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder is subtyped into overactive bladder-wet and overactive bladder-dry based on the presence or absence, respectively, of urgency incontinence. To better understand patient and physician perspectives on symptoms among women with overactive bladder-wet and overactive bladder-dry, we performed patient focus groups and interviews with experts in urinary incontinence.

Five focus groups totaling 33 patients with overactive bladder symptoms, including 3 groups of overactive bladder-wet and 2 groups of overactive bladder-dry patients, were conducted. Topics addressed patient perceptions of overactive bladder symptoms, treatments, and outcomes. A total of 12 expert interviews were then conducted in which experts were asked to describe their views on overactive bladder-wet and overactive bladder-dry. Focus groups and expert interviews were transcribed verbatim. Qualitative data analysis was performed using grounded theory methodology as described by Charmaz.

During the focus group sessions, women screened as overactive bladder-dry shared the knowledge that they would probably leak if no toilet were available. This knowledge was based on a history of leakage episodes in the past. Those few patients with no history of leakage had a clinical picture more consistent with painful bladder syndrome than overactive bladder. Physician expert interviews revealed the belief that many patients labeled as overactive bladder-dry may actually be mild overactive bladder-wet.

Qualitative data from focus groups and interviews with experts provided insights into the distinction and potential overlap between overactive bladder-wet and overactive bladder-dry.

### Cystometrical sensory data from a normal population: Comparison of two groups of young healthy volunteers examined with 5 years interval [^111TYeaV]. European Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective - **To describe the pattern of sensations** reported during standardized cystometry in a group of healthy young volunteers, and compare them with a group examined 5 years before.

Methods - **A group of 50 young healthy volunteers** without any symptoms or history reported the sensations they felt during cystometry. These results were compared with those of another group of 38 young healthy volunteers examined in the same lab in 1995 by another investigator.

Results - **All participants perceived a first sensation** of bladder filling, first desire to void, and strong desire to void. Each sensation was easily distinguishable from the others. The volumes at which these sensations came up varied widely. The ratio between volumes at consecutive sensations and at full bladder was fairly constant. All but two parameters were not significantly different from those found in 1995.

Conclusions - **Our data give additional weight** to previous findings that there exists a normal pattern of sensations reported during cystometric bladder filling. This sensory pattern probably corresponds with specific physiological mechanisms as suggested before. Deviations from this pattern indicate or illustrate pathology.

### Urodynamic studies in adults: AUA/SUFU guideline [^111fvofq]. The Journal of Urology (2012). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for urinary incontinence in men, specifically with respect to urodynamic testing, the AUA/SUFU 2012 guidelines recommend obtaining pressure flow studies to determine whether urodynamic obstruction is present in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), particularly when invasive, potentially morbid, or irreversible treatments are considered.

### Pressure-volume analysis of rat's micturition cycles in vivo [^112dC4Ar]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2020). Low credibility.

The urinary bladder collects and stores urine before its disposal by urination. The cystometry, measuring intravesical pressure (IVP) and emptied fluid volume over time, is used clinically to identify urological conditions such as outflow obstruction and stress incontinence. Although rodent micturition differs somewhat from that of humans, rodent cystometry is conducted in preclinical investigations and has provided important information about bladder physiology/pharmacology.

In addition to well-defined parameters reflecting bladder function, studies based on cystometry have developed novel parameters with the intent of probing specific pathophysiological changes. For example, the time-derived IVP differentiates enhanced IVP caused by active detrusor contraction from that due to passive urine retention, and bladder compliance reveals an altered storage function.

Notably, although cystometry measures pressure and volume events over time, the relationship between pressure and volume during micturition cycles has received scant attention. Based on thermodynamics, comprehensive works have established the pressure-volume analysis (PVA) of ventricular function (for details see Kuhz-Buschbeck et al.). In addition to providing a framework for understanding cardiac function, studies have correlated the areas enclosed by the trajectory in PVA with the oxygen consumption of the beating ventricles; therefore, PVA is a specific means to assess the mechanical work of the heart.

### An anatomical pathogenesis of lower urinary tract definitions from the 2002 ICS report: Symptoms, conditions, syndromes, urodynamics [^111L98hP]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2022). High credibility.

- **Phasic detrusor overactivity**: According to the binary control (Figure 1), phasic detrusor overactivity indicates a struggle for control between the closure reflex (high-pressure point) and the opening reflex (micturition, low-pressure point). The wave period is a consequence of the time delay in switching from "closed" mode to "open".

- **Terminal detrusor overactivity**: During evacuation, micromotions from bladder smooth muscles coalesce to "contract as one", which is evident upon observing the micturition.

- **Provocative maneuvers**: Local factors (e.g. cold water) stimulate "N" (Figure 1), while activities such as tapping or hand washing interrupt the cortical/spinal autonomic suppression. In cases with weak peripheral control, the micturition reflex may temporarily dominate. This is perceived as "urgency", or if the closure mechanism cannot regain control, the micturition reflex proceeds to detrusor contraction, and the patient wets.

- **Bladder compliance during filling cystometry**: Bladder scarring from radiation damage would inhibit detrusor distension. However, most low compliance arises from an activated but controlled micturition reflex. During bladder filling, afferent impulses from the stretch receptors "N" (Figure 1) travel to the cortex. If they cannot be fully suppressed cortically, the peripheral part of the closure reflex is activated; the urethra is closed. Micromotion segments of detrusor smooth muscle fibers coalesce to "contract as one" against a urethra that remains closed, not sufficiently to evacuate the bladder, but enough for detrusor pressure to rise in a low compliance pattern.

### Methods of assessing and recording bladder sensation: A review of the literature [^113yLTLW]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Bladder sensation occurs due to the interplay between volume and pressure, detected by pressure and stretch receptors within the bladder wall. Determining its pattern in healthy individuals is challenging because there is limited evidence on how people perceive bladder sensation and respond to different stimuli. The sensory pathway that processes bladder perception is complex. Various intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence this pathway, such as abdominal pressure, bowel status, posture, and hydration; however, these factors are yet to be confirmed.

- **Tools for measuring bladder sensation**: Sensation-related bladder diaries (SR-BDs), cystometry, visual analogue scales (VAS), frequency volume charts, and forced diuresis are some tools used to measure bladder sensation. Although bladder sensation develops continuously and progressively, most methods assess bladder perception by identifying three separate events: first sensation of filling (FSF), first desire to void (FDV), and strong desire to void (SDV). Episodic events do not correlate with the way in which the sensation develops.

- **Interest in objective and non-invasive methods**: Recently, there has been growing interest in objective and non-invasive methods of measuring bladder sensation. However, there is still no consensus on which tool is most appropriate.

The aim of this article is to provide an overview of methods used to assess bladder sensation and to identify which method is the most accurate and objective for measuring the subjective perception of the bladder.

### Diagnosis and treatment of the overactive bladder [^116NR2YX]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is a symptomatic diagnosis based on the presence of urgency, with or without urge incontinence, and usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, in the absence of obvious pathologic or metabolic disease. Initial management of OAB requires an integrated approach using behavioral and pharmacologic methods. Patients should be educated about the functioning of the lower urinary tract system, fluid and dietary management, timed or prophylactic voiding and bladder training regimens, the keeping of micturition charts or bladder diaries, and pelvic floor exercises.

Although the effectiveness of muscarinic receptor antagonists for the treatment of OAB has been shown, adverse effects, such as dry mouth, constipation, and blurred vision, have somewhat limited their usefulness. Newer agents that are more bladder selective have been and continue to be developed. The concept of clinical effectiveness — a combination of efficacy, tolerability, and compliance — can be used to evaluate not only how well a drug works but also the side-effect profile, bothersomeness, and how likely patients are to continue treatment. Patients who do not respond to antimuscarinic treatment of OAB may do so because of a variety of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic reasons.

Most cases of OAB are not cured, but rather the symptoms are reduced, with an associated improvement in the patients' quality of life. Patients who have failed behavioral and pharmacologic intervention may respond to neuromodulation and augmentation cystoplasty. Future approaches may include other types…

### How should bladder sensation be measured? ICI-RS 2011 [^116AtnLD]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2012). Low credibility.

Disturbed bladder sensations, or in broader terms, sensory dysfunctions, are increasingly recognized as key elements in the origin and manifestation of symptom syndromes of urinary dysfunction. Adequate assessment of bladder sensation is crucial to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of urinary dysfunction. This manuscript summarizes the discussions of a think tank on "How to measure bladder sensation" held at the ICI-RS meeting in 2011.

- **Methods**: Based upon literature reviews on bladder sensation presented at the think tank in the ICI-RS meeting, discussions were summarized in the ICI-RS report. Different physicians and researchers further elaborated on this report, which is presented in this manuscript.

- **Results**: Bladder sensations are not merely the result of bladder distension. Other factors inside the bladder or bladder wall, including central processing and/or cognitive manipulation, may play an important role. Methods to measure sensations, such as urodynamics, voiding diaries, forced diuresis, electrical stimulation, and brain imaging, are likely sub-optimal as they only consider part of these factors in isolation.

- **Conclusions**: Different methods to measure bladder sensations have been described and are used in clinical practice. However, these methods only address part of the parameters responsible for the generation and perception of urinary sensations. Further focused research is required, and several recommendations are provided.

### Effect of abdominal and pelvic floor tasks on muscle activity, abdominal pressure and bladder neck [^112Wcj1y]. International Urogynecology Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Although the bladder neck is elevated during a pelvic floor muscle (PFM) contraction, it descends during straining. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between bladder neck displacement, electromyography (EMG) activity of the pelvic floor and abdominal muscles, and intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) during different pelvic floor and abdominal contractions.

- **Methods**: Nine women without PFM dysfunction performed maximal, gentle, and moderate PFM contractions, maximal and gentle transversus abdominis (TrA) contractions, bracing, Valsalva, and head lift. Bladder neck position was assessed with perineal ultrasound. PFM and abdominal muscle activities were recorded with a vaginal probe and fine-wire electrodes, respectively. IAP was recorded with a rectal balloon.

- **Results**: Bladder neck elevation only occurred during PFM and TrA contractions. PFM EMG and IAP increased during all tasks from 0.5 cmH2O (gentle TrA) to 45.7 cmH2O (maximal Valsalva).

- **Conclusion**: Bladder neck elevation was only observed when the activity of PFM EMG was high relative to the IAP increase.

### Systematic evaluation of lower urinary tract sensations to improve management of LUTS: ICI-RS 2024 [^114jMypb]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

There are ways to partly overcome the subjectivity: repeated measurements in identical circumstances, large data from comparable patient groups, and combining different sensory tests.

The ways to investigate are by history taking, standardized questionnaires, and (sensation-related) micturition diaries. If a patient is requested to report what he or she feels in the bladder, the outcome is most successful if sensations are graded: when do you feel "something" in the bladder, when a first desire to void, a strong desire to void, urgency. Furthermore, reporting of sensations during cystometry (standardized as the first sensation of bladder filling, first desire to void, strong desire to void) and evaluation of the reproducibility are very useful. Others have been evaluated as strict water loading protocol and focus group studies.

Besides the grading of filling sensations, bladder-related pain and discomfort can be graded on a 1–10 scale or other scales. The sensation of touch is reported during touching the wall inside the bladder and urethra as with an endoscope. Determining the electrical perception threshold uses numeric figures of the lowest amplitude in mA felt with electrical stimulation in different locations of the lower urinary tract with increasing amplitude. The electrical potential thresholds (EPT) in the bladder have been shown to be higher than in the urethra, while urethral EPTs differ in different parts of the urethra. This test is important as it is semi-objective, repeatable, done by urologists themselves, and provides information about different neurologic pathways directly. Filling sensations and EPT do not corre

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neurogenic bladder, specifically in the context of initial evaluation, the AUA/SUFU 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining the following for patients with unknown-risk neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction:

- **Upper tract imaging**: To assess any potential issues in the urinary tract.

- **Renal function assessment**: Important for understanding kidney health and functionality.

- **Multichannel urodynamic testing**: Provides detailed information about bladder and urethral function.

### The clinical significance of the subtypes of detrusor overactivity: A systematic review [^1121nW5d]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

Patients with terminal detrusor overactivity (DO) are more likely to be older, suffer from worse symptoms, have smaller bladder capacities, and respond less favorably to treatment than those with phasic DO. Future studies incorporating DO should consider stratifying DO patients into terminal detrusor overactivity (TDO) and phasic detrusor overactivity (PDO), assessing them as separate clinical entities.

### Cool and menthol receptor TRPM8 in human urinary bladder disorders and clinical correlations [^1179zFwN]. BMC Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Despite considerable progress in understanding the pathophysiology of bladder dysfunction, there is presently no consistently effective treatment for disorders like the painful or overactive bladder syndromes. Painful bladder syndrome (PBS) is a chronic bladder hypersensitivity disorder that typically presents with suprapubic pain related to bladder filling, accompanied by other symptoms such as increased frequency and nocturia, in the absence of a definable etiology. The overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is a symptom complex characterized by urinary urgency, with or without urge incontinence, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia. Detrusor overactivity is often the underlying condition.

Detrusor overactivity should be further qualified as neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) when there is a relevant neurologic condition or idiopathic detrusor overactivity (IDO) when there is no defined cause. The recent discovery of a range of receptors in the bladder that respond to capsaicin, menthol, and temperature, and their expression in subsets of sensory nerve fibers, provides an opportunity to advance our understanding and treatment of these bladder disorders.

### Do patients with OAB experience bladder sensations in the same way as healthy volunteers? A focus group investigation [^111jSdiC]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2012). Low credibility.

- **Aims**: To describe the terminology and pattern of bladder sensations experienced during non-invasive rapid bladder filling in a controlled setting in patients with OAB and to compare these results with a previous study conducted in healthy volunteers.

- **Methods**: Three groups of patients with OAB, in total 10 patients, participated in three consecutive focus group sessions. Before each session, a strict water loading protocol was given. During the first two sessions, participants described how they experienced their bladder sensations in daily life and during a non-invasive bladder filling with constant focus on their bladder. The third session focused on verifying the interpretation of the data gathered and describing the pattern of sensations.

- **Results**: Patients describe their bladder sensations as a pressure or a tingling sensation, and the pattern can be described by terms ranging from no sensation to an absolute need to void. The absolute need to void may develop suddenly or more slowly progressively. The mean development of bladder sensation is significantly different between patients and healthy volunteers, as well as their average diuresis.

- **Conclusions**: Patients with OAB describe their bladder sensations as a pressure or a tingling sensation. There appear to be two types of urgency: a sudden absolute need to void and a slowly developing absolute need to void. Furthermore, bladder sensation develops significantly differently in volunteers than in OAB patients.

### Can the bladder itself "measure" volume, and thereby help to determine when initiation of voiding should occur? ICI-RS 2024 [^113xpJ9t]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

Several new sensors and new sensing mechanisms have been recognized in the last decade. Combining these new sensing mechanisms with those previously described into a comprehensive hypothesis will enhance our understanding of volume measuring and signaling threshold mechanisms in the bladder itself. Bladder properties such as shape and permeability have an underrecognized influence on the moment of signaling to the central nervous system.

The communication of peripheral afferent information to the central nervous system will be transmitted from the end organ in either a frequency-dependent or amplitude-modulated manner. The way these signals are presented to the central nervous system only partly determines the consecutive actions that will be taken. The hierarchical grading of the signals originating from the bladder among other peripheral bodily or central signals are crucial factors that determine whether the bladder is "allowed" to initiate voiding.

New methods both in basic science (optogenetics) and clinical science (functional imaging) will allow more specific experiments to unravel these mechanisms.

### Neural control of the lower urinary tract: Peripheral and spinal mechanisms [^111LCquL]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2010). Low credibility.

This review addresses the individual components regulating the neural control of the urinary bladder. The focus is on the factors and processes involved in the two modes of bladder operation: storage and elimination. Topics covered in this review include:

- **The urothelium and its roles**: Sensor and transducer functions, including interactions with other cell types within the bladder wall ("sensory web").
- **Location and properties of bladder afferents**: Factors involved in regulating afferent sensitization.

### Refractory overactive bladder: A common problem [^115uByVk]. International Urogynecology Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Materials and methods - **Computerized library systems**: Systems such as MEDLINE, BIOSIS, and EMBASE were analyzed regarding articles on refractory overactive bladder (OAB) published between 2000 and 2014. Search terms included "overactive bladder" or "detrusor overactivity" or "antimuscarinic" AND "non-responder", or "refractory", or "fail", or "persistent", or "dissatisfied". Furthermore, reviews of pharmacological and physiological aspects were conducted using the same initial search terms combined with terms such as "muscarinic", "nicotinic", "m-receptor", "adrenergic", and "transporters". In addition, unpublished pharmacological and clinical data were included.

### The underactive bladder: A new clinical concept [^115axJwj]. European Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Detrusor underactivity (DU) is an increasingly recognized cause of lower urinary tract symptoms in both men and women. There has been a lack of research into all aspects of this dysfunction, and as yet, no effective treatments exist. DU can currently be diagnosed only on the basis of an invasive urodynamic study. An international consensus group met at the International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society and International Continence Society annual meetings in 2014 to consider the feasibility of developing a working definition of a symptom complex associated with DU. Drawing an analogy to detrusor overactivity (urodynamic diagnosis) and overactive bladder (symptom complex), the aim of this process is to help identify affected patients and facilitate further clinical and epidemiological research.

- **Patient summary**: Bladder underactivity is an under-researched but important cause of urinary symptoms in men and women. In this paper, an international expert group presents a working definition for the symptoms that characterize bladder underactivity, with the aim of facilitating further research in this area.

### Normal bladder sensations in healthy volunteers: A focus group investigation [^116ckr4H]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to describe the bladder sensations experienced during non-invasive rapid bladder filling in a controlled setting among healthy volunteers.

Three groups of healthy volunteers, totaling 11 subjects (4 men, 7 women), participated in three consecutive focus group sessions. Before each session, participants followed a strict water loading protocol. The first two sessions concentrated on how participants described and experienced bladder sensations in daily life and during a physiological bladder filling with constant focus on their bladder. The third session aimed at verifying the interpretation of the data gathered so far and describing the pattern of sensations.

During the focus group sessions, with continuous focus on their bladder, all participants reported their bladder sensations as a continuous progression. Healthy subjects described their bladder sensations as a "pressure" and a "tingling" sensation. However, a terminology ranging from no sensations to an absolute need to void was used by all participants and effectively described the pattern in which the need to void develops in healthy volunteers.

The study concluded that focus group research enables the description of the development of normal bladder sensation and helps refine the terminology used by healthy participants. The findings indicate that two types of bladder sensations are spontaneously reported by healthy uninitiated volunteers — pressure and a tingling sensation — with the former developing in a continuous manner. The pattern in which the absolute need develops is described by terms such as no sensation, weak awareness, and stro.

### On the nature of bladder sensation: The concept of sensory modulation [^111s9Awb]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2011). Low credibility.

Going to the toilet is an essential everyday event. Normally, we do not give much thought to the sensations and factors that trigger voiding behavior: we just go. For many people, this apparently simple task is complicated and dominates their lives. They experience strong sensations and sudden desires to void, often resulting in incontinence. It is therefore important to understand the origins of this functional change and identify means to alleviate it.

- **Methods**: Literature survey.

- **Results**: A considerable body of work has focused on this problem, with ideas and concepts on the nature of bladder sensations embedded in the literature. In this paper, we argue for a return to first principles and a re-examination of the problem. We explore the use of focus groups to identify relevant bladder sensations and what triggers 'bladder' behavior. We argue that there are differences between 'introspective bladder sensations' and the sensations reported immediately before a void, known as 'void sensations'. Finally, we propose an alternative model describing how peripheral information generating 'introspective sensations' and 'void sensations' might be different but interrelated. By exploring such ideas and identifying this complexity, we aim to stimulate debate and generate further research to better understand the physiology of bladder sensation and the pathology of increased urge, frequency, and incontinence.

### Mechanism of bladder dysfunction in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus [^111Un9g7]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism of bladder dysfunction in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) by conducting a urodynamic study.

- **Methods**: Forty-two patients with possible iNPH, who were diagnosed based on clinical symptoms and signs, including gait, cognitive, and urinary disorders, with typical imaging features such as ventricular enlargement and normal cerebrospinal fluid pressure, were enrolled. The group comprised 36 men and 6 women with a mean age of 72 years (range 62–83 years). All patients underwent a urodynamic test according to the definitions and methods proposed by the International Continence Society.

- **Results**: Lower urinary tract symptoms were observed in 93% of the patients, with storage symptoms (93%) being more common than voiding symptoms (71%). Urinary urgency (overactive bladder) and frequency were both reported at 64%, being more common than urinary incontinence (57%). The mean values for maximum flow rate and post-void residual (PVR) volume were 11.7 ml/sec and 42.1 ml, respectively. PVR volumes greater than 100 mL were noted in six patients (three men and three women), ranging from 100 to 228 ml. While the majority of patients had a normal bladder volume at the first sensation (mean 134 ml), the bladder capacity was small (mean 200 ml), and detrusor overactivity was observed in 95% of patients.

While incontinence can result secondarily from gait disturbance or dementia, detrusor overactivity mostly underlies urinary urgency and frequency, as well as incontinence in iNPH.

### Systematic evaluation of lower urinary tract sensations to improve management of LUTS: ICI-RS 2024 [^112Z4C6v]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

Lower urinary tract (LUT) sensations form an essential part of the diagnostic criteria for many LUT symptoms, and they are also used to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. The accurate measurement of LUT sensations is severely hampered by their subjective nature.

This paper summarizes the discussions from the 2024 meeting of the International Consultation for Incontinence-Research Society (ICI-RS 2024), focusing on the systematic evaluations of LUT sensations and the design of more objective tools to measure them. We discuss factors that influence sensations under the control of the caregiver or investigator, the signaling of sensations from the LUT to the central nervous system, and currently used diagnostic tools to measure LUT sensations. Recent methodological advances to objectively measure factors that correspond with changes in LUT sensations are introduced, along with recommendations for future research to optimally enable the objective assessment of processes underlying LUT sensations.

Advancing the objective measurement of LUT sensations will require interdisciplinary collaboration, integrating insights from neuroscience, engineering, and clinical practice. Such efforts hold the potential to transform patient care by enabling more precise diagnostics and personalized therapeutic strategies.

### Pathophysiology: The varieties of bladder overactivity [^11464JhN]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is the most common term used in clinical medicine to describe a complex of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) with or without incontinence. The symptoms typically include urgency, frequency, nocturia, troublesome or incomplete emptying, and occasionally, pain. Causes of bladder overactivity encompass neurologic illness or injury, bladder outlet obstruction, urethral weakness, detrusor hyperactivity and impaired contractility in elderly patients, emergence of new voiding reflexes, and so-called idiopathic bladder overactivity.

Most clinicians agree that effective treatment for OAB symptoms should be guided by a basic assessment of patients for these contributing factors. However, it is uncertain if outcomes are significantly improved by diagnostic precision. This is partly because of the ubiquity of LUTS in various common lower urinary tract disorders: stress incontinence, outlet obstruction, and neurologic illness or injury. The prevalence of LUTS suggests they are caused by common mechanisms and, theoretically at least, would be amenable to a single form of effective therapy. Conversely, the limited types and number of LUTS and the limited representation of lower urinary tract structures in the central nervous system may mean that several different causes produce similar symptoms, which are not amenable to a single form of effective therapy.

Future research directions should consider each possible explanation as new knowledge about lower urinary tract function and potential interventions continues to emerge.

### Bladder sensation measures and overactive bladder [^1177axxp]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

We conducted a prospective multicomponent study to determine whether subjective and objective bladder sensation instruments could provide data on sensory dysfunction in patients with overactive bladder.

- **Materials and methods**: We evaluated 70 prospectively enrolled patients using urodynamics and questionnaires on validated urgency (Urgency Perception Score), general overactive bladder (Urogenital Distress Inventory), and quality of life (Incontinence Impact Questionnaire). We first sought a correlation between sensory-specific (Urgency Perception Score) and quality of life questionnaire scores. We then assessed a correlation between sensory questionnaire scores and urodynamic variables, exploring the hypothesis that certain urodynamic parameters may measure bladder sensation. Two urodynamic derivatives (first sensation ratio and bladder urgency velocity) were evaluated to improve sensory finding discrimination.

- **Results**: A moderate correlation was noted between the Urgency Perception Score (0.56) and the Urogenital Distress Inventory (0.74) versus the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (each p < 0.01). A weak negative correlation was evident between the Urgency Perception Score and bladder capacity (-0.25, p < 0.05). No correlation was found for other urodynamic parameters. However, the first sensation ratio and bladder urgency velocity significantly correlated with the Urgency Perception Score, despite the lesser or absent correlation associated with the individual components of these derivatives.

- **Conclusions**: Bladder sensation questionnaires may be valuable in identifying patients with sensory dysfunction related to overactive bladder.

### The AUA/SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^113RMZBc]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of overactive bladder, particularly concerning general principles, the AUA/SUFU 2024 guidelines recommend considering a combination of one or more of the following when symptoms of overactive bladder do not respond adequately to monotherapy:

- **Behavioral therapy**: Techniques and strategies to modify behaviors that contribute to symptoms.
- **Noninvasive therapy**: Interventions that do not require surgery or penetration of the body.
- **Pharmacotherapy**: The use of medication to manage symptoms effectively.
- **Minimally invasive therapies**: Procedures that require minimal incision or insertion into the body.

### Does bladder tone influence sensation of filling and electro-sensation in the bladder? A blind controlled study in young healthy volunteers using bethanechol [^113RxFFN]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

The influence of bladder tone on filling sensation and electro-sensation in the bladder was studied in young healthy volunteers. A total of 22 healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 30 years, were included in our study. Of these, 15 received a subcutaneous injection of 5 mg bethanechol, and 7 received a subcutaneous injection of water to serve as randomly selected controls. In each group, filling perception was evaluated during medium fill cystometry before and 25 minutes after injection. The bladder electrical threshold was determined in each group by constant stimulation before and 25 minutes after injection.

In the study group, there was a marked decrease in the volume at which various filling sensations occurred after bethanechol was administered. The pressure at which all filling sensations were perceived was higher after bethanechol than at baseline cystometry. The electrical threshold decreased with bethanechol. In the control group, no change was noted in the perception of filling or electro-sensation.

Bethanechol has a distinct influence on the filling sensation and on electrical bladder stimulation. Each sensation is sharpened after the administration of bethanechol. Several hypotheses are possible to explain these effects.

### Dimensions of sensation assessed in urinary urgency: A systematic review [^1167RHNr]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Urinary urgency is an adverse sensory experience. The confirmation of the multidimensional nature of other adverse sensory experiences, such as pain and dyspnea, has enhanced the understanding of neurophysiological and perceptual mechanisms. This has led to innovations in assessment and treatment. It has been suggested that the sensation of urgency may include multiple dimensions such as intensity, suddenness, and unpleasantness. In this systematic review, we determine which dimensions of sensation have been assessed by instruments used to measure urinary urgency.

A systematic search was undertaken in the MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, CINAHL, Ageline, Web of Science, InformIT Health, and Scopus databases to identify studies that included assessments of urinary urge or urgency. Articles were included in the analysis if they were primary studies that described the methods used to measure urge/urgency in adults and were published in English in peer-reviewed publications since January 1, 2000. Articles were excluded from the study if urgency was measured only in conjunction with other symptoms (e.g. frequency or incontinence) or if there was no English version of the instrument. Secondary analyses and systematic reviews were retained to hand-search references for additional primary studies.

Data were extracted for the instruments used to measure urge/urgency. For each instrument, the items specific to urinary urgency were reviewed using a prospectively developed categorization process for sensory dimensions and measurement metrics. Items used to assess urinary urgency were collected and analyzed.

### Urodynamic studies in adults: AUA/SUFU guideline [^113D6vHM]. The Journal of Urology (2012). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for urinary incontinence in men, the AUA/SUFU 2012 guidelines recommend obtaining an EMG in combination with cystometry or cystometrogram, with or without pressure flow studies. This is particularly advised for patients with relevant neurologic disease at risk for neurogenic bladder or in patients with other neurologic conditions and elevated post-void residual or urinary symptoms.

### Assessment of bladder pressure and discomfort symptoms: How do overactive bladder differ from interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome patients [^116uPcAm]. BMC Urology (2023). High credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome is defined by the cardinal symptom of urinary urgency. However, in qualitative interview studies, an additional theme emerged as some OAB patients described their urgency as "pressure" or "discomfort". For example, one illustrative quote from an OAB patient said, "I think the pressure is the urgency. When I get the pressure, I've gotta make a dash for the bathroom because it is very uncomfortable". About 30% of OAB patients reported that their urge to urinate was mainly due to "pain, pressure, or discomfort". This can lead to confusion since "pressure or discomfort" are also embedded in the definitions of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). In our clinical experience, some OAB patients described their abnormal bladder sensation in terms of pressure or discomfort, in addition to the classic sudden urgency to urinate.

In this study, we asked IC/BPS and OAB patients to rate their bladder "pain", "pressure", "discomfort", and urinary "urgency" sensation on separate numeric rating scales. We then compared their mean ratings and correlations to discover group differences between IC/BPS and OAB patients. Our objective is to better understand the sensation of bladder "pressure" and "discomfort", and how they are similar or distinct from "pain" (the cardinal symptom of IC/BPS) and "urgency" (the cardinal symptom of OAB) in the two clinical populations. This study may provide further clarity on the distinguishing factors between bladder pain, pressure, discomfort, and urgency symptoms.

### Bladder afferent signaling: Recent findings [^115RD9TE]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Much research on lower urinary tract physiology focuses on afferent mechanisms. The main goals are to define and control the signaling pathways by which afferent information is generated and conveyed to the central nervous system. We summarize recent research on bladder afferent mechanisms.

We systematically reviewed the literature by searching PubMed up to June 2009 with a focus on the last 5 years.

At least two signaling pathways can be identified, including the urothelial and the myogenic pathway. The urothelial pathway is a functional unit consisting of the urothelium, interstitial cells, and afferent nerves in the lamina propria. Signaling occurs via muscle-mucosal mechanoreceptors, mucosal mechanoreceptors, and chemoreceptors. The myogenic pathway is activated via in-series mechanoreceptors responding to distention and via spontaneous contractile activity in units of myocytes generating afferent noise.

To control dysfunctional micturition, we must know more about all components involved in normal micturition control, including how afferent information is handled by the central nervous system.

### Is abdominal wall contraction important for normal voiding in the female rat [^1153Yo9X]. BMC Urology (2007). Low credibility.

The bladder may be pressurized directly by detrusor contraction or indirectly by transmitted abdominal pressure. As the bladder fills, increasing activity on pelvic afferents in response to increasing wall stress triggers efferent firing with resultant detrusor contraction, and bladder pressure begins to rise. Shortly thereafter, the abdominal wall is activated, and concurrently, the IPHFO/flow phase begins, possibly in response to urine being forced into the proximal urethra at a threshold bladder pressure against the closed rhabdosphincter. This timing suggests that abdominal pressure due to the voiding-associated abdominal response may thus play a part in initiating and supporting the IPHFO/flow phase of micturition.

It has been demonstrated that the voiding-associated EMG activity depends upon pelvic nerve afferents. Bladder pelvic nerve activity decreases during the IPHFO phase, possibly in response to decreasing volume, with a change in efferent activity to a bursting pattern, and thus detrusor-generated bladder pressure may decrease. The persistence of the abdominal activity throughout the IPHFO/flow phase, despite decreasing bladder afferent activity, is consistent with afferent signaling leading to the abdominal response arising in the urethra rather than the bladder. The voiding-associated abdominal wall response may therefore provide an important self-sustaining quantum of driving pressure at a moment when detrusor-generated pressure is declining, thus maintaining urine flow during EUS relaxation. According to this hypothesis, failure of abdominal pressurization

Regarding diagnostic investigations for overactive bladder, particularly with respect to history and physical examination, the AUA/SUFU 2024 guidelines recommend considering the use of a symptom questionnaire and/or a voiding diary in patients with symptoms suggestive of overactive bladder. This approach is intended to assist in the diagnosis of overactive bladder, exclude other disorders, ascertain the degree of bother, and/or assess treatment response.

### Systematic evaluation of lower urinary tract sensations to improve management of LUTS: ICI-RS 2024 [^1128dhur]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Low credibility.

More nuanced approaches to measure sensation have been developed, including bladder sensation diaries and focus groups. Focused introspection, a method designed to study the development of bladder sensation noninvasively, avoids confounding factors by using a water loading protocol to induce a constant, elevated diuresis and bladder filling rate. This method aims to achieve the sensation of an absolute need to void within a 60–90 minute time span. Words to describe bladder sensation are avoided to minimize confusion. Instead, sensation intensity is graded on a graph with the absolute need to void as maximal (100%) intensity.

In a study involving three focus groups, researchers were able to describe the development of normal bladder sensation and refine the terminology used by healthy participants. The findings indicate that two types of bladder sensations are reported spontaneously by healthy, uninitiated volunteers: pressure and a tingling sensation. The first develops in a continuous manner. The pattern is described by the terms: no sensation, weak awareness, stronger awareness, weak need, stronger need, and absolute need to void.

New technologies that have been developed to improve our diagnostic capabilities in urinary urgency and bladder sensation include MRI-based neuroimaging and novel tablet-based sensation meters. These can be used during urodynamics as well as during oral hydration.

### Transient receptor potential channels in sensory mechanisms of the lower urinary tract [^1121UNUo]. Nature Reviews Urology (2021). Low credibility.

Disruptions to sensory pathways in the lower urinary tract commonly occur and can give rise to lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The unmet clinical need for treatment of LUTS has stimulated research into the molecular mechanisms that underlie neuronal control of the bladder, and transient receptor potential (TRP) channels have emerged as key regulators of the sensory processes that regulate bladder function. TRP channels function as molecular sensors in urothelial cells and afferent nerve fibers and can be considered the origin of bladder sensations. TRP channels in the lower urinary tract contribute to the generation of normal and abnormal bladder sensations through a variety of mechanisms and have demonstrated potential as targets for the treatment of LUTS in functional disorders of the lower urinary tract.

### The sensory bladder (1): An update on the different sensations described in the lower urinary tract and the physiological mechanisms behind them [^111iaRLn]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2008). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to provide an update on current information regarding sensory function in the lower urinary tract (LUT). An up-to-date review was conducted, discussing the most modern and reasonable approaches to understanding the physiological mechanisms involved in LUT sensory function and different sensations described within the LUT.

Although sensory function in the LUT plays a crucial role in continence and micturition, it has been superficially addressed for many decades. Recent times have seen a surge of interest in this function, rapidly progressing in both basic and clinical research. Sensation depends on neurophysiologic mechanisms involving several nerves, receptors, and transmitters, which enhance our understanding of sensory symptoms. Various stimuli, such as bladder filling, micturition, noxious stimuli, and external stimuli, can elicit sensations in the LUT.

In conclusion, sensation is a prerequisite for conscious bladder control and deserves thorough consideration in managing LUT dysfunction.

### Bladder training for treating overactive bladder in adults [^112o5L7b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common, chronic, and bothersome condition. Bladder training is widely prescribed as a first-line treatment for OAB, but the efficacy has been systematically evaluated more thoroughly for urinary incontinence than for OAB alone.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of bladder training for treating adults with OAB compared to no treatment, anticholinergics, β3-adrenoceptor agonists, or pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), alone or in combination.

- **Search methods**: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search took place on 6 November 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials involving adults aged 18 years or older with non-neurogenic OAB. We excluded studies of participants whose symptoms were caused by factors outside the urinary tract, such as neurologic disorders, cognitive impairment, and gynecologic diseases.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We utilized standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) participant-reported cure or improvement, 2) symptom- and condition-related quality of life (QoL), and 3) adverse events. Secondary outcomes included: 4) participant-reported satisfaction, 5) number of incontinence episodes, 6) number of urgency episodes, and 7) number of micturition episodes. For this review, we considered two time points: immediately after treatment (early phase) and at least two months after treatment (late phase). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

- **Main results**: We included 15 trials with 2007 participants.

### Definition and epidemiology of overactive bladder [^115sH5HW]. Urology (2002). High credibility.

Overactive bladder is a condition that can be associated with a sudden urge to urinate that is difficult to control. It may also involve urinary incontinence, bladder stones, constipation, urinary tract infections (UTIs), excessive consumption of caffeine, urinary frequency, certain medications, and nocturia. Other associated factors include a feeling of incomplete bladder emptying, stroke, menopause, diabetes mellitus, alcohol consumption, multiple sclerosis, involuntary bladder contractions, an enlarged prostate, declining cognitive function due to aging, and cancer.

### Diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (non-neurogenic) in adults: AUA/SUFU guideline amendment 2019 [^115od3cd]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Low credibility.

The purpose of this guideline is to provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis and treatment of non-neurogenic overactive bladder (OAB).

- **Materials & methods**: The primary source of evidence for the original version of this guideline was the systematic review and data extraction conducted as part of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Evidence Report/Technology Assessment Number 187 titled Treatment of Overactive Bladder in Women (2009). This report was supplemented with additional searches capturing literature published through December 2011. Following its initial publication, this guideline underwent amendments in 2014 and 2018. The document reflects relevant literature published through October 2018.

- **Results**: When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular treatment was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low). Such statements are provided as Standards, Recommendations, or Options. In instances of insufficient evidence, additional guidance information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions.

- **Conclusions**: The evidence-based statements are provided for diagnosis and overall management of OAB, as well as for the various treatments. Diagnosis and treatment methodologies can be expected to change as the evidence base grows and as new treatment strategies become obtainable.

### Is coexistent overactive-underactive bladder (with or without detrusor overactivity and underactivity) a real clinical syndrome? ICI-RS 2019 [^116PHoMt]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2020). Low credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) can be classified into symptom syndromes based on which symptoms are predominant. Overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome, a storage dysfunction, and underactive bladder (UAB) syndrome, a voiding dysfunction, are common syndromes which urodynamic tests may show to be caused by detrusor overactivity (DO) and detrusor underactivity (DU) but can also be associated with other urethro-vesical dysfunctions. Sometimes, OAB and UAB can coexist in the same patient and, if so, need a specific approach beyond treatment of the single and apparently opposing syndromes.

During its 2019 meeting in Bristol, the International Consultation on Incontinence Research Society held a literature review and expert consensus discussion focused on the emerging awareness of the coexisting overactive-underactive bladder (COUB).

The consensus considered whether COUB is the combination of OAB and UAB syndromes, or a real unique clinical syndrome in the same patient, possibly with a common etiology. Definitions, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment were discussed, and high-priority research questions were identified.

COUB (with or without urodynamic evidence of DO and DU) may be considered a real clinical syndrome because it differs from single OAB and UAB, and may not be the combination of both syndromes. Urodynamic tests may be necessary in unclear cases or in cases not responding to initial treatment of the most troublesome symptoms. It is pivotal to define the evolution of the syndrome and the characteristic population.

### Overactive bladder: A better understanding of pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^115ECyJw]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

We reviewed information regarding the updated definitions, prevalence, etiologies, disease burden, and management of OAB from a number of perspectives, including professional impact and patient quality of life.

- **Materials and methods**: Published literature and treatment concepts were reviewed regarding the understanding and management of OAB.

- **Results**: OAB is a symptom syndrome including urinary urgency with or without urinary incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia. Approximately 17% of the adult population experience OAB. There are evolving theories regarding its pathophysiology and the mechanism of action of the most commonly prescribed pharmacological therapy (antimuscarinic agents). Treatment primarily revolves around improving quality of life.

- **Conclusions**: Behavioral therapy combined with pharmacological therapy often will bring about acceptable outcomes for patients with OAB. Modalities such as botulinum toxin injections, neuromodulation, and various surgical interventions also are showing encouraging results in more refractory patients.

### Cerebral electrical response on urinary bladder filling: First experimental findings [^111N3Pxe]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2002). Low credibility.

Micturition disorders in neurologic diseases are often combined with reduced bladder sensation. Bladder sensation is important to time the void appropriately and prevent bladder overdistension. We attempted to evaluate cerebral evoked potentials by bladder distension to objectively determine bladder sensation.

In six rabbits, cerebral evoked potentials were evaluated by averaging cerebral responses to bladder distension. We stimulated the bladder with a computerized air pump system, resulting in repeated filling and emptying of the bladder. The number of stimulations, stimulation intensity, and different electroencephalograph electrode positions (both mastoids and frontal) were investigated.

In all rabbits, cerebral evoked potentials were observed after 500 stimulations when stimulation pressure exceeded a certain threshold. Optimum response was observed after 1,000 stimulations. The latency of response of the frontal electrode position was observed after the mastoidal response, with a significant delay of approximately 0.8 seconds. The latencies were significantly different when using different stimulation intensities. At lower intensity (mean pressure, 16.6 mm Hg), the response was observed after 4.531 ± 0.909 seconds, while at higher intensity (mean pressure, 19.0 mm Hg), cerebral response was observed following a latency of 3.971 ± 0.735 seconds.

We conclude that recording cerebral evoked potentials by bladder distension is possible, resulting in an objective evaluation of afferent pathways from the bladder.

### Assessment of bladder pressure and discomfort symptoms: How do overactive bladder differ from interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome patients [^111jctX1]. BMC Urology (2023). High credibility.

In this study, we compared bladder pain, pressure, discomfort, and urgency sensations between IC/BPS and OAB patients. This was done to better understand how bladder "pressure" and "discomfort" are similar or distinct from "pain" (the cardinal symptom of IC/BPS) and "urgency" (the cardinal symptom of OAB) in the two clinical populations.

In our cohort of IC/BPS patients, there was no patient who reported any pressure or discomfort without pain. Every single patient reported pain, pressure, and discomfort. Thus, we were unable to compare IC/BPS patients with pressure or discomfort alone versus those with pain. Their mean numeric ratings of pain, pressure, or discomfort were nearly identical. Additionally, the three-way correlations between pain, pressure, or discomfort were very strong (r all > 0.77). In fact, the correlation between pain and discomfort ratings was extremely high (r = 0.95), almost approaching a straight line (Fig. 1c). This suggests that IC/BPS patients interpreted pain, pressure, and discomfort as similar concepts or a generalized category of painful noxious sensation, without a strong distinction between "pain", "pressure", and "discomfort". The use of three descriptors — "pain", "pressure", or "discomfort" — to define IC/BPS appeared to be redundant in our small cohort of IC/BPS patients. It is unclear from our data whether the descriptors "pressure" or "discomfort" provide additional or differentially useful information beyond the pain descriptor in our small IC/BPS cohort.

### Is the urothelium intelligent [^1123iaWg]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2010). Low credibility.

The urothelium separates the urinary tract lumen from underlying tissues of the tract wall. Previously considered as merely an effective barrier between these two compartments, it is now recognized as a more active tissue that senses and transduces information about physical and chemical conditions within the urinary tract, such as luminal pressure and urine composition. To understand this sensory function, it is useful to consider the urothelium and suburothelium as a functional unit containing uroepithelial cells, afferent and efferent nerve fibers, and suburothelial interstitial cells. This structure responds to alterations in its external environment through the release of diffusible agents, such as ATP and acetylcholine, and eventually modulates the activity of afferent nerves and underlying smooth muscles.

This review considers different stresses the urothelium/suburothelium responds to, the particular chemicals released, the cellular receptors that are consequently affected, and how nerve and muscle function is modulated. Brief consideration is also given to regional differences in the urothelium/suburothelium along the urinary tract. The importance of different pathways in relaying sensory information in the normal urinary tract, or whether they are significant only in pathological conditions, is also discussed. An operational definition of intelligence is used, whereby a system (urothelium/suburothelium) responds to external changes to maximize the possibility of the urinary tract achieving its normal function. If so, the urothelium can be regarded as intelligent.

### Interstitial cystitis: An update [^112LnZNe]. Current Opinion in Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis is a chronically progressive, severely debilitating, heterogeneous syndrome affecting the urinary bladder, primarily associated with urgency, frequency, and pain. Though known for over a century, its etiology is poorly understood, and universally effective treatments are lacking. This review focuses on recently published literature on the disorder.

- **Recent findings**: Appropriate diagnostic tests for interstitial cystitis remain uncertain. The diagnostic criteria developed by the US National Institutes of Health represent research definitions, which are subject to controversial debate due to their overenthusiastic clinical application. The diagnosis is made clinically and by cystoscopy with hydrodistention and sometimes biopsy when other pathologies have been excluded. In symptomatic patients, glomerulations upon bladder distension are indicative but not pathognomonic for nonulcerative interstitial cystitis. Patients with ulcerative disease represent a separate subgroup with distinct characteristics and treatment implications. The role of bladder permeability tests remains controversial. Promising noninvasive markers for interstitial cystitis have been described but are not yet clinically available. Validated symptom scores are appropriate to assist in diagnostics and to monitor disease course and treatment efficacy. Recently investigated hypotheses for causative factors include occult or resistant microorganisms, urothelial hyperpermeability, neurogenic or hormonal pathomechanisms, and mast cell activation. Increasing evidence for a genetic susceptibility is also being explored.

### Overactive bladder: An update [^111K24Uk]. Current Opinion in Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder is an important lower urinary tract syndrome that negatively affects the quality of life of millions of people worldwide. Both sexes and all age groups may be affected; therefore, many specialists, including urologists, gynecologists, geriatricians, pediatricians, physiotherapists, and continence advisors, are involved in the management of patients with overactive bladder.

- **Recent findings**: There is ongoing research, both basic science and clinical trials, to establish the cause of overactive bladder and determine the best methods for managing patients who suffer from this syndrome. New theories and modified definitions of overactive bladder have been proposed, structured evidence-based management guidelines have been established, more prevalence studies have been conducted, and new treatment strategies have emerged.

- **Summary**: Overactive bladder is now recognized as a chronic debilitating condition that incurs costs amounting to millions of dollars. With an aging population, these costs will increase, and it is necessary that health systems around the world recognize this. Further research into the basic science of the condition is required to identify the true cause of overactive bladder, allowing new targeted treatments to be established.

### Is there evidence for pelvic floor muscle relaxation training in nonneurogenic female bladder outlet obstruction?-A narrative review [^111QaFRx]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). High credibility.

Nonneurogenic bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) is defined as an obstruction during voiding, characterized by increased detrusor pressure and reduced urine flow rate. The prevalence of BOO in women varies between 2.7% and 29% and is one of the major causes of voiding dysfunction in women. The diagnosis requires urodynamic evaluation including assessment of both pressure and flow, which allows for differentiation between other forms of voiding dysfunctions.

BOO can be classified as either anatomical (mechanical) or functional. Anatomical BOO is associated with pelvic organ prolapse (POP), incontinence surgery, urethral stricture, stenosis, diverticulum, caruncle, malignancies, and para‐urethral masses. Functional BOO may be caused by the failure of relaxation or contraction of the bladder neck and/or the urethral sphincter or the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) during a sustained detrusor contraction. Anatomical obstruction is more common than functional obstruction in women, with conditions associated with functional BOO being idiopathic urinary retention and Fowler's syndrome.

To verify assumptions of overactivity/increased tone, the urethral sphincter and the PFM must be properly assessed with responsive, reliable, and valid measurement methods. In a systematic review, Worman et al. described eight tools to assess PFM overactivity: electromyography, dynamometry, manometry, digital palpation, defecography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and others.

At the time of writing, there is Level 1, recommendation A for pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) as the first-line treatment for stress and mixed urinary incontinence in women.

### Pathophysiology of overactive bladder [^1124hN65]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a complex of symptoms frequently encountered in the primary care setting. Impediments to optimal management of OAB include inaccurate perceptions by patients and primary care providers. These perceptions, such as the belief that OAB symptoms represent a natural progression of aging and are beyond the scope of treatment, or that diagnosis and treatment are specialist concerns, pose significant challenges.

Complicating the physician's task is the reluctance of many patients to initiate discussion of their OAB symptoms. Patients often develop disruptive coping strategies instead of seeking medical treatment, possibly due to the belief that OAB is a normal part of aging rather than an actual medical condition. In most cases, OAB can be managed effectively by primary care physicians who understand the pathophysiology of OAB. This article reviews normal bladder function and explores the pathophysiological changes likely causing the symptoms of OAB.

### The AUA/SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^116Psjpc]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for overactive bladder, specifically concerning history and physical examination, the AUA/SUFU 2024 guidelines recommend considering telemedicine for the initial evaluation of patients with symptoms suggestive of overactive bladder. It is understood that a physical examination will not be performed, but urinalysis should be obtained at a local laboratory, or recent laboratory results should be reviewed if available.

### The case against urethral failure is not a critical factor in female urinary incontinence. Now what? The integral theory system [^116gKP9m]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2022). Low credibility.

- **Opening reflex (micturition)**: Urothelial stretch receptors "N" are cells with neuron-like properties that respond to mechanical and chemical stimuli. They are activated by hydrostatic or other pressure. At a critical mass of afferent "X" impulses from "N", the micturition reflex is activated, and the closure reflex is suppressed. Relaxation of the forward vector PCM relieves the closure force behind the distal urethra and allows backward/downward vectors to actively pull open the posterior urethral wall. Opening the urethra exponentially lowers resistance to urine outflow inversely by the 4th power of the radius, allowing the detrusor to contract and empty the bladder.

- **Validation of "N" as stretch receptors**: Video 2 shows that bladder base stretch receptors are sensitive to pressure. Digital pressure activates the micturition reflex, resulting in urine loss (by permission Dr. Monteiro, Portugal).

- **Validation of opening reflex (micturition)**: See Figure 2D and Video 3 for further validation.

- **Sensations of urgency**: Sensations of urgency indicate that afferent impulses "X" from bladder stretch receptors "N" have stimulated the micturition reflex (Figure 1). The urge symptom is the same, whether from a normal woman "hanging on" too long or a woman with "OAB" (overactive bladder) who experiences an urge to urinate at a (full for her), low bladder volume.

### Regulation of urinary bladder function by protein kinase C in physiology and pathophysiology [^111UML8n]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Figure 3 highlights the changes which characterize a milder form of dysfunction in compensated bladders, such as decreased relaxation and increased DSM tone in response to the PKC activator, PDBu. Low levels of PKC stimulation, which induce inhibition in normal DSM (panel A1), resulted in increased force in compensated DSM (panel A2). Additionally, moderate to high levels of PKC stimulation caused a modulated rise in tension in normal bladder DSM (panel B1), but a linear increase in the compensated DSM (panel B2). A failure to relax sufficiently and a linear, instead of a modular, increase in DSM tone are the contributing factors to higher bladder pressure and bladder dysfunction observed in compensated bladders compared to normal and sham-operated controls.

- **Low and high levels of PKC stimulation by PDBu differentially affect DSM tone and spontaneous contractions**:
	- Representative isolated muscle strips show the effect of low (20 nM) PDBu stimulation on sham (upper trace) and PBOO (lower trace) DSM strips from rabbits.
	- Summary data is presented in c.
	- Representative isolated muscle strips show the effect of high (100 nM) PDBu stimulation on sham (upper trace) and PBOO (lower trace).
	- Summary data is presented in d.
Low PDBu stimulation caused a significant inhibition of spontaneous contraction amplitude (SCA) of the sham muscle strips but only a minor effect in PBOO strips. However, low PDBu caused a significant increase in basal DSM tone in the PBOO strips. High PDBu stimulation caused a significant increase in basal DSM tone for both sham and PBOO.
