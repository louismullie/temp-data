## Question

How should EBV titers with negative IgM and positive IgG be interpreted?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret Epstein-Barr virus serology when IgM is negative and IgG is positive. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core EBV antibody kinetics and which specific IgG is being measured. Then, I should verify age effects and timing of sample collection. Next, I will review assay variability and the role of heterophile testing. After that, I need to consider immunocompromised hosts and when to use EBV DNA PCR. Finally, I will synthesize scenario-based interpretations and outline follow-up testing strategies with caveats and special populations in mind [^114k6HkE] [^11241bMs] [^113NvrLA].

> Let me first confirm the basic serologic framework: VCA IgM typically appears early in primary infection, VCA IgG emerges and persists for life, and EBNA-1 IgG appears about 2–4 months after primary infection and marks past infection; EA antibodies may rise in acute infection or reactivation but are not routinely required for most clinical interpretations, so I need to keep their limited role in mind as I proceed [^114k6HkE] [^11241bMs] [^116FXKSm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions with "IgM negative and IgG positive" because the meaning hinges on which IgG is detected; if both VCA IgG and EBNA IgG are positive with VCA IgM negative, that supports resolved past infection, whereas isolated VCA IgG positivity without EBNA IgG can be ambiguous and requires clinical correlation and possibly repeat testing or additional markers to clarify the phase of infection [^114k6HkE] [^116FXKSm].

> I should double-check the "isolated VCA IgG" pattern by age, because misclassification risk differs; in adults this pattern usually reflects past infection with EBNA-1 IgG loss or non-appearance, while in children a sizeable fraction may actually represent early primary infection with delayed or transient IgM, so repeating serology or adding EBNA IgG testing is prudent to avoid premature labeling [^114ssRMY].

> Wait, timing matters; if the sample was obtained within the first week of symptoms, IgM may not have risen yet and EBNA-1 IgG would not be expected, so a negative IgM with positive VCA IgG early on could still be evolving primary infection — repeat serology in 7–14 days to document seroconversion, and remember that IgM peaks around 2–4 weeks then wanes, while EBNA-1 IgG emerges later and persists [^11241bMs].

> I need to check heterophile testing and clinical hematology; a positive heterophile (Monospot) supports infectious mononucleosis, but up to a nontrivial minority of IM cases can be heterophile negative, so if clinical suspicion is high with lymphocytosis or atypical lymphocytes, EBV-specific serology should be prioritized and interpreted with the illness timeline to avoid false reassurance from a negative heterophile result [^113NvrLA] [^111dVUED].

> Let me consider assay variability before final interpretation; different commercial platforms show discordances, especially around VCA IgM and equivocal ranges, and discrepant patterns often resolve as "past infection" after expert adjudication with confirmatory methods like IFA, immunoblot, or heterophile testing, so if the pattern is borderline or unexpected, I should verify on an alternative assay or with an orthogonal method [^114DhKXw] [^113NvrLA] [^116pTrp5].

> In immunocompromised or transplant settings, I should not rely on IgM at all; serologies can be blunted or atypical, and EBV DNAemia monitoring by standardized quantitative PCR is the cornerstone for risk assessment and management of PTLD, with serial plasma testing offering high negative predictive value for proven EBV disease, while whole blood can trade specificity for sensitivity in some contexts [^116Esm4w] [^117M1h6c].

> Next, I should review pediatric and infant considerations; primary EBV infection in early childhood may be atypical or subclinical, maternal antibodies can confound interpretation in infants, and population seroepidemiology shows shifting ages of acquisition — so for young children with isolated VCA IgG, repeating serology and correlating with clinical features is essential to avoid misclassification [^114EWvav] [^114hA4Dx] [^116cG8xg].

> Now, I will examine the role of supplemental tests when the pattern is ambiguous; ordering EBNA-1 IgG can resolve isolated VCA IgG, repeating serology in 1–2 weeks can document evolving patterns, EA IgG is occasionally helpful but not routinely recommended, and in complex or discrepant cases, confirmatory IFA or immunoblot improves classification while PCR is reserved for immunocompromised hosts or high-risk scenarios [^114Gf2ct] [^112JeUeP] [^113NvrLA].

> But wait, what about reactivation patterns; diagnosing reactivation on serology alone is unreliable because EA and VCA IgM responses can be variable and context-dependent, so if reactivation is a concern, especially in high-risk hosts, I should corroborate with EBV DNA testing rather than overinterpreting EA or IgM blips [^114Gf2ct] [^116FXKSm].

> Special populations deserve a pause; I initially thought pregnancy necessitated PCR "due to teratogenic risk", but that's not correct — EBV is not a known teratogen, and while seropositivity and even markers of reactivation are common in pregnancy, PCR is considered when active infection is strongly suspected or when serology is equivocal, not because of teratogenicity per se — thank you for catching that, I should correct my reasoning here [^111E1sLz].

> Synthesis for the core question: if VCA IgG and EBNA-1 IgG are positive with VCA IgM negative, this is definitive past infection in immunocompetent hosts and no further testing is usually needed; if only VCA IgG is positive with IgM negative and EBNA-1 IgG unknown or negative, interpret cautiously — repeat EBNA-1 IgG or repeat the full panel in 7–14 days, and weigh age, timing, and symptoms; in immunocompromised hosts or atypical presentations, prioritize EBV DNA PCR to guide management rather than leaning on IgM/IgG patterns alone [^114k6HkE] [^11241bMs] [^117M1h6c].

---

A serologic pattern of **negative EBV IgM and positive IgG** indicates a **past EBV infection** with established latency and lifelong immunity, not an acute or recent infection [^114k6HkE] [^11241bMs]. This is the most common EBV serologic profile in adults and requires **no treatment or isolation**. In immunocompromised patients, consider **EBV DNA testing** [^116Esm4w] if reactivation is suspected, but in immunocompetent hosts, no further testing is needed unless clinically indicated [^111VQtjo] [^117M1h6c].

## Serological markers of EBV infection

EBV serology relies on **antibodies** against distinct viral antigens, each reflecting a specific stage of infection [^114Gf2ct]:

| **Antibody marker** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| VCA IgM | - Acute primary infection <br/> - Appears early and declines within weeks [^114k6HkE] [^116FXKSm] |
| VCA IgG | - Past infection <br/> - Appears during acute infection and persists for life [^114k6HkE] [^11241bMs] |
| EBNA IgG | - Past infection <br/> - Appears 2–4 months after infection and persists for life [^11241bMs] [^116FXKSm] |
| EA IgG | - Active viral replication or reactivation <br/> - Transiently elevated [^111VQtjo] [^112YjL4Y] |

## Interpretation of negative EBV IgM and positive IgG

The combination of negative EBV IgM and positive IgG indicates **past infection** with established latency and lifelong immunity. This pattern is typical in adults and older children, reflecting prior exposure and immune control [^11241bMs].

---

## Clinical implications

- **No acute infection**: The patient is not experiencing acute EBV infection [^114k6HkE].
- **No recent infection**: The patient has not had a recent EBV infection [^11241bMs].
- **No infectious risk**: The patient is not contagious and does not require isolation.
- **No treatment required**: No antiviral therapy or specific treatment is needed [^116W3ajD].

---

## Exceptions and special considerations

While this pattern generally indicates past infection, certain scenarios may warrant further evaluation — for example, **immunocompromised patients**, in whom reactivation can occur [^116Esm4w] and EBV DNA testing should be considered if clinically suspected [^111VQtjo], and **atypical serologic patterns**, in which, rarely, an isolated VCA IgG without EBNA IgG may reflect past infection with EBNA-1 IgG loss or non-appearance, or acute infection with delayed IgM; immunoblotting can help clarify [^114ssRMY] [^114DhKXw].

---

## Recommended follow-up and management

For immunocompetent patients, **no further testing** or follow-up is needed [^114k6HkE]. For immunocompromised patients or when reactivation is suspected, consider EBV DNA testing and clinical monitoring [^117M1h6c] [^116Esm4w].

---

A negative EBV IgM with positive IgG indicates **past infection** with established latency and lifelong immunity, not acute or recent infection [^11241bMs] [^114Gf2ct]. No treatment or isolation is needed, but consider EBV DNA testing in immunocompromised patients if reactivation is suspected [^116Esm4w].

### Molecular diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus-related diseases [^111VQtjo]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2001). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis and can be found in a wide variety of benign and malignant lesions, including oral hairy leukoplakia, inflammatory pseudotumor, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and gastric carcinoma. Molecular testing is increasingly important in diagnosing and monitoring patients affected by these diseases. In biopsy tissues, molecular detection of EBV-encoded RNA transcripts by in situ hybridization remains the gold standard for proving that a histopathological lesion is EBV-related. EBV-encoded RNA hybridization and EBV LMP1 immunostains are used routinely to detect latent EBV in tissues affected by posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) or in enlarged nodes from patients with infectious mononucleosis.

Traditional serology is the best test for evaluating acute versus remote infection in healthy individuals. High serological titers serve as a tumor marker for some EBV-related malignancies, but titers are not a dependable tumor marker in immunocompromised hosts. EBV viral load testing by quantitative DNA amplification of blood samples is a promising new laboratory test that has proven useful for early diagnosis and monitoring of patients with PTLD. Recent studies suggest a role for EBV viral load testing in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Hodgkin's disease, and AIDS patients with brain lymphoma. Further research is needed to more fully define the clinical utility of viral load tests in the full spectrum of EBV-associated diseases. Gene expression profiling is ongoing.

Microbiological investigations were conducted to detect EBV and CMV-specific antibodies using an ETI-MAX 3000 microtiter plate analyzer (DiaSorin, Italy). The Epstein-Barr Viral Capsid Antigen (VCA) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG), as well as the Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen (EBNA) ELISA IgG (Vircell, Spain), were utilized for EBV-specific antibodies detection. Cytomegalovirus ELISA IgM capture and IgG (Vircell, Spain) were utilized to detect CMV-specific antibodies.

Primary EBV infection was confirmed by anti-VCA IgM positive/borderline results, and anti-VCA IgG-positive results with negative anti-EBNA IgG test results. In cases of isolated anti-VCA IgM results, control serology was recommended. The presence of anti-VCA IgG and anti-EBNA IgG with negative anti-VCA IgM serology indicated a past infection. Anti-CMV IgM was positive, and seroconversion was detected in the second specimen of primary CMV infection. Past infection was confirmed by the presence of anti-CMV-specific IgG without anti-CMV IgM.

To exclude other causes, throat swabs were cultured using 5% sheep Columbia blood agar (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), chocolate (PolyViteX, bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France), and Sabouraud agar. Agar plates, except for Sabouraud agar, were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO₂ cabinet for 24 hours. In the presence of Streptococcus pyogenes, identification of the isolated strain was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI–TOF MS). Antibiotic susceptibility testing and evaluation of the results were conducted.

### A systematic study of Epstein-Barr virus serologic assays following acute infection [^11241bMs]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

We determined the presence of IgG and IgM antibodies to viral capsid antigen (VCA-IgG, VCA-IgM) and IgG antibody to the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) during the acute illness and at 1, 2, 6, and 48 months. This study was conducted in a prospective, population-based case series of 95 persons with an acute illness serologically confirmed as Epstein-Barr virus infection.

The acute illness was characterized by the presence of VCA-IgG and VCA-IgM (by ELISA) and by the absence of EBNA in most, but not all, patients. During follow-up, VCA-IgG antibodies remained detectable in all patients, while the proportion with VCA-IgM declined and the number with detectable EBNA antibodies steadily increased.

- **Serologic test methods differences**: The primary differences between the two serologic test methods were the increased persistence of VCA-IgM during follow-up by ELISA and the earlier detection of EBNA by IFA. Clinicians should consider the illness stage and the laboratory technique to appropriately interpret serologic test results in suspected cases of mononucleosis caused by the Epstein-Barr virus.

The International CIS study is a collaborative study across 33 centers. Inclusion and exclusion criteria and methods for sample and data collection have previously been described. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) reactivity against EBNA1 was initially evaluated using commercially available ELISA (ETI-EBNA-G, Diasorin, Italy) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Samples with anti–EBNA1-IgG reactivity less than the manufacturer's cutoff value (CoV) of 1.0 were considered positive. Samples demonstrating negative or borderline (0.8–1.2) results against both EBV antigens were investigated using an EBV-specific immunoblot.

### Early identification of individuals at risk for multiple sclerosis by quantification of EBNA-1-specific antibody titers [^115EDmgt]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

In 264 of these MS patients with follow-up samples (81.5%), EBV seroconversion occurred in the course of clinically evident infectious mononucleosis (IM), confirmed by the triad of fever, lymphadenopathy, and tonsillitis. In all patients with IM, EBV primary infection was further confirmed serologically by the presence of EBV viral-capsid antigen (VCA)-specific IgM in the absence of EBV-VCA- or EBV-EBNA-specific IgG antibodies. In all 264 patients with clinically evident IM, the time point of EBV seroconversion (T0) was defined as the first available plasma sample with VCA-IgM positive, VCA-IgG negative, and EBNA-IgG negative antibodies.

In 60 (18.5%) patients with MS, primary EBV infection had occurred asymptomatically, and, in these individuals, EBV seroconversion was confirmed by an additional plasma sample that was available and obtained at a median of 5.2 (3.2–7.2) months prior to the first detection of EBV-VCA-specific IgM or EBV-VCA-specific IgG. In all 60 patients with asymptomatic EBV seroconversion, the time point of EBV seroconversion (T0) was defined as the first available plasma sample with VCA-IgM positive or VCA-IgG positive antibodies.

For each of the 324 follow-up MS patients, one healthy control individual was selected from the control cohort matched according to gender, age, time, and occurrence of IM. All MS patients and healthy controls were recruited in Austria and Germany. Furthermore, from all 324 control subjects, a follow-up was available for more than 5 years after the matching time point, and it was confirmed by follow-up records that none.

### Evaluation of a quantitative dual-target EBV DNA test on a fully automated molecular testing system [^116Esm4w]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). High credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is estimated to infect approximately 90% of adults worldwide and is the main cause of infectious mononucleosis. In recipients of solid organ transplants and hematopoietic cell transplants, viral infections are frequent causes of morbidity and mortality, and infection with EBV is associated with the development of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in such immunosuppressed patients. EBV DNAemia is routinely monitored in transplant recipients who are at high risk of PTLD as well as in those who are undergoing therapy for PTLD. Indeed, high levels of EBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in asymptomatic patients can serve as a marker for clinicians to initiate preemptive therapy and halt disease progression. In patients undergoing monitoring of EBV DNAemia, serial quantitative nucleic acid tests (NATs) can be used to indicate the need for potential treatment. As such, guidelines from the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation recommend the serial quantitative measurement of EBV DNAemia post-transplantation.

A wide range of commercial assays and laboratory-developed tests with which to assess EBV DNAemia are available, and results may be reported as copies/mL, copies/μg DNA, copies/number of cells, or IU/mL. The diversity in PCR methods and the lack of technical standardization are barriers to the optimal use of quantitative PCR assays, and they hinder comparisons of results between clinical laboratories, which is particularly important if patient testing is transferred to other laboratories.

### Fever with atypical lymphocytosis: Pearls and pitfalls in Epstein-Barr virus serology [^111dVUED]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

The heterophile antibody (also known as the Monospot) test is a useful screening tool for infectious mononucleosis (IM) resulting from primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. However, up to 10% of patients with IM are heterophile negative. Heterophile-negative patients who have lymphocytosis or atypical lymphocytes on a peripheral blood smear should be further tested for EBV serologies, which include testing for specific IgM and IgG antibodies against viral capsid antigens, early antigens, and EBV nuclear antigen proteins. A diagnostic dilemma arises when the patient has clinical and laboratory features of IM but is both heterophile negative and seronegative for IM, as illustrated in this case presentation. To avoid missed diagnoses of IM, misdiagnosis of mononucleosis-like illnesses, and unnecessary testing, knowledge of test characteristics and the evolving course of EBV serologies is important to assure and inform both the physician and the patient.

### Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in infancy [^114EWvav]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2001). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been shown to cause infectious mononucleosis (IM) and has complex associations with several malignant diseases. These EBV-associated diseases strongly incentivize the development of an EBV vaccine. Most primary EBV infections during infancy and early childhood are mild or subclinical. Little is known about its infection in infancy. The pattern of EBV serological response during infancy may be important for vaccine management.

- **Objectives**: This study has served to clarify the epidemiology and serology of primary EBV infection during early infancy.

- **Study design**: Longitudinal serum samples from 66 Hong Kong infants were tested for EBV antibodies by immunofluorescence. Cord blood and sequential serum samples from these infants were taken at birth and then at 4-month intervals up to 2 years of age.

- **Results**: Maternal antibodies were present at different levels in all cord blood specimens and in serum samples of 8 infants at 4 months of age. Evidenced by VCA-IgG seroconversion, 60.6% (40/66) of infants were infected during the first 2 years of life. One episode occurred before 8 months of age, but thereafter and for the remaining 16 months of follow-up until the infants were 2 years of age, the infection occurred at essentially a constant rate, affecting about 20% of the remaining seronegative infants every 4 months.

- **Conclusions**: The abrupt onset of the infection following a delay of 8 months is a remarkable feature of primary EBV infection during infancy, which implicates a protective role for maternal antibodies.

### Humoral immune response to EBV in multiple sclerosis is associated with disease activity on MRI [^11168PNX]. Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Evidence suggests that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) plays a role in triggering or perpetuating disease activity in multiple sclerosis (MS).

- **Methods**: We investigated 100 subjects (50 clinically isolated syndrome [CIS], 25 relapsing-remitting [RR] MS, 25 primary progressive [PP] MS) for (1) evidence of EBV reactivation and (2) disease activity as indicated by serial gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced MRIs over a 5-year period. EBV DNA in blood was quantified by real-time quantitative PCR and EBV serology for anti-Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) immunoglobulin G (IgG), anti-viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgG, and anti-EBV IgM. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis, analysis of variance, and logistic regression analysis.

- **Results**: All subjects had serologic evidence of previous EBV infection, but no lytic reactivation was detected. Significant differences in EBNA-1 IgG titers were found between subgroups, highest in the RRMS cohort compared with PPMS (p < 0.001) and CIS (p < 0.001). Gd-enhancing lesions on MRI correlated with EBNA-1 IgG (r = 0.33, p < 0.001) and EBNA-1:VCA IgG ratio (r = 0.36, p < 0.001). EBNA-1 IgG also correlated with change in T2 lesion volume (r = 0.27, p = 0.044) and Expanded Disability Status Scale score (r = 0.3, p = 0.035).

- **Conclusions**: The correlation between elevated Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) immunoglobulin G (IgG) and gadolinium-enhancing lesions suggests an association between Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and multiple sclerosis (MS) disease activity. The heightened immune response to EBV in MS is specific and notable.

### Evaluation of the Architect EBV VCA IgM, VCA IgG, and EBNA-1 IgG chemiluminescent immunoassays to assess EBV serostatus prior to transplantation [^115fGhK2]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Prior to the transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells or solid organs, the EBV serostatus of both donor and recipient must be determined to assess the risks of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders. The sensitivity of EBV viral capsid antigens (VCA) IgG and EBV nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) is critical for defining past infections, and good specificity of VCA IgM is necessary to avoid the disqualification of cord blood (CB) units. The Architect™ EBV antibody panel (Architect assay), which provides high throughput, was compared to a semi-automated ELISA (Etimax assays Diasorin) to assess the sensitivities and specificities of VCA and EBNA-1 IgG and VCA IgM on 419 sera collected from immunocompromised patients (n = 184) and from pregnant women who agreed to provide CB cells (n = 235).

Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation ranged from 1.63% to 4.8% for VCA IgM, VCA IgG, and EBNA-1 IgG. The indices of VCA IgG and IgM and EBNA IgG from the two assays were highly correlated. The concordance in interpretation between the two assays was moderate for VCA IgM (kappa = 0.5), substantial for VCA IgG (kappa = 0.60), and good for EBNA-1 IgG (kappa = 0.75). Using serial dilutions of positive controls and in accordance with clinical results, VCA IgG and EBNA IgG were detected at lower dilutions with Architect than with Etimax. Conversely, 96.1% (74/77) of samples that were negative with Architect and positive with Etimax for VCA IgM did not have any heterophile antibodies and had VCA IgG and EBNA IgG antibodies, supporting past infections. The Architect™ EBV serology panel provided good sensitivities and specificities for EBV serostatus determination.

### Natural history of Epstein-Barr virus replication and viral load dynamics after alemtuzumab-based allogeneic stem cell transplantation [^111xHYYH]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) load monitoring after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) enables earlier detection of EBV replication and often serves as a trigger for preemptive therapies aimed at reducing EBV-related diseases. Our institutional strategy is to treat patients with clinical signs of EBV-related disease accompanied by a rising viral load, rather than to intervene based solely on viral load. This affords an opportunity to study the natural history of EBV replication and to assess whether our strategy reduces overtreatment without compromising outcomes.

The objectives of the present study were to assess the natural history of untreated EBV replication in patients who underwent an alemtuzumab-based allogeneic HSCT and to examine whether our clinical strategy reduced overtreatment without compromising patient outcomes. In this retrospective single-center observational study of 515 consecutive patients (age ≥ 18 years) undergoing T cell-depleted allogeneic HSCT incorporating alemtuzumab, patients underwent surveillance monitoring for EBV by quantitative PCR in the peripheral blood at least weekly up to 100 days post-transplantation and longer if they remained on immunosuppressive therapy. The cumulative incidence of EBV detection and EBV-related disease were assessed.

Among the 515 patients, 192 had EBV DNA detectable on ≥ 1 occasion, with a cumulative incidence of 35.8% (31.8% to 40.4%), although this remained below the limit of quantification in 93 patients. The median time to first detection was 89.5 days (range, 0 to 2254 days). The incidence was…

### Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) early-antigen serologic testing in conjunction with peripheral blood EBV DNA load as a marker for risk of posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disease [^116jFwDs]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) early-antigen (EA) serologic profile was examined in conjunction with peripheral blood EBV DNA load to assess its value in evaluating the risk of developing posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). The cohort included 26 pediatric recipients of solid-organ transplants, 6 of whom developed PTLD. All 6 patients had high peripheral blood EBV DNA loads. Of the remaining 20 patients who did not develop PTLD, 14 had high EBV DNA loads, and 6 had low EBV DNA loads. None of the patients who developed PTLD had significant EA immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers. However, all 14 patients with high EBV DNA loads and without PTLD had high EA IgG titers, either at the time of initial high EBV DNA load or during the ensuing weeks. Here, we report that EBV DNA load analysis, combined with EA serologic analysis, is a potentially useful prognostic marker for evaluating the risk of developing PTLD.

### Analysis of the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of Epstein-Barr virus infection [^112sEWeA]. Journal of Medical Virology (2024). Low credibility.

The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is responsible for a spectrum of human diseases and demonstrates a considerable prevalence among various populations. Advances in molecular epidemiological research have enhanced our comprehension of EBV-related pathologies. In this study, our objective was to examine the epidemiological profile and clinical features of EBV infection in Chongqing, China. We enrolled patients suspected of EBV-related diseases who were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University between May 2013 and November 2022. Inclusion criteria were based on those who underwent EBV-specific immunofluorescence or plasma EBV-DNA testing.

Among 13,584 inpatients, the overall seropositivity rates for EBNA-1-IgG, EBV-VCA-IgM, EBV-EA-IgG, EBV-EA-IgA, EBV-VCA-IgA, and EBV-DNA were 91.89%, 7.22%, 18.00%, 16.19%, 30.78%, and 18.00%, respectively. The seropositivity rate for EBNA-1-IgG steadily increased with age. The seropositivity rate for VCA-IgM, an indicator of acute EBV infection, was highest in patients aged 11–20 years at 26.41%, decreasing to 2%-6% in older patients. Additionally, among 205 outpatients, the EBV-DNA positivity rate was 14.15%.

In 3,670 individuals from health check-up centers, the seropositivity rates for EBV-EA-IgA and EBV-VCA-IgA were 11.96% and 28.09%, respectively, and the EBV-DNA positivity rate was 11.92%, all of which were lower than those in inpatients. Among the 762 EBV-DNA positive inpatients, adults aged 31–40 years were the least affected, with a seropositivity rate of 12.00%, which increased with age.

### Recommendations for Epstein-Barr virus-based screening for nasopharyngeal cancer in high- and intermediate-risk regions [^112iZmVj]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2023). High credibility.

Here, we summarize the key knowledge gaps identified during the meeting to help define priorities for research in this area in the coming years. Although we avoid prescribing specific studies to address existent gaps, there is a consensus that, to the extent possible, randomized clinical trials should be considered to address these important knowledge gaps.

With sufficient evidence to support the implementation of screening programs, subsequent monitoring of short-term (incidence, stage distribution) and long-term (morbidity, overall mortality) impact of the programs will be important. We therefore recommend that plans for monitoring the impact of NPC screening programs be developed and implemented in parallel with the development and implementation of the screening programs themselves.

- **Unanswered questions on screening for the early detection of and morbidity and/or mortality reduction from NPC**: Serum antibody and plasma DNA EBV have been shown to be highly sensitive tests to screen for prevalent, asymptomatic early stage NPC. However, no formal head-to-head comparison of these tests has been performed in a large study cohort, except one for evaluation among high-risk individuals with a positive family history of NPC. Future studies should consider testing to allow for direct comparisons between alternative screening strategies, including their cost-effectiveness. These studies might also address the potential complementary roles of the two EBV-based biomarkers.

### The case for targeting latent and lytic Epstein-Barr virus infection in multiple sclerosis [^113QoH8C]. Brain (2025). Low credibility.

Future directions for proving EBV's causal role in MS include conducting large-scale, long-term studies that initially follow EBV-negative individuals and monitor their immunological health over time to see what happens after asymptomatic or symptomatic EBV seroconversion. This will uncover the mechanisms by which EBV might trigger MS and autoimmunity in general. Working out what happens during infectious mononucleosis and how it might affect the CNS is critical for identifying new therapeutic strategies.

Developing new animal models that try to mimic the development of MS and the role of EBV or related herpes virus will help with mechanistic studies. A good start would be to extend research into Japanese macaque encephalomyelitis, a spontaneous MS-like disease in a non-human primate caused by a gamma herpes virus. This would allow researchers to study the effects of EBV infection and potential antiviral therapies in a controlled environment.

Other strategies include investigating the role of EBV viral load and lytic activity in MS patients and correlating it with clinical, radiological, and other biomarkers of disease activity; executing well-designed clinical trials to test the efficacy of EBV antiviral drugs and EBV-targeted immunotherapies in MS patients, as highlighted in this review; exploring a personalized medicine approach where an individual's EBV status, viral load, and other factors are studied to help identify patients who might benefit from antiviral therapies; and investigating the potential of combining antiviral therapies with other MS treatments.

### Diagnostic value of Epstein-Barr viral serology in nasopharyngeal carcinoma [^1113VAVL]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2000). Low credibility.

Although Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) IgA serology has been established as an effective marker for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), it remains unclear how useful or cost-effective it is as a screening test. This article is aimed at establishing how these tests could be used most effectively in the diagnosis of NPC in an otolaryngology outpatient clinic. A total of 111 consecutive patients with NPC and an equal number of control subjects were studied. Forty-seven patients with NPC had early (AJCC stages 1 and 2) and 64 had advanced (stages 3 and 4) disease. A positive early antigen (EA) serology result was found in 81.2% of NPC patients and in none of the controls. Negative EA and viral capsid antigen (VCA) serology results were present in 2.7% of NPC patients and in 46.8% of controls. Negative EA and positive VCA serology results were found in 30.0% of NPC patients with early disease, 7.8% of NPC patients with advanced disease, and 53.2% of controls. Given its high specificity, serology for EA is recommended as a clinically useful screening test. Serology for VCA, although highly sensitive, has an unacceptably high false-positive rate, and its cost-effectiveness as a universal screening test is questionable.

### Incidence of Epstein-Barr virus reactivation is elevated in COVID-19 patients [^116FXKSm]. Virus Research (2023). Low credibility.

After primary EBV infection is resolved and latency is established, antibodies against the latent Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) are produced. Anti-EBNA-1 IgG antibodies are not present during the acute phase of EBV but become detectable 2–4 months after infection and persist for life. Detection of EBNA-1 IgG indicates a past infection. EBV reactivation results in expression of lytic gene products such as the viral capsid antigen (VCA) and early antigen-diffuse (EA-D). Anti-VCA IgM is detectable early in infection and reactivation but falls to undetectable levels in approximately 6 weeks. Anti-EA-D IgG also appears early after infection (3–4 weeks) and reactivation and typically falls to undetectable levels in approximately 4 months. Detection of antibodies against VCA IgM and EA-D IgG is an indicator of EBV reactivation. However, diagnosing EBV reactivation on serology alone can produce different results depending on the patient's disease course and the instability of anti-EBV antibodies before the appearance of symptoms. EBV DNA is frequently detectable in plasma during early infection and reactivation. qPCR detection of EBV DNA is more sensitive than serology in terms of evaluating reactivation.

This study aims to determine if COVID-19 positive patients experience increased levels of EBV reactivation compared to COVID-19 negative patients and differs from previous studies in that samples were collected at a time when the Omicron variant was the dominant strain in the area.

### Epstein-Barr virus: an important vaccine target for cancer prevention [^115CWWLm]. Science Translational Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Participants at the February 2011 meeting at the U.S. National Institutes of Health on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) vaccine research recommend that future clinical trials have two goals: prevention of infectious mononucleosis and EBV-associated cancers, facilitated by identification of disease-predictive surrogate markers.

### Application of virus-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgG, and IgA antibody detection with a polyantigenic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus infections in childhood [^114fni13]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

The Enzygnost anti-Epstein-Barr virus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system, based on a defined antigen mixture and detection of antibodies of the immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, and IgA classes, was evaluated for its reliability in diagnosing Epstein-Barr virus infections in childhood. With samples from 66 children, the Epstein-Barr virus status and infection phase were defined by indirect immunofluorescence and anticomplement fluorescence assays: 11 children were seronegative, 8 had a primary infection, 20 had a recent primary or past infection, and in 27, a reactivated Epstein-Barr virus infection was diagnosed.

When applying the Enzygnost ELISAs, 15 serum samples (22.7%) were not interpretable due to indeterminate results in at least one of the assays used and were therefore excluded from further evaluation. The respective sensitivities and specificities for the diagnosis of seronegativity were 100% and 100%, those for the diagnosis of primary infection were 100% and 97%, those for the diagnosis of recent primary or past infection were 100% and 52%, and those for the diagnosis of reactivated infection were 10% and 100%. This poor performance of the Enzygnost system with reactivated infections is due to the prerequisite of an IgG antibody value of > 650 IU/ml for the diagnosis of viral activity, which was fulfilled in only two of the children. Despite the high rate of indeterminate results, the Enzygnost system is useful in diagnosing acute and past Epstein-Barr virus infections in childhood.

### Comparison of Elecsys and Liaison immunoassays to determine Epstein-Barr virus serological status using further diagnostic approaches to clarify discrepant results [^116pTrp5]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Low credibility.

Serological markers for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection are commonly used to diagnose infectious mononucleosis and establish a serological status in pre-transplant patients. This study prospectively assessed 1043 serum specimens sent to the laboratory for physician-ordered EBV testing. The three markers — antiviral capsid antigen (VCA) immunoglobulin M (IgM), anti-VCA immunoglobulin G (IgG), and anti-Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) antibodies — were tested using the Elecsys and the Liaison immunoassays. Specimens with discrepant results between the two assays were assessed using further EBV diagnostic approaches to conclude on the EBV serological status.

In spite of substantial agreement between the two assays (88%) and with the presumed EBV status (> 92%), the results showed differences in the performance of the assays. Liaison VCA IgM appeared to be the most sensitive test for the detection of the 38 sera classified as early primary infection in comparison with the Elecsys assay (91.4% vs. 68.6%, p = 0.008). Excluding the cases of early primary infection, the sensitivity values of the VCA IgM marker were comparable between the Liaison and Elecsys assays (95.2% and 92.9%, respectively, p = 1).

Concerning the sera classified as past infection (n = 763), the Elecsys assay showed higher sensitivity values for the detection of the VCA and EBNA IgG markers in comparison with the Liaison assay (99.9% and 99.7% vs. 97.4% and 91.2%, respectively, p < 0.001). Overall, the Elecsys and Liaison assays showed similar performance. The interpretation of EBV serological profiles based on the clinical context is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.

### Single-assay combination of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) EBNA1- and viral capsid antigen-p18-derived synthetic peptides for measuring anti-EBV immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA antibody levels in sera from nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients: options for field screening [^111Dm5XW]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

Assessment of immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody responses to various Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigen complexes, usually involving multiple serological assays, is important for the early diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Through the combination of two synthetic peptides representing immunodominant epitopes of EBNA1 and viral capsid antigen (VCA)-p18, we developed a one-step sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the specific detection of EBV reactive IgG and IgA antibodies in NPC patients (EBV IgG/IgA ELISA).

Sera were obtained from healthy donors (n = 367), non-NPC head and neck cancer patients (n = 43), and biopsy-proven NPC patients (n = 296) of Indonesian and Chinese origin. Higher values of optical density at 450 nm for EBV IgG were observed in NPC patients compared to the healthy EBV carriers, but the large overlap limits its use for NPC diagnosis. Using either EBNA1 or VCA-p18 peptides alone, IgA ELISA correctly identified 88.5% and 79.8% of Indonesian NPC patients, with specificities of 80.1% and 70.9%, whereas combined single-well coating with both peptides yielded sensitivity and specificity values of 90.1% and 85.4%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively) for the combined EBNA1 plus VCA EBV IgA ELISA were 78.7% and 93.9%, respectively. In the Indonesia panel, the level of EBV IgA reactivity was not associated with NPC tumor size, lymph node involvement, metastasis stage, sex, and age group. In the China panel, the sensitivity/specificity values were 86.2/92.0% (EBNA1 IgA) and 84.1/90.3% (VCA-p18).

### Elevated EBNA-1 IgG in MS is associated with genetic MS risk variants [^1124gGvu]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

The etiology of MS involves genetic predispositions and exposure to environmental factors, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Genetic risk factors for MS include specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and approximately 100 adaptive immune-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with modest odds ratios compared to the major HLA-DRB1*1501 association and EBV exposure.

Almost all patients with MS are infected with EBV, compared with 90%–95% in healthy controls. A history of EBV-related infectious mononucleosis and elevated EBV nuclear antigen 1 immunoglobulin γ (IgG) levels increase the risk of developing MS later in life. Recently, a meta-analysis showed that antibodies against the latency-associated Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) are consistently increased in patients with MS compared with healthy EBV carriers, whereas results for the lytic viral capsid antigen and early antigen D are more heterogeneous.

Epidemiologic and genetic studies support interactions between EBV and HLA-DRB1*15 on an additive scale. It is currently unclear whether the MS risk SNPs are associated with enhanced IgG levels against EBV.

We hypothesized that certain MS risk SNPs are involved in the increased humoral immune response against EBV. Serum IgG levels against the EBV antigen EBNA-1 were measured, and associations with MS risk SNPs were assessed.

### Comparison of Elecsys and Liaison immunoassays to determine Epstein-Barr virus serological status using further diagnostic approaches to clarify discrepant results [^115w8NLR]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Low credibility.

Serological markers for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection are commonly used to diagnose infectious mononucleosis and establish a serological status in pretransplant patients. This study prospectively assessed 1043 serum specimens sent to the laboratory for physician-ordered EBV testing. The three markers — antiviral capsid antigen (VCA) immunoglobulin M (IgM), anti-VCA immunoglobulin G (IgG), and anti-Epstein–Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) antibodies — were tested using the Elecsys and the Liaison immunoassays. Specimens with discrepant results between the two assays were assessed using further EBV diagnostic approaches to conclude on the EBV serological status.

In spite of substantial agreement between the two assays (88%) and with the presumed EBV status (> 92%), the results showed differences in the performance of the assays. Liaison VCA IgM appeared to be the most sensitive test for the detection of the 38 sera classified as early primary infection in comparison with the Elecsys assay (91.4% vs. 68.6%, p = 0.008).

### Proposed guidelines for diagnosing chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection [^114AxSEX]. American Journal of Hematology (2005). Low credibility.

Since the initial report of unusual manifestations possibly associated with chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection (CAEBV), nearly three decades have passed. During this period, reported cases with this entity have dramatically increased worldwide. Additionally, the recent development of diagnostic procedures, including molecular biological and immunological techniques, has provided us with the ability to define certain diseases, especially malignant disorders. Guidelines, derived mainly from the literature and recent experiences with CAEBV in Japan, for diagnosing CAEBV are proposed to clarify this enigmatic disease.

### Peripheral blood Epstein-Barr viral nucleic acid surveillance as a marker for posttransplant cancer risk [^115XaDg7]. American Journal of Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Several viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus, are now known to be associated with several human cancers, but not all patients with these viral infections develop cancer. In transplantation, such viruses often have a prolonged time gap from infection to cancer development, and many are preceded by a period of circulating and detectable nucleic acids in the peripheral blood compartment. The interpretation of a viral load as a measure of posttransplant risk of developing cancer depends on the virus, the cancer, and associated pathogenic factors. This review describes the state of knowledge regarding the utility and limitations of peripheral blood nucleic acid testing for Epstein-Barr virus in surveillance and risk prediction for posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders.

### Recommendations for Epstein-Barr virus-based screening for nasopharyngeal cancer in high- and intermediate-risk regions [^112xGAGq]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2023). High credibility.

Follow-up of individuals without an immediate diagnosis of NPC

The formulation of a clinical follow-up plan should consider the follow-up modalities, frequency of follow-up, and when to terminate the follow-up. However, there is a paucity of evidence to support best practice, so the suggestions below are based on the limited data, experience, and discussions during the meeting.

A high risk of NPC among screen-positive individuals has been shown in the initial years following a screen-positive result. In one key study that followed a group of 1,445 asymptomatic individuals with a moderate or high serum EBV antibody score (defined as EBV VCA/EBNA1 IgA score ≥ 0.65) in the Guangdong NPC screening trial, a total of 38 NPC cases were identified over the course of four years. Of these 38 NPC cases, the majority (i.e. n = 25, 66%) were identified at the time of the initial positive screen, 12 NPC cases in the first-year follow-up, and 1 NPC case in the second-year follow-up. No NPC cases were identified four years after the initial screen. The findings therefore support more frequent follow-up in the initial 1–2 years following a screen-positive result.

### Recommendations for Epstein-Barr virus-based screening for nasopharyngeal cancer in high- and intermediate-risk regions [^111TBLU2]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2023). High credibility.

For screen-positive, asymptomatic individuals with negative nasoendoscopy and MRI, endoscopy is useful for detecting an emerging small NPC during follow-up. Interval nasopharyngeal endoscopy with photo documentation would facilitate recognition of subtle changes. EBV-based biomarkers could be repeated to see if the status (positive vs negative) has changed. Specifically, there is a lack of data on the complementary roles of EBV-based biomarkers; for example, whether plasma EBV DNA could help differentiate those who need follow-up among EBV antibody screen-positive subjects. For individuals with persistent positive EBV-based testing results, MRI is useful for excluding small, concealed tumors. For those who have already undergone MRI or for those with a suspicious abnormality on the initial MRI without biopsy-proven NPC, follow-up MRI using a short screening protocol without contrast can evaluate interval changes indicative of disease.

- **Optimal timing and frequency of follow-up**: The optimal timing and frequency for follow-up is unknown, but in general, more frequent follow-up (e.g. 6 monthly) should be arranged in the first year when most NPCs are diagnosed.

- **Termination of follow-up**: As available data suggest an elevated risk of NPC for the initial 1–2 years following a positive screen, the termination of follow-up could be considered 2 years after the screening test. Follow-up may need to be extended to 3–4 years if MRI is not available. Given the high negative predictive value (NPV) of MRI, future studies may determine if EBV tests alone are sufficient.

### Anti-EBV antibodies: Roles in diagnosis, pathogenesis, and antiviral therapy [^114Gf2ct]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). High credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is prevalent in the global population and is associated with multiple malignancies and autoimmune diseases. During infection, EBV-harbored or infected cell-expressing antigens can elicit a variety of antibodies that play significant roles in the viral host response and pathogenesis. These antibodies have been extensively evaluated and found valuable in predicting disease diagnosis and prognosis, exploring disease mechanisms, and developing antiviral agents. In this review, we discuss the versatile roles of EBV antibodies as important biomarkers for EBV-related diseases, potential driving factors of autoimmunity, and promising therapeutic agents for viral infection and pathogenesis.

### Aberrant Epstein-Barr virus persistence in HIV carriers is characterized by anti-Epstein-Barr virus IgA and high cellular viral loads with restricted transcription [^111cnaRa]. AIDS (2007). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive lymphomas in HIV carriers are paralleled by elevated EBV-DNA loads in the circulation. Approximately 20% of asymptomatic HIV carriers also show elevated circulating EBV-DNA loads. We aimed to characterize the nature of this EBV DNA and to determine the transcriptional phenotype of EBV in blood, in relation to serological parameters.

- **Design**: A total of 197 random asymptomatic HIV carriers, representing 2% of the Dutch HIV-positive population, were sampled for blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and plasma. In addition, 39 EBV-DNA carriers were sampled twice, with a 5-year interval.

- **Methods**: EBV-DNA loads were determined by LightCycler-based real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). EBV transcription was studied by nucleic acid sequence-based amplification and reverse transcriptase PCR. IgA and IgG antibodies to EBV antigens EBNA1 and VCA-p18 were quantified by synthetic peptide-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

- **Results**: Elevated EBV-DNA loads were found in whole blood of 19.3% of the tested HIV population, which were persistent in 82%. Plasma samples were EBV-DNA negative, and circulating EBV DNA could be attributed to the B-cell compartment. Transcription of only LMP2 and (non-translated) transcripts from the BamHI-A region of the EBV genome was found, whereas EBNA1, LMP1, and lytic EBV transcripts were absent despite high cellular EBV-DNA loads. IgA-reactivity to VCA-p18 was seen in 69%. IgG to VCA-p18 was significantly higher in high EBV-DNA load carriers.

- **Conclusion**: Asymptomatic HIV carriers show aberrant EB.

### Comparison of Elecsys and Liaison immunoassays to determine Epstein-Barr virus serological status using further diagnostic approaches to clarify discrepant results [^113NvrLA]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). High credibility.

Immunofluorescence assays (IFA) are considered the gold standard for EBV serology. Nevertheless, because performing and interpreting IFA is labor-intensive and sometimes subjective, many laboratories use commercially available immunoassays based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or chemiluminescent methods. These assays show good agreement with gold standard assays and are easier to perform. Diagnostic approaches based on IFA, heterophile testing, immunoblot analysis, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to clarify some atypical serological results previously determined by immunoassays.

This large prospective study aimed to evaluate the newly developed automated Elecsys EBV immunoassay compared to a widely used immunoassay in laboratories, the Liaison EBV immunoassay. Further diagnostic approaches for EBV diagnosis were performed when discrepant results were observed between the two assays. The independent evaluation of automated immunoassays is crucial to help biologists and clinicians in interpreting EBV serological status and managing transplanted patients or patients suspected of IM.

### Epstein-Barr virus: The impact of scientific advances on clinical practice [^116W3ajD]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a tumorigenic herpes virus that predominantly infects and persists in B lymphocytes across the majority of humans, generally without causing disease. However, in a minority of individuals, the virus is associated with significant pathology, particularly benign and malignant lymphoproliferations. Recent advancements in understanding the mechanisms of EBV persistence, immune control of primary and persistent infection, and disease pathogenesis are being translated into clinical practice. These advancements include novel methods of diagnosis, prevention, and treatment, thereby contributing to improved patient care. This review focuses on these recent advances in the field of hematology/oncology.

### Febrile palpebral edema [^115ZwGfW]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Question 2: Which one of the following tests is expected to be found with the diagnosis of the presented case?

- **A. Negative heterophile antibodies**: Incorrect. Heterophile antibodies may be sufficient in case of positivity with a typical clinical picture of EBV infection. Otherwise, anti-VCA and anti-EBNA are required for the diagnosis. Moreover, young children aged < 4 years may not develop a positive heterophile antibody response during EBV primoinfection.

- **B. Immunoglobulin M (IgM)-viral capsid antigen (VCA) − IgG-VCA + anti-Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) − antiearly antigen (anti-EA) −**: Incorrect. This serologic profile is consistent with a convalescent infection.

- **C. IgM-VCA + IgG-VCA + anti-EBNA − anti-EA +**: Correct. This serologic profile is consistent with an EBV primoinfection. Anti-EA antibodies are the markers of acute infection, appearing in early disease. IgM anti-VCA are also usually found at the onset of the disease, but studies report the existence of false positive results, especially with cytomegalovirus infections.

- **D. IgM-VCA − IgG-VCA − anti-EBNA − anti-EA −**: Incorrect. This serologic profile is not consistent with an EBV infection.

- **E. IgM-VCA − IgG-VCA + anti-EBNA + anti-EA −**: Incorrect. This serologic profile is consistent with…

### Serological diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus infection by novel ELISAs based on recombinant capsid antigens p23 and p18 [^116ug8Ue]. Journal of Medical Virology (2001). Low credibility.

A new pair of Epstein-Barr virus ELISAs (Biotest Anti-EBV VCA IgG and VCA IgM ELISA) was evaluated for its usefulness in the routine diagnosis of acute EBV infections. The ELISAs are based on two viral capsid antigens (VCA), p23 (BLRF2, full-length) and p18 (BFRF3, carboxy-half), which are combined by autologous gene fusion. In total, 179 sera were tested in direct comparison with classical VCA immunofluorescence assays (IFA).

With the help of clinical data and additional reference serology, such as heterophile antibodies, anti-EA IgG (IFA), and anti-EBNA-1 IgG (ELISA), the patients were divided into the following categories: seronegatives (46), acute primary infections (67), previous infections (39), suspected reactivations (20), and constellations with intermediate serological patterns (7). The VCA IgG and VCA IgM ELISAs showed overall agreement with IFA of 95.0% and 94.4%, respectively.

The calculated analytical performance (sensitivity; specificity) of VCA IgG and VCA IgM was 94.0%; 97.8% and 97.1%; 96.5%, respectively. A certain delay in seroconversion of anti-p23-p18 IgG may account for a significant difference in sensitivity of the VCA IgG ELISA between primary (88.4%) and previous infections (100%).

In summary, the new recombinant VCA ELISAs yielded good correlation with VCA IFA and, in combination with EBNA-1 IgG, allows rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis or EBV immune status in general.

### Positive Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus IgM assays in primary HIV infection [^1149wXTr]. Journal of Medical Virology (2011). Low credibility.

We report three cases with misleading cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immunoglobulin M (IgM) results during primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We determined the rate of positive anti-CMV IgM assays or anti-EBV capsid antigen IgM assays in sera from a group of well-characterized subjects with primary HIV infection as 2.9% (1/35; 95% CI: 0.15–16.6%) for each infection. The rate of positive anti-EBV capsid antigen IgM assays in subjects with positive hepatitis A virus IgM assays was 30% (6/20; 95% CI: 14.6–51.9%). Clinicians need to consider the limitations of IgM assays for diagnosis of herpesvirus infections and consider testing for other infections with overlapping clinical manifestations.

### Comparison of Elecsys and Liaison immunoassays to determine Epstein-Barr virus serological status using further diagnostic approaches to clarify discrepant results [^115WSttM]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Low credibility.

EBV serology is also useful for determining the serological status in transplantation contexts to match the EBV status of the donor with that of the recipient and assess the risk of lymphoproliferative disorders.

In this setting, both assays showed excellent specificity regarding seronegative status. However, the study revealed differences in the assays' performance in clearly ascertaining the status of a past infection. Among the sera classified as past infection, the Liaison assay reported 10% discrepant profiles with the EBV status established by the reference laboratory. The most frequently discrepant profiles obtained with the Liaison assays were isolated IgG VCA (n = 30), presence of the three markers (n = 23), isolated EBNA IgG (n = 15), and seronegative status (n = 3).

Isolated VCA and EBNA IgG patterns obtained with the Liaison assay were in line with a relative lack of sensitivity of VCA and EBNA IgG markers with this assay. Previous studies reported that an isolated VCA IgG pattern is commonly associated with a past infection and, to a lesser extent, can also correspond to a primary infection. Among the discrepant results displaying an isolated IgG VCA IgG profile in the Elecsys assay (n = 14), we classified four sera as seronegative, two sera as primary infection, three sera as confirmed isolated VCA IgG (using the immunoblot IgG test), two sera as past infection, and three sera remained inconclusive. All discrepant results with isolated VCA IgG with the Liaison assays were classified as past infection. An isolated EBNA IgG pattern with the Elecsys assay was reported.

### Complete Epstein-Barr virus seropositivity in a large cohort of patients with early multiple sclerosis [^113dmAMi]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Low credibility.

A retrospective analysis of EBV seroprevalence was conducted on a large hospital population. We retrospectively analyzed results of EBV serologies, which were performed for routine diagnostic purposes in 16,163 persons at Labor Berlin GmbH, Berlin, Germany, between January 2014 and December 2016. Sera were sent for EBV serological testing from individuals treated as inpatients or outpatients at university hospitals (Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin) located in Berlin or community hospitals located in Berlin and Northern Germany. The 16,163 individuals were included irrespective of diagnoses or the reasons for ordering EBV serologies. For individuals tested more than once during the study period, only the results of the first EBV serology were considered.

From all persons included in the analysis, results of serological tests for EBNA-1 IgG, VCA IgG, and VCA IgM had to be available. Notably, EBNA-1 IgG is a marker of past EBV infection, VCA IgG can be found in primary and past EBV infections, and VCA IgM is a marker of primary EBV infection. Testing for EBNA-1 IgG, VCA IgG, and VCA IgM was performed by Liaison automated quantitative CLIA using undiluted sera. Thus, the same method (Liaison CLIA) was used for testing patients with CIS/RRMS and patients from the hospital population, with sera of patients with CIS/RRMS being measured in dilution and sera of patients from the hospital population being measured without dilution. According to the manufacturer's recommendations, in undiluted sera, EBNA-1 IgG levels < 5 U/mL were considered negative, levels between 5 and 20 U/mL were considered equivocal.

### Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) deletions as biomarkers of response to treatment of chronic active EBV [^112AH1mo]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (CAEBV) disease is a rare condition characterized by persistent EBV infection in previously healthy individuals. Defective EBV genomes were found in East Asian patients with CAEBV. In the present study, we sequenced 14 blood EBV samples from three UK patients with CAEBV, comparing the results with saliva CAEBV samples and other conditions. We observed EBV deletions in blood, some of which may disrupt viral replication but not in saliva, in CAEBV. Deletions were lost over time after successful treatment. These findings are compatible with CAEBV being associated with the evolution and persistence of EBV+ haematological clones that are lost on successful treatment.

### Age-specific prevalence of Epstein-Barr virus infection among Minnesota children: Effects of race/ethnicity and family environment [^116cG8xg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection affects the host differently according to when in life it is acquired. Understanding risk factors for infection could be important for disease prevention, and the age-specific prevalence of infection must be known to optimize the use of a prophylactic vaccine.

- **Methods**: Children 18 months to 19.9 years of age who had blood drawn for medical indications during an outpatient visit were eligible. Sera were tested for immunoglobulin G antibodies against EBV viral capsid antigen by enzyme immunoassay. Family demographic and socioeconomic data were obtained via scripted telephone questionnaires.

- **Results**: Consent was given for 876 of 914 (96%) subjects approached. Sera were available for 782 of 876 (89%) subjects, and demographic/socioeconomic data were obtained for 705 (90%) of them. Antibody prevalence, adjusted for age and sex, was as follows: non-Hispanic blacks, 74%; Asians, 62%; multiracial children, 54%; Hispanics, 50%; and non-Hispanic whites, 26%. The pattern of increases in antibody prevalence with age differed significantly by race/ethnicity and was most divergent in the two youngest age groups. Adjusted EBV antibody prevalence decreased with greater household education among non-Hispanic whites, but was not associated with any other socioeconomic factor. In 42 of 51 (82%) families with more than one child in the study, the siblings' EBV antibody status was concordant (bootstrap P < .001).

- **Conclusions**: Racial/ethnic differences in EBV antibody prevalence and concordance of antibody status among siblings prompt us to speculate that both…

### Serum IgA antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) early lytic antigens are present in primary EBV infection [^11336gqg]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is characterized by the presence of IgM antibodies to viral capsid antigen and the absence of antibodies to EB nuclear antigen. Here, using a flow cytometry-based assay, we investigated whether IgA antibodies are a marker for primary infection. Serum IgA antibodies in 15 individuals with primary EBV infection reacted with 15%-55.6% of HH514–16 Burkitt lymphoma cells expressing early lytic antigens (EAs), whereas IgA antibodies in serum samples from 15 healthy EBV-seropositive individuals reacted with 0.02%-2% of cells with EAs (p < 0.0001). IgA antibodies in primary infection were directed against the Bam Z Epstein-Barr replication activator (ZEBRA) (BZLF1) and diffuse EA (BMRF1) EAs. Thus, IgA antibodies to EBV EAs are produced during primary EBV infection and are likely to be stimulated as a result of lytic EBV replication in mucosal sites. Detection of IgA antibodies to EA may be developed into a diagnostic tool for primary EBV infection.

Detection of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) DNA by PCR in serum demonstrated a sensitivity of 80%, a specificity of 94%, and positive and negative predictive values of 95% and 79%, respectively, for diagnosing primary EBV infection. We suggest that this is a useful addition to the panel of tests used for this purpose.

- **Results**: Among the 1043 sera analyzed in both the Elecsys and Liaison assays, 211 (20%) were discordant for at least one marker, but the interpretation of the serological pattern differed from one assay to another for only 130 sera (12%), according to the manufacturers' recommendations. In 80% of cases (n = 62), the sera reclassified as concordant displayed a past infection pattern with the presence of equivocal anti‐VCA IgM in one assay versus negative IgM antibodies in the other (combined with anti‐VCA and EBNA IgG positive in both assays). In 20% of cases (n = 19), the sera displayed an early primary infection pattern in one assay (IgM eq/positive, anti‐VCA IgG and anti‐EBNA negative) and a primary infection profile in the other (IgM eq/positive, anti‐VCA IgG positive, and anti‐EBNA negative).

Among the 130 sera requiring assessment at the reference laboratory, a total of 182 complementary analyses were performed, including 106 Vidas assays with determination of the three markers (i.e. 318 tests), 32 IgG/IgM immunoblots, 21 tests for detection of heterophile antibodies, 17 IFA for detection of IgG/IgM anti‐VCA antibodies, and six PCR for EBV DNA detection. EBV serological statuses could be attributed to 122 sera out of 130, but the status of eight sera could not be resolved (lack of sample or sera remaining inconclusive despite expert assessment). In conclusion, the overall distribution of serological profiles included the following patterns: n = 77 primary infection (7%), n = 160 seronegative (16%), and n = 763.

### Epstein Barr virus antibody and cancer risk in two prospective cohorts in Southern China [^114VZ8sG]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Our study has several limitations. Firstly, it was conducted in Southern China, where the local populations exhibit a distinct genetic background, and specific EBV subtypes are associated with NPC risk. While heterogeneity analyses, such as I² and Cochrane Q tests, were performed to evaluate consistency between the Zhongshan and Wuzhou cohorts, minimal statistical differences were found for most cancer types. However, inherent differences in cohort characteristics, such as recruitment periods, sex distribution, and covariate availability, remain a limitation. These variations may introduce confounding that cannot be fully addressed through meta-analysis. Future studies with harmonized data collection across diverse populations are needed to confirm these findings.

- **Residual confounding**: The Wuzhou cohort lacked detailed covariate information, potentially influencing hazard ratios, particularly regarding smoking. However, given that less than 1.0% of females are smokers in China, subgroup analysis for females showed consistent results with total and male data, minimizing this concern. Sensitivity analyses in the Zhongshan cohort supported stable associations after adjusting for different covariables, reinforcing the reliability of our findings. We acknowledged that the ASRs for lung cancer and lymphoma in VCA-IgA seropositive individuals were not significantly higher than the seronegative ones in the Wuzhou cohort. This discrepancy may reflect variability in cohort characteristics or other region-specific factors. Replication in other studies is needed to better understand these differences.

### Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) deletions as biomarkers of response to treatment of chronic active EBV [^112D8Lk7]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infects more than 95% of the population worldwide. A small number of patients develop life‐threatening persistence of high‐level EBV replication following an infectious mononucleosis syndrome, often associated with splenomegaly and hepatitis. Chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease is characterized by the infiltration of tissues by EBV-positive T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, or less frequently B cells, and can progress into lymphoproliferative disease. Clonal expansion of EBV‐infected T or NK cells is well described.

At the time of writing, CAEBV has been mostly described in Asian or South/Central American patients. Frequent deletions in the EBV genome have been found in samples from Japanese CAEBV patients (35%) and other EBV‐driven neoplasms. However, it is unclear if these deletions are specific to Asian EBV strains, whether they are present in viral genomes in different sites, and how they evolve over time.

In the present study, we sequenced EBV from serial blood samples obtained from three UK patients with CAEBV disease. The results were compared with sequences from the saliva of patients with CAEBV and blood and tissue from other benign and malignant EBV‐related conditions.

### Quantitative Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serology in lung transplant recipients with primary EBV infection and/or post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease [^111AQpmV]. Journal of Medical Virology (2003). Low credibility.

The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific antibody response was studied in lung transplant patients to assess its value in the diagnosis and prognosis of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. Recently developed synthetic peptides representing Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1), diffuse early antigen (EA(D)), and virus capsid antigen (VCA) were studied using a semiquantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to analyze antibody patterns in 12 seronegative lung transplant patients, of whom four developed post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease, and seven seropositive lung transplant patients, all of whom developed post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease. The immunoblot technique was used as a control.

All 12 EBV-seronegative patients exhibited a very limited antibody response, primarily restricted to VCA antibodies. EA(D) antibodies became detectable in only two patients. Notably, the antibody response never preceded the clinical diagnosis of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease in the four EBV-seronegative patients who developed the disease. In the seven seropositive lung transplant patients with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease, an increase in antibody titer was observed in only two patients. Immunoblot analysis confirmed these serological findings.

In conclusion, EBV-specific antibody patterns after lung transplantation are highly restricted and variable, and they are of limited value for the diagnosis or prognosis of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease.

### How I treat EBV lymphoproliferation [^114wfiT3]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated B-cell lymphoproliferation is a life-threatening complication following hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplantation, resulting from the outgrowth of EBV-infected B cells that would normally be controlled by EBV-cytotoxic T cells. Over the past decade, early detection strategies, such as serial measurement of EBV-DNA load in peripheral blood samples, have assisted in identifying high-risk patients and diagnosing early lymphoproliferation.

Treatment options include manipulating the balance between outgrowing EBV-infected B cells and the EBV cytotoxic T lymphocyte response, as well as targeting the B cells with monoclonal antibodies or chemotherapy. Major challenges remain in defining indications for preemptive therapies and integrating novel and conventional therapies.

### Epidemiology and clinical features of Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus infections in Japanese infants and young children [^114hA4Dx]. Journal of Medical Virology (2025). High credibility.

The recent clinical features of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections in young children in developed countries remain unclear. This study investigated the clinical features of EBV and CMV infections and the latest seroepidemiology in Japan.

Seroprevalence was analyzed using 303 stored serum samples with commercial Enzyme Immunosorbent Assay kits, and viral infections were investigated in a cohort of febrile children under 5 years of age. After maternal antibody levels declined, the seroprevalences of EBV and CMV gradually increased by adolescence to 42.9% and 57.1%, respectively. Among 2,732 febrile children, serum EBV and CMV DNAs were detected in 1.76% and 1.24%, respectively.

- **Primary EBV-infected patients**: Of 25 patients, 15 (60.0%) had infectious mononucleosis (IM) with significantly higher IM frequency, WBC, atypical lymphocyte ratios, AST, ALT, LDH, and EBV DNA load compared to EBV-reactivated patients. No CMV DNA-positive patients had IM. Among primary EBV-infected patients, those with IM were older and had more atypical lymphocytes and higher EBV DNA load than those without IM. The age of primary EBV infection appears to have decreased compared to reports from Western countries in the 1990s. Even among children under 5 years of age, 60.0% of those with primary EBV infection developed IM.

### Incidence of Epstein-Barr virus reactivation is elevated in COVID-19 patients [^112YjL4Y]. Virus Research (2023). High credibility.

Detection of EA-D IgG and VCA IgM as determinants of EBV reactivation:

- **Samples testing positive**: For the presence of EBV EA-D IgG and VCA IgM are charted as a percentage of samples where EBV was reactivated among COVID-negative and positive groups determined by PCR assay. Two-sample proportion Z test: EBNA-1 and EA-D: p = 0.3821, EBNA-1 and VCA: p = 0.6593, EBNA-1 and EA-D/VCA: p = 0.4519.

- **Samples testing positive for EBV EA-D IgG and VCA IgM**: In addition to EBNA-1 IgG, are charted as a percentage of samples where EBV was reactivated among COVID-negative and positive groups determined by the detection of COVID anti-nucleoprotein (COVID Np ab+) (left side) or detected by either PCR or detection of antibodies against nucleoprotein (right side). Two-sample proportion Z test: COVID-19 positivity determined by Np seropositivity: p = 0.2815, COVID-19 positivity determined by a positive PCR test or Np seropositivity: p = 0.1588.

- **Relative levels of antibodies against Np**: Among COVID-negative and COVID-positive patients. COVID ± groups on X-axis represent COVID determination by PCR test; therefore, COVID-negative patients with detection of antibodies against Np demonstrate past infection. COVID status determined by PCR: p = 0.0002 (Mann-Whitney test).

- **Anti-Np IgG levels in EBV reactivated patients**: Samples with antibodies against COVID Np were graphed for patients found to have reactivated EBV determined by detection of EBV genomes. EBV reactivation patients with COVID determined by PCR had higher levels.

### Laboratory assays for Epstein-Barr virus-related disease [^115inK8D]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2008). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects various cell types in a wide spectrum of benign and malignant diseases. Laboratory tests for EBV have improved and are increasingly used in diagnosis, prognosis, prediction, and prevention of diseases ranging from infectious mononucleosis to selected subtypes of lymphoma, sarcoma, and carcinoma. Indeed, the presence of EBV is among the most effective tumor markers supporting clinical management of cancer patients.

In biopsies, localization of EBER transcripts by in situ hybridization remains the gold standard for identifying latent infection. Other RNA- and protein-based assays detect lytic viral replication and can distinguish carcinoma-derived from lymphocyte-derived EBV in saliva or nasopharyngeal brushings. Analysis of blood using EBV viral load and serology reflects disease status and risk of progression.

This review summarizes prior research in the context of basic virologic principles to provide a rational strategy for applying and interpreting EBV tests in various clinical settings. Such assays have been incorporated into standard clinical practice in selected settings such as diagnosis of primary infection and management of patients with immune dysfunction or nasopharyngeal carcinoma. As novel therapies are developed that target virus-infected cells or overcome the adverse effects of infection, laboratory testing becomes even more critical for determining when intervention is appropriate and the extent to which it has succeeded.

### Epstein-Barr-negative MS: a true phenomenon [^111PESNg]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is associated with multiple sclerosis (MS); up to 3.3% of people with MS are EBV nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA1)-seronegative compared with 6.0% of controls. EBV serology is complex, and multiple antigens are required to assess seropositive status. We examined a cohort of seemingly EBV-negative patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). The size of the population enrolled in the International CIS study allowed us to examine the largest population of seemingly EBV-negative patients with CIS gathered at the time of writing.

### Prevalence of Epstein-Barr virus reactivation in pregnancy [^111E1sLz]. American Journal of Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

Recent evidence suggests a link between Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation and chronic stress in nonpregnant adults, possibly due to decreased cellular immune response. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of EBV seropositivity in a diverse cohort of pregnant women and whether maternal demographic characteristics were associated with EBV reactivation.

In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated midpregnancy serum specimens from 64 healthy pregnant women for the presence of EBV viral capsid antigen, EBV nuclear antigen, and EBV early antigen. The subjects were reported as EBV seronegative, EBV seropositive with reactivation, and EBV seropositive without reactivation. The maternal demographics of the seropositive women with EBV reactivation were compared with their nonreactivated counterparts. Chi-square and Student T test were used for statistical analysis.

In our pregnant cohort, 63 (98%) of the 64 women were EBV seropositive. Among these seropositive women, 22 (35%) demonstrated EBV reactivation in pregnancy. EBV reactivation was not associated with maternal age, race, parity, or insurance type. In our diverse pregnant cohort, 98% of women analyzed were EBV seropositive, with 35% demonstrating EBV reactivation by the second trimester. The pathophysiology and clinical implications of EBV reactivation during pregnancy need further study.

### The influence of Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus on childhood respiratory health: A population-based prospective cohort study [^113Za7Sr]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

In this population-based prospective cohort study, we observed that seropositivity for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in early childhood was associated with higher lung function at school age. This association was driven by seropositivity for EBV in the presence of seropositivity for cytomegalovirus (CMV). Seropositivity for either EBV or CMV was not associated with asthma. However, only seropositivity for CMV, in the absence of seropositivity for EBV, was associated with an increased risk of inhalant allergic sensitization. The associations of these viruses with respiratory health could be fully explained by ethnicity, sociodemographic factors, health-related factors, and lifestyle-related factors.

### Atypical prediagnosis Epstein-Barr virus serology restricted to EBV-positive Hodgkin lymphoma [^112uTz6k]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

An altered anti-Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serologic profile preceding diagnosis is associated with an increased risk of Hodgkin lymphoma. It is unknown whether this atypical pattern predicts Hodgkin lymphoma risk further subdivided by the determination of EBV in tumor cells. A nested case-control study of 128 incident Hodgkin lymphoma cases and 368 matched controls from active-duty military personnel with archived serum in the U.S. Department of Defense Serum Repository was conducted to determine whether a panel of anti-EBV antibody titers differed in EBV(+) and EBV(-) Hodgkin lymphoma.

Among 40 EBV(+) Hodgkin lymphoma cases and matched controls, statistically significant increased risks were associated with elevated anti-EBV VCA IgG antibody titers (relative risk = 3.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–8.7), and an anti-EBNA-1/anti-EBNA-2 antibody ratio ≤ 1.0 versus > 1.0 (relative risk = 4.7; 95% CI, 1.6–13.8). In contrast, no significant associations were found among 88 EBV(-) Hodgkin lymphoma cases relative to their matched controls.

In case-case analysis, EBV(+) disease was significantly associated with a low anti-EBNA-1/anti-EBNA-2 antibody ratio. This distinctive serologic response to EBV latent antigens, indicative of immune dysfunction in other clinical settings, is associated with an increased risk of developing EBV(+) but not EBV(-) Hodgkin lymphoma.

### A prospective evaluation of the diagnostic potential of EBV-DNA in plasma and whole blood [^117M1h6c]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2023). High credibility.

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-DNA is an important diagnostic tool for EBV-associated disease, but interpretation of its clinical significance is challenging.

- **Objectives**: We assessed the diagnostic and clinical performance of WHO-standardized qPCR for EBV-DNA (WHO EBV-qPCR) in plasma and whole blood (WB) for proven EBV disease in a prospectively accrued patient cohort.

- **Study design**: Central Denmark Region patients, tested with WHO EBV-qPCR from November 2017 to March 2019, were screened for EBV disease. Incidence (IR) was estimated by Poisson regression. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) were calculated for EBV-qPCR in plasma and WB. Risk of diagnostic latency was compared between patients with EBV-positive and EBV-negative lymphomas.

- **Results**: EBV disease was diagnosed in 95 of 1484 participants (IR: 16.3 per 1000 patient-years; 95% CI 13.3–19.9). Sensitivity and specificity of WHO EBV-qPCR in plasma was 82.4% (95% CI 74.2–90.7%) and 87.8% (95% CI 85.6–90%), yielding a PPV of 32.2% (95% CI 24.9–39.5%) and NPV of 98.6% (95% CI 97.7–99.5%) for proven EBV disease. Sensitivity and NPV were comparable in WB, while specificity and PPV decreased to 66.9% (95% CI 60.6–73.1%) and 18.1% (95% CI 7.5–28.7%). The risk of diagnostic latency was 2.3-fold (95% CI 1.4–4.1) higher for patients with EBV-positive compared with EBV-negative lymphomas.

- **Conclusions**: WHO EBV-qPCR in plasma and WB have a low PPV but a high NPV for proven EBV disease. Implementation of WHO EBV-qPCR could improve in…

### Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and human herpesvirus-6 infections in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome [^111xUShs]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Low credibility.

Enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing was utilized to detect immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) class antibodies specific to CMV, EBV, and HHV‐6. All serum samples were tested with commercial ELISA kits for the following virus‐specific antibodies: CMV IgM and IgG, and EBV capsid antigen (CA) IgM and IgG (EUROIMMUN, Medizinische Labordiagnostika AG, Lubeck, Germany); HHV‐6 IgG and IgM (VIDIA, Vestec, Czech Republic). EBV‐CA positive samples underwent further testing for the presence of EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA‐1) IgG (EUROIMMUN, Medizinische Labordiagnostika AG).

The performance and interpretation of results for all tests adhered to the manufacturer's instructions. Each ELISA was conducted with negative and positive controls and a calibrator (cutoff). To determine antibody concentration, a ratio (R) (EUROIMMUN) and index value (Iv) (VIDIA) were calculated by dividing the sample optical density (OD) by the cutoff OD value. Serum samples with R ≥ 1.1 (EUROIMMUN) and Iv > 1 (VIDIA) were considered positive. For the purpose of this study, test results with R/Iv > 5.0 were deemed highly positive. Samples with equivocal results were retested to ensure accuracy.

### Seroepidemiology of EBV and interpretation of the "isolated VCA IgG" pattern [^114ssRMY]. Journal of Medical Virology (2009). Low credibility.

The presence of VCA IgG in the absence of VCA IgM and EBNA-1 IgG antibodies makes classifying EBV infection more difficult, as this serological picture can be seen in cases of past infection with EBNA-1 IgG loss or non-appearance, or acute infections with the early disappearance or delayed onset of VCA IgM. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of this pattern in 2,422 outpatients with suspected EBV infection examined in 2005–2006 and to interpret its significance by means of immunoblotting.

One hundred and seventy-seven (7.3%) of the patients were VCA IgG-positive, VCA IgM-negative, and EBNA-1 IgG-negative, 15 of whom (8.5%) presented with heterophile antibodies. Analysis by age class showed that the prevalence of isolated VCA IgG ranged from 4.5% in subjects aged 1–10 years to 9% in those aged > 60 years. Immunoblotting allowed 18.9% of the cases to be classified as acute and 81.1% as past infections, the latter being observed in about 37% of the patients aged less than 10 years and in 100% of those aged > 30 years.

Therefore, in our case series, the presence of isolated VCA IgG was usually associated with past infection, particularly among adults. In children aged less than 10 years, it was associated mainly with acute infection, but as past infection may be present in about one-third of such children, this possibility should not be overlooked.

### Evaluation of a multiplex fluorescent microsphere immunoassay for the determination of Epstein-Barr virus serologic status [^112JeUeP]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a human herpesvirus, affects up to 95% of adults. Diagnosis of acute EBV infection can be challenging and often relies on the serologic antibody pattern to three distinct antigens, most often determined by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), and, more recently, multiplex assays. We compared a multiplex assay for the simultaneous detection of antibodies to viral capsid (VCA), nuclear (EBNA), and early (EA) EBV antigens with ELISAs, using IFA for discrepancy resolution.

Concordance of the multiplex assay was good for all four antigens: VCA IgM, 86.6% vs. ELISA and 92.9% vs. IFA; VCA IgG, 92.8% vs. ELISA and 98.0% vs. IFA; EBNA IgG, 90.3% vs. ELISA and 98.1% vs. IFA; and EA IgG, 83.8% vs. ELISA and 92.8% vs. IFA. After IFA resolution, correlation between the multiplex assay and ELISA for serologic disease stage, based on the antibody profile of all four analytes, was 90%.

The multiplex assay showed good correlation with an established ELISA and even better correlation with the "gold standard" IFA. Advantages of the multiplex assay over traditional methods include multiple results per assay, inclusion of internal controls for each assay, and well-to-well monitoring of assay drift.

### Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) deletions as biomarkers of response to treatment of chronic active EBV [^114x9GtR]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Chronic active Epstein–Barr virus (CAEBV) disease is a rare condition characterized by persistent EBV infection in previously healthy individuals. Defective EBV genomes were found in East Asian patients with CAEBV. In the present study, we sequenced 14 blood EBV samples from three UK patients with CAEBV, comparing the results with saliva CAEBV samples and other conditions. We observed EBV deletions in blood, some of which may disrupt viral replication, but not in saliva in CAEBV. Deletions were lost over time after successful treatment. These findings are compatible with CAEBV being associated with the evolution and persistence of EBV-positive haematological clones that are lost upon successful treatment.

### Quantification of circulating Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in the diagnosis and monitoring of natural killer cell and EBV-positive lymphomas in immunocompetent patients [^113UX3vk]. Blood (2004). Low credibility.

In Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive lymphomas in immunocompetent patients, the release of EBV DNA from tumor cells into the plasma might be useful for disease monitoring and prognostication. To test this hypothesis, we quantified serially plasma EBV DNA by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 39 cases of EBV-positive lymphomas (natural killer [NK] cell, n = 23; T cell, n = 8; B cell, n = 4; Hodgkin, n = 4). As a control, EBV DNA was undetectable in 34 cases of EBV-negative lymphomas at diagnosis and during chemotherapy. In all cases of EBV-positive lymphomas, EBV DNA was detectable (10^5–10^10 copies/mL) at diagnosis. It paralleled the clinical course, with EBV DNA becoming undetectable at remission and remaining elevated in refractory disease. On multivariate analysis, high-presentation EBV DNA (> 7.3 x 10^7 copies/mL) was significantly associated with inferior overall survival (OS).

- **Subgroup analysis**: In NK cell lymphomas, the largest cohort in this study, presentation EBV DNA was correlated with disease stage and lactate dehydrogenase. On multivariate analysis, high-presentation EBV DNA (> 6.1 x 10^7 copies/mL) was significantly associated with inferior disease-free survival. During treatment, patients with EBV DNA that showed further increases or failed to become undetectable had significantly inferior OS.

In EBV-positive lymphomas, plasma EBV DNA is valuable as a tumor biomarker and for prognostication.

### Evaluation of commercial EBV RecombLine assay for diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma [^1138VaN2]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2008). Low credibility.

In recent years, a number of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) proteins have been defined as immunodominant for either IgM, IgG, or IgA immune responses, yielding promising markers for diagnostic serology. Specific reactivity patterns to these proteins have been described for infectious mononucleosis (IM), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), various types of lymphoma, and healthy EBV carriers.

- **Objectives**: To compare the NPC-related diagnostic value of the EBV RecombLine test (Mikrogen, Germany) with a standardized immunoblot assay and to define the diagnostic value of individual EBV marker proteins in a population with a high incidence of NPC.

- **Result**: Sera from Indonesian NPC patients taken at primary diagnosis (n = 108) were analyzed for IgG and IgA reactivity and compared with regional healthy blood donors (n = 62), non-NPC patient controls (n = 10), and IM patients (n = 10). Most NPC patients and controls showed strong IgG reactivity to VCA-p18, -p23, and EBNA1, limiting their diagnostic use. Fewer patients (80% positive) than controls (< 10% positive).
