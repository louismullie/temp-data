## Question

Which laboratory tests should be ordered for someone with low urinary creatinine?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which laboratory tests should be ordered for someone with low urinary creatinine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about verifying the abnormal result and its preanalytical context. Then, I should assess how best to estimate kidney function when urine creatinine is low. Next, I will consider how low urine creatinine affects albuminuria interpretation and what confirmatory strategies are appropriate. After that, I should decide when to pursue measured GFR. Finally, I will outline targeted additional testing, laboratory quality considerations, risk stratification, follow-up, and a concise test set to order, all while checking key KDIGO and other guideline recommendations as I go [^111NBuLs] [^1151kJym] [^112yiJoE] [^1175ZuJn] [^1174tCEz].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and verify the result because low urinary creatinine can be physiologic from dilute urine or low muscle mass, technical from incomplete collection or timing issues, or pathologic if it reflects decreased creatinine generation or kidney disease; I should not jump to conclusions that it equals CKD before confirmation [^1125mN4N]. Wait, let me verify the collection method, hydration status, and whether this was a spot or timed urine, and I should repeat the urine measurement to ensure persistence before labeling an abnormality, which KDIGO 2024 explicitly recommends for incidentally detected abnormalities including albuminuria and low eGFR [^1151kJym] [^115Mg2Kk]. I need to ensure the lab handling was appropriate and that enzymatic methods and proper QC are used for urine creatinine and albumin, given KDIGO's quality standards and the known interferences with Jaffe methods [^117JSXLg] [^111nW6MG] [^116KJRrG].

> I will now examine kidney function using serum-based markers because low urine creatinine can make ratio-based indices and creatinine excretion unreliable; serum creatinine remains the standard initial test but I should interpret it cautiously if sarcopenia or low muscle mass is suspected [^112P3426]. Hold on, I should verify whether creatinine-based eGFR might be biased high in low muscle mass and therefore confirm with cystatin C, since KDIGO 2024 recommends cystatin C when creatinine-based eGFR is less accurate and suggests using a validated estimating equation rather than single markers [^111NBuLs] [^114q3FTC] [^111382ct]. Let me consider using the combined creatinine–cystatin C equation, which improves precision and accuracy compared with either alone, as supported by NEJM 2012 validation work [^1151ULyu].

> Hmm, wait a minute, at first glance one might think a low urinary creatinine must reflect reduced GFR, but hold on, I should verify that this could instead be low generation or dilution, which would tend to overestimate GFR when relying only on serum creatinine; that is exactly where cystatin C helps reduce bias, and the combined equation further enhances performance in populations with atypical muscle mass [^111NBuLs] [^1151ULyu]. I should double-check whether clinical decisions hinge on precise GFR, because if so, even dual-marker eGFR may be insufficient and measured GFR should be considered [^112yiJoE].

> Next, I should review albuminuria assessment because low urine creatinine can artifactually inflate albumin-to-creatinine ratio values, especially in individuals with low muscle mass; I need to check whether the initial ACR was abnormal and, if so, confirm with a first-morning sample using a quantitative laboratory method as KDIGO recommends [^1175ZuJn]. Let me verify whether a timed urine collection would bypass the denominator problem; KDIGO notes that a timed collection for albumin excretion or even measured creatinine clearance can be useful when eGFR is inaccurate or mGFR is not available, so a 24-hour collection can clarify discordant ACR results when urine creatinine is very low [^1174tCEz]. I should also consider evidence that spot ACR can be higher in women, older, and lower-weight persons independent of timed excretion, reinforcing the need for careful confirmation strategies when the denominator is low [^114mptUd].

> I need to ensure that if exact GFR will change treatment decisions, I obtain a measured GFR using an exogenous filtration marker, such as iohexol or iothalamate, because this bypasses both creatinine and cystatin C non-GFR determinants and is KDIGO's gold standard in high-stakes decisions; let me confirm appropriateness before ordering due to availability and cost considerations [^112yiJoE] [^117PWaEL].

> Let me consider additional targeted testing guided by clinical suspicion rather than scattershot ordering; urine microscopy can reveal disease signatures like dysmorphic RBCs or casts that change management, so I should review sediment if kidney disease is suspected and not rely on automated reports alone [^112gmbo2]. If the patient has diabetes, I should confirm uACR and reassess eGFR per ADA and other diabetes guidance, ensuring persistence over at least 3 months before diagnosing CKD, and integrate HbA1c for risk context [^114DBqEk] [^1166eoYH]. For hypertension, I should check serum creatinine, eGFR, and uACR given ESC 2024 initial workup recommendations, and repeat at least annually if moderate to severe CKD is present [^1114ry3p]. If there was recent or planned contrast, I should verify baseline kidney function and arrange appropriate follow-up testing and counseling per CAR guidance [^111q3qmB]. If microscopic hematuria is present, I should confirm serum creatinine and conduct risk-based evaluation per AUA/SUFU 2025, integrating renal causes in the differential, and for nephrolithiasis I should check serum electrolytes, creatinine, and uric acid per AUA guidance [^116SrBWt] [^116KfMKy].

> Next, I should review laboratory quality assurance because erroneous creatinine or albumin measures will mislead the entire pathway; KDIGO emphasizes external quality assessment programs for urine albumin and creatinine and standardized reporting of ACR with defined analytical precision, which I need to confirm with the lab [^117JSXLg] [^111nW6MG]. I should verify that enzymatic creatinine methods are used rather than Jaffe where possible due to interference and variability, especially when values are low and clinical decisions are sensitive to small changes [^116KJRrG]. For children, I need to ensure age-appropriate reference ranges at the low end are included in QC, and if I must use POCT, I should confirm adherence to preanalytical through postanalytical quality criteria and use the regional eGFR equation as KDIGO advises [^115bW8h1] [^117N47Xm] [^1116Uo8j].

> I should confirm risk stratification and follow-up plans by using the Kidney Failure Risk Equation when appropriate to contextualize age, sex, serum creatinine, and albuminuria for 2 and 5 year risk, but I must remember that a CKD diagnosis requires persistence beyond 3 months, so I will repeat abnormal eGFR or albuminuria after an appropriate interval before labeling CKD and then monitor trends over time rather than single snapshots [^115s9Svv] [^115Mg2Kk] [^1151kJym].

> Finally, let me summarize the essential tests to order once low urinary creatinine is confirmed and technical issues are addressed; I should obtain serum creatinine and cystatin C to calculate a dual-marker eGFR, repeat albuminuria assessment preferably with a first-morning ACR or a timed urine if the denominator remains unreliable, perform a urinalysis with microscopy to look for active sediment, and order a basic metabolic panel including electrolytes and BUN, reserving measured GFR for scenarios where precise GFR directly impacts management; I will double-check that this aligns with KDIGO's emphasis on cystatin C when creatinine is unreliable, confirmation of abnormalities, and mGFR when accuracy is paramount [^111NBuLs] [^1175ZuJn] [^1174tCEz] [^112gmbo2].

For low urine creatinine, first **confirm with repeat testing** and assess for **collection errors or dilution** [^1151kJym] [^117XeZs7]. Then, **evaluate kidney function** with serum creatinine, eGFR, and cystatin C [^112P3426] [^111NBuLs]; check urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [^1148ACz5] [^1175ZuJn] and perform urinalysis with microscopy [^112gmbo2]. Assess hydration status, electrolytes, and acid-base balance [^1116ZUbJ]; consider **24-hour urine collection** for creatinine clearance and total protein [^1174tCEz]. If low muscle mass is suspected, obtain CK, albumin, and prealbumin; if renal tubular disorders are suspected, measure urine sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphate, and magnesium [^1125mN4N]. Use imaging (renal ultrasound) and specialist referral as indicated [^112un5Br].

---

## Initial confirmation and assessment

- **Repeat urine creatinine measurement**: Confirm persistently low levels and exclude laboratory or collection errors [^1151kJym].

- **Urine specific gravity and osmolality**: Assess urine concentration and hydration status [^117XeZs7].

- **Urinalysis with microscopy**: Evaluate for proteinuria, hematuria, or other abnormalities indicating renal pathology [^112gmbo2].

---

## Renal function evaluation

- **Serum creatinine and eGFR**: Initial assessment of renal function [^112P3426] [^111382ct].

- **Cystatin C**: Use when creatinine-based eGFR is less accurate or in low muscle mass [^111NBuLs] [^1151ULyu].

- **Measured GFR**: Use exogenous filtration markers when accurate GFR will impact decisions [^112yiJoE] [^117PWaEL].

---

## Assessment of renal tubular function

Urine electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphate, and magnesium) assess **tubular handling** [^1133HscU]; **urine pH and anion gap** evaluate acid-base status and tubular function [^1116ZUbJ].

---

## Evaluation of muscle mass and metabolism

Serum creatine kinase (CK) assesses muscle mass and turnover, while **serum albumin and prealbumin** reflect nutritional status and muscle mass.

---

## Assessment of hydration status and fluid balance

Serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate) assess hydration and electrolyte balance; **blood urea nitrogen (BUN)** helps evaluate hydration and renal function.

---

## Evaluation for renal tubular disorders

Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) assesses tubular sodium handling; **fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea)** further evaluates tubular function [^1125mN4N].

---

## Imaging studies

Renal ultrasound assesses kidney size, structure, and obstruction; consider **CT or MRI** if structural abnormalities are suspected [^112un5Br].

---

## Specialist referral

Nephrology referral is indicated for persistent low urine creatinine with abnormal renal function or suspected renal pathology; consider **endocrinology referral** if metabolic or hormonal disorders are suspected.

Urinary chemistries vary widely in both health and disease and are affected by diet, volume status, medications, and disease states. When properly examined, these tests provide important insight into the mechanism and therapy of various clinical disorders that are first detected by abnormalities in plasma chemistries. These tests cannot be interpreted in isolation, but instead require knowledge of key clinical information, such as medications, physical examination, and plasma chemistries, to include kidney function. When used appropriately and with knowledge of limitations, urine chemistries can provide important insight into the pathophysiology and treatment of a wide variety of disorders.

### Screening for renal disease using serum creatinine: who are we missing [^114CMddo]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

Appropriate management and timely referral of patients with early renal disease often depend on the identification of renal insufficiency by primary care physicians. Serum creatinine (SCr) levels are frequently used as a screening test for renal dysfunction; however, patients can have significantly decreased glomerular filtration rates (GFR) with normal range SCr values, making the recognition of renal dysfunction more difficult. This study was designed to estimate the prevalence of patients who have significantly reduced GFR, as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault (C-G) formula, but normal-range SCr.

- **Methods**: The study included 2,781 outpatients referred by community physicians to an urban laboratory network for SCr measurement. GFR was estimated using the C-G formula. Patients were grouped according to the concordance of SCr level abnormalities (abnormal > 130 micromol/l) with significantly abnormal C-G values (abnormal ≤ 60 ml/min).

These findings highlight the complex nature of diagnosing renal insufficiency and emphasize the need for more effective screening strategies to avoid missing patients with significant renal dysfunction despite normal SCr levels.

### Evaluation and enhancement of standard equations for renal function estimation in individuals with components of metabolic disease [^113kxouz]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

The appropriate assessment of renal function is critical for drug dosing. More than half of all medications are cleared by the kidneys and inappropriate dose adjustment to account for potential drug accumulation may lead to drug toxicity. Therefore, an adept understanding of the accuracy, reliability, and nuances of the Cockcroft-Gault equation is necessary. Moreover, strategies to correctly classify the degree of renal dysfunction are likely to improve patient outcomes. The reliability and application of the Cockcroft-Gault equation (see equation below) in clinical practice may be influenced by several factors.

- **Weight considerations**: The impact of weight must be considered. The physiological max GFR is approximately 120 mL/min; however, if the total body weight of an obese patient is entered into the equation, the resultant value for CrCl often exceeds this threshold. The question arises as to whether we should use ideal, lean, adjusted, or total body weight; a question that has been frequently tested with different answers. The original Cockcroft-Gault equation suggested total body weight — before the worldwide obesity epidemic.

- **Serum creatinine influences**: Serum creatinine may be influenced by malnutrition, cachexia, liver disease, and other conditions leading to lower muscle mass. In clinical practice, serum creatinine is often below 1.0 mg/dL in these populations; therefore, GFR tends to be overestimated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation. Some have suggested rounding serum creatinine to 0.8 mg/dL or 1 mg/dL to account for this concern. There is no substantial evidence to support these suggestions.

### Urine sediment examination in the diagnosis and management of kidney disease: Core curriculum 2019 [^112gmbo2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Automated urine technology and centralized laboratory testing are becoming the standard for providing urinalysis data to clinicians, including nephrologists. This trend has had the unintended consequence of making examination of urine sediment by nephrologists a relatively rare event. In addition, the nephrology community appears to have lost interest in and forgotten the utility of provider-performed urine microscopy. However, it is critical to remember that urine sediment examination remains a time-honored test that provides a wealth of information about the patient's underlying kidney disease. This test performs very favorably as a urinary "biomarker" for a number of acute kidney diseases. When used properly, urine sediment findings alert health care providers to the presence of kidney disease, while also providing diagnostic information that often identifies the compartment of kidney injury. Urine sediment findings may also guide therapy and assist in prognostication. In this review of the role of urine sediment examination in the diagnosis and management of kidney disease, we seek to help experienced nephrologists maintain their competency in performing this test and encourage ongoing training of nephrology fellows and others less experienced in such analyses.

### Diagnostic accuracy of semiquantitative point of care urine albumin to creatinine ratio and urine dipstick analysis in a primary care resource limited setting in South Africa [^114SHwHL]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has a high burden of infectious diseases (ID), mostly from HIV and tuberculosis, and an emerging burden of non-communicable diseases (NCD). Together, ID and NCD are risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD), which has a prevalence of 10.7% in SSA. The prevalence of CKD is predicted to rise disproportionately in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Therefore, early detection of CKD and appropriate management of risk factors for progression is an essential public health priority.

Persistent albuminuria is one criterion for the diagnosis of CKD and an independent risk factor for adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. Albuminuria, measured on more than one occasion as a spot urine albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR), is now included as one of the diagnostic criteria for CKD. Screening for albuminuria is recommended in certain high-risk groups such as those with diabetes mellitus; however, results should be confirmed by a central laboratory.

The lack of access to central laboratory services in LMICs is a major hurdle obstructing widespread implementation of CKD screening programs. While limited laboratory access is acknowledged in the 2012 KDIGO guidelines, there are no recommendations for using point of care (POC) devices in resource-limited settings (RLS). POC testing provides actionable results in real-time for clinical decision-making. In South Africa (SA), the efficacy of POC testing is well established for diagnosing and managing patients with HIV and tuberculosis. Using the existing framework established for POC testing is essential in these settings, yet its applicability is still being assessed.

### Urinary kidney injury biomarkers and urine creatinine normalization: a false premise or not [^113eHktC]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Substantial research has focused on the discovery of urinary biomarkers to detect acute kidney injury (AKI) before a rise in serum creatinine. Similar to chronic kidney diseases, the concentrations of urinary AKI biomarkers have been normalized to urine creatinine concentration to account for creatinine clearance and urine flow. Waikar et al. challenge the assumption that normalization to creatinine clearance in a chronic disease state can be extrapolated to an acute state, in which creatinine clearance is, by definition, changing acutely.

### Excessive diagnostic testing in acute kidney injury [^112un5Br]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

The patterns, performance characteristics, and yield of diagnostic tests ordered for the evaluation of acute kidney injury (AKI) have not been rigorously evaluated.

- **Methods**: We characterized the frequency of AKI diagnostic testing for urine, blood, radiology, and pathology tests in all adult inpatients who were admitted with or developed AKI (N = 4903 patients with 5731 AKI episodes) during a single calendar year. We assessed the frequency of abnormal test results overall and by AKI stage. We manually reviewed electronic medical records to evaluate the diagnostic yield of selected urine, blood, and radiology tests. The diagnostic yield of urine and blood tests was determined based on whether an abnormal test affected AKI diagnosis or management, whereas the diagnostic yield of radiology tests was based on whether an abnormal test resulted in a procedural intervention. In sensitivity analyses, we also evaluated the appropriateness of testing using prespecified criteria.

- **Results**: The frequency of testing increased with higher AKI stages for nearly all diagnostic tests, whereas the frequency of detecting an abnormal result increased for some, but not all, tests. The frequency of detecting an abnormal result was highly variable across tests, ranging from 0% for anti-glomerular basement membrane testing to 71% for urine protein testing. Many of the tests evaluated had low diagnostic yield. In particular, selected urine and blood tests were unlikely to impact AKI diagnosis or management, whereas radiology tests had greater clinical utility.

- **Conclusions**: In patients with AKI, many of the diagnostic tests conducted are not effective in influencing patient diagnosis or management. The preference for radiology tests over others suggests a greater clinical utility in procedural intervention.

### Reporting the eGFR and its implication for CKD diagnosis [^1164PVLh]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

The process of diagnosing chronic kidney disease using the estimated GFR involves several pitfalls. The estimated GFR laboratory report should be requested only by practitioners who are familiar with how to interpret the result. Until a more reliable method is available to estimate the GFR, the chronic kidney disease classification should be revised by reducing the central role of the GFR cutoff levels.

### Performance and pitfalls of the tools for measuring glomerular filtration rate to guide chronic kidney disease diagnosis and assessment [^115s9Svv]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2023). Low credibility.

Accurate diagnosis, classification, and risk stratification for chronic kidney disease (CKD) allow for early recognition and optimal care delivery. Creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR), and the kidney failure risk equation (KFRE) are important tools for this purpose. However, understanding their limitations is crucial for optimal implementation.

When accurate GFR is required, such as for chemotherapy dosing, it is measured using an exogenous filtration marker. In routine clinical practice, estimated GFR (eGFR) from serum creatinine (SCr), calculated using the enzymatic method with or without UACR, is recommended. Limitations of SCr include non-GFR determinants such as muscle mass, diet, and tubular handling. An alternative or additional endogenous filtration marker is cystatin C, which can be used alongside SCr for confirmatory testing of CKD. However, its role in the UK is more limited due to concerns regarding false positive results.

The recommended creatinine-based eGFR equation in the UK is the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration 2009 equation. This was recently updated to a race-neutral 2021 version, demonstrating reduced bias in people of Black ethnicity, though it has not been validated in the UK. Limitations include extremes of age, inaccuracy at greater GFRs, and reduced generalizability to under-represented ethnic groups.

The KFRE, based on age, sex, SCr, and UACR, has recently been developed to help determine 2-year and 5-year risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease. It has been validated in over 30 countries and provides meaningful assessments.

### When laboratories report estimated glomerular filtration rates in addition to serum creatinines, nephrology consults increase [^112j9o7X]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Serum creatinine alone can be difficult to interpret as a measure of kidney function, leading to chronic kidney disease potentially being under-recognized in the general population. In the province of Ontario, Canada, all outpatient laboratories now report estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) along with serum creatinine. To determine the impact of this reporting on clinical practice, we linked health administrative data for over 8 million adults aged 25 years or older across an almost 10-year period and conducted a population-based intervention analysis using seasonal time-series modeling. This analysis assessed overall trends in the number and type of patients seen by nephrologists. Compared to the period when only serum creatinines were reported, the number of patients seen in consultation by nephrologists increased after eGFR reporting by an average of 24% (an absolute increase of 2.9 consults per 100,000 adults), amounting to about 23 additional consults per nephrologist each year. The greatest increases were observed in women (39% increase) and individuals aged 80 years and older (58% increase). Our study found that eGFR reporting was associated with a significant increase in nephrology consults. However, it remains to be seen whether the routine reporting of eGFR translates into improved treatment and outcomes for those with chronic kidney disease.

### Population-based screening for CKD [^113ZdbBS]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Organizations both in the United States and globally have advocated for screening for chronic kidney disease with a urine test for proteinuria, followed by subsequent testing with creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate determinations. Screening for a disease, such as chronic kidney disease, can have value, but a decision to screen is not trivial. Criteria must be met to balance the aggregate benefits with the risks and costs of a screening test. We discuss how screening for chronic kidney disease meets many of these criteria, but also how the populations to which it is applied must be targeted, and the strategies for testing must be clearly defined.

### Identifying individuals with a reduced GFR using ambulatory laboratory database surveillance [^111eeJFc]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Use of outpatient laboratory databases to identify people with a low GFR may be part of an effective strategy to increase their use of treatments to prevent kidney failure. All renal function data from 17 independent outpatient laboratories in Eastern Ontario were combined to determine the proportion of adults with at least one serum creatinine measurement during a 1-year period. The detection rates of low GFR were measured using different algorithms, and what proportion of identified low GFR was transient was considered. Canadian census data were used to calculate rates and proportions.

Renal function testing was common. Of the 1,090,000 adult residents, 32% of the entire population and 63% of seniors had at least one serum creatinine measured during the study year. Sixteen percent of the population (49% of those with tests performed) had at least one GFR < 80 ml/min per 1.73 m², 5% (16%) had at least one GFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m², and 0.6% (1.7%) had at least one GFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m². Low GFRs were usually not transient: 68% of individuals with subsequent testing at least 30 days later had a similar or worse GFR.

Ambulatory laboratory database case finding, particularly in older patients, seems to be a promising method for easily identifying large segments of the population with persistent reductions in GFR. Whether such identification leads to improved health outcomes warrants further study.

### Estimating glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine and cystatin C [^1151ULyu]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Estimates of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) based on serum creatinine are routinely used; however, they are imprecise, potentially leading to the overdiagnosis of chronic kidney disease. Cystatin C presents an alternative filtration marker for estimating GFR.

- **Methods**: Using cross-sectional analyses, we developed estimating equations based on cystatin C alone and in combination with creatinine in diverse populations totaling 5,352 participants from 13 studies. These equations were then validated in 1,119 participants from five different studies in which GFR had been measured. Cystatin and creatinine assays were traceable to primary reference materials.

- **Results**: Mean measured GFRs were 68 and 70 mL per minute per 1.73 m² of body surface area in the development and validation data sets, respectively. In the validation data set, the creatinine-cystatin C equation performed better than equations using creatinine or cystatin C alone. Bias was similar among the three equations, with a median difference between measured and estimated GFR of 3.9 mL per minute per 1.73 m² with the combined equation, as compared with 3.7 and 3.4 mL per minute per 1.73 m² with the creatinine equation and the cystatin C equation (P = 0.07 and P = 0.05), respectively. Precision was improved with the combined equation (interquartile range of the difference, 13.4 vs. 15.4 and 16.4 mL per minute per 1.73 m², respectively) [P = 0.001], and the proportion of estimates within 30% of measured GFR was 8.5 vs. 12.8 and 14.1, respectively [P < 0.001 for both].

### Viltepso [^112GVmyi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Monitoring to assess safety**: Serum cystatin C, urine dipstick, and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio should be measured before starting Viltepso. Consider measurement of glomerular filtration rate prior to initiation of Viltepso. Monitoring for kidney toxicity during treatment is recommended. Obtain the urine samples prior to infusion of Viltepso or at least 48 hours after the most recent infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Dosing information**: The recommended dosage of Viltepso is 80 mg/kg administered once weekly as a 60-minute intravenous infusion. If a dose of Viltepso is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible after the scheduled dose time.

### Adding creatinine to routine pregnancy tests: A decision tree for calculating the cost of identifying patients with CKD in pregnancy [^111QetHR]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

On the occasion of the 2018 World Kidney Day dedicated to women and kidney diseases, the integration of serum creatinine — a simple, low-cost, widespread, and pivotal marker of kidney function — into the work-up for pregnant patients was suggested as a potential tool for improving women's health. At the time of writing, this suggestion has not been widely followed.

In the present study, we calculated, by modeling data available from the literature, how much it would cost to detect new CKD cases with reduced kidney function by adding serum creatinine to pregnancy screening and monitoring tests in several scenarios. Due to changes in glomerular filtration rate during pregnancy, creatinine levels must be interpreted with caution. Acknowledging this, we conservatively modeled our decision tree by focusing on the detection of cases with a relevant reduction in kidney function (CKD stage 3b onwards).

2.6 Laboratory testing and monitoring to assess safety

Measure the urine protein to creatinine ratio prior to initiation of treatment. Conduct the following laboratory tests at baseline and at periodic intervals until 48 months after the last treatment course of Lemtrada to monitor for early signs of potentially serious adverse effects:

- **Complete blood count (CBC) with differential**: Prior to treatment initiation and at monthly intervals thereafter.
- **Serum creatinine levels**: Prior to treatment initiation and at monthly intervals thereafter.
- **Urinalysis with urine cell counts**: Prior to treatment initiation and at monthly intervals thereafter.
- **A test of thyroid function, such as thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level**: Prior to treatment initiation and every 3 months thereafter.
- **Serum transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) and total bilirubin levels**: Prior to treatment initiation and periodically thereafter.

Conduct baseline and yearly skin exams to monitor for melanoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Adding creatinine to routine pregnancy tests: A decision tree for calculating the cost of identifying patients with CKD in pregnancy [^116SudTT]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). High credibility.

The model discussed here is based on the following series of assumptions:

- **Prevalence of CKD in pregnant women**: It is assumed to be the same as in women of childbearing age. We relied on Davison's classic estimate that sets CKD at about 3% in this population and estimates the prevalence of 'severe' CKD to be 1:750. This was considered synonymous with a prevalence of CKD stages 4–5 (0.13333% of the population). Regarding stage 3, considering that the prevalence is usually estimated to be 4–10 times higher than CKD stages 4–5, we hypothesized that it was evenly divided between stages 3a and 3b. We focused only on stage 3b [estimated GFR (eGFR) 44–30 mL/min], to address the difficulty in detecting lesser degrees of a creatinine increase in pregnancy. We conservatively estimated prevalence as double that of stages 4–5 (i.e. 0.26667% of the population). The estimate is conservative and aligns with a large recent meta-analysis.

- **Detection of reduced kidney function**: Targeting the model to detect cases with reduced kidney function, we hypothesized that a patient with CKD stage 3b before pregnancy (eGFR 30–44 mL/min) would remain in stage 3, possibly shifting to 3a (eGFR 59–45 mL/min) during pregnancy. This choice is quite conservative, as we did not consider the possibility of detecting earlier stages (1–3a) if serum creatinine were adjusted for pregnancy, and urinalysis and hypertension were considered.

Having set the detection threshold at relatively low eGFR levels, we considered that a further 10% of cases would escape detection due to laboratory errors, resulting in a detection rate of 90%.

### Excessive diagnostic testing in acute kidney injury [^113Pcibv]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

The patterns, performance characteristics, and yield of diagnostic tests ordered for the evaluation of acute kidney injury (AKI) have not been rigorously evaluated.

- **Methods**: We characterized the frequency of AKI diagnostic testing for urine, blood, radiology, and pathology tests in all adult inpatients who were admitted with or developed AKI (N = 4903 patients with 5731 AKI episodes) during a single calendar year. We assessed the frequency of abnormal test results overall and by AKI stage. We manually reviewed electronic medical records to evaluate the diagnostic yield of selected urine, blood, and radiology tests. The diagnostic yield of urine and blood tests was determined based on whether an abnormal test affected AKI diagnosis or management, whereas the diagnostic yield of radiology tests was based on whether an abnormal test resulted in a procedural intervention. In sensitivity analyses, we also evaluated the appropriateness of testing using prespecified criteria.

- **Results**: The frequency of testing increased with a higher AKI stage for nearly all diagnostic tests, whereas the frequency of detecting an abnormal result increased for some, but not all, tests. The frequency of detecting an abnormal result was highly variable across tests, ranging from 0% for anti-glomerular basement membrane testing to 71% for urine protein testing. Many of the tests evaluated had low diagnostic yield. In particular, selected urine and blood tests were unlikely to impact AKI diagnosis or management, whereas radiology tests had greater clinical utility.

- **Conclusions**: In patients with AKI, many of the diagnostic tests used to evaluate the condition were found to have limited diagnostic utility. Radiology tests exhibited greater clinical usefulness compared to urine and blood tests.

### The urine sediment as a biomarker of kidney disease [^112VVUi1]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The modern era of medicine has ushered in new diagnostic technologies to assist clinicians in evaluating patients with kidney disease. The birth of automated urine analysis technology and centralized laboratory testing has unfortunately made the examination of urine sediment by physicians a rare event. At the same time, identifying novel urine biomarkers for kidney disease has become a research priority in nephrology, and the search for the "renal troponin" has progressed at a fast pace. Despite this, urine sediment examination remains a time-honored test that provides a wealth of information about the patient's kidney condition and performs favorably as a urinary biomarker. It alerts the clinician to the presence of kidney disease and provides diagnostic information that often identifies the compartment of kidney injury.

In addition, sediment findings may guide therapy and assist in prognostication. As such, it is premature to abandon urine sediment examination. It may be more appropriate to combine urine sediment examination with new candidate biomarkers that enter clinical practice to create a "diagnostic panel" that provides clinicians with a useful battery of diagnostic tests. To accomplish this, we as nephrologists must encourage continued training and maintenance of competency in urine sediment examination.

### Influence of urine creatinine on the relationship between the albumin-to-creatinine ratio and cardiovascular events [^114mptUd]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

In the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (spot-ACR), urine creatinine corrects for tonicity but also reflects muscle mass. Low muscle mass is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). We hypothesized that the spot-ACR would be higher in women, lower-weight persons, and older individuals, independent of timed urine albumin excretion (24hr-UAE), and accordingly, that spot-ACR would be more strongly associated with CVD events than 24hr-UAE in these subgroups.

- **Design, setting, participants, & methods**: 2627 PREVEND (Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-stage Disease) participants with 24hr-UAE 0.06).

- **Conclusions**: In community-living individuals with 24hr-UAE < 30 mg/d, spot-ACR is higher in women, older persons, and lower-weight persons, indepen.

### Screening for kidney diseases: Older measures versus novel biomarkers [^112YaAVE]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Biomarkers have been used to screen for kidney disease since creatinine was recognized to be correlated with renal function. The measurement of serum creatinine as a screening test for kidney disease falls short, however, because serum creatinine is not particularly sensitive for the diagnosis of kidney disease. Creatinine reflects renal filtering capacity, which has a lot of reserve and is therefore not sensitive to acute or chronic kidney injury unless the injury is substantial enough to compromise the filtering ability. The sensitivity of serum creatinine is further diminished in certain patient populations that are prone to kidney disease because of the physiology of creatinine. Therefore, researchers are seeking new biomarkers that can aid in the diagnosis of both acute and chronic kidney diseases. The limitations of creatinine in screening for kidney diseases in specific patient populations as well as new potential biomarkers that are actively being researched are discussed in this review.

Regarding quality improvement for chronic kidney disease, particularly in relation to laboratory requirements, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend flagging an eGFR creatinine level that is less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m² as "decreased" and as an indication of chronic kidney disease when present for more than 3 months. Additionally, the guidelines emphasize the importance of assessing albuminuria levels with urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and suggest repeating abnormal tests within a 3–6 month period to confirm chronic kidney disease.

- **Laboratory reporting**: Laboratories should report eGFR along with serum creatinine using standardized creatinine assay calibration. Furthermore, the use of race-neutral equations for calculating eGFR is encouraged to provide equitable treatment across all populations.

- **Prognosis and stratification**: KDIGO 2024 underscores the importance of stratifying patients based on eGFR and albuminuria levels for appropriate risk evaluation and management, enhancing clinical decision-making and outcomes for patients with chronic kidney disease.

### Urinalysis: A comprehensive review [^117XeZs7]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A complete urinalysis includes physical, chemical, and microscopic examinations. Midstream clean collection is acceptable in most situations, but the specimen should be examined within two hours of collection. Cloudy urine often results from precipitated phosphate crystals in alkaline urine, but pyuria can also be the cause. A strong odor may be due to a concentrated specimen rather than a urinary tract infection. Dipstick urinalysis is convenient, but false-positive and false-negative results can occur. Specific gravity provides a reliable assessment of the patient's hydration status. Microhematuria has a range of causes, from benign to life-threatening. Glomerular, renal, and urologic causes of microhematuria can often be differentiated by other elements of the urinalysis. Although transient proteinuria typically is a benign condition, persistent proteinuria requires further work-up. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections diagnosed by positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests can be treated without culture.

### Imperfect gold standards for kidney injury biomarker evaluation [^114PbobT]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Clinicians have used serum creatinine in diagnostic testing for acute kidney injury for decades, despite its imperfect sensitivity and specificity. Novel tubular injury biomarkers may revolutionize the diagnosis of acute kidney injury; however, even if a novel tubular injury biomarker is 100% sensitive and 100% specific, it may appear inaccurate when using serum creatinine as the gold standard. Acute kidney injury, as defined by serum creatinine, may not reflect tubular injury, and the absence of changes in serum creatinine does not assure the absence of tubular injury.

In general, the apparent diagnostic performance of a biomarker depends not only on its ability to detect injury but also on disease prevalence and the sensitivity and specificity of the imperfect gold standard. Assuming that, at a certain cutoff value, serum creatinine is 80% sensitive and 90% specific and disease prevalence is 10%, a new perfect biomarker with a true 100% sensitivity may seem to have only 47% sensitivity compared with serum creatinine as the gold standard.

Minimizing misclassification by using stricter criteria to diagnose acute kidney injury will reduce the error when evaluating the performance of a biomarker under investigation. Apparent diagnostic errors using a new biomarker may be a reflection of errors in the imperfect gold standard itself rather than poor performance of the biomarker. The results of this study suggest that small changes in serum creatinine alone should not be used to define acute kidney injury in biomarker or interventional studies.

### Adding creatinine to routine pregnancy tests: a decision tree for calculating the cost of identifying patients with CKD in pregnancy [^116m54dx]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes even in the early stages of the disease. However, while the European and US guidelines for the management of low-risk pregnancy include a search for major risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension, they do not include measuring kidney function. Most guidelines recommend including questions on diabetes, hypertension, and thyroid diseases, yet none specifically mention determining whether a patient has a history of kidney disease or suggest testing kidney function before or at the beginning of pregnancy. This oversight fails to acknowledge that CKD is often asymptomatic and may not be found unless searched for.

Although dipstick urinalysis, the only test routinely prescribed in pregnancy, serves to identify kidney diseases characterized by proteinuria, its limitations as a sole marker of kidney disease are well known. This test is likely more important during the second half of pregnancy for identifying preeclampsia. Attention to microscopic haematuria can increase the diagnostic yield of urinalysis, but since it is found in up to 20% of uneventful pregnancies, its association with CKD is weak in this setting.

By definition, CKD encompasses any abnormality of kidney structure or function [glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measured or calculated] or blood and urine composition, including alteration in blood or electrolytes. Diagnosis of CKD requires a combined assessment of kidney function and electrolytes, renal imagery, and urinalysis. A urinalysis alone cannot detect redu…

### Screening for chronic kidney disease: Change of perspective and novel developments [^1159gdxn]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

Estimated glomerular filtration rate versus urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio as diagnostic test for chronic kidney disease screening

Before the KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) guideline of 2012, eGFR was the most considered marker for CKD screening and detection. Research has demonstrated that eGFR is strongly related to kidney outcomes and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Nevertheless, eGFR may be less suited for early identification of CKD, as it can be considered a late rather than an early indicator of CKD. In practice, eGFR is considered an accurate, relatively inexpensive test for screening that is widely available and easy to implement. However, the actual costs and availability may differ substantially between low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries.

After the KDIGO guideline update in 2012, kidney damage received more attention as part of the CKD definition, and, as a result, albuminuria emerged as a screening test to identify CKD early. Compared with eGFR, albuminuria can be considered an early indicator of CKD. Albuminuria levels generally increase before the kidney function detectably declines. Work from, amongst others, the CKD Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC) and PREVEND, has repeatedly demonstrated that albuminuria is strongly associated with kidney and cardiovascular outcomes, independently of and often stronger than eGFR.

Another important argument for UACR as a CKD screening test is the increasing evidence that (early) change in albuminuria can serve both as a surrogate endpoint and target for intervention.

### What every clinician needs to know about chronic kidney disease: Detection, classification and epidemiology [^114LXErL]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major healthcare challenge, affecting over 800 million people worldwide. The implications for population health result from the strong associations of CKD with increased rates of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, progressive CKD leading to kidney failure, acute kidney injury (AKI), and mortality. In addition to a single disease perspective, CKD commonly coexists alongside other long-term conditions, particularly type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Consequently, CKD is an important component of multimorbidity that influences individual management and impacts prognosis.

CKD is defined by abnormalities of kidney structure or function of any cause with implications for health that are present for longer than three months. The diagnosis is usually made based on an abnormal glomerular filtration rate (GFR 30mg/g or > 3mg/mmol). GFR is typically estimated from serum creatinine concentration using a variety of validated equations. However, serum creatinine is closely related to muscle mass and may therefore not be an accurate marker of GFR in people with high or low muscle mass (sarcopenia). Cystatin C is an alternative endogenous marker of GFR that is increasingly being used but also has limitations. An estimate of GFR based on both creatinine and cystatin C is the most accurate.

Diagnosis should be followed by classification and risk stratification to guide the development of a risk-based, personalized care plan.

### Evaluation of short-term changes in serum creatinine level as a meaningful end point in randomized clinical trials [^1177fkY5]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Observational studies have shown that acute change in kidney function, specifically acute kidney injury (AKI), is a strong risk factor for poor outcomes. Thus, the outcome of acute change in serum creatinine level, regardless of underlying biology or etiology, is frequently used in clinical trials as both efficacy and safety end points.

We performed a meta-analysis of clinical trials to quantify the relationship between positive or negative short-term effects of interventions on change in serum creatinine level and more meaningful clinical outcomes. After a thorough literature search, we included 14 randomized trials of interventions that altered risk for an acute increase in serum creatinine level and had reported between-group differences in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and/or mortality rate ≥ 3 months after randomization.

- **Interventions increasing risk**: Seven trials assessed interventions that, compared with placebo, increased risk of acute elevation in serum creatinine level (pooled relative risk, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.22 to 1.89).

- **Interventions reducing risk**: Seven trials assessed interventions that, compared with placebo, reduced risk of acute elevation in serum creatinine level (pooled relative risk, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 0.74).

However, pooled risks for CKD and mortality associated with interventions did not differ from those with placebo in either group. In conclusion, several interventions that affect risk of acute, mild to moderate, often temporary elevation in serum creatinine level in placebo-controlled randomized trials showed no appreciable effect on CKD or mortality months later, raising questions about the value of using small to moderate changes in serum creatinine level as meaningful clinical end points.

### Diagnostic performance of a point-of-care saliva urea nitrogen dipstick to screen for kidney disease in low-resource settings where serum creatinine is unavailable [^1167mnQ3]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

We have previously assessed the utility of saliva urea nitrogen (SUN) in the management of kidney disease in high-income settings and in admissions to tertiary hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we tested its feasibility and performance in the management of patients at risk of kidney disease presenting to low-resource healthcare facilities where serum creatinine is largely unavailable. The cohort in which the strip was tested, and the settings where this was done are highly representative of those where we envisage this strip to be of greatest utility, which is the major strength of this study. We conducted the study in a large number of patients across multiple centers in community, rural, and urban settings, throughout all seasons of the year.

In addition to assessing the strip's performance, we demonstrated that in almost 1500 tests, SUN as a continuous variable correlated with creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) across multiple observation time points (i.e. as renal function changed with treatment). This supports previous findings that SUN can be used not only for diagnosing kidney disease but also for monitoring response to treatment. Moreover, we demonstrated that in-hospital mortality increased according to presenting SUN, supporting previous work that highlighted SUN's ability to identify patients at increased risk and predict their outcomes.

The high proportion of patients at increased risk of kidney disease undergoing successful SUN testing supports its feasibility. However, we would have liked to collect reasons for the inability to undertake the test.

### Optimization of screening strategy for chronic kidney disease by urine test strips using the albumin-creatinine read-out [^1164PAs7]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Given that the semi-quantitative ACR is the only readout demonstrating positive and negative likelihood ratios of 11.3 and 0.11, respectively, this readout should be preferred in CKD screening algorithms when urine test strips are used. These results are confirmed by the high predictive probability of ACR for CKD compared to semi-quantitative PCR and qualitative PCR. Additionally, the agreement between the KDIGO CKD-risk score classification based on eGFR and semi-quantitative and quantitative ACR indicates that the semi-quantitative results obtained with the test strip are reliable. However, reporting the category in which the patient is classified has limited diagnostic value and should primarily serve as an indication for quantitative ACR determination. The CKD stage assigned based on semi-quantitative test strip results may necessitate confirmation by quantitative analysis.

Although it is clear that quantitative ACR is the best parameter for evaluating albuminuria in CKD, especially in high-risk patients, there is still debate on the appropriate screening technique in lower-risk patients. Lamb et al. examined several algorithms for detecting proteinuria and concluded that urinary albumin measurement is analytically superior to total urinary protein measurement and should be prioritized as a first-line test for detecting proteinuria due to its higher sensitivity, standardization, and ability to improve the consistency of early CKD detection. Furthermore, they stated that semi-quantitative test strips have low sensitivity and clinical reliability, resulting in false negatives.

### Diagnostic yield of various serum creatinine testing frequencies in people at risk for CKD [^111tA5Kf]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend regular serum creatinine testing to detect chronic kidney disease (CKD) among people with diabetes or hypertension, but the ideal frequency of testing is unknown. We determined the diagnostic yield for incident CKD as defined by ≥ 2 measures of eGFR for individuals aged 18 years or older with eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73 m² at baseline in Alberta, Canada. We assessed diagnostic yield overall and within categories defined by age, sex, comorbidity, albuminuria, or levels of a multivariable risk score for CKD.

- **Results**: Assuming annual testing, the number of tests needed (NTN) to detect one new CKD case was more than 67-fold higher among those aged 70 years (32, [32,32]). NTN for annual testing were 50 (49, 50) among people with diabetes, 57 (57, 58) in those with hypertension, and 20 (20, 21) among people with heart failure. When stratified by CKD risk score, the NTN for annual testing ranged from 7 (7,8) at a score of 9 (highest risk) to 5708 (5494, 5930) at a score of 0 (lowest risk).

Testing people with diabetes every three years instead of every year would delay the diagnosis of CKD by a mean of 1.5 years for 2, 12, and 32 per 1000 people with diabetes aged 70 years, respectively. Corresponding delays associated with testing people with hypertension every three years instead of every year would impact 2, 9, and 27 per 1000 people aged less than 50 years.

### Too much nephrology? The CKD epidemic is real and concerning. A CON view [^1173VebH]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) clearly depends on its definition, and the definition used most often is the one proposed by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines in 2012: "CKD is defined as abnormalities of kidney structure or function, present for > 3 months, with implications for health". An abnormality of kidney function is indicated by a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² or an albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) > 30 mg/g (or 3 mg/mmol).

However, two major aspects of this definition could explain why CKD prevalence is, in our view, overstated in most epidemiological studies.

- **Fixed threshold for GFR**: The fixed threshold at 60 mL/min/1.73 m² is questionable because normal GFR decreases with age. This and the profound consequence it has on CKD epidemiology will be illustrated.

- **Criterion of chronicity**: The criterion of chronicity is ignored by the vast majority of epidemiological studies. In other words, confirming CKD (low GFR and/or high ACR) is mandatory. Indeed, a large proportion of subjects with a low first GFR level have a normal GFR level when tested a second time.

Hence, the prevalence of CKD may, in fact, be considerably lower, although still neither negligible nor irrelevant.

### Gfr estimating equations: Getting closer to the truth [^111WVSKN]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The application of serum creatinine and cystatin C in patients with CKD has been limited to using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Criteria for choosing the best GFR estimating equation are:

- **Accuracy in estimating measured GFR**: Must be reflected in the equation's precision.
- **Optimal discrimination of clinical outcomes**: The equation should predict clinical outcomes effectively.
- **Association with CKD risk factors and outcomes similar to that of measured GFR**: Despite being the most important criterion, this has been widely overlooked.

Notably, these criteria are often not in agreement. The primary problem with eGFR is that non-GFR determinants of serum creatinine and cystatin C, as well as their surrogates (age, sex, and race), associate with CKD risk factors and outcomes. This leads to a distorted understanding of CKD, though eGFR based on serum creatinine appears to be less biased than eGFR based on cystatin C. Due to this issue, the use of eGFR should be limited to settings where knowing actual GFR is relevant and eGFR is more informative about GFR than serum creatinine or cystatin C alone.

Such settings include staging CKD severity by GFR and dosing medications cleared by glomerular filtration. Alternatively, the diagnosis of CKD, the longitudinal progression of CKD, and prognostic models for CKD are settings where serum creatinine and cystatin C can be better applied and interpreted without eGFR.

### The abnormal urinalysis [^1126CRh8]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The urinalysis is one of the most commonly performed tests in pediatrics, and whether expected or incidental, abnormal findings are common. Understanding the strengths and limitations of the urinalysis allows one to maximize its use as a screening tool while avoiding expensive and unnecessary evaluations. This article reviews the significance of abnormal results on urine dipstick testing and urine microscopy. Causes of false positive and false negative results are summarized. Initial diagnostic considerations of abnormal urinalysis findings are provided where appropriate.

### Clinical evaluation of analytical variations in serum creatinine measurements: Why laboratories should abandon Jaffe techniques [^116KJRrG]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Accurate and precise measurements of serum creatinine (SCr) are essential for a more reliable estimation of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which supports dependable clinical decision-making. Enzymatic techniques measure SCr with substantially less variability compared to Jaffe techniques, particularly when assessed against isotope dilution mass spectrometry (ID-MS) reference values. This results in a more reliable estimation of GFR and chronic kidney disease (CKD) staging. To enhance the reliability of estimated GFR (eGFR), specific enzymatic techniques for measuring SCr are recommended over the unspecific Jaffe techniques.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^111nW6MG]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Regarding quality improvement for chronic kidney disease, particularly concerning laboratory requirements, the KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend implementing the following laboratory reporting and handling standards to ensure precision and reliability when evaluating urine samples:

- **Analyze samples**: For albumin measurement, analyze fresh samples or store them at 4 °C for up to 7 days.
- **Storage guidelines**: Do not store samples for albumin measurement frozen at -20 °C.
- **Reporting standards**: Report albumin-to-creatinine ratio in untimed urine samples in addition to urine albumin concentration rather than the concentrations alone.
- **Decimal precision**: Report to 1 decimal place for albumin-to-creatinine ratio, whether mg/mmol or mg/g.
- **Analytical precision**: Ensure the analytical coefficient of variation of methods to measure urine albumin is less than 15%.

### Optimization of screening strategy for chronic kidney disease by urine test strips using the albumin-creatinine read-out [^112oBR9w]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Clinical laboratories play an important role in the diagnosis and monitoring of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Our aim was to evaluate the performance of qualitative and semi-quantitative albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) test strip results as screening tools for albuminuria in multiple representative patient cohorts.

- **Materials and methods**: ACR and PCR were evaluated in both cross-sectional (n = 940) and validation (n = 927) patient cohorts. Semi-quantitative urinary ACR and PCR were performed using a UC-3500 instrument (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). The diagnostic performance of semi-quantitative ACR and PCR was determined using quantitative ACR and PCR as a reference method.

- **Results**: In the cross-sectional cohort, a sensitivity and specificity of 78.1% and 93.3%, respectively, were obtained for semi-quantitative ACR at a cut-off of 30 mg/g creatinine, with an overall agreement of > 90% between both methods. The sensitivity and specificity increased in the target population (validation cohort) to 89.9% and 92.1%, respectively. In contrast, the sensitivities of qualitative protein concentration (78.6%) and semi-quantitative PCR (69.8%) were lower.

- **Conclusion**: The results confirm that urine test strip readouts are a valuable screening tool for CKD in low-risk individuals. ACR should be the preferred criterion for reflex testing when using a urine test strip for screening CKD.

### False-positive rate of AKI using consensus creatinine-based criteria [^112LJMX7]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Use of small changes in serum creatinine to diagnose AKI allows for earlier detection but may increase diagnostic false-positive rates because of inherent laboratory and biologic variabilities of creatinine.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: We examined serum creatinine measurement characteristics in a prospective observational clinical reference cohort of 2267 adult patients with AKI by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes creatinine criteria and used these data to create a simulation cohort to model AKI false-positive rates. We simulated up to seven successive blood draws on an equal population of hypothetical patients with unchanging true serum creatinine values. Error terms generated from laboratory and biologic variabilities were added to each simulated patient's true serum creatinine value to obtain the simulated measured serum creatinine for each blood draw. We determined the proportion of patients who would be erroneously diagnosed with AKI by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes creatinine criteria.

- **Results**: Within the clinical cohort, 75.0% of patients received four serum creatinine draws within at least one 48-hour period during hospitalization. After four simulated creatinine measurements that accounted for laboratory variability calculated from assay characteristics and 4.4% of biologic variability determined from the clinical cohort and publicly available data, the overall false-positive rate for AKI diagnosis was 8.0% (interquartile range = 7.9%-8.1%) for patients with true serum creatinine values.

### Incidence, recognition, and follow-up of laboratory evidence of acute kidney injury in primary care practices: Analysis of 93,259 creatinine results [^115WFD66]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Community-acquired acute kidney injury (CA-acute kidney injury) is under-recognized in outpatient settings and is associated with adverse outcomes.

- **Methods**: We analyzed the incidence of CA-acute kidney injury in an academic primary care practice and community health center. Recognition and follow-up were assessed through repeat creatinine measurement (closed-loop). Our review included 93,259 specimens from 36,593 unique patients spanning from January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2021.

- **Results**: Among the patients, 220 unique cases of CA-acute kidney injury were identified, defined by a > 75% increase in creatinine from baseline (incidence: 150/100,000; 0.15% per year). Repeat serum creatinine was performed within 30 days for 137 patients (62.3%). Chart reviews for the 83 patients with open loops revealed that no follow-up creatinine was ordered for 69 out of 83 (83.1%) patients. The mean baseline creatinine was higher and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was lower in the closed-loop group (0.92 ± 0.4 mg/dL; 84.45 ± 27.49 mL/min) compared to the open-loop group (0.63 ± 0.34 mg/dL; 105.19 ± 26.67 mL/min) [P < .0001]. Pre-existing chronic kidney disease was more prevalent in closed-loop patients (35 out of 137; 25.6%) compared with open-loop patients (3 out of 83; 3.6%). Baseline chronic kidney disease increased the likelihood of closed loops. Progression to new chronic kidney disease was common, occurring in 25% of open-loop and 24.1% of closed-loop patients. The new baseline eGFR was lower across all groups.

- **Conclusions**: Clinicians frequently overlook follow-up in community-acquired acute kidney injury, highlighting the need for improved monitoring practices.

### Metabolic acidosis or respiratory alkalosis? Evaluation of a low plasma bicarbonate using the urine anion gap [^1116ZUbJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Hypobicarbonatemia, or a reduced bicarbonate concentration in plasma, is a finding seen in three acid-base disorders: metabolic acidosis, chronic respiratory alkalosis, and mixed metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. Hypobicarbonatemia due to chronic respiratory alkalosis is often misdiagnosed as metabolic acidosis and mistreated with the administration of alkali therapy. Proper diagnosis of the cause of hypobicarbonatemia requires integration of the laboratory values, arterial blood gas, and clinical history. The information derived from the urinary response to the prevailing acid-base disorder is useful to arrive at the correct diagnosis.

We discuss the use of the urine anion gap as a surrogate marker of urine ammonium excretion in the evaluation of a patient with low plasma bicarbonate concentration to differentiate between metabolic acidosis and chronic respiratory alkalosis. The interpretation and limitations of urine acid-base indexes at the bedside (urine pH, urine bicarbonate, and urine anion gap) to evaluate urine acidification are discussed.

### Diagnostic value of urinary sodium, chloride, urea, and flow [^1133HscU]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Up to 30% of hospitalized critically ill patients may experience a rise in serum creatinine concentration. Alongside history and physical examination, there is diagnostic value in assessing urinary electrolytes, solute excretion, and urine flow in these patients. Correct interpretation of these urinary parameters can prevent unnecessary volume overload and mechanical ventilation, which are risk factors for increased mortality in patients with rising serum creatinine. This article also discusses the role of arterial underfilling in causing prerenal azotemia, even with an increase in total body sodium and extracellular fluid expansion. Similar to extracellular fluid volume depletion, arterial underfilling secondary to impaired cardiac function or primary arterial vasodilation can hinder recovery from ischemic or toxic acute tubular necrosis. This brief review elaborates on the correct interpretation of urinary electrolytes, solute excretion, and urine flow in the context of rising serum creatinine concentrations.

### Measured and estimated glomerular filtration rate: Current status and future directions [^117PWaEL]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Evaluation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is central to the assessment of kidney function in medical practice, research, and public health. Measured GFR (mGFR) remains the reference standard, but the past 20 years have seen major advances in estimated GFR (eGFR). Both eGFR and mGFR are associated with error compared with true GFR. eGFR is now recommended by clinical practice guidelines, regulatory agencies, and public health agencies for the initial evaluation of GFR, with mGFR typically considered an important confirmatory test, depending on how accurate the assessment of GFR needs to be for application to the clinical, research, or public health setting. Our approach is to use initial and confirmatory tests as needed to develop a final assessment of true GFR. We suggest that GFR evaluation might be improved by more complete implementation of recommendations and by further research to improve the accuracy of mGFR and eGFR.

### Excessive diagnostic testing in acute kidney injury [^115YQBAo]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

In this retrospective study, we characterized the patterns and clinical utility of a wide variety of acute kidney injury (AKI) diagnostic tests, including urine, blood, radiology, and pathology tests. Our key findings are:

1. The frequency of testing increases with higher AKI stage for nearly all diagnostic tests.

2. The frequency of abnormal results increases with higher AKI stage for some, but not all, diagnostic tests.

3. Many of the tests evaluated have low clinical utility. In particular, selected urine and blood tests are unlikely to impact AKI diagnosis or management. Cumulatively, these data suggest a paucity of actionable diagnostic tests in AKI.

Previous studies have examined the utility of a limited number of AKI diagnostic tests in isolation, including urine microscopy, urine eosinophils, the fractional excretion of sodium and urea, and renal ultrasonography. Most of these studies have focused on a single diagnostic test, have been limited by modest sample sizes, and have focused on test performance without inclusion of data on frequency of testing. None, to our knowledge, have simultaneously evaluated the patterns and test performance of a wide variety of AKI diagnostic tests in a large AKI cohort.

To assess diagnostic yield, we focused mostly on abnormal test results. Although normal test results can also be clinically useful by ruling out diagnoses, our sensitivity analysis of normal test results for glomerulonephritis and paraproteinemia labs revealed very low diagnostic yield. We therefore focused on abnormal test results and evaluated diagnostic yield based on whether…

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^112LuMYS]. Nephron Clinical Practice (2012). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis for acute kidney injury, and more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, the KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend diagnosing AKI in patients meeting any of the following criteria:

- **Increase in serum creatinine**: By ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 mcmol/L) within 48 hours.

- **Increase in serum creatinine to ≥ 1.5 times baseline**: Known or presumed to have occurred within the prior 7 days.

- **Urine volume**: Of ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/hour for 6 hours.

### Excessive diagnostic testing in acute kidney injury [^111rWcXj]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

In summary, a large number of diagnostic tests are available for the evaluation of AKI, and determining which test to order should be based on estimates of pre-test probability and performance characteristics of the test.

Our data suggest that many of the currently available tests have limited clinical utility, even when they are abnormal or "positive". Thus, developing better diagnostic tests that provide reliable and actionable data on AKI diagnosis or management should be a priority in AKI research. The dearth of such tests may be a key reason why therapeutic advances to improve outcomes in AKI have been largely unsuccessful.

### Screening with urinary dipsticks for reducing morbidity and mortality [^11168YvC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Urinary dipsticks are sometimes used for screening asymptomatic people and for case-finding among inpatients or outpatients who do not have genitourinary symptoms. Abnormalities identified on screening sometimes lead to additional investigations, which may identify serious diseases, such as bladder cancer and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Urinary dipstick screening could improve prognoses due to earlier detection but could also lead to unnecessary and potentially invasive follow-up testing and unnecessary treatment.

- **Objectives**: We aimed to quantify the benefits and harms of screening with urinary dipsticks in general populations and patients in hospitals.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to 8 September 2014 through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials and other study types that compared urinary dipstick screening with no dipstick screening were eligible for inclusion. We searched for studies that investigated the use of urinary dipsticks for detecting haemoglobin, protein, albumin, albumin-creatinine ratio, leukocytes, nitrite, or glucose, alone or in any combination, and in any setting. We planned to exclude studies conducted in patients with urinary disorders.

- **Data collection and analysis**: It was planned that two authors would independently extract data from included studies and assess risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. However, no studies met our inclusion criteria.

### Point of care creatinine testing in diagnostic imaging: A feasibility study within the outpatient computed tomography setting [^114wmRK8]. European Journal of Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

Although the risks associated with iodinated contrast administration are acknowledged to be very low, screening of kidney function prior to administration is still standard practice in many hospitals. This study has evaluated the feasibility of implementing a screening form in conjunction with point of care (PoC) creatinine testing as a method to manage the risks of post contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI) within the CT imaging pathway.

- **Method**: Over an eight-week period, 300 adult outpatients attending a UK CT department for contrast-enhanced scans were approached. Participants completed a screening questionnaire for co-morbidities linked to kidney dysfunction and consented to have PoC and laboratory creatinine tests. Comparison was made against previous baseline blood tests obtained within the preceding 3 months, as required by the study site. Participants were also invited to attend follow-up PoC and laboratory blood tests at 48–72 hours.

- **Results**: Fourteen patients (4.7%) had a scan-day eGFR below 45mL/min/1.73 m², all identified through screening. The majority of patients (n = 281/300; 93.7%) fell in the same risk category based on previous and scan-day blood results. Six PoC test failures were recorded on the scan day. The constant error between the Abbott i-STAT PoC scan-day measurements and the laboratory scan-day measurements was -3.71 (95% CI: -6.41 to -0.50). Five patients had an elevated creatinine (≥ 25% from baseline) post contrast administration, but no instances of PC-AKI (≥ 50% from baseline) were identified.

- **Conclusion**: PoC creatinine testing is feasible within the outpatient CT imaging pathway.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease in children and adults: A commentary from the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) [^117CsudW]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Low credibility.

The KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline endorses point of care testing (POCT) for creatinine measurements given the convenience associated with this in some settings, placing less value on diagnostic accuracy. Given the need to improve the rate of detection of CKD in the community, even in Europe, where most health systems are relatively robust, POCT may be an important tool to improve rates of case finding. POCT for urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) may be similarly convenient and would permit more complete CKD staging in appropriately selected individuals.

- **Key practice points**: A detailed discussion of the accuracy of POCT devices for creatinine and uACR is beyond the scope of this article; however, as discussed in the KDIGO 2024 CKD Guideline, it is important to highlight potential drawbacks, especially in regions where resources may allow more accurate testing. Given the relevant concerns regarding the accuracy of various devices for both creatinine and albuminuria, potential benefits and harms should be considered and individualized. As with any test, it is crucial that testing is performed when indicated, in patients at risk of CKD. Importantly, a diagnosis of CKD cannot be made on a single test and must be confirmed through nephrology consultation if there is suspicion of advanced CKD or through repeat testing in individuals with higher eGFR and/or lower levels of albuminuria.
