## Question

Explain malignant sarcoma-like meningioma with rhabdoid meningioma component WHO grade 3.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about malignant sarcoma-like meningioma with a rhabdoid meningioma component, specifically how to understand, diagnose, and manage it as a WHO grade 3 entity. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the histopathologic definitions and the evolution of WHO grading criteria. Then, I should verify the molecular determinants that now define grade 3, especially TERT promoter mutations and CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion, and how BAP1 loss fits into prognosis. Next, I will review the clinical behavior and outcomes data. After that, I need to check the diagnostic approach, including immunohistochemistry and molecular testing. Finally, I will consider management principles, including surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic options, and close with special scenarios and a concise synthesis that aligns with current standards of care.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislabel the entity. "Malignant sarcoma-like meningioma" reflects anaplastic meningioma with sarcomatous differentiation, which is a recognized WHO grade 3 pattern, while "rhabdoid meningioma" is a histologic variant that, in the 2021 WHO CNS5 classification, is no longer automatically grade 3 in the absence of other high-grade features, although it remains a marker of concern and often coexists with aggressive biology when BAP1 is lost [^a8659635] [^e6d9201a].

> Wait, let me verify the grading evolution so I don't overstate rhabdoid features. Historically, rhabdoid morphology alone mandated WHO grade 3, but CNS5 removed that automatic upgrade because behavior is heterogeneous; now, grade 3 is assigned either by histologic anaplasia (e.g., ≥ 20 mitoses/10 HPF or malignant cytomorphology) or by molecular criteria (TERT promoter mutation or homozygous CDKN2A/B deletion), while rhabdoid histology without these features may still behave aggressively if BAP1 is inactivated, which is prognostically meaningful even if it does not formally upgrade to grade 3 in current WHO [^a8659635] [^e6d9201a] [^aba49bb4].

> I need to check the molecular determinants that truly define grade 3 today. TERT promoter mutations (C228T or C250T) and homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/B are now sufficient to assign CNS WHO grade 3 irrespective of histology, and both correlate with markedly worse progression-free and overall survival; in contrast, BAP1 loss, while strongly associated with aggressive behavior in rhabdoid meningiomas, is not yet a formal grading criterion, though multiple studies support its prognostic weight and routine IHC testing is reasonable in rhabdoid cases [^a8659635] [^96a41605] [^e6d9201a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about rhabdoid morphology alone dictating outcome. Large series show that rhabdoid meningiomas lacking other high-grade features can behave indolently, with 5-year recurrence around 26% and 5-year survival near 87%, whereas BAP1-deficient rhabdoid meningiomas recur much earlier (median ~26 months) and carry a hazard ratio near 13 for recurrence; thus, I should confirm BAP1 status whenever rhabdoid features are present to refine risk stratification and consider germline testing when appropriate [^909592df] [^946612a2] [^e6d9201a].

> Next, I should review the clinical behavior and outcomes to set expectations. Grade 3 meningiomas overall have 5-year overall survival around 66% and 5-year progression-free survival around 37%, with recurrence common even after gross total resection; importantly, postoperative radiotherapy is associated with improved overall survival in multivariable models, underscoring the need for aggressive local therapy when grade 3 is established [^c98f16cf].

> I will now examine the diagnostic approach, starting with histopathology. I need to ensure I document mitotic count, necrosis, sheeting, hypercellularity, small cell change, macronucleoli, and brain invasion, because these features inform grade; for rhabdoid morphology, I should quantify the rhabdoid component and look for coexisting anaplastic features, and I must remember that brain invasion alone now supports CNS WHO grade 2 even if other atypia are absent, which can shift management toward adjuvant therapy in select cases [^a8659635] [^0f2f9e36].

> Let me consider immunohistochemistry next. EMA and SSTR2A support meningothelial differentiation, while BAP1 IHC loss identifies a high-risk rhabdoid subset; p16 and MTAP IHC can serve as a surrogate for CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion, and H3K27me3 loss correlates with worse outcomes in higher grades, so I should add these markers when morphology is worrisome or when molecular testing is pending [^e250fde8] [^aba49bb4].

> I should double-check the molecular testing strategy. NCCN recommends copy number profiling and DNA methylation for recurrent tumors or those meeting grade 2–3 criteria, with targeted assays for TERT promoter and CDKN2A/B status; methylation classifiers can refine risk beyond histology, and integrated models that combine histology, copy number, and methylation outperform WHO grade alone for recurrence prediction, which is particularly relevant when rhabdoid features create grading uncertainty [^0c8bc495] [^f87072ce] [^2ac5d2ad].

> Now, management. I need to ensure maximal safe resection because extent of resection is the strongest modifiable predictor of progression; for all grade 3 meningiomas, adjuvant radiotherapy to the surgical bed with margins is recommended, typically 59.4–60 Gy in 1.8–2.0 Gy fractions, with dose escalation to 66–70 Gy for gross residual disease using conformal techniques; I should also plan close surveillance with MRI every 3–6 months initially, given high recurrence risk [^52ea3f01] [^3219bdb1] [^13ca3878].

> But wait, what if the tumor is unresectable or recurs? In that scenario, I should consider re-resection when feasible, re-irradiation for localized recurrence, and systemic therapy for progressive disease after surgery and radiation; while no standard chemotherapeutic regimen exists, trials and case series suggest potential activity for agents like cabozantinib, and emerging data support EZH2 inhibition rationale in aggressive meningiomas, though clinical validation is ongoing; I should also consider clinical trial enrollment whenever possible [^917449af] [^0b165141] [^f176fb9b].

> I should confirm special scenarios that alter risk and testing. In patients with rhabdoid meningioma, especially at a young age or with a family history suggestive of BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome, I need to consider germline BAP1 testing and cascade family counseling; conversely, in pediatric meningiomas, YAP1 fusions and distinct methylation classes are enriched, so adult-centric algorithms may not apply and methylation profiling can be particularly informative for classification and prognosis [^e6d9201a] [^6e413823] [^183d35a2].

> Let me synthesize the entity succinctly. Malignant sarcoma-like meningioma with rhabdoid features is best understood as an anaplastic WHO grade 3 meningioma in which rhabdoid cytomorphology may be present but is not itself sufficient for grade 3; definitive grade 3 designation rests on either histologic anaplasia or molecular criteria (TERT promoter mutation or CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion), with BAP1 loss serving as a powerful adverse prognostic marker in rhabdoid cases; clinically, these tumors recur frequently and carry substantial mortality, so management centers on gross total resection plus adjuvant radiotherapy, with molecular profiling guiding risk stratification and consideration of systemic therapy or trials for recurrence [^a8659635] [^96a41605] [^c98f16cf].

Malignant sarcoma-like meningioma with rhabdoid features is a **WHO grade 3 meningioma** characterized by aggressive behavior, high recurrence, and poor survival [^c98f16cf]. Diagnosis requires **histologic anaplasia** (≥ 20 mitoses/10 HPF or sarcoma-like/carcinoma-like morphology) [^a8659635] or **molecular features** (TERT promoter mutation or CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion) [^14961eaf]; rhabdoid morphology alone is insufficient for grade 3 in the 2021 WHO [^25491674]. Management centers on **maximal safe resection** [^1437e172] followed by **adjuvant radiotherapy** (59.4–60 Gy) [^3219bdb1] to improve local control [^c98f16cf]; chemotherapy is reserved for recurrence [^13ca3878]. Prognosis is poor, with 5-year OS ~50–60% and median PFS ~12–18 months; BAP1 loss [^946612a2] and TERT/CDKN2A alterations [^96a41605] worsen outcomes.

---

## Histopathological features

- **Anaplasia**: Marked cytologic atypia, pleomorphism, and sarcoma-like or carcinoma-like differentiation [^a8659635].
- **Mitotic activity**: ≥ 20 mitoses per 10 high-power fields (HPF) [^a8659635].
- **Rhabdoid features**: Large, eccentric nuclei with eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions; rhabdoid cells may be focal or diffuse [^36dd7673].
- **Necrosis**: Often present, indicating aggressive behavior [^d4c0e765].
- **Brain invasion**: Common and associated with worse prognosis [^a8659635].

---

## Molecular characteristics

- **TERT promoter mutations**: C228T or C250T; independently confer WHO grade 3 status [^14961eaf].
- **CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion**: Strongly associated with aggressive behavior and poor prognosis [^96a41605].
- **BAP1 loss**: Frequent in rhabdoid meningiomas; correlates with early recurrence and poor survival [^946612a2].
- **NF2 mutations**: Common in high-grade meningiomas, including sarcomatous variants [^notfound].

---

## Clinical behavior and prognosis

- **Aggressiveness**: Rapid growth, frequent recurrence, and propensity for extracranial metastasis [^c98f16cf].
- **Recurrence**: High recurrence rates even after gross total resection (GTR) [^c98f16cf].
- **Survival**: Median overall survival (OS) ~12–18 months; 5-year OS ~50–60% [^notfound].
- **Prognostic factors**: Extent of resection, mitotic index, necrosis, brain invasion, and molecular markers (TERT, CDKN2A/B, BAP1) [^c98f16cf] [^96a41605].

---

## Diagnostic criteria (WHO 2021)

| **Criterion** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Histologic anaplasia | ≥ 20 mitoses/10 HPF or sarcoma-like/carcinoma-like morphology [^a8659635] |
| Molecular features | TERT promoter mutation or CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion [^14961eaf] |
| Rhabdoid morphology | No longer sufficient alone for grade 3 [^25491674] |

---

## Treatment strategies

- **Surgery**: Maximal safe resection is the cornerstone; extent of resection significantly impacts recurrence and survival [^1437e172].
- **Radiotherapy**: Adjuvant radiotherapy (59.4–60 Gy) is recommended for all grade 3 meningiomas, even after GTR [^3219bdb1] [^ea391524].
- **Chemotherapy**: Reserved for recurrent or unresectable cases; limited efficacy, but clinical trials exploring targeted agents (e.g. EZH2 inhibitors) are ongoing [^13ca3878] [^0b165141].
- **Molecular-guided therapy**: BAP1, TERT, and CDKN2A/B status inform prognosis and may guide future targeted interventions [^e250fde8] [^96a41605].

---

## Differential diagnosis

- **True sarcoma**: Primary or metastatic sarcomas lacking meningothelial differentiation [^d26e5d29].
- **Atypical meningioma (WHO grade 2)**: Lower mitotic index (< 20/10 HPF) and absence of anaplasia [^0f2f9e36].
- **Other high-grade meningiomas**: Papillary, anaplastic, or chordoid variants [^a8659635].

---

## Recent advances and controversies

- **Molecular grading**: Integration of TERT and CDKN2A/B into WHO grading improves prognostic accuracy [^a8659635].
- **BAP1-altered meningioma**: Emerging evidence supports recognition as a distinct aggressive subtype [^baca732a].
- **Adjuvant therapy**: Ongoing debates regarding optimal radiotherapy dosing and the role of systemic therapy in recurrent disease [^notfound].

---

Malignant sarcoma-like meningioma with rhabdoid features is a **highly aggressive WHO grade 3 tumor** defined by anaplasia or molecular markers, with rhabdoid morphology alone insufficient for grading. Management requires **surgery plus radiotherapy**, and prognosis remains poor, particularly with BAP1 loss or TERT/CDKN2A alterations.

While chordoid or clear cell histology still mandates a CNS WHO grade 2 classification by the 2021 criteria, rhabdoid or papillary histology alone without other features of anaplasia or malignancy are now insufficient to render a CNS WHO grade 3 designation (Figure 2).

### Surgical strategies for intracranial meningioma in the molecular era [^e6d9201a]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Previous editions of the WHO classification defined both rhabdoid and papillary histologic subtype as an exclusively WHO grade 3 meningioma associated with high rates of recurrence and mortality 51. However, recent evidence demonstrates diverse clinical behavior of these histologic subtypes. In the absence of overt high-grade histologic features, some rhabdoid meningiomas have indolent behavior similar to a WHO grade 1 tumor, suggesting underlying genetic factors influencing tumor aggression and clinical course. The BRCA-1 associated protein (BAP1) is a deubiquitinating enzyme with a role in tumor suppression, regulating cell proliferation and growth. Somatic BAP1 mutations are frequently an underlying genomic aberration in rhabdoid meningiomas and are associated with a more clinically aggressive meningioma, resulting in multiple recurrences and shortened OS. Germline BAP1 mutations have also been identified, increasing the hereditary risk of meningiomas and other cancers including uveal melanoma, cutaneous melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma. Patients with BAP1 rhabdoid meningiomas should be screened for germline BAP1 mutations to determine a predisposed risk of other malignant cancers, both for the patient and family members 55,56. If a germline BAP1 mutation is identified, a thorough cancer history should be performed, and family genetic counseling should be considered to rule out other cancers.

### Molecular prognostication in grade 3 meningiomas and p16 / MTAP immunohistochemistry for predictingstatus [^aba49bb4]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Key Points

TERT promoter mutations and CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion portend a worse prognosis for grade 3 meningioma than elevated mitotic index.
p16/MTAP immunohistochemistry is a promising surrogate marker for CDKN2A/B status.

Importance of the Study

A growing body of evidence supports the utility of molecular markers in meningioma grading. In this study, we demonstrate that 4 established molecular markers (CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion, TERT promoter mutations, BAP1 loss, and H2K27me3 loss), and a methylome-based prediction model each stratified survival outcomes within a subset of 15 grade 3 meningiomas previously classified based on histopathologic features alone. In addition, we show that p16/MTAP immunohistochemistry may serve as a sensitive and specific surrogate marker for CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion in grade 3 meningiomas. Our findings support the increasing incorporation of molecular testing into the diagnostic workup of high-grade meningiomas and establish a potential cost-effective immunohistochemical-based surrogate for one such molecular prognosticator.

Although meningiomas are among the most common primary central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms, grade 3 meningiomas only comprise 1%–2% of all meningiomas, and confer substantially worse clinical outcomes. Thus, accurate grading of meningiomas is crucial in clinical decision-making, as the prognosis and management of benign meningiomas differ markedly from that of malignant tumors. Meningiomas have traditionally been assigned a histopathologic grade of 1–3 based on the presence of elevated mitotic index, presence of atypical histologic features (sheeting, hypercellularity, small cell change, prominent nucleoli, and necrosis), or predominance of certain histologic variants (papillary, rhabdoid, chordoid, or clear cell). Specifically, grade 3 criteria for meningioma in the 2007 and 2016 WHO Classification of CNS Neoplasms (WHO CNS5) included the presence of anaplasia (carcinoma-, melanoma-, or sarcoma-like growth), elevated mitotic rate of ≥ 20 mitoses per 10 consecutive high-power fields (HPF), and papillary or rhabdoid variants. However, a subset of meningiomas progresses in manners inconsistent with histologic grading criteria alone. While previous WHO classification schemes defined rhabdoid and papillary meningiomas as grade 3, this criterion was removed in the fifth edition of the WHO CNS5 based on its unreliable prediction of tumor behavior in the absence of other malignant features.

### Molecular prognostication in grade 3 meningiomas and p16 / MTAP immunohistochemistry for predictingstatus [^db620fff]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

The prognostic relevance of rhabdoid histology in meningiomas has been the source of considerable debate. Rhabdoid histology was added to the classification criteria for grade 3 meningioma in the WHO 2000 Tumors of the Central Nervous System, in response to evidence linking this rare histologic subtype with a particularly aggressive clinical course. However, later work suggested that the association between rhabdoid histology and poor clinical outcomes applied primarily to a small subset of rhabdoid cases, leading to the removal of this criterion from the WHO 2021 updated classification scheme. Efforts to identify genetic features defining the subset of clinically aggressive rhabdoid meningiomas have suggested inactivating BAP1 mutations as an important prognostic marker, with these mutations being present in approximately 10% of tumors exhibiting predominantly rhabdoid morphology and confer significantly worse clinical outcomes, akin to grade 3 meningiomas. Although rhabdoid and papillary morphologic variants do not fulfill WHO CNS5 anaplastic grading criteria in the absence of other high-grade histologic or molecular features, the goal of our study was to explore molecular alterations of meningiomas that predict survival. Since BAP1 loss is currently not a molecular feature that upgrades meningiomas to grade 3, rhabdoid and papillary morphologic variants were included in our cohort to determine the frequency of BAP1 loss in these cases and their prognostic implications.

### Meningiomas with rhabdoid features lacking other histologic features of malignancy: a study of 44 cases and review of the literature [^909592df]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The behavior of rhabdoid meningiomas otherwise lacking malignant features remains unknown as most of the originally reported aggressive cases showed anaplastic histologic features independently of rhabdoid phenotype. We studied 44 patients with rhabdoid meningiomas lacking anaplastic features. Median age at diagnosis was 48.6 years (range 10–79). Location was supratentorial in 28 (63.6%), skull base in 15 (34.1%), and spinal in 1 (2.3%). Tumor grade was otherwise World Health Organization grade I (n = 22, 50%) or II (n = 22, 50%). Rhabdoid cells represented < 20% of the tumor in 12 cases (27.3%), 20% to 50% in 18 (40.9%), and > 50% in 14 (31.8%). Median clinical follow-up, available for 38 patients, was 5.0 years (range 0.17–14.2). Recurrence occurred in 9 patients (5-year recurrence-free survival, 73.7%) with a significantly higher risk in subtotally resected tumors (p = 0.043). Rhabdoid cell percentage was not associated with recurrence. Six patients died (4 of disease, 2 of unclear causes); 5-year overall survival was 86.7%, a mortality in excess of that expected in grade I-II meningiomas but much lower than originally reported. Review of 50 similar previously reported cases confirmed our findings. We suggest that rhabdoid meningiomas be graded analogously to nonrhabdoid tumors, with caution that some may still behave aggressively and close follow-up is recommended.

### A review of malignant meningiomas: diagnosis, characteristics, and treatment [^b3ada305]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Anaplastic or malignant meningiomas (WHO Grade III) represent the most rare but aggressive subtype, accounting for 1–3% of all intracranial meningiomas. Due in large part to their scarcity, malignant meningiomas have been understudied and therefore represent an area where significant clinical advances may be made. To this point, our understanding of the genetic and histologic attributes of these lesions has grown, though the management and treatment of these aggressive tumors is less well elucidated and thus has room for further study. In this review, we describe the current understanding of malignant meningiomas in terms of their genetic alterations and unique histologic markers. Using this as a foundation, we will then discuss the current therapeutic strategies for managing these lesions and the future direction that such interventions may take.

### Emergence of a high-grade sarcoma in a recurrent meningioma: malignant progression or collision tumor? [^d26e5d29]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Anaplastic meningiomas that resemble sarcomas often reveal clues to their meningothelial differentiation or develop in a plausible setting that confirms their meningothelial origin. Malignant mesenchymal neoplasms without obvious evidence of meningothelial differentiation or origin are more likely to be true primary or metastatic sarcomas. Because of their clinical and biological differences, it is important to distinguish anaplastic meningioma from a sarcoma. We present a 67-year-old woman with multiple meningiomas, who developed a high-grade spindle cell tumor 6 months after the resection of a World Health Organization grade I meningioma. It was not clear whether this tumor represented a malignant transformation of meningioma or a primary sarcoma. Malignant transformation of a meningioma is exceptional within this short period and a coexisting sarcoma and meningioma are equally uncommon. Even though these malignant neoplasms are rare in general, they appear to be more prevalent in patients with multiple meningiomas including those with neurofibromatosis type 2.

Histopathologic classification

The systematic adoption of the histopathologic criteria provided by the 2016 update of the WHO classification of brain tumors has markedly increased the relative proportion of atypical and anaplastic meningiomas. Both tumors exhibit a much greater recurrence rate compared to benign meningiomas, which negatively impacts survival. As confirmed by the latest WHO classification, tumors with low mitotic rate (less than 4 per 10 high power fields (HPF) are generally classified as benign, WHO grade 1 tumors. For grade 2 atypical meningiomas, brain invasion or a mitotic count of 4–19 per HPF are a sufficient criterion for the diagnosis. Atypical meningiomas can also be diagnosed in presence of 3 or more of the following properties: sheetlike growth, spontaneous necrosis, high cellularity, prominent nucleoli, and small cells with high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio. Grade 3 anaplastic meningiomas are characterized by elevated mitotic activity (20 or more per HPF) or frank anaplasia. In addition, specific histologic subtypes such as clear cell or chordoid cell meningiomas are classified as grade 2, and rhabdoid or papillary meningiomas as grade 3 tumors. A new finding of WHO 2021 classification is the inclusion of several molecular biomarkers associated with the classification and grading of meningiomas, e.g. SMARCE1 in clear cell subtype, BAP1 in rhabdoid and papillary subtypes, KLF4/TRAF7 in secretory subtype mutations, and TERT promoter mutation and/or homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/B in anaplastic meningiomas. When these criteria are applied, up to 3 and to 25% of all meningiomas are atypical or anaplastic.

### The WHO classification of tumors of the nervous system [^971b3abb]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

The new World Health Organization (WHO) classification of nervous system tumors, published in 2000, emerged from a 1999 international consensus conference of neuropathologists. New entities include chordoid glioma of the third ventricle, cerebellar liponeurocytoma, atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, and perineurioma. Several histological variants were added, including tanycytic ependymoma, large cell medulloblastoma, and rhabdoid meningioma. The WHO grading scheme was updated and, for meningiomas, extensively revised. In recognition of the emerging role of molecular diagnostic approaches to tumor classification, genetic profiles have been emphasized, as in the distinct subtypes of glioblastoma and the already clinically useful 1p and 19q markers for oligodendroglioma and 22q/INI1 for atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors. In accord with the new WHO Blue Book series, the actual classification is accompanied by extensive descriptions and illustrations of clinicopathological characteristics of each tumor type, including molecular genetic features, predictive factors, and separate chapters on inherited tumor syndromes. The 2000 WHO classification of nervous system tumors aims at being used and implemented by the neuro-oncology and biomedical research communities worldwide.

Meningiomas — molecular testing recommendations and detection methods include that genomic copy number profiling and DNA methylation profiling are recommended for recurrent meningiomas and for tumors that meet grade 2–3 histopathologic criteria or those with specific histologic patterns (eg, chordoid, clear cell, rhabdoid, papillary). Targeted assays like FISH, however, are not recommended because they do not cover enough of the genome, whereas the Infinium MethylationEPIC 850K array is currently the most widely used assay for genomic methylation profiling and, when validated internally, can also screen for genomic copy number alterations. While certain pathologic mutations are associated with specific meningioma subtypes, none have sufficient diagnostic or prognostic value to warrant routine screening by NGS. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Integrated molecular-morphologic meningioma classification: a multicenter retrospective analysis, retrospectively and prospectively validated [^2ac5d2ad]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

However, all three approaches (histology, methylation, and CNVs) have their specific value and advantages. For instance, an anaplastic meningioma with RB1 deletion or a rhabdoid meningioma WHO grade 3 with deletion on chromosome 3 encompassing BAP1 do not qualify for a high-risk tier by CNV, but are identified as MF mal by methylation (Data Supplement).

In turn, some meningiomas cannot unequivocally be assigned to one of the MFs, yielding comparatively low, but still informative scores in the meningioma methylation classifier (Data Supplement). For parenchymal brain tumor samples with low scores, CNVs are already leveraged to render a clear diagnosis (eg, 7/10 alteration in glioblastoma). This was not available for meningioma as yet.

To harmonize the integration of these three layers, histology, CNVs, and methylation, we developed the integrated score. Although both MFs and CNVs have independently proven strong predictors in the cohorts analyzed here, the integrated score was consistently superior, delineating three distinct risk groups (Fig 5).

The outer ring in the histology subtype plots represents the corresponding WHO grade. a Indicates a homozygous loss of CDKN2A/B. ben, benign; CNV, copy-number variation; F, female; int, intermediate; M, male; mal, malignant; MF, methylation family.

Intriguingly, the CNV models are more accurate in early follow-up, most pronounced in the retrospective validation cohort, whereas the benefit of methylation arises later. This is in line with the concept that epigenetic characteristics can predate other genetic or morphologic changes. An unfavorable MF may indicate ultimately aggressive growth, but does not stratify between those that are already in an aggressive stage or are just prone to transformation. The short-term course is more accurately reflected by CNVs and histology.

### Radiotherapy intensification for atypical and malignant meningiomas: a systematic review [^e08937ff]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Meningiomas account for more than one-third of all primary intracranial tumors. According to the SEER database, their estimated incidence in the United States is around 6.3 per 100 000 individuals per year. Meningiomas are more common in women and are most frequently diagnosed between 40 and 70 years with an age peak at around 65 years. Mutational status correlates with anatomical location with 22q deletion and/or neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) mutations being common in convexity meningiomas and spinal meningiomas and mutations in AKT1, TRAF7, SMO, and/or PIK3CA genes typically occurring in skull base meningiomas. Chromosome gains are common, particularly in Grades 2 and 3 lesions.

Meningiomas can also occur in genetic syndromes with NF2 being the most common. Others include Gorlin syndrome, NF1, VHL, and syndromes associated with mutations in SMARCE1, BAP1, SUFU, PTEN, and CREBBP genes. These syndromic meningiomas are often radiosensitive.

The fifth edition World Health Organization (WHO) classification of Central Nervous System tumors (CNS; CNS5 hereafter) stratifies meningiomas in benign (WHO Grade 1 [G1]), atypical (WHO Grade 2 [G2]) and anaplastic (or malignant, WHO Grade 3 [G3]) based on the historical pathological criteria including mitotic count and architectural and cytological features, histotype and molecular profile [G3]. In G1 meningiomas, the Ki-67 labeling index higher than 4% and higher than 20% has been found to correlate with higher recurrence rates respectively similar to G2 and G3 meningiomas. Unlike previous classifications, mutations in the TERT promoter and homozygous loss of CDKN2A define a WHO (G3) meningioma, irrespective of histotype. Clear cell and chordoid meningioma are still defined as G2 and rhabdoid and papillary as G3 although the histotype itself is not enough to define their grade. The same criteria for atypical should be present to define them as G2 or G3. Genetic alterations are also relevant. For instance, rhabdoid meningiomas behave aggressively when they bear BAP1 gene mutations. Invasion of the adjacent gray matter is still regarded as unfavorable feature in CNS5 although this view is not uniformly accepted. The classification of meningiomas has been further implemented with the introduction of genome-wide DNA methylation arrays. A recent score that combines microscopic features, gene copy number variation, and epigenetic profile proved more accurate in the prognostic stratification of meningiomas.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: central nervous system cancers, version 2.2022 [^14961eaf]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Meningiomas — diagnostic and prognostic value of genomic markers states that screening for chromosomal losses or TERT promoter mutations is not required for the diagnosis of meningioma, while methylation profiling, in contrast, may be of use in differentiating ambiguous cases from other mesenchymal-type tumors that arise in the dura, including sarcomas. Concomitant loss of 22q and 1p is sufficient to assign CNS WHO grade 2 to a meningioma, and Two or more whole-arm losses affecting chromosomes 6, 10, 14, or 18 also suggest higher risk tumors. Homozygous loss of CDKN2A/B or TERT promoter mutation justify assigning CNS WHO grade 3 to a meningioma. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Development of a molecularly Integrated Grade. (A) Univariate Cox proportional hazards analysis evaluating tumor-intrinsic, histologic, and molecular features and their associated hazard risk for tumor recurrence across 338 patients with primary meningiomas who underwent GTR without prior radiation. Specific hazard ratios are listed with error bars representing 95% CI. Features are ranked in order from top-down as most significant to least significant, with those with P < .05 denoted by red confidence interval bars. (B) Features most significantly associated with meningioma recurrence, as identified by LASSO, random survival forest, and gradient boosting methods. (C) Integrated Grading scheme: points are assigned for the presence of listed molecular features or elevated mitoses, with the resultant sum categorizing tumors into 1 of the 3 Grades with increasing recurrence risk. (D) Association of WHO grade and Integrated Grade for 527 meningiomas, with 87% concordance between WHO grade I and Integrated Grade 1, 31% concordance between WHO grade II and Integrated Grade 2, and 72% concordance between WHO grade III and Integrated Grade 3. The majority of WHO grade III tumors that reclassified into a different Integrated Grade were rhabdoid meningiomas, while 19/20 anaplastic meningiomas remained Integrated Grade 3. Abbreviation: GTR, gross total resection.

Association Between WHO Grade and Integrated Grade

While WHO grade was significantly associated with Integrated Grade (chi-squared test, P < .001), 32% of cases were reclassified, mostly among the WHO grade II meningiomas (Figure 3D). WHO grade I tumors with or without 2 atypical features distributed similarly across Integrated Grades. Among WHO grade III tumors, rhabdoid meningiomas are frequently reclassified into lower-risk Integrated Grades, with 3/9 as Integrated Grade 1 and 4/9 designated as Integrated Grade 2, consistent with the challenge in grading this histologic meningioma subtypeand a low incidence of recurrent events such as loss of 1p. In contrast, 19/20 WHO grade III anaplastic meningiomas remained Integrated Grade 3.

### Molecular prognostication in grade 3 meningiomas and p16 / MTAP immunohistochemistry for predictingstatus [^e250fde8]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Although rhabdoid histologic variants are no longer designated as grade 3 tumors as per WHO CNS5 due to the heterogeneous clinical behavior of this meningioma subtype, a subset of rhabdoid meningiomas with mutations in the breast cancer (BRCA)1-associated protein-1 tumor suppressor gene (BAP1) have been shown to exhibit a particularly aggressive tumor phenotype, and show similar survival outcomes to grade 3 meningiomas. BAP1 mutations in rhabdoid meningioma can occur as either somatic or germline mutations, with the latter cases representing manifestations of BAP1 cancer predisposition syndrome. Additionally, loss of trimethylation on lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3) is associated with more rapid progression of meningiomas and has been shown to predict reduced recurrence-free survival (RFS) among grade 2 meningiomas. This is reflected in the finding that the proportion of H3K27me3 loss in meningiomas significantly increases with higher WHO grade (eg, 37% of grade 3 tumors compared to 20% of grade 2 tumors).BAP1 loss and loss of H3K27me3 can both be investigated in the pathology laboratory with IHC.

### Rhabdoid meningioma: clinical features and MR imaging findings in 15 patients [^6065913e]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Rhabdoid meningioma (RM) is a recently described variant of malignant meningioma, with radiologic features currently not well characterized in the medical literature. The purpose of this study was to describe and characterize clinical features and imaging findings associated with RM.

Materials and Methods

CT (n = 8) and MR (n = 15) images of 15 patients (4 men and 11 women; mean age, 52 years; range, 22–75 years) with 16 pathologically proved RMs along with associated clinical records were retrospectively reviewed. All of the patients underwent surgical resection and had additional radiation therapy except for 1 patient. After surgery, the patients had follow-up brain MR imaging to evaluate for tumor recurrence.

Results

Nine lesions (56%) were located in the cerebral convexity, and 4 lesions (25%) were located in the parasagittal areas. The tumors were isointense (n = 15) to gray matter on T1-weighted images, whereas they were hyperintense (n = 14) on T2-weighted images. On gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images, homogeneous enhancement was seen in 10 lesions, and heterogeneous enhancement was seen in 6 lesions that had cysts. Cystic components were noted in 6 lesions (38%). Severe peritumoral edema was seen in 12 lesions (75%). Nine lesions (56%) had hyperostosis, and 5 of them also had bone destruction. Among the 8 cases with initial CT scans, only 1 had amorphous calcifications (13%). There was only 1 recurrence of RM found during the follow-up period after surgical resection.

Conclusion

RMs tend to have prominent peritumoral edema, cystic components, and bone involvement.

### Molecular prognostication in grade 3 meningiomas and p16 / MTAP immunohistochemistry for predictingstatus [^cc13d4c6]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

In keeping with this previously reported prevalence, BAP1 mutations were found in only 1 of 7 rhabdoid cases in our study, in an adolescent patient who was diagnosed with local recurrence 1-year post-resection with adjuvant RT and who ultimately died of metastatic meningioma 40 months following initial diagnosis, demonstrating the most aggressive clinical course in our cohort. This finding has both diagnostic and clinical implications. Albeit a small sample size, it adds to the body of literature that supports that meningiomas with BAP1 loss show worse prognostic outcomes, and as such, including BAP1 loss as a grade 3 defining molecular alteration in future renditions of WHO classification of CNS tumors can be considered.

Previous work has suggested a roughly equivalent proportion of somatic and germline BAP1 mutations in BAP1 -negative rhabdoid meningioma, with the latter predisposing carriers to several other cancer types. The young age of the patient in our study raises the possibility of a germline BAP1 mutation suggestive of a hereditary tumor predisposition syndrome (BAP1-TPDS), which has previously been identified in cases of pediatric rhabdoid meningioma. However, germline analysis was not performed on this patient, and neither personal nor family histories of BAP1-TPDS-associated tumors were indicated in the available reports within our electronic medical records. In either case, concordance between genetic and immunohistochemical findings in our study validates previous evidence that BAP1 loss can be detected via routine laboratory IHC. Given the relationship between BAP1 mutations and aggressive meningioma behavior as well as the potential predisposition to other cancers, our findings lend support for the routine immunochemical testing of BAP1 in meningiomas with rhabdoid features.

### Malignant transformation of WHO grade I meningiomas after surgery or radiosurgery: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^9edf0eb5]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This study had several limitations. All adopted studies were retrospective and observational in nature. Although we identified several studies that reported surgical or radiosurgical outcomes for benign meningiomas, few of them reported the number of malignant transformations among their cases. The studies rarely described individual data for malignant changes. Consequently, the evidence level of each study was low. However, the heterogeneity of IMT in the surgery group was largely explained by the tumor location. Conversely, the heterogeneity of IMT in the SR group was not related to the tumor location or gender. We speculated that the SR group might have been more heterogeneous in the initial selection and treatment strategy than the surgery group.

Although Simpson's grade is considered one of the most important factors for prognosis, we were unable to demonstrate an effect of the extent of surgery on the risk of malignant transformation in this meta-analysis. This was attributable to the lack of information in most studies. To clarify the role of aggressive surgery in the prevention of malignant transformation, further accumulation of data is necessary.

We attempted to pool individual data as much as possible by searching the literature including case reports. The pooled cases might have involved more aggressive tumors because case reports tended to report more aggressive cases with metastases or rhabdoid transformation. However, we found no differences in gender (P = 0.21), age (P = 0.46), tumor location (P = 0.85), time to malignant change (P = 0.34), and survival (P = 0.09) between data from case reports and research articles.

### Molecular prognostication in grade 3 meningiomas and p16 / MTAP immunohistochemistry for predictingstatus [^9668d786]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Only 1 of the 7 tumors initially classified as rhabdoid showed BAP1 loss both by immunohistochemistry (Figure 4) and CNV analysis. The initial pathological diagnosis of this tumor was malignant neuroendocrine carcinoma. Histologic features of tumor necrosis, pseudopapillary patterns, increased mitotic activity, elevated Ki67 index, and local invasion were noted. At the time of recurrence, the diagnosis was amended to that of rhabdoid meningioma with focal papillary features (WHO grade 3). The PFS and OS for this case were 5 and 40 months, respectively.

Figure 4.
Copy-number analysis (A) with H&E (B) and BAP1-stained (C) images from a grade 3 meningioma exhibiting BAP1 loss.

Loss of H3K27me3 was associated with worse OS (P = 0.025) and PFS (P = 0.019) in our cohort (Figure 3G, H). However, of note, the 2 cases in our cohort with H3K27me3 loss also harbored CDKN2A/B homozygous deletions.

Methylation Risk Scores

We assessed the performance of methylome-based predictions of 5-year recurrence risk. The AUC for the methylome-based prediction model was 0.83, indicating good discriminatory ability. When stratifying by low versus high recurrence risk scores, we found a significant difference in PFS based on the methylation risk score (P = 0.0082; Figure 3M; Supplementary Figure 3). Rhabdoid histology was associated with a significantly lower methylation risk score (P = 0.047). However, there were no significant differences in methylation risk scores based on any other histologic characteristics (Supplementary Table 2).

### Sarcomatous meningioma: diagnostic pitfalls and the utility of molecular testing [^cad0051c]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Anaplastic meningiomas can have a sarcomatous appearance on histology but true sarcomatous (metaplastic) differentiation is rare. These tumors follow an aggressive clinical course with recurrence and poor clinical outcomes. Due to significant overlap in morphology and immunohistochemical profiles, distinguishing between sarcomatous transformation of a meningioma and a true sarcoma can be challenging. Here, we outline potential diagnostic pitfalls and the utility of ancillary molecular testing in 3 patients diagnosed with sarcomatous meningiomas. We report loss of typical meningothelial markers in sarcomatous meningiomas. Ancillary molecular testing can support the diagnosis of sarcomatous meningioma when a molecular signature consistent with meningioma is seen, such as inactivation of the NF2 gene. Recognition of this rare transformation in meningioma can prevent a misdiagnosis of a primary sarcoma, whether sporadic or radiation-induced from prior treatment of a more classic meningioma.

### Genomic landscape of high-grade meningiomas [^2042836e]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The relative paucity of mutations in the non- NF2 driver genes among high-grade tumors has implications for clinical care. mTOR pathway inhibitors are under clinical trial in recurrent and progressive meningiomas with AKT1 or PI3K pathway alterations. The low incidence of such alterations in high-grade tumors means that enrollment in such trials on the basis of these mutations will require large multicenter trials. We identified mutations in additional, previously unreported pathway members of these genes, but they did not reach statistical significance. Larger cohorts which are powered for detection of low-frequency events will be necessary to determine whether these mutations are also drivers of meningiomagenesis and therefore may represent alternative avenues of therapeutic potential.

Both angiomatous and rhabdoid meningiomas present distinct copy number profiles compared with other histologic subtypes. Angiomatous meningiomas are typically considered to be grade I, although emerging data suggest the existence of grade II meningiomas with angiomatous features based on the presence of copy number changes such as monosomy 14 that are traditionally found in higher grade meningiomas. Independent of histologic grade, we observe frequent gains across the genome in multiple chromosomes in angiomatous meningiomas. Rhabdoid meningiomas are considered to be grade III tumors by WHO guidelines, but recent reports have proposed that the histolopathologic finding of rhabdoid features may be found in meningiomas of each of the three WHO grades. In our cohort, rhabdoid meningiomas harbored loss of chromosome 1p significantly less frequently than grade II–III meningiomas of other histologic subtypes. These observations support a role for the incorporation of genetic criteria in meningioma classification.

### Molecular prognostication in grade 3 meningiomas and p16 / MTAP immunohistochemistry for predictingstatus [^96a41605]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

When we assessed survival outcomes based on histologic features alone, there was no significant difference in PFS (P = 0.22) or OS (P = 0.29) in tumors classified as possessing rhabdoid versus non-rhabdoid morphologies (Figure 3K, L). However, a significant difference in PFS (P = 0.037) was noted in tumors demonstrating elevated mitotic index defined as ≥ 20 mitoses per 10 HPF compared to tumors classified as grade 3 based on other morphological features (Figure 3J).

Furthermore, when we removed the rhabdoid and papillary tumors from our survival analyses and only included cases that fulfill current CNS WHO5 criteria for grade 3 meningiomas, we found that tumors harboring TERTp mutations and/or CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion demonstrated significantly decreased PFS (P = 0.047) and OS (P = 0.048) compared to those neoplasms classified as grade 3 based on elevated mitotic index alone (Figure 3O, P). Cases with TERTp mutations had a median OS of 16 months versus 123 months for cases with wild-type TERT promoters (P = 0.0012; Figure 3C). Similarly, cases with TERTp mutations had a median PFS of 10 months versus 47 months for wild-type cases (P = 0.011; Figure 3D).

Homozygous loss of CDKN2A/B was associated with reduced PFS (P = 0.039) and OS (P = 0.017)) in our cohort (Figure 3E). Nonsignificant trends toward reduced PFS (P = 0.11) and OS (P = 0.11) were observed among cases with heterozygous loss of CDKN2A/B relative to wild-type (Supplementary Figure 1A, B). Loss of p16 itself was associated with significantly reduced PFS (P = 0.009) and OS (P = 0.01; Supplementary Figure 2A, B). Individuals with wild-type CDKN2A/B status showed a median survival of 123 months post-resection. When compared to wild-type tumors, cases with CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion showed a median OS of 26 months (P = 0.032), while those with heterozygous deletions showed a median OS of 28 months (P = 0.13; Figure 3E). Similarly, a median PFS for individuals with intact CDKN2A/B was 74 months versus 3 months for those with both heterozygous (P = 0.14) and homozygous (P = 0.044) CDKN2A/B deletion (Figure 3F).

Rationale for grade 3 diagnosis and identified genomic alterations (A). Correlation of CDKN2A homozygous deletion and immunohistochemical loss of p16 and MTAP staining (B).

Brain invasion was noted in 6 (40%) of cases. Eight (53.3%) tumors were histologically characterized as malignant morphologic variants, 6 (40%) as rhabdoid, and 1 (7%) as papillary (Figure 1A). One case involved a malignant transformation of a previously resected lower-grade meningioma, while all other cases represented primary grade 3 meningiomas. Atypical histologic features included necrosis in 11 (73%) cases, hypercellularity in 6 (40%) cases, sheeting and prominent nucleoli were each noted in 5 (33%) cases, while small cell change and high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio were each noted in 4 (27%) cases. Elevated mitotic index (≥ 20/10 HPFs) was noted in 8 cases. Genetic abnormalities (BAP1 loss, homozygous CDKN2A/B deletion, and/or TERTp mutations) were present in 6 (40%) cases. One (7%) of these cases involved genetically and immunohistochemically confirmed BAP1 loss, 4 (27%) harbored TERTp mutations, of which 2 also demonstrated CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion. CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion was also noted in a third case without coincident TERT p mutations, and heterozygous CDKN2A/B loss was noted in 2 additional cases, one of which also had a TERT p mutation. No significant associations were identified between the presence of genetic alterations and histologic subtype or malignant histologic features, though our study was likely underpowered to detect such relationships (Table 1).

### Analysis of demographics and the impact of adjuvant radiotherapy on a nationwide cohort of patients with high-grade spinal meningiomas [^59b8aa32]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Surgery-alone versus surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy

After excluding patients with missing data and those receiving other treatment modalities, 620 patients with high-grade SMs remained (Table 2). Among these, 517 (83%) underwent surgery alone while 108 (17%) received both surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. Patients in the surgery and radiotherapy group were significantly younger as compared to those in the surgery-alone group (median: 53.0 (40.0–63.0) vs 59.0 (46.0–68.0); P = 0.002). Although males were in minority, they were significantly more represented in the surgery and radiotherapy group as compared to the surgery-alone group (46% vs 30%; P = 0.001). Significant differences were observed in the distribution of race among groups (P = 0.007). Specifically, 76%, 19%, and 3% of the surgery and radiotherapy cohort were White, Black, and Asian, respectively, as compared to 87%, 8%, and 3% in the surgery-alone group.

There were no differences in comorbidity levels between the groups as determined by the Charlson–Deyo comorbidity index (P = 0.83). In both surgery-alone and surgery and radiotherapy groups, most patients had a Charlson–Deyo score of 0 (74% and 77%), followed by 1 (15% and 13%), 2 (8% and 8%), and ≥ 3 (4% and 2%). The tumor's largest diameter was significantly greater in the surgery and radiotherapy group (median: 25.0 mm (18.3–43.8), compared to the surgery-alone group (median: 20.0 mm [15.0–29.0], P = 0.001).

Moreover, a comparison of the WHO grades (2 and 3) between patients undergoing both surgery and radiotherapy versus those undergoing surgery-alone revealed no significant difference (P = 0.42). In total, there were 520 (84%) and 115 (18%) patients harboring high-grade SM in WHO grades 2 and 3, respectively. On further histological classifications, the distribution between the 2 groups significantly differed (P < .001), with the rhabdoid/papillary subtype being more commonly offered surgery and radiotherapy.

### A molecularly integrated grade for meningioma [^7fa62566]. Neuro-Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

This analysis harbors several limitations. Mutational coverage in this study was incomplete, including those associated with prognosis such as in TERTp, BAP1, and SMARCE1. While these mutations are relatively rare, the Integrated Grade was able to stratify outcome amongst TERT promoter-mutated cases. Additionally, there was a sparsity of certain WHO high-grade histologic subtypes (clear cell, chondroid, rhabdoid, and papillary). It is possible these subtypes may have other important genomic features driving aggressive tumor behavior not captured by our Integrated Grading scheme, such as SMARCE1 mutations in clear cell meningiomas. Simpson grade, the most precise measure for extent of tumor resection, was unavailable. Hence, we adopted volumetric measurements based on quantitative imaging analysis as an indicator of tumor resection to accommodate for subjectivity and inter-surgeon variability in reporting, acknowledging that the failure to remove tumor-involved bone and dura remains an important consideration for evaluating recurrence risk. Additionally, methylation signatures were not available for our institutional cohort, limiting comparison to previously described methylation classification schemes. Broad access to copy-number-based profiling, made available by divergent genomic platforms that have proliferated across medical centers and commercial labs, will expand the number of patients who may benefit from molecular characterization beyond WHO grade at institutions without ready access to methylation platforms. Copy-number profiling has been integrated into the workflow at our institution, and the largely prospective collection of these cases strengthens the validity of our findings. Despite the need for assessment of larger cohorts of meningioma with rare mutations and of uncommon histologic subtypes, we show that mitotic index and copy-number profile can alone appraise tumor behavior with satisfactory results and significantly improve upon existing methods.

Taken together, the modular nature of the proposed risk-stratified integrated grading scheme lends itself to future refinement with incorporation of additional axes of genomic data as scientific discovery advances and has immediate relevance to management of meningioma patients. We envision that the Integrated Grade can enhance the clinical care of meningioma patients and aid in the design of future prospective clinical trial

### Germline and somatic BAP1 mutations in high-grade rhabdoid meningiomas [^946612a2]. Neuro-Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with meningiomas have widely divergent clinical courses. Some entirely recover following surgery alone, while others have relentless tumor recurrences. This clinical conundrum is exemplified by rhabdoid meningiomas, which are designated in the World Health Organization Classification of Tumours as high grade, despite only a subset following an aggressive clinical course. Patient management decisions are further exacerbated by high rates of interobserver variability, biased against missing possibly aggressive tumors. Objective molecular determinants are needed to guide classification and clinical decision making.

Methods

To define genomic aberrations of rhabdoid meningiomas, we performed sequencing of cancer-related genes in 27 meningiomas from 18 patients with rhabdoid features and evaluated breast cancer [BRCA]1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) expression by immunohistochemistry in 336 meningiomas. We assessed outcomes, germline status, and family history in patients with BAP1-negative rhabdoid meningiomas.

Results

The tumor suppressor gene BAP1, a ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase, is inactivated in a subset of high-grade rhabdoid meningiomas. Patients with BAP1-negative rhabdoid meningiomas had reduced time to recurrence compared with patients with BAP1-retained rhabdoid meningiomas (Kaplan-Meier analysis, 26 mo vs 116 mo, P < .001; hazard ratio 12.89). A subset of patients with BAP1-deficient rhabdoid meningiomas harbored germline BAP1 mutations, indicating that rhabdoid meningiomas can be a harbinger of the BAP1 cancer predisposition syndrome.

Conclusion

We define a subset of aggressive rhabdoid meningiomas that can be recognized using routine laboratory tests. We implicate ubiquitin deregulation in the pathogenesis of these high-grade malignancies. In addition, we show that familial and sporadic BAP1-mutated rhabdoid meningiomas are clinically aggressive, requiring intensive clinical management.

Histopathologic Classification

The histopathologic characteristics of meningioma have been the main correlate to outcome for decades and still form the basis of contemporary WHO grading. Released in 2021, the 5th edition of the WHO CNS classification is the first to include molecular criteria for the definition of a CNS WHO grade 3 meningioma: presence of a TERT p hotspot mutation or homozygous loss of CDKN2A/B. These molecular alterations are rare in meningiomas, particularly in cases that do not have other worrisome histologic findings. In the absence of these alterations, which automatically impart a CNS WHO grade 3 designation, grading is assigned based on histopathologic features such as the number of mitotic figures or identification of at least 3 out of 5 "soft" criteria for atypia (sheeting architecture, hypercellularity, small cell formation, macronucleoli, spontaneous necrosis; Figure 2).

While the presence of brain invasion alone is now sufficient for a designation of CNS WHO grade 2 meningioma, its association with outcome in the absence of any other higher grade histopathological features (eg, brain invasion without elevated mitotic index, hypercellularity, loss of architecture, small cell change, spontaneous necrosis, or prominent nucleoli) remains unclear. Given that cases of brain invasion alone as a solitary atypical finding is rare, only a minority of meningioma cases will likely require retrospective re-grading based solely on this feature. More work is needed to understand the biological significance and mechanism of brain invasion in meningioma. Additionally, current intraoperative sampling methods to identify brain invasion vary significantly between neurosurgical departments worldwide and this too requires standardization given that many pathology samples for this extra-axial tumor may lack brain tissue altogether. A systematic, structured method of safely sampling areas suspicious for brain invasion during surgery may be needed to optimize the diagnostic yield for detecting CNS invasion.

### Pathological classification and molecular genetics of meningiomas [^6eaf6386]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Meningiomas are extremely common adult brain tumors originating from meningeal coverings of the brain and spinal cord. While most are slowly growing Word Health organization (WHO) grade I tumors, rare variants (clear cell, chordoid, papillary, and rhabdoid), as well as brain invasive (WHO grade II), atypical (WHO grade II), and anaplastic (WHO grade III) meningiomas are considerably more aggressive. This review summarizes the histopathological and genetic features of meningiomas, including differential diagnosis, pitfalls, and grading challenges. Early stages of meningioma tumorigenesis are closely linked to inactivation of one or more members of the 4.1 superfamily, including the neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and 4.1B (DAL-1) genes, which interact with the 14-3-3 protein family. Other chromosome 22q genes implicated include BAM22, BCR (breakpoint cluster region), and TIMP-1, the last of which is implicated in higher-grade meningiomas. Atypical meningiomas also commonly show chromosomal losses of 1p, 6q, 10, 14q, and 18q, as well as multiple chromosomal gains. While most relevant genes remain unknown, two chromosome 14q candidates (MEG3 and NDRG2) have recently been identified. In addition to alterations of CDKN2A, p14(ARF), and CDKN2B tumor suppressor genes on 9p21, a contribution of the wingless (wnt) pathway with alterations of the E-cadherin and beta-catenin proteins, as well as alterations of the hedgehog signaling pathway have been implicated in anaplastic meningiomas. The integration of histopathological appearance, complex genetic/genomic data, and outcome will likely result in the identification of clinically distinct meningioma subgroups, which in turn can facilitate the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.

### International society of neuropathology – haarlem consensus guidelines for nervous system tumor classification and grading [^785f62de]. Brain Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Meeting Conclusions

The meeting reached consensus regarding a broad set of conclusions that pertain to future classification systems for nervous system tumors, including the widely utilized WHO classification scheme. The group did not make comprehensive recommendations about individual tumor entities but, as shown below, utilized examples to illustrate how such decisions could be made in the future.

The conclusions reached can be summarized as follows:
(1) Disease entities should be defined as precisely and objectively as possible in order to establish highly biologically and clinically uniform groups (ie, as previously undertaken by the hematopathology community). With this approach, some tumors may not fit into a diagnostic category and may require a descriptive diagnosis (eg, "diffuse glioma, not otherwise specified"); such "gray zone" tumors require further study before their exact position in the classification could be established.
(2) Regarding the use of molecular information in diagnosis: (a) Molecular information should be incorporated into the definitions of some diagnostic entities. (i) For some entities, molecular information is required to provide an "integrated" diagnosis (see below) and only a descriptive histological diagnosis is acceptable if no molecular diagnostic testing is available. (See example of atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, below. Note that this is an example only and that the eventual definitions will result from the WHO classification updating process.) (ii) For other entities, molecular information will be necessary to provide an "integrated" diagnosis but a formal "NOS" (not otherwise specified) can be used if no molecular testing is performed. (See example of adult diffuse gliomas, below. Note that this is an example only and that the eventual definitions will result from the WHO classification updating process.) (iii) To do the above, the definitions of some disease entities need to be refined, while others need to be added. (b) For some diagnostic entities, histology alone will remain the basis for definition and diagnosis.
(3) A key concept was that diagnoses should be "layered" in order to provide a format for displaying multiple types of information (Tables 2, 3, 4, 5). The analogy is to modern map technology, in which multiple layers can be readily superimposed on top of one another for easy viewing; such an approach has been advocated for disease taxonomy in general 2. A layered approach also facilitates standardization of diagnosis, which will be necessary to use such diagnostic information in computational systems. The suggested format is summarized in Table 2. (a) The "integrated diagnosis" will be the top line in order to emphasize its primacy over the other lines even though it will be the last portion of the diagnostic format completed, as it is dependent on all diagnostic information being present. It is anticipated therefore that the integrated diagnosis will be "pending" for a period of time between histological examination and the availability of molecular information. (b) The "histological classification" is the standard microscopic diagnosis that is based on hematoxylin and eosin staining and additional histological techniques such as histochemistry, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. (c) The "WHO grade" is the standard histological grade. As in the past, WHO grade reflects natural history after surgery alone, rather than expected patient prognosis following current adjuvant therapies. For example, despite substantially improved control rates with current therapy, a medulloblastoma is still considered WHO grade IV as, if left without adequate postoperative treatment, it will follow a rapidly progressive, typically fatal course. Thus, the question arose as to whether a separate, additional grade reflecting expected behavior following therapy should be considered. However, because both current therapies and responses are subject to changes and having two different grades on a single report is confusing, the group opined that only a WHO grade based on natural history should be reported. This discussion raised the additional challenge that in some tumor types (eg, IDH ‐mutant glioblastoma or WNT‐subgroup medulloblastoma in a child), stressing the WHO grade in the diagnosis may be more confusing than helpful, and that such situations may require a comment stating that the prognosis is better in such a molecular subtype than suggested by the grade. (d) The "molecular information" is a synoptic account of the results of the molecular tests recommended for that particular tumor entity. Notably, the specific molecular tests recommended vary among tumor entities and will likely change over time. Moreover, the reporting of such molecular information should follow a set of guidelines, which are outlined in the following section.
(4) Regarding molecular testing and reporting: (a) Whether particular tests are required or recommended for diagnosis will depend on the biological properties of individual tumor types and whether the reported biomarkers are diagnostic, prognostic and/or predictive. (b) Future decisions to incorporate such testing into diagnostic definitions will be based on conclusive published evidence from multiple independent studies. (c) For some genetic tests, some general methodological approaches may be recommended over others (eg, detecting whole‐arm loss in oligodendrogliomas). In some situations, second‐level tests should follow first‐level tests (eg, IDH1/2 sequencing to exclude rare mutations if IDH1 R132H immunohistochemistry is negative). (d) In settings in which molecular testing is required or recommended, a report should state if it was not done ("unknown") or if ordered ("pending"), along with a reason if not performed (eg, "tissue insufficient for molecular testing for MGMT promoter methylation status"). (e) The methodological and results parameters of the assays performed should be included in reports in order to provide testing details and interpretive significance. This was felt important as, in some institutions, molecular reports are separate from surgical pathology reports and the results of molecular testing are either left out of the pathology report entirely or only abstracted in addenda. The group felt that by incorporating the pertinent details into the original surgical pathology report, this would facilitate comparability of data and multi‐institutional patient care, given that the pathology report alone is often forwarded to outside centers. (f) Molecular testing must be based on histologically representative tissue. While this practice is routine in most academic centers, it remains possible that fragments of tissue are sent directly by neurosurgeons to molecular testing laboratories without histological confirmation; this practice risks false‐negative results and must be avoided.
(5) The grading of adult type diffuse gliomas will follow standard, current WHO criteria for astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas with the caveat that in some circumstances, assigning a precise grade is not possible. The latter is most relevant for the category of diffuse glioma that is not clearly of pure astrocytic or pure oligodendroglial subtype, either in the setting of a small biopsy in which selective sampling may be a concern or because of lack of molecular studies being performed, a discordance between morphology and molecular studies (eg, a histologically classic oligodendroglioma that lacks 1p/19q co‐deletion or shows ATRX loss), or a molecular pattern that does not fit neatly into a single tumor type. In such circumstances, the WHO grade may either be left off altogether (preferably with an explanatory comment) or may appear as "high grade" or "at least WHO grade… " For example, a phenotypically ambiguous diffuse glioma with atypia, mitoses, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis could initially be diagnosed as being "at least WHO grade III" given that it would qualify as grade III if oligodendroglial (ie, anaplastic oligodendroglioma) or grade IV if astrocytic (ie, glioblastoma). In compliance with WHO terminology, the term "anaplastic" will precede any astrocytic or oligodendroglial tumor qualifying for a grade III designation. The term glioblastoma will be utilized for astrocytic neoplasms qualifying as grade IV.
(6) Some pediatric tumor types will require separation from their adult histological "look‐alikes". Separating these pediatric entities becomes critical now that there is clear evidence that the underlying molecular basis is different (eg, histone H3.3 K27M mutations in diffuse pediatric high‐grade gliomas/intrinsic pontine gliomas and a rarity of 1p/19q co‐deletion in pediatric oligodendrogliomas).
(7) The inclusion of non‐tissue‐based information (eg, clinical, radiological information) is not required in the layered final diagnosis, but can be of clear utility in reaching a final diagnosis or determining sampling adequacy in individual cases. As such, non‐tissue‐based data can be included in the clinical history or comments section, as is already common practice.
(8) Input from a broad constituency of clinical and scientific colleagues involved in neuro‐oncology is important in guiding future decisions regarding brain tumor classification.

WHO grade 3 meningiomas — treat as malignant tumors with treatment directed to gross tumor (if present), surgical bed, and a margin (1–2 cm, depending on distribution of disease and histopathology). RT dosing is 59.4–60 Gy in 1.8–2.0 Gy fractions, and higher doses (66–70 Gy at 2 Gy per fraction) may be needed to provide durable local control of gross tumor but require highly conformal technique and respect of normal tissue tolerances; using techniques like IMRT with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) are helpful in these instances.

### New molecular targets in meningiomas: the present and the future [^56a53069]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Meningiomas, the most common primary brain tumor, have historically been managed with surgery and radiation. Traditional chemotherapy has not been effective. Fortunately, recent advances in genetic sequencing have led to an improved understanding of the molecular drivers in meningioma. This article aims to discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic implications of recently discovered genetic alterations in meningiomas.

Recent Findings

Many of the recently discovered genetic alterations correlate with distinct clinical phenotypes. SMO, AKT and PIK3CA mutations are enriched in the anterior skull base. KLF4 mutations are specific for secretory histology, and BAP1 alterations are common in progressive rhabdoid meningiomas. Alterations in TERT, DMD and BAP1 correlate with poor clinical outcomes. Importantly, the discovery of clinically actionable alterations in a number of genes, including SMO, AKT1 and PIK3CA, has opened up novel potential avenues for therapeutic management of meningiomas. Overexpression of PD-L1 in higher grade meningiomas also provides preclinical support for the investigation of checkpoint blockade.

Summary

The discovery of genetic alterations has improved our understanding of the natural history and classification of meningiomas. Clinical trials with several novel agents targeting driver mutations are currently accruing patients and they can lead to better treatment strategies.

### Metastatic rhabdoid meningioma with BRAF V600E mutation and good response to personalized therapy: case report and review of the literature [^a03658e3]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Rhabdoid meningioma is an aggressive phenotype of meningioma, associated with a poor prognosis. We present a very rare case of high-grade meningioma with rhabdoid features that eventually expressed in a coma state. Comprehensive genomic profiling using a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) assay revealed three genomic alterations: activating BRAF mutation (V600E), loss of CDKN2A/2B, and APC I1307K. After treatment with BRAF inhibitor (dabrafenib), the child's clinical condition improved progressively. After seven months, an MEK inhibitor was added (trametinib).

### Prognostic value of estrogen receptor in WHO grade III meningioma: a long-term follow-up study from a single institution [^9cdba64e]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2018). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE Malignant meningioma is rare and classified as Grade III in the WHO classification of CNS tumors. However, the presence of estrogen receptor (ER) in WHO Grade III meningiomas and its correlation with patients' outcomes are still unclear. In this single-center cohort study, the authors analyzed clinical features, treatment, and prognosis of these malignant tumors in patients with long-term follow-up. METHODS A total of 87 patients who were pathologically diagnosed with WHO Grade III meningiomas between 2003 and 2008 were enrolled in this study and followed for at least 7 years. Clinical information was collected to analyze the factors determining the prognosis. RESULTS Twelve patients with rhabdoid, 12 with papillary, and 63 with anaplastic meningioma were included. The mean progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 56.2 ± 49.8 months and 68.7 ± 47.4 months, respectively. No significant differences were observed among the 3 histological subtypes in either PFS (p = 0.929) or OS (p = 0.688). Patients who received gross-total resection had a longer PFS (p = 0.001) and OS (p = 0.027) than those who received subtotal resection. Adjuvant radiotherapy was associated with OS (p = 0.034) but not PFS (p = 0.433). Compared with primary meningiomas, patients with recurrent disease had worse PFS (p < 0.001). For patients who had malignant transformations, the prognosis was poorer than for patients without malignant transformations for both PFS (p = 0.002) and OS (p = 0.019). ER-positive patients had a significantly worse prognosis than ER-negative patients regarding both PFS (p = 0.003) and OS (p < 0.001), whereas no association between progesterone receptor and patients' outcomes was observed. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that ER expression was an independent prognostic factor for both PFS (p = 0.008) and OS (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS This retrospective study showed that patients with meningioma with ER-positive expression had a much worse prognosis than those with ER weak-positive or ER-negative status. The results demonstrated that ER is an independent prognostic factor for both PFS and OS of patients with WHO Grade III meningioma. The authors also found that more radical resection of the tumor, as well as postoperative radiotherapy, may prolong patients' survival time.

### April 2001: a 70 year old woman with recurrent meningioma [^c9ba3afc]. Brain Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

The April Case of the Month (COM). The contributors report a case of a 70 year-old woman with recurrent meningiomas, one of which showed rhabdoid and lipomatous differentiation. Histopathological study of the first and second previous resections showed only typical meningothelial meningioma. On the third craniotomy, a new tumor specimen showed an admixture of classic meningothelial meningioma with lipomatous and rhabdoid foci. Immunohistochemical studies showed diffuse reactivity for epithelial membrane antigen and vimentin, as well as focal positivity for desmin and smooth muscle actin in the areas with rhabdoid features and S100 protein in the lipomatous foci. The presence of these three different and concomitant histological patterns only in the third surgical resection might support a metaplastic origin and, also, corroborates the concept that rhabdoid features are suggestive of an aggressive behavior.

### Molecular pathogenesis of meningiomas [^bf5ee3a1]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Meningiomas are common central nervous system tumors that originate from the meningeal coverings of the brain and the spinal cord. Most meningiomas are slowly growing benign tumors that histologically correspond to World Health Organization (WHO) grade I. However, certain rare histological variants (clear cell, chordoid, papillary, and rhabdoid), as well as atypical (WHO grade II) and anaplastic (WHO grade III) meningiomas show a more aggressive biological behavior and are clinically associated with a high risk of local recurrence and a less favorable prognosis. This review summarizes the most important features of meningioma pathology and provides an up-to-date overview about the molecular mechanisms involved in meningioma initiation and progression. Current data indicate that meningioma initiation is closely linked to the inactivation of one or more members of the highly conserved protein 4.1 superfamily, including the neurofibromatosis type 2 gene product merlin/schwannomin, protein 4. IB (DAL-1) and protein 4.1R. The genetic alterations in atypical meningiomas are complex and involve losses on 1p, 6q, 10, 14q and 18q, as well as gains on multiple chromosomes. The relevant genes are still unknown. Anaplastic meningiomas show even more complex genetic alterations, including frequent alteration of the CDKN2A, p14ARF, and CDKN2B tumor suppressor genes at 9p21, as well as gene amplification on 17q23. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in meningioma pathogenesis may not only lead to the identification of novel diagnostic and prognostic marker but will also facilitate the development of new pathogenesis-based therapeutic strategies.

Meningiomas — epidemiology, grading, and presentation states that meningiomas are extra-axial central nervous system (CNS) tumors arising from the arachnoid cap cells and are most often discovered in middle-to late adult life with a female predominance. The annual incidence for males and females is 1.8 and 3.4 per 100,000 people, respectively. In a review of 319 cases, 92% were WHO grade 1, 6% grade 2 (atypical), and 2% grade 3. Small tumors are often asymptomatic incidental findings, and seizure is a common presenting symptom occurring in 27% of patients.

Other prognostic mutations in meningiomas

Since the discovery of non- NF2 driver mutations in meningiomas, other prognostically important genomic alterations have since been uncovered (Table 1). POLR2A (RNA polymerase II polypeptide A) mutations were found more commonly in benign meningiomas without large-scale chromosomal alterations. In familial studies of patients with schwannomatosis and multiple meningiomas, germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene SMARCB1 (SWIch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF)-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily B member 1) and NF2 were identified as the key predisposing alterations. One of the rare but early prognostically important mutations in clinically aggressive meningiomas was the TERTp mutation, found to be present in 16/252 (6.4%) of meningiomas in one study and were associated with significantly shorter TTP compared to TERT wild-type meningiomas irrespective of WHO grade. TERTp mutations have since been added to the most recent iteration of the WHO classification of CNS tumors as an independent marker of grade 3 meningiomas, and increased sensitivity of TERTp mutated meningioma cells to ETS transcription factor inhibition has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy.

Table 1
Genes implicated in meningiomas and meningioma development

*As per the 2021 WHO classification of brain tumors grading criteria

While histopathology continued to drive the contemporary grading of meningiomas, interesting corollaries between pathological subtype and molecular findings have been uncovered SMARCE1 (SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily E member 1) mutations were found in almost all cases of meningiomas with clear cell histology (WHO grade 2) and are often mutually exclusively with NF2 loss and non- NF2 mutations. Subsequent studies demonstrated SMARCE1 loss to be associated with reduced DNA accessibility over distal enhancer sites, and SMARCE1 -deficient cells were susceptible to mSWI/SNF inhibition. Another rare alteration in aggressive meningiomas was inactivation of BAP1 [breast cancer (BRCA)1-associated protein-1 tumor suppressor]. BAP1 loss on IHC was more common in histologically rhabdoid and papillary meningiomas (WHO grade 3), although more cases are being reported in exclusion of these histological subtypes. Less than 30 cases have reported, including germline and somatic BAP1 mutations, and almost universally with poor outcomes.

### Molecular profiling of pediatric meningiomas shows tumor characteristics distinct from adult meningiomas [^36ccf870]. Acta Neuropathologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

The histological subtype distribution among the 37 primary pediatric meningiomas which were graded according to the 2016 WHO classification of brain tumors is shown in Fig. 1 a–c. While 30% of tumors were of WHO grade I, the largest group consisted of atypical WHO grade II meningiomas (57%). Among 5 WHO grade III meningiomas (14%), three tumors were rhabdoid meningiomas. Thus, pediatric meningiomas are predominantly characterized by a more aggressive histology than WHO grade I, which is in contrast to their adult counterparts. This was reflected by a relatively high proliferation activity, with a mean Ki-67 proliferation index of 8.3% (1–20%) and a mean number of mitoses per 10 HPF of 1.9 (0–20). Brain invasion was seen in 6/32 samples analyzed (16.2%), and tumor necrosis was present in 10/32 cases (27%). The cohort contained slightly more male (N = 20) than female patients (N = 17). In Fig. 1 d, the time to tumor recurrence for patients with available follow-up information is shown. As shown in Fig. 1 e, male patients had a trend to less favorable outcome than female patients (p = 0.089). Proliferation activity as counted by Ki-67 staining was significantly higher in WHO grade II and grade III tumors than in WHO grade I meningiomas (Fig. 1 f). Except one patient with spinal meningioma (2.7%), 36 tumors (97.3%) were located intracranially. Most tumors were found at the convexity (N = 18, 48.6%), followed by skull base (N = 15, 40.5%) and ventricular system (N = 3, 8.1%). Skull base localization was associated with slightly less favorable prognosis compared to convexity localization (p = 0.057, Fig. 1 g).

### The integrated multiomic diagnosis of sporadic meningiomas: a review of its clinical implications [^750f4db9]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Pathways to malignancy

Genetic markers of meningioma aggressiveness is an active area of investigation, aiming to identify molecular signatures for patients at risk of transformation. Unique mutations are being discovered in rarer, more malignant subsets of meningiomas. TERT promoter mutations are associated with recurrence as well as progression to higher grades. The breast cancer (BRCA)1-associated protein-1 tumor suppressor gene (BAP1) has been linked to a clinically aggressive rhabdoid subtype and both germline and somatic mutations in BAP1 predict faster recurrence. As discussed above, DNA methylation correlates with aggressiveness and H3K27me3 loss identifies a subset of grade 2 meningiomas with increased recurrence risk. Gene co-expression analysis is also being used to predict tumor behavior using meta-gene markers. One recent co-expression module identified, E2F4/FOXM1, predicts increased meningioma aggressiveness, correlating with previous identification of FOXM1 and E2F2 expression networks activated in atypical meningiomas. Further insight into genetic alterations and gene co-expression networks will improve our ability to predict tumor behavior.

### A molecularly integrated grade for meningioma [^43d00e8b]. Neuro-Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

The discovery cohort included 527 meningiomas (326 WHO grade I, 172 WHO grade II, 29 WHO grade III; Figure 1). The cohort was 67% female, with a mean age of 57 (range 9–90) years; there were 132 recurrences across a mean follow-up of 43 months (Supplementary Table S1). Broad CNVs were absent in 27% of tumors and monosomy 22 was present alone in 18% of tumors, followed by frequent loss of chromosomes 1p (36%), 14q (19%), 6p/q (17%), 18p/q (16%), 10p/q (10%), and gain of 20p/q (11%), 5p/q (10%), 7p/q (6%), 17p/q (8%), and 12p/q (7%) (Figure 2A, B). Chromosomal gains were largely restricted to angiomatous and microcystic meningiomas, a subset of which also exhibited chromosome 1p loss (Figure 2A). Of 34 patients with radiation-induced meningiomas, frequent broad CNVs were present with 71% exhibiting 1p loss (Supplementary Figure S2). Loss of 3p, encompassing BAP1 and PBRM1, was seen in 5/9 cases with rhabdoid histology. WHO grade III meningiomas demonstrated significantly greater genome disruption than WHO grade II meningiomas (P = 0.027) with a trend toward more arm-level CNVs (8.3 vs 6.7, P = 06; Supplementary Figure S3A).

### Somatic SMARCB1 mutation in spinal meningioma represents branched evolution in a patient with multiple sporadic meningiomas [^2f1eec80]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Familial disorders with MMs are caused by predisposing germline mutations in NF2, SMARCB1, SMARCE1 (SWI/SNF complex), or SUFU genes. These include neurofibromatosis type 2 disorder and familial multiple meningiomas, and typically display autosomal dominant inheritance. SMARCE1 mutations have been described in familial multiple spinal meningiomas associated with clear cell subtypes. Germline SMARCB1 mutations with somatically acquired NF2 co-mutation have been described in a family with a history of multiple meningiomas.

The genetic landscape of solitary spinal meningiomas is different from cranial meningiomas. Hua et al. described 2 groups of sporadic spinal meningioma (SM) with mutually exclusive NF2 and AKT1 mutations. The NF2 mutation group had a significantly lower mean age of onset (65.5 years), female preponderance, thoracic spinal dorsal/dorsolateral location, and meningothelial subtypes. On the other hand, the AKT1 subgroup had a higher mean age (71 years), balanced gender distribution, cervical spine anteriorly location, and meningothelial, psammomatous, and transitional fibrous subtypes.

SMARCB1 (SWI/SNF related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily B, member 1) is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes INI1, a core component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Loss of SMARCB1 leads to epigenetic dysregulation, affecting chromatin remodeling and gene expression. This results in enhanced cell proliferation and reduced differentiation.

SMARCB1-deficient meningiomas tend to be more aggressive, higher-grade (CNS WHO grade 2/3), and recurrent, often showing features of rhabdoid or atypical histology. Loss of SMARCB1 leads to oncogenic enhancers activation, which reshapes the regulatory landscape specifically in malignant rhabdoid tumors. SMARCB1 somatic mutations frequently co-occur with other genetic abnormalities, such as those in NF2, across various mesenchymal neoplasms including meningiomas, as may arise in the setting of Schwannomatosis. Immunotherapy strategies are under investigation for other tumor types, as SMARCB1-deficient tumors often exhibit altered immune microenvironments. However, further research is needed to completely elucidate the impact of SMARCB1 deficiency on tumor microenvironment, especially in meningiomas.

4 DISCUSSION

The presence of areas with overt carcinomatous differentiation in a meningioma raises the possibility of anaplastic meningioma with heterologous differentiation versus metastatic carcinoma involving a meningioma. Metastasis to meningioma is a well‐known occurrence, with breast and lung as the most frequent primary sites followed by kidney, prostate, and GI tract. In over one‐third of cases, the tumor‐to‐meningioma metastasis can be the initial presentation of a previously undiagnosed occult cancer. Therefore, the lack of history of malignancy, such as in this case, does not exclude a tumor‐to‐meningioma metastasis.

Malignant meningiomas encompass diverse morphologies and can show carcinomatous or sarcomatous differentiation. Sarcomatous differentiation is a more frequent occurrence and tumors usually show heterologous elements that can either be found adjacent to areas with typical meningoma morphology or can represent the entire tumor without evidence of residual conventional meningioma. These tumors usually express lineage specific immunohistochemical (IHC) markers related to the heterologous elements that are present, with weak or negative expression of meningioma markers. On the other hand, aside from few limited reports, the pathology and IHC profile of carcinoma‐like areas in anaplastic meningiomas has not been evaluated in detail.

While the IHC findings were markedly different between the conventional meningiomatous foci and the carcinomatous component, their molecular profile was nearly identical, which is typical of what has been previously reported. Chromosomal microarray showed loss of chromosome 22, which is the most frequent alteration occurring in meningiomas of all histologic grades. Losses of chromosomes 1p and 14q were also detected, which are frequent cytogenic abnormalities affecting approximately 50% of grade 2 and nearly all grade 3 meningiomas.

Next‐generation sequencing was also useful in confirming the diagnosis through detection of NF2 gene alterations which is a very common finding in meningiomas occurring in 40%–60% of cases. NF2 gene alterations are usually secondary to either copy loss of 22q or inactivating mutations (the most frequent is frameshift mutations such as the mutation present in this case). KMT2D is also one of the mutations reported in meningiomas of various morphological subtypes and grades.

In conclusion, even though IHC had limited utility to reliably distinguish between metastatic carcinoma to a meningioma and meningioma with heterologous differentiation in this case, the nearly identical copy number results and identical mutational profile supported the diagnosis of anaplastic meningioma with heterologous carcinomatous differentiation. Molecular evaluation of distinct tumor regions in similar cases can provide valuable information for the diagnosis of these challenging neoplasms.

### June 2004: a male in his late 60s with recurrent extracerebral tumor [^36dd7673]. Brain Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

June 2004: Over the past year, this man in late-60s had complained about progressive weakness of concentration and memory disturbances, associated with word finding difficulties. MRI examination revealed an extra-axial, parasagittal tumor 3 cm in diameter located in the left frontoparietal region. Five years ago, a meningioma in the same region, with radiographic appearance comparable to the present tumor had been totally removed. The histological picture of the current tumor was dominated by sheets of large rounded pleomorphic tumor cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei (rhabdoid cells). Cytoplasmic inclusions were frequent; occasionally, multinucleatedtumorcellswereseen. Mitoticfigures were absent and the MIB was 3%. Meningothelial lobules were scarce, and regions with fibroblastic appearance were absent. There were no psammoma bodies, necrosis or brain invasion. Moderate immunoreactivity for EMA was found. Additionally, strong cytoplasmic immunoreaction for vimentin within the rhabdoid cells was observed. Review of the previous material showed small islets of rhabdoid cells. Rhabdoid meningioma is an uncommon meningioma variant. It has been suggested that rhabdoid meningiomas are highly aggressive tumors (WHO grade III)and that the rhabdoid phenotype represents a marker of malignant transformation in meningiomas. Histologically, rhabdoid meningiomas usually exhibit signs of anaplasia, a high mitotic activity, and a markedly increased MIB-1 labeling index. Extracranial metastases may occur in the course of the disease. However, not all rhabdoid tumors appear to have anaplastic features (as this case illustrates). Another interesting feature of rhabdoid meningiomas is that in a significant number of cases, the rhabdoid cells appear only at the time of recurrence. Alternatively, as seen in this case, the rhabdoid cells may be already present in the primary meningioma, but not as the predominating histological feature.

### The spatial phenotype of genotypically distinct meningiomas demonstrate potential implications of the embryology of the meninges [^872bce97]. Oncogene (2021). Medium credibility.

BAP1 is involved in the response to DNA damage as a tumor suppressor gene functioning as a ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase. Germline mutations in BAP1 result in a cancer syndrome involving the development of BAP1-mutated melanocytic skin tumors and a high incidence of mesothelioma. All tumors share a common histological rhabdoid morphology. Of the six tumors with BAP1 mutations and BAP1 loss on immunohistochemistry, four were located in the convexity regions and two in the skull base. There is currently insufficient evidence to demonstrate a spatial phenotype of these tumors.

SWI/SNF related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, SMARCE1 pathogenic variants have been specifically associated with heritable clear cell meningiomas. Initially suspected to present exclusively as multiple spinal meningiomas, cases of cranial meningiomas with pathogenic variants in SMARCE1 have subsequently been identified. Clear cells are characterized by vacuolated cytoplasm and bland nuclei in a whorled, syncytial architecture, a likely consequence of SMARCE1 protein loss. While the histology is diagnostic of WHO grade II clear cell subtype, of the few cases reported they have included meningiomas of the spine, convexity, and skull base regions without a propensity to a specific location. A simplified summary of the above pathogenic variant categories and their relationship with histological subtype and the location of meningioma tumorigenesis is shown in Fig. 1B.

### Chromosome 1p loss and 1q gain for grading of meningioma… [^38461fa8]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

This cohort study of 1964 meningiomas found that chromosome 1p loss in CNS WHO grade 1 meningiomas was associated with outcomes that were highly concordant with CNS WHO grade 2 tumors. The addition of a chromosome 1q gain was associated with outcomes that were highly concordant with CNS WHO grade 3 tumors regardless of initial CNS WHO grade. Exposures All patients underwent surgery for meningioma and a subset underwent radiation therapy. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was PFS. Cox regression analysis was used to identify copy number alterations associated with outcomes in the context of WHO grading. Results. Recent work has demonstrated the prognostic value of chromosome-level copy number alterations in meningioma, 8, 9 which are more readily accessible using technologies, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization.

10, 11 In this study, we examine whether patients with WHO grade 1 meningiomas that harbor chromosomal 1p deletion have outcomes similar to those with WHO grade 2 tumors and whether tandem 1p loss with 1q gain is associated with outcomes concordant with a WHO grade of 3. Furthermore, while tandem 1p and 18q losses were associated with grade 3–like outcomes in patients with grade 2 disease, this was not the case for patients with grade

1. In this cohort study, 1p loss and 1q gain were significantly associated with clinical outcomes similar to CNS WHO grade 3 disease, regardless of initial grade. Using these findings to reclassify disease in out cohort would upgrade 156 patients with grade 1 disease to grade 2, 8 patients with grade 1 to grade 3, and 27 patients with grade 2 to grade 3, totaling 191 changes overall.

The findings of this cohort study support the recent c-IMPACT NOW statement advocating for cytogenic profiling in the next iteration of CNS WHO grading of meningiomas. We found that grade 1 meningiomas with chromosome 1p loss had prognosis similar to grade 2, and the addition of 1q gain was associated with grade 3–like outcomes regardless of initial grade.

The anatomic location of meningiomas also appear to have genomic underpinnings. Meningiomas with NF2 loss tend to be located along the cerebral convexities or in the posterior/lateral skull base. Those with non- NF2 mutations (eg, TRAF7, SMO, SUFU, and PRKAR1A) are more common around the anterior skull base. Meningiomas with combined NF2/SMARCB1 mutations (2 genes in close physical proximity to one another on chromosome 22q) may be more commonly found along the anterior falx. Alterations in several meningioma driver genes (including NF2 and TRAF7) have also been found in normal leptomeninges with similar anatomic predilection.

Mutations in SMARCE1 (SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily B member 1), BAP1 (BRCA1 associated protein-1), and PBRM1 are associated with different meningioma histologic subtypes. SMARCE1 loss is found in almost all clear cell meningioma, which are currently CNS WHO grade 2 by the 2021 classification. SMARCE1 encodes for a protein involved in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and consequently SMARCE1 -deficient cells may be susceptible to SWI/SNF inhibition. Inactivation of BAP1 has been associated with rhabdoid and papillary histology and is almost universally associated with poor prognosis, although fewer than 30 of these cases have been reported in the literature. PBRM1 mutations often co-occur with BAP1 mutations and are associated with papillary or sometimes rhabdoid histology. Notably, alterations in SMARCE1 and BAP1 appear to be independent of NF2 mutation or loss, identifying a small, rare group of NF2- wild-type meningiomas that are unusually aggressive.

### Alveolar soft part sarcoma: the new primary intracranial malignancy: a case report and review of the literature [^31a8136c]. Neurosurgical Review (2019). Medium credibility.

Macroscopically, ASPS is typically a round or lobulated soft mass of a yellow-white color. The histological diagnosis of ASPS is based upon its alveolar growth pattern and unique cytological features such as diastase-resistant periodic acid-Schiff (PAS-D) crystalline cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. It is this characteristic histological appearance that has led to the nomenclature "alveolar soft part sarcoma" as it is comparable, although unrelated, to the alveoli of the lungs. Histological examination in our case did show PAS-D cytoplasmic positivity, but it is possible for ASPS tumours lacking these characteristic features to be mistaken for a wide differential of malignancies. This occurred in case 3 where a pre-operative histological diagnosis of meningioma was made following biopsy. The histological differential of ASPS includes the following: renal cell carcinoma (RCC); adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC); hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); paediatric age RCC; malignant melanoma; paraganglioma; alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma; rhabdoid meningioma; perivascular epithelioid cell tumours (PEComas) and granular cell tumours. Given this broad differential, to confirm the diagnosis of ASPS, several specific immunohistochemical markers must be used to differentiate these separate malignancies. RCC can be excluded from ASPS as it shows a unique RCC marker protein. ACC will show immunoreactivity to synaptophysin, HCC will be positive for hepar-1 and rare paediatric RCCs are positive for CK. Similarly, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma will show positivity for desmin, PEComas for smooth muscle actin and rhabdoid meningiomas will show eosinophilic inclusions strongly positive for EMA. Malignant melanoma, paraganglioma and granular cell tumours all stain positive for the S-100 protein (Fig. 3).

### An 11-year-old boy with a posterior fossa tumor [^e91a96a2]. Brain Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

3 FINDINGS

The lesion consisted of epithelioid and rhabdoid cells arranged in a chordoid pattern within a myxoid stroma (Figure 2A) with foci of collagen deposition sometimes featuring amianthoid fibers (Figure 2B). Solid sheets of rhabdoid and epithelioid cells with focal clear cell changes were also present. Mitotic figures were infrequent (1/1.96 mm²). There was a sparse lymphoplasmocytic inflammatory infiltrate at the periphery. The possibility of a chordoid meningioma was first considered, and the expression of epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) seemed to support this hypothesis. However, given the rarity of this meningioma subtype and the lack of a specific marker, an extensive immunohistochemical panel was performed: the diffuse desmin expression, combined with focal CD99 and D2‐40, prompted us to consider an intracranial mesenchymal tumor (IMT) with FET::CREB fusion (Figure 2C–E). RNA sequencing (Agilent) demonstrated the presence of a SMARCA2::CREM transcript (Figure 2F). No pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were identified (TSO500). CGH/SNP array revealed only a mosaic 12p trisomy. Genome‐wide DNA methylation profiling classified the lesion as meningioma (score 0.98), subclass 3 (score 0.93) according to the Heidelberg Brain Tumor Classifier v12.5. t‐distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t‐SNE) analysis was performed using selected Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (German Cancer Research Center) (DFKZ) reference classes and two previously characterized IMT cases, both harboring an EWSR1::CREM fusion. The current case clustered with one of the IMT and was close to meningiomas, whereas the other IMT was near angiomatoid fibrous histiocytomas (Figure 2G).

### Favorable long-term outcomes of chordoid meningioma compared with the other WHO grade 2 meningioma subtypes [^d325a982]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Meningioma, originating from the arachnoid cells, is the most common intracranial neoplasms and accounts for around 39.0% of primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Meningiomas can be classified into 3 malignancy grades and 15 histological subtypes according to the newest 2021 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria of CNS tumors. Around 80% of meningiomas are WHO grade 1, accompanied with benign behaviors. Approximately 20% are WHO grade 2 and 3 characterized by aggressive clinical features and frequent tumor recurrence.

WHO grade 2 meningiomas, including atypical meningioma (AM), chordoid meningioma (CM), and clear cell meningioma (CCM), are the category that is clinically problematic because of relatively large case volume, highly heterogenous clinical behaviors, and controversy in optimal management. AM is the most common grade 2 subtype, accounting for approximately 15% to 20% of all meningiomas, and has been by far the most extensively investigated grade 2 meningiomas.CM is a rare subtype of WHO grade 2 meningiomas and only accounts for 0.32% to 1.0% of all meningiomas. - CM is histologically characterized by cords of eosinophilic, often vacuolated cells in an abundant mucoid matrix. CCM accounts for only 0.2%–0.8% of all meningiomas. CCM is histologically characterized by sheets of rounded or polygonal clear cells and perivascular and interstitial collagen. Current literature regarding CM and CCM consists of isolated case reports and a small number of institutional series. To the best of our knowledge, only 22 studies with 423 CM cases have been reported until now -,- while less than 20 studies reported the outcomes of CCM. Owing to the limited case numbers of CM and CCM, few studies have comprehensively investigated the clinical, pathological, and prognosis differences among these 3 histological subtypes of grade 2 meningiomas.

In this study, we systematically analyzed and compared the clinical-histopathological characteristics and long-term outcomes of 609 patients diagnosed with WHO grade 2 meningiomas at a single neurosurgical center. Outcome difference between CM and non-CM grade 1 and 2 tumors was also investigated.

### Meningioma: international consortium on meningiomas consensus review on scientific advances and treatment paradigms for clinicians, researchers, and patients [^183d35a2]. Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

As in adult cases, extent of resection appears to be the most important prognostic factor, with GTR conferring both a PFS and overall survival benefit. The role of adjuvant RT is controversial, with insufficient literature to assess its utility. One meta-analysis showed no clear demonstrated benefit for PFS or overall survival, though there was likely a high degree of selection bias for irradiating aggressive tumors. Clinical decisions should be made with multidisciplinary discussion on a case-by-case basis, keeping in mind that cranial irradiation is associated with significant morbidity in children. Some clinicians advocate for second-look surgery if residual tumor is detected on postoperative imaging although evidence to support this approach is not well established.

Similar to adult meningiomas, NF2 mutations and loss of chromosome 22 are the most common alterations in pediatric meningiomas, found in 47%–72% of cases. However, other classical non- NF2 driver mutations such as AKT1, SMO, KLF4, and TRAF7 have not been described in the pediatric population. Instead, a number of different YAP1 -fusions have been described in non- NF2 altered pediatric meningiomas (YAP1-MAML2; YAP1-PYGO1; and YAP1-LMO1) and have been proposed as an alternative oncogenic driver to NF2 inactivation. Preclinical studies have shown that the YAP component of these gene fusions is likely the critical driver of these tumors and the YAP1-MAML2 fusion may be targetable through pharmacologic disruption of the YAP1-TEAD interaction.

The majority of clear cell meningiomas in this population expectedly harbor SMARCE1 mutations. DNA methylation profiling largely segregates pediatric meningioma cases from adult cases and may further separate them into 3 methylation subgroups: one group comprised almost exclusively of SMARCE1 -mutated clear cell meningiomas, one group driven by NF2 or chromosome 22q loss, and another mixed group containing all cases with rhabdoid histology, allelic loss of chromosome 11 and rare loss of chromosome 22. The prognostic significance of these groups remain uncertain given the rarity of cases with both molecular profiling and well annotated clinical data.

Meningioma surgery — management is guided by patient- and treatment-related factors, and complete surgical resection may be curative and is therefore the treatment of choice, if feasible. Both the tumor grade and the extent of resection impact the rate of recurrence; in a cohort of 581 patients, 10-year PFS was 75% following GTR but dropped to 39% for patients receiving STR, and short-term recurrences for grade 1, 2, and 3 meningiomas were 1% to 16%, 20% to 41%, and 56% to 63%, respectively. The Simpson classification scheme (grades 1–5 in decreasing degree of completeness) correlates with local recurrence rates.

CONCLUSION

CM showed unique clinicopathological characteristics and relatively benign behavior postoperatively, thus clinically representing a distinct subtype of WHO grade 2 meningioma. The long-term outcomes of CM were better than those of the other WHO grade 2 subtypes and worse than those of WHO grade 1 meningiomas.

### Molecular profiling of pediatric meningiomas shows tumor characteristics distinct from adult meningiomas [^6e413823]. Acta Neuropathologica (2021). Medium credibility.

In contrast to adults, meningiomas are uncommon tumors in childhood and adolescence. Whether adult and pediatric meningiomas differ on a molecular level is unclear. Here we report detailed genomic analyses of 37 pediatric meningiomas by sequencing and DNA methylation profiling. Histologically, the series was dominated by meningioma subtypes with aggressive behavior, with 70% of patients suffering from WHO grade II or III meningiomas. The most frequent cytogenetic aberrations were loss of chromosomes 22 (23/37 [62%]), 1 (9/37 [24%]), 18 (7/37 [19%]), and 14 (5/37 [14%]). Tumors with NF2 alterations exhibited overall increased chromosomal instability. Unsupervised clustering of DNA methylation profiles revealed separation into three groups: designated group 1 composed of clear cell and papillary meningiomas, whereas group 2A comprised predominantly atypical meningiomas and group 2B enriched for rare high-grade subtypes (rhabdoid, chordoid). Meningiomas from NF2 patients clustered exclusively within groups 1 and 2A. When compared with a dataset of 105 adult meningiomas, the pediatric meningiomas largely grouped separately. Targeted panel DNA sequencing of 34 tumors revealed frequent NF2 alterations, while other typical alterations found in adult non- NF2 tumors were absent. These data demonstrate that pediatric meningiomas are characterized by molecular features distinct from adult tumors.

### Chromosome 22q dosage in composite extrarenal rhabdoid tumors: clonal evolution or a phenotypic mimic? [^b4ed5805]. Human Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

Composite extrarenal rhabdoid tumors (CERTs) represent a diverse group of neoplasms with rhabdoid shape in combination with one of several distinctive tumor types. Like the classic renal and extrarenal malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT), as well as the atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) of the central nervous system, CERTs typically show aggressive clinical behavior. Deletions and mutations of the INII gene on 22q11.2 have been identified in most classic MRTs and AT/RTs; however, it is not known whether the rhabdoid components in CERTs have similar genetic abnormalities. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on archival, paraffin-embedded tissue with a commercially available probe in close proximity to the INII locus (bcr), as well as other chromosome 22 probes, we studied 4 cases of MRT, 13 of AT/RT, and 16 of CERT (3 melanoma, 4 meningioma, 7 carcinoma, 1 rhabdomyosarcoma, and 1 neuroblastoma). Deletion of the 22q11.2 locus was demonstrated in 10 (77%) of 13 AT/RTs and 3 (75%) of 4 MRT, including 1 congenital MRT. Of the 16 CERTs, only 2 (a rhabdoid meningioma and a carcinoma with rhabdoid features; 13%) harbored a deletion at this locus. This difference was statistically significant (P < .001). We conclude that deletion of 22q11.2, typical of most classic MRTs and AT/RTs, is infrequently seen in CERTs. This suggests that the rhabdoid component of CERTs does not evolve by way of the genetic alteration characteristic of MRTs or AT/RTs, but represents instead a distinct phenotype shared by a number of tumors as they undergo anaplastic progression.

### CIMPACT-NOW update 8: clarifications on molecular risk parameters and recommendations for WHO grading of meningiomas [^0a3b3747]. Neuro-Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Meningiomas are the most frequent primary intracranial tumors. Hence, they constitute a major share of diagnostic specimens in neuropathology practice. The 2021 WHO Classification of Central Nervous System Tumors ("CNS5") has introduced the first molecular grading parameters for meningioma with oncogenic variants in the TERT promoter and homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/B as markers for CNS WHO grade 3. However, after the publication of the new classification volume, clarifications were requested, not only on novel but also on long-standing questions in meningioma grading that were beyond the scope of the WHO "blue book". In addition, more recent research into possible new molecular grading parameters could not yet be implemented in the 2021 classification but constitutes a compelling body of literature. Hence, the consortium to inform molecular and practical approaches to CNS tumor taxonomy-not official WHO (cIMPACT-NOW) Steering Committee convened a working group to provide such clarification and assess the evidence of possible novel molecular criteria. As a result, this cIMPACT-NOW update provides guidance for more standardized morphological evaluation and interpretation, most prominently pertaining to brain invasion, identifies scenarios in which advanced molecular testing is recommended, proposes to assign CNS WHO grade 2 for cases with CNS WHO grade 1 morphology but chromosomal arm 1p deletion in combination with 22q deletion and/or NF2 oncogenic variants, and discusses areas in which the current evidence is not yet sufficient to result in new recommendations.

### Impact on natural history of atypical meningioma after changes in 2016 edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of central nervous system tumors: a literature review [^04c3385b]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Meningiomas and their WHO histological diagnostic criteria is complex, especially for grade 2 tumors presenting a interobserver discordance as high as 12.2%. The 2016 edition of the WHO Classification of CNS tumors recommended brain invasion as a stand-alone grading criterion for diagnosing an atypical grade 2 meningioma (AM). To provide an overview of the classification of 2016 WHO impact on the natural history of atypical meningioma (AM) relative to previous classification. To achieve this goal, we selected articles from the period 2017–2024 in Medline search on atypical meningiomas and analyzed them after following the following criteria: 1) reports with confirmed histopathological diagnosis according to WHO 2016 and or 2021 criteria; 2) series and case reports; 3) detailed and individualized clinical outcomes for AM; and 4) papers written in English; after that a total of 3445 patients reported in 67 manuscripts from worldwide centers from 2017 to March 2024 were analyzed. The patient's age at the time of surgery ranged from 1 month to 97 years (mean 52.28 ± 18.7 years). The most common tumor site was the convexity, accounting for 67.8%, followed by the skull base in 30.6%, ventricle in 1%, and spine in 0.6%; Gross total resection (GTR) was performed in 71.25% and subtotal resection (STR) in 28.75%; 1021 patients (29.63%) underwent adjuvant radiotherapy, and 22 patients (0.6%) were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy; tumor recurrence was reported in 1221 patients (35.44%) and 859 deaths (24.93%). 1) AM prevalence in females; 2) AM age distribution similar to the distribution of meningiomas in general; 3) AM recurrence rate of 35.44%, despite the high rate of GTR, which was higher than previously reported; 4) deepening knowledge in molecular mechanism of tumor progression will provide alternative therapeutic approaches for AM.

### Meningioma: international consortium on meningiomas consensus review on scientific advances and treatment paradigms for clinicians, researchers, and patients [^1c1ce2f8]. Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Standard treatment guidelines for RIMs do not currently differ from sporadic meningiomas, with surgical resection as first line therapy for symptomatic cases. When multiple RIMs are present in the same patient, surgery should target the largest and/or symptomatic tumors first. Otherwise, active surveillance remains a safe initial strategy for these tumors, with a low rate of neurologic morbidity. The role of adjuvant RT for RIMs is unclear but may be utilized in cases of subtotally resected meningiomas or those that are higher WHO grade. However, even CNS WHO grade 1 RIMs can demonstrate aggressive behavior and many of these cases are RT-resistant. SRS in select cases however appears to be safe and well tolerated for RIMs that are not amenable to surgical resection or in patients with multiple RIMs that require treatment. Overall, tumor control rates following SRS are lower for RIMs than for sporadic meningiomas, and larger treatment volume is associated with worse PFS.

Meningioma — follow-up and recurrence management: In the absence of definitive data, clinicians should base surveillance on individual clinical conditions, with malignant or recurrent meningiomas followed more closely than grade 1 and 2 tumors. A typical low-grade schedule is MRI every 3 months in year 1, then every 6 to 12 months for another 5 years; after 5 years, imaging may be done every 1 to 3 years as clinically indicated. Upon detection of recurrence, the lesion should be resected whenever possible followed by RT; non-surgical candidates should receive RT; systemic therapy is reserved for unresectable recurrence refractory to RT; observation is an option if there is no clinical indication for treatment at recurrence.

Meningioma — initial treatment and adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) recommendations: Meningiomas are typically diagnosed by brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and surgery or octreotide scan may be considered for confirmation. Patients are stratified by symptoms and tumor size; most asymptomatic small tumors (≤ 3 cm) are best managed by observation, otherwise patients should undergo surgical resection whenever possible, and non-surgical candidates should undergo RT. All patients with surgically resected grade 3 meningioma, even after gross total resection (GTR), should receive adjuvant RT to enhance local control. For grade 2 disease, postoperative RT is recommended for incomplete resection; after complete resection, postoperative RT may be considered although this remains controversial. Grade 1 meningioma may be observed following surgery, with postoperative RT considered for symptomatic disease, and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) may be used in lieu of conventional RT as adjuvant or primary therapy in asymptomatic cases.

### Grade 3 meningioma survival and recurrence outcomes in an international multicenter cohort [^c98f16cf]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Grade 3 meningioma represents a rare meningioma subtype, for which limited natural history data are available. The objective of this study was to identify demographics and pathologic characteristics, clinical and functional status outcomes, and prognostic factors in an international cohort of grade 3 meningioma patients.

Methods

Clinical and histopathological data were collected for patients treated at 7 sites across North America and Europe between 1991 and 2022.

Results

A total of 103 patients (54% female, median age 65 [IQR 52, 72] years) were included. Sixty-seven (65%) patients had de novo grade 3 lesions, whereas 29 (28%) had malignant transformations of lower-grade meningiomas. All patients underwent initial resection of their tumor. Patients were followed for a median of 46 (IQR 24, 108) months, during which time there were 65 (73%) recurrences and 50 (49%) deaths. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 66% (95% CI 56%-77%) and 37% (95% CI 28%-48%), respectively. Age ≥ 65 years and male sex were independent predictors of worse OS and PFS in multivariate regression analysis, while postoperative radiotherapy was independently associated with improved OS. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) remained stable relative to baseline over 5 years postdiagnosis among participants who were alive at the end of the follow-up period.

Conclusions

This large multicenter study provides insight into the longitudinal outcomes of grade 3 meningioma, with respect to recurrence, survival, and functional status. This study affirms the survival benefit conferred by radiotherapy in this population and suggests good functional status outcomes for patients surviving to 5 years postoperatively.

### EZH2 overexpression is associated with aggressive behavior and promotes cell proliferation in CNS WHO grade 3 meningiomas [^0b165141]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The major function of PRC2 is the methylation of histone H3 at the lysine 27 position, producing its trimethylated form (H3 K27me3), which is able to potently suppress the transcription of its target genes. The catalytic subunit of PRC2 is the histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2). Considering the aforementioned results, overactivation of EZH2 could be suggested in high-grade meningiomas, and an increase of EZH2 expression was indeed detected in parallel with increasing meningioma grade, both at the mRNA and protein levels.

Increased activity of EZH2 is a common finding in various malignant tumors, resulting from overexpression, gain-of-function mutations, or inactivation of counteracting mechanisms. Among the available EZH2 inhibitors with multiple mechanisms of action, the cofactor-competitive inhibitor EPZ-6438 (Tazemetostat) has already entered clinical practice having been approved for the treatment of follicular lymphoma and epithelioid sarcoma. In follicular lymphoma, EZH2 overactivation is related to recurrent pathogenic mutations, while in epithelioid sarcoma, loss of components of the SWItch/sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex, an antagonist of PRC2, results in H3 K27me3 addiction in the tumor cells. Since EZH2 mutations are not characteristic in meningiomas, increased PRC2 activity is more likely to be related to EZH2 overexpression. It is also worth noting that inactivation of SWI/SNF complex occurs in a significant proportion of aggressive meningiomas.

### Intracranial mesenchymal tumor with FET-CREB fusion – A unifying diagnosis for the spectrum of intracranial myxoid mesenchymal tumors and angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma-like neoplasms [^ce5d31ca]. Brain Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

In terms of clinical outcomes, these tumors demonstrate a propensity for local recurrence and occasionally dissemination or metastasis leading to mortality. The available data suggest improved outcomes for patients that are able to undergo gross total resection. The growth rates have been variable, and the interval to disease recurrence has been up to 10 years. While optimal treatment strategy remains to be defined, adjuvant radiation may be a consideration given the propensity for local recurrence, especially for incompletely resected tumors. Histologic features or other criteria to predict disease course were not identified by this study, although the three patients who died of disease all had EWSR1 ‐ ATF1 fusions. Larger patient cohorts are needed to define prognostic criteria for these neoplasms.

These intracranial mesenchymal tumors with FET‐CREB fusion can both radiographically and histologically mimic a number of other intracranial tumor entities. The extra‐axial location and dural tail seen radiologically in a subset of tumors can result in a preoperative impression of meningioma or solitary fibrous tumor/hemangiopericytoma. Microscopically, these tumors can feature syncytial growth and meningioma‐like whorls that closely resemble meningioma. Additionally, those with rhabdoid cytology, or with cords of epithelioid cells in a mucin‐rich stroma, could be misinterpreted as rhabdoid or chordoid variants of meningioma (Figure 4). The frequent expression of EMA in these tumors can further confound the differential diagnosis of meningioma. Fortunately, these tumors are negative for SSTR2A and positive for desmin, which can be used to distinguish them immunohistochemically. Furthermore, FET‐CREB fusions are specific to these tumors and are not found in meningiomas, and all the 19 tumors analyzed by next‐generation sequencing in this study lacked meningioma‐associated mutations in NF2, TRAF7, KLF4, SMO, AKT1, PIK3CA, and BAP1. The extra‐axial location and prominent collagenous stroma can also raise the diagnostic possibility of solitary fibrous tumor/hemangiopericytoma. However, intracranial mesenchymal tumors with FET‐CREB fusions lack nuclear STAT6 immunopositivity and the characteristic NAB2 ‐ STAT6 fusion. They are desmin positive, but lack expression of skeletal muscle markers including myogenin and MyoD1 that allows distinction from rhabdomyosarcoma. They uniformly have intact expression of INI1 and lack SMARCB1 mutations or deletions, which distinguishes them from atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor and proximal‐type epithelioid sarcoma. A subset of these tumors demonstrates MUC4 immunopositivity, a protein marker previously thought to be highly specific to low‐grade fibromyxoid sarcoma and sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma, tumor entities which are defined by fusion of FUS (or rarely EWSR1) to either CREB3L1 or CREB3L2. The subset of tumors with round cell morphology, collagenous stroma, and polyphenotypic differentiation by immunohistochemistry with the combination of desmin, EMA, and synaptophysin positivity overlaps with desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), which do rarely occur intracranially. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showing EWSR1 break‐apart does not allow distinction between DSRCT with EWSR1 ‐ WT1 fusions and those intracranial mesenchymal tumors with EWSR1 fusions to CREB family members. Therefore, the distinction from DSRCT requires additional testing to determine the specific fusion partner. The possibility of a brain metastasis from a primary extracranial tumor should be considered as part of the workup of these patients, although all of these tumors described to date have appeared to be primary intracranial neoplasms. Noteworthy is that these intracranial mesenchymal tumors with FET‐CREB fusion are negative for expression of melanocytic markers such as HMB45 and MITF that is characteristic of clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue, and are almost always positive for desmin expression which is absent in both clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue and primary pulmonary myxoid sarcoma.

### Molecular landscape, subtypes, and therapeutic vulnerabilities of central nervous system solitary fibrous tumors [^39c2223b]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is a rare mesenchymal spindle cell neoplasm with unpredictable clinical and biological behavior. Molecularly defined by the NAB2-STAT6 gene fusion, SFT accounts for < 2% of all soft tissue sarcomas. Although SFT can arise in various anatomical locations including the central nervous system (CNS), CNS SFT was not distinctly documented until 1996 by Carneiro et al.

CNS SFTs represent < 1% of all primary CNS tumors but are frequently misdiagnosed as meningiomas due to their dural attachment and similar radiographic appearance. CNS SFTs demonstrate more aggressive behavior than meningiomas, with recurrence rates reaching 57% even after complete resection, compared to only 5% for meningiomas. These tumors also exhibit significant metastatic potential, spreading to extracranial sites including the liver, lungs, bone, and peritoneum. Malignant transformation and dedifferentiation further compromise prognosis and can rapidly lead to patient mortality.

Surgical resection remains the primary treatment for CNS SFTs, with gross total resection serving as the most important prognostic factor. Achieving complete resection often proves technically challenging due to the tumors' deep location and aggressive nature. While adjuvant radiotherapy may enhance local control, its effects on metastasis prevention and overall survival remain uncertain. Traditional chemotherapy shows limited efficacy against SFT, and standardized systemic treatment protocols are lacking.

The latest World Health Organization (WHO) classification distinguishes CNS SFTs from peripheral SFTs based on their distinct pathophysiological features and worse prognosis. Despite recent progress in understanding their clinical and molecular characteristics, the mechanisms driving SFT recurrence, malignant transformation, dedifferentiation, and distant metastasis remain incompletely understood. Additionally, systematic research on potential therapeutic targets — including signaling pathway aberrations associated with aggressive phenotypes and dynamic changes in the immune microenvironment — remains insufficient.

Central nervous system cancers — meningioma surgery outcomes and recurrence: Complete surgical resection may be curative and is therefore the treatment of choice, if feasible. In a cohort of 581 patients, 10-year PFS was 75% following GTR but dropped to 39% for patients receiving STR. Short-term recurrences for grade 1, 2, and 3 meningiomas were 1% to 16%, 20% to 41%, and 56% to 63%, respectively. The Simpson classification scheme (grades 1–5) correlates with local recurrence rates.

FIGURE 6
Summary of meningioangiomatosis and tumor spectrum. AT/RT, atypical teratoid and rhabdoid tumor; CNV, copy number variations; MAM, meningioangiomatosis; ped, pediatric.

Previously, MAM have been described as being associated with AT/RT or tumors having CNS SMARCB1‐ alterations. However, molecular data (including 22q status in the two components, germline status of SMARCB1, and epigenetic analyses) are lacking for these cases. The current study showed that MAM and meningioma components harbored only a hemizygous deletion of chromosome 22q including the SMARCB1 gene, whereas a homozygous deletion was present in the AT/RT component. The DNA‐methylation profiling of these three components are distinct. This may illustrate the fact that an additional genetic event may be responsible for a subset of patients with MAM where AT/RT later appears. Moreover, meningiomas belong to the tumor spectrum for cases of rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome. This hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that this AT/RT component was classified as an AT/RT subtype MYC, which is known to be similar to extracranial forms of rhabdoid tumors (non‐neuronal), and in this case, potentially shares the same cellular origin as MAM and meningiomas.

To conclude, the current work brought additional findings arguing a potential neoplastic nature for MAM, which might be isolated or progress to form a meningioma. If further series confirm these data, MAM will need to be included in the meningioma chapter of a future version of the WHO Classification of CNS Tumors.

### The multiomic landscape of meningiomas: a review and update [^130d148c]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Meningiomas are the most common primary brain tumor in adults. Traditionally they have been understudied compared to other central nervous system (CNS) tumors. However over the last decade, there has been renewed interest in uncovering the molecular topography of these tumors, with landmark studies identifying key driver alterations contributing to meningioma development and progression. Recent work from several independent research groups have integrated different genomic and epigenomic platforms to develop a molecular-based classification scheme for meningiomas that could supersede histopathological grading in terms of diagnostic accuracy, biological relevance, and outcome prediction, keeping pace with contemporary grading schemes for other CNS tumors including gliomas and medulloblastomas.

Methods

Here we summarize the studies that have uncovered key alterations in meningiomas which builds towards the discovery of consensus molecular groups in meningiomas by integrating these findings. These groups supersede WHO grade and other clinical factors in being able to accurately predict tumor biology and clinical outcomes following surgery.

Results

Despite differences in the nomenclature of recently uncovered molecular groups across different studies, the biological similarities between these groups enables us to likely reconciliate these groups into four consensus molecular groups: two benign groups largely dichotomized by NF2-status, and two clinically aggressive groups defined by their hypermetabolic transcriptome, and by their preponderance of proliferative, cell-cycling pathways respectively.

Conclusion

Future work, including by our group and others are underway to validate these molecular groups and harmonize the nomenclature for routine clinical use.

### Case-based review: atypical teratoid / rhabdoid tumor [^be0d9825]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) is a rare CNS cancer that typically occurs in children younger than 3 years of age. Histologically, AT/RTs are embryonal tumors that contain a rhabdoid component as well as areas with primitive neuroectodermal, mesenchymal, and epithelial features. Compared to other CNS tumors of childhood, AT/RTs are characterized by their rapid growth, short symptomatic prodrome, and large size upon presentation, often leading to brain compression and intracranial hypertension requiring urgent intervention. For decades, the mainstay of care has been a combination of maximal safe surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Despite advances in each of these modalities, the relative paucity of data on these tumors, their inherently aggressive course, and a lack of molecular data have limited advances in treatment over the past 3 decades. Recent large-scale, multicenter interdisciplinary studies, however, have significantly advanced our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of these tumors. Multiple clinical trials testing molecularly targeted therapies are underway, offering hope for patients with AT/RT and their families.

Advances in the understanding of the molecular biology of central nervous system (CNS) tumors prompted a new World Health Organization (WHO) classification scheme in 2021, only 5 years after the prior iteration. The 2016 version was the first to include specific molecular alterations in the diagnoses of a few tumors, but the 2021 system greatly expanded this approach, with over 40 tumor types and subtypes now being defined by their key molecular features. Many tumors have also been reconceptualized into new "supercategories", including adult-type diffuse gliomas, pediatric-type diffuse low- and high-grade gliomas, and circumscribed astrocytic gliomas. Some entirely new tumors are in this scheme, particularly pediatric tumors. Naturally, these changes will impact how CNS tumor patients are diagnosed and treated, including clinical trial enrollment. This review addresses the most clinically relevant changes in the 2021 WHO book, including diffuse and circumscribed gliomas, ependymomas, embryonal tumors, and meningiomas.

### Genomic landscape of high-grade meningiomas [^09b5e48f]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Genomic features associate with high-grade meningioma subtype and location

It is increasingly appreciated that the driver mutations of meningiomas are associated with particular histopathologic subtypes and with anatomic locations in the cranium. Recent work has shown that a subset of rhabdoid meningiomas, but not meningiomas of other histological subtypes, harbor mutations in the tumor suppressor gene BAP1. Across high-grade meningiomas, we found that the rhabdoid subtype was associated with a significantly lower incidence of chromosome 1p losses compared with other high-grade meningiomas (p = 0.002, Fig. 2a), consistent with a distinct pathogenesis. Angiomatous meningiomas also demonstrated a markedly different copy number profile from other meningiomas, with frequent arm-level gains, consistent with previous cytogenetics observations. These spanned both classic grade I angiomatous meningiomas as well as meningiomas with angiomatous features that fulfilled histologic criteria for grade II.

High-grade meningiomas in our cohort were also significantly more likely to exhibit a paravenous origin (including parasagittal, falcine, torcula, and intraventricular locations), and significantly less likely to originate in the anterior skull base (including olfactory groove, clinoid, planum, tuberculum), than low-grade meningioma (p < 3 × 10⁷).

Across the 702 aggregated samples, low-grade meningiomas were significantly more likely to occur in females compared with males, in line with previous reports. We also validated the association between AKT1/PIK3CA mutations and meningothelial subtype (p < 0.001), NF2 mutations with fibroblastic subtype (p < 0.001), and mutations in TRAF7/KLF4 and secretory subtype (p < 0.001). We did not detect additional associations between age or gender and chromosomal disruption, mutation burden, location, or specific driver alterations.

Furthermore, we did not detect a significant difference in recurrence rates between high-grade meningiomas with canonical low-grade driver alterations and those without, or between NF2 -mutant and NF2 -wild-type low-grade meningiomas. However, we had limited power to assess such relationships as a result of the relatively low recurrence rate observed in our cohort, in part due to our limited follow-up time.

### Meningioma: molecular updates from the 2021 World Health Organization classification of CNS tumors and imaging correlates [^82a96c9f]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Meningiomas, the most common primary intracranial neoplasms, account for more than one-third of primary CNS tumors. While traditionally viewed as benign, meningiomas can be associated with considerable morbidity, and specific meningioma subgroups display more aggressive behavior with higher recurrence rates. The risk stratification for recurrence has been primarily associated with the World Health Organization (WHO) histopathologic grade and extent of resection. However, a growing body of literature has highlighted the value of molecular characteristics in assessing recurrence risk. While maintaining the previous classification system, the 5th edition of the 2021 WHO Classification of Central Nervous System tumors (CNS5) book expands upon the molecular information in meningiomas to help guide management. The WHO CNS5 stratifies meningioma into 3 grades (1–3) based on histopathology criteria and molecular profile. The telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter mutations and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/B (CDKN2A / B) deletions now signify a grade 3 meningioma with increased recurrence risk. Tumor location also correlates with underlying mutations. Cerebral convexity and most spinal meningiomas carry a 22q deletion and/or NF2 mutations, while skull base meningiomas have AKT1, TRAF7, SMO, and/or PIK3CA mutations. MRI is the primary imaging technique for diagnosing and treatment-planning of meningiomas, while DOTATATE PET imaging offers supplementary information beyond anatomic imaging. Herein, we review the evolving molecular landscape of meningiomas, emphasizing imaging/genetic biomarkers and treatment strategies relevant to neuroradiologists.

Temporal relationships indicate survival of multiple lineages across resections

Successive recurrences of the same meningioma may comprise either a single invasive subclone that develops a growth advantage compared with other initially co-existing subclones, or different subclones that are present in geographically distinct regions of the primary meningioma which can each subsequently emerge. In the former case, one would expect successive resections to be more closely related to each other than to the primary resection, whereas the latter case would imply a random ordering to the relationships between successive resections (Fig. 5a).

Pre-operative and post-operative MR imaging (top) from the third (S3), fourth (S4), fifth (S5), and sixth (S6) resections, spanning a 4-year interval, demonstrates a heterogeneous pattern and location of tumor regrowth despite excellent resections.

To distinguish between these possibilities, we constructed phylogenetic trees to assess the evolution of tumors over time among six patients for whom we had sequenced more than two recurrences. In five of the six cases, we found that samples that did not immediately precede one another were the most closely related (Supplementary Fig. 6). For example, in one case, the fifth and third resection were more similar to one another than to any of the other sequenced samples (Fig. 5b). In another, the primary tumor and fourth resection were more similar to one another than to the third resection (Fig. 5c). These results suggest that subsequent recurrences reflect geographically distinct unresected regions rather than a dominant invasive subclone that originates from the primary tumor.

Meningiomas in Patients With NF2-Related Schwannomatosis

Pathogenic germline alterations in the NF2 gene, whether inherited or acquired (eg, new germline variant), result in the development of the tumor predisposition syndrome NF2-SWN.NF2-SWN is a highly penetrant autosomal dominant condition with an incidence of 1 in 25 000 to 33 000. While classically characterized by the development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas, 48%–75% of patients with NF2-SWN will develop meningiomas at some point in their clinical course. Compared to patients with sporadic meningiomas, patients with NF2-SWN typically develop meningiomas at a younger age and are at higher risk for developing multiple meningiomas. Therefore patients with these phenotypes should be screened for germline NF2 and SMARCE1 mutations. The majority of NF2-SWN-associated meningiomas are asymptomatic and often diagnosed during the work up for NF2-SWN or over the course of routine radiographic surveillance. When present, approximately 10% of these meningiomas will grow rapidly (defined as ≥ 2 cm³/year by one study) while the remainder will demonstrate no or very slow growth. New meningiomas will develop in 20% of NF2-SWN patients. Importantly, patients with NF2-SWN who have a meningioma have been found to have a significantly increased risk of death compared to those who do not.

Given their complexity, the management of patients with NF2-SWN by multidisciplinary teams at high-volume centers has been demonstrated to improve both their quality of life and life expectancy. The majority of NF2-SWN-associated meningiomas can be safely observed including those that demonstrate slow, clinically silent growth. Surgery remains the primary treatment for symptomatic or rapidly enlarging tumors, although its risks must be weighed against the anticipated risks of additional or future operative procedures that NF2-SWN patients may need to undergo for their other neoplasms. Maximizing extent of resection remains important but even moreso here must be balanced against the risk of incurring a significant neurologic deficit that may irreparably impair their quality of life or make them ineligible for other required interventions.NF2-SWN-associated meningiomas tend to be more biologically aggressive than sporadic cases (52% are WHO grades 2 or 3), although this statistic may be confounded by a relative hesitancy on the part of most surgeons to resect the presumably more benign, slow-growing tumors in these patients.

### Gliosarcoma in patients under 20 years of age. A clinicopathologic study of 11 cases and detailed review of the literature [^e6b92486]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Pediatric gliosarcomas are even rarer than adult gliosarcomas. Clinical and morphological features are similar to adult gliosarcomas. However, they may mimic more common tumors on radiological and histological examination. The clinicopathological features and differential diagnostic consideration are discussed. Published literature is reviewed.

On radiological examination, the relative discreteness of these tumors may mimic meningioma. Similarly, on gross examination, the appearance of a firm well-circumscribed mass with attachment to dura may be mistaken with a meningioma or metastases, although such confusion is more likely in adults rather than in the pediatric age group. On histological examination, the diagnosis in typical cases even in pediatric age group is straightforward when the classic biphasic pattern is well developed. However, the sarcomatous areas in both adult and pediatric gliosarcoma can resemble fibrosarcoma. Some cases may show other types of mesenchymal differentiation such as bone and cartilage formation (resembling osteo-or chondrosarcoma), smooth and striated muscle differentiation (resembling leiomyosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma), lipomatous differentiation (resembling liposarcoma) and primitive neural differentiation. Variable mesenchymal differentiation was seen in our series and additional mesenchymal differentiation in the form of bone and cartilage formation was seen in one case. Similarly, adenoid (epithelial) differentiation may be seen in gliosarcoma in all age groups and such areas may resemble carcinoma resulting in misdiagnosis. Squamous metaplasia may be seen and can be mistaken for squamous cell carcinoma. The presence of gemistocytic and rhabdoid cells may lead to erroneous diagnosis of gemistocytic astrocytoma and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor in the pediatric age group. Gemistocytic and rhabdoid cells were seen in one and two cases respectively in our series. In pediatric patients, germ cell tumors (such as germinoma and teratoma) should also be considered in the differential diagnosis. Gliosarcoma in pediatric patients can especially be confused with teratoma if bone, cartilage or other mesenchymal components are present. Desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma (DIA) is another rare tumor which can be confused with gliosarcoma in the pediatric age group. However, DIA is a slow growing, WHO grade I tumor which typically occurs in infants as a large cystic mass in the supratentorial cerebral cortex and meninges and is often attached to the dura. Microscopically, it is composed of a prominent desmoplastic stroma in which streams of neoplastic astrocytes are seen. Mitotic activity and necrosis are uncommon and ki67 index is usually < 2%.

Rhabdoid tumor cells are typically observed in atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) but may also be seen in meningioma, glioma, melanoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and metastatic carcinoma. We present an astroblastoma with unusual rhabdoid features which is rarely described in the English literature. Apart from the rhabdoid tumor cells, all the histopathological features typical for astroblastoma are present in this case. These features include pseudopapillary arrangement, astroblastic pseudorosettes, perivascular hyalinization and calcifications, absence of fibrillary background and a pushing tumor border. The tumor cells display a multilineage immunohistochemical profile. In addition, diffuse and strong membranous and cytoplasmic dot-like pattern is appreciated with epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). The diagnosis of astroblastoma is also well supported by the age of presentation, anatomical location and radiological features of the tumor. We believe that on top of the above-mentioned unusual tumors with rhabdoid cells, astroblastoma should also be considered in the list of differential diagnosis.

### Pediatric meningioma with a novel MAML2-YAP1 fusion variant: a case report and literature review [^f7e2555a]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

In this report, we attempted to identify the potential genomic aberrations underlying the histological subtype of rhabdoid meningiomas. Characterization of such alterations is challenging due to uncommon anaplastic meningiomas, especially rhabdoid meningiomas, and significant interobserver variabilities in the diagnosis of this entity and in the recognition and description of rhabdoid features. In addition, the rhabdoid subtype was initially defined as aggressive and exclusively high grade, but without significant high-grade histologic features, some meningiomas with rhabdoid cytomorphology showed indolent behaviors analogous to WHO grade I tumors, highlighting the genetic diversity of meningiomas with rhabdoid features. Currently, BAP1 germline and somatic mutations have been identified to be associated with clinically aggressive meningiomas with rhabdoid features. However, in our case, only MAML2-YAP1 fusion was detected, but not BAP1 germline and somatic mutations, which might be associated with infrequent rhabdoid meningiomas and interobserver variabilities. In the future, multi-institutional efforts are required to better characterize the clinicopathological and genomic features of meningiomas with rhabdoid features.

In our knowledge, research and development of drugs targeting YAP1 may be a novel direction. Protein-protein interaction sites between YAP/TAZ and TEAD have been identified as a potential drug target of Hippo pathway. One of the mechanisms is to directly inhibit α-helix or Ω-loop of the YAP-TEAD binding site, the other is to target the TEAD palmitoylation pocket to indirectly disrupt YAP/TAZ-TEAD complex and modulate Hippo pathway activity. YAP1 inhibitors have not entered the clinical stage in the field of oncology yet, but they might provide a new therapeutic direction in the future.

In conclusion, a novel MAML2-YAP1 fusion break point in a child with meningioma was identified in our report, which expanded the YAP1 fusion spectrum. This case not only provides integrated clinical, radiological, and pathological features of pediatric meningioma with the fusion of YAP1 and MAML2 genes, but also highlights the importance of integrated diagnosis in pediatric meningioma.

### Molecular signatures define BAP1-altered meningioma as a distinct CNS tumor with deregulation of polycomb repressive complex target genes [^baca732a]. Neuro-Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial neoplasms, with highly variable patient outcomes. While most meningiomas are benign, a significant subset recurs postoperatively, presenting substantial treatment challenges. BAP1 gene inactivation has been suggested as a marker for aggressive meningiomas, although its precise molecular and clinical roles remain poorly understood.

Methods

To comprehensively investigate BAP1-altered meningiomas, we used six meningiomas with known BAP1 alterations as a discovery set. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of these samples, along 11,151 reference meningiomas, identified a distinct molecular cluster (n = 42) using unsupervised visualization approaches. These tumors were further characterized by DNA/RNA sequencing, histopathological examination, and a retrospective review of clinical data, compared to reference meningioma cohorts, providing a thorough characterization of this rare tumor subtype.

Results

Our integrative analysis revealed BAP1-altered meningiomas as a distinct CNS tumor subtype, characterized by recurrent loss of chromosome 3p21 and driven by various BAP1-inactivating alterations. Although rhabdoid morphology is present in some cases, it is not exclusive and should not be used as a grading criterion. Progression-free survival analysis showed a median of 21 months (95% CI: 12-NA), with a 2-year overall survival rate of 79% (95% CI: 60%-100%), highlighting the aggressive nature of these tumors. Gene expression profiling revealed upregulation of PRC target genes, dysregulated Polycomb signaling, and elevated expression in several cellular and growth factor pathways.

Conclusions

BAP1-altered meningiomas represent a distinct and aggressive CNS tumor subtype associated with PRC dysregulation and recurrent 3p chromosome loss. These findings support the designation "meningioma, BAP1-altered".

### Imaging of supratentorial intraventricular masses in children: a pictorial review-part 1 [^69961668]. Neuroradiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Meningioma

Background

Meningiomas (WHO grades 1 to 3) are rare in children and are even less likely to occur in the ventricles. While meningiomas can appear anywhere within the ventricular system, they are more commonly found in the atrium of the lateral ventricles. These tumours arise from arachnoid cells trapped within the CP and exhibit no histological difference from the supratentorial meningiomas.

Pathology

Intraventricular meningiomas can present with any histopathology type (predominantly fibrous, fibroblastic, meningothelial or psammomatous) as defined by WHO CNS5. Characteristically, meningiomas will display spherical formations of meningothelial cells, known as whorls, which may eventually mineralise into psammoma bodies (Fig. 11). Other common features include central chromatin clearing in the nucleus and the presence of intranuclear cytoplasmic pseudoinclusions.

Fig. 11
Meningioma — the image shows tumour cells with round to ovoid nuclei, growing in a lobulated to fascicular pattern, with intervening collagenous bands, focal whorls and calcifications (psammoma bodies, indicated by arrows). H&E stain, 20 × magnification

According to WHO CNS5, the diagnostic criteria for meningioma typically require a combination of several elements. These include classic histopathological features corresponding to at least one meningioma subtype, suggestive histopathological features combined with biallelic inactivation of NF2 or other classic drivers of conventional meningioma (TRAF7, AKT1, KLF4, SMO, PIK3CA), clear cell meningioma (SMARCE1) or rhabdoid meningioma (BAP1). Alternatively, suggestive histopathological features combined with one of the defined DNA methylation classes of meningioma could be used for diagnosis. EMA immunoreactivity, strong and diffuse SSTR2A immunoreactivity and the presence of classic copy-number alterations of NF2-mutant meningioma, such as monosomy 22/22q in lower-grade meningiomas, with additional losses of 1p, 6, 10q, 14q and/or 18 in higher-grade meningiomas, are also desirable in the diagnostic process.

### Meningioma: international consortium on meningiomas consensus review on scientific advances and treatment paradigms for clinicians, researchers, and patients [^fead2ad0]. Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

The conventional use of WHO grading to stratify meningiomas into different treatment arms should also be considered. The WHO criteria for CNS WHO grade 2 and 3 meningiomas (the cases that are most often selected for adjuvant RT clinically) have undergone several updates of from 2000 to 2021. Clinical trials that accrue over several years may require central pathological review and regrading or be limited by this confounder. Furthermore, apart from the most recent 2021 classification, all previous WHO grading systems were entirely based on histopathology and in some instances may be susceptible to differences in interpretation between pathologists. In this emergent molecular era of meningioma classification, the WHO grade has been shown to be less predictive of outcome than nearly all molecular classification systems although robust, large-scale validation of these classifications are still needed, particularly as it pertains to response to RT. Despite the associated challenges, it will be important to consider prognostic molecular alterations when it comes to future selection of patients for adjuvant RT. When DNA methylation was performed on 38 CNS WHO grades 2 and 3 meningiomas from the phase II EORTC 22042–26042 clinical trial that received different degrees of surgical resection, loss of chromosome 1p and unfavorable DKFZ methylation class were found to be associated with worse 3-year PFS, although statistical significance was not met. Recently, a 34-gene expression signature was developed that appeared to outperform WHO grade and several other molecular prognostic systems in accurately predicting 5-year PFS. Using this prognostic signature, meningiomas were able to be stratified into cases at high- and low-risk of recurrence following surgery. Although this gene expression biomarker was robustly validated in large external cohorts where postoperative management for up to 29.8% of cases could be refined, these cohorts spanned multiple decades of time and included only 210 patients who actually received postoperative RT. Therefore, further validation is needed to translate this signature to specifically RT-treated meningioma cases before its utility for determining response to RT can be definitively established.

### The WHO classification of tumors of the central nervous system-finally here, and welcome! [^aa72e565]. Brain Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Certainly, this minisymposium does not encompass all tumor groups and updates of the new WHO classification. Important topics such as pediatric high‐grade gliomas and meningiomas are covered in other reviews and even complete minisymposiums. Additionally, challenges intrinsic to all molecular‐based classifications remain, specifically difficulties in platform and bioinformatic standardization, as well as accessibility of novel diagnostic tests in underdeveloped, and sometimes even developed countries. In the spirit of the prior WHO, "not otherwise specified" options and long diagnostic comments are still available when thorough profiling resulting from large‐scale groundbreaking studies are not possible in the individual case. Therefore, creativity in the design of surrogate markers and practical diagnostic approach guidelines should continue to be encouraged at the present time.

Methods Results Correlation of WHO Grade, CNVs, DNA Methylation, and Mutations 6These six MCs encompass three MCs with benign outcome, two MCs with intermediate outcome, and one malignant MC with highly aggressive outcome. Accordingly, these six MCs can be merged into three overarching groups, formerly referred to as combined clinical groups. 6In line with previous studies, the CNVs were highly distinct for the MCs: ben-1 shows consistently deletions of 22q, ben-2 has virtually flat copy-number profiles, and ben-3 is characterized by whole-chromosomal gains. The number of whole-chromosome deletions increases in MC int-A/B, and finally MC mal is characterized by numerous CNVs including focal homozygous deletions on 9p at the. SMO, KLF4, and TRAF7mutations are common in WHO grade 1 meningioma of MC ben-2 with flat copy-number profiles.

Additional CNVs besides 22q deletion are accumulated in MC int-A and int-B, along with NF2mutations and increasing WHO grade. Finally, meningiomas with highly perturbed genomes, including. NF2-mutant meningiomas. 15–24 NF2-mutant cases, the most informative single marker is deletion of 1p. The addition of 1p assessment in WHO grade 1 and 2 cases substantially increases the prediction accuracy: Histologically inconspicuous cases, thus compatible with WHO grade 1, but prone to progression or recurrence, can be singled-out by identification of 1p deletion. In turn, meningioma with higher mitotic count, thus allotted to WHO grade 2, but lack of 1p alteration, can be categorized as WHO grade 1. 15, 16, 25and provides the first methylation-based classification that has now been validated over multiple cohorts, including prospectively accrued cases, after its introduction in

### Fractionated radiotherapy for spinal tumors: a literature review regarding spinal glioma, ependymoma, and meningioma [^15b1d13c]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Spinal Ependymoma

Adult ependymomas are relatively rare tumors that are most commonly found in the brain but make up about 18% of all spinal cord tumors. The latest WHO classification of CNS tumors, updated in 2021, classifies ependymomas based on their location and molecular characteristics. Spinal ependymomas are recognized as a distinct entity, characterized by molecular definition through MYCN amplification. Depending on their histopathological features, these tumors can be assigned a grade of 2 or 3. Notably, the term "anaplastic" is no longer employed to describe grade 3 ependymomas in the updated classification. In the CNS WHO 2021 classification, myxopapillary ependymoma remains an independent entity. However, its grading has been reclassified from grade 1 to grade 2. This change is attributed to its high recurrence rate, which is comparable to other grade 2 spinal ependymomas. Regarding treatment, the primary goal should be achieving optimal GTR, which results in the most favorable outcomes. As the most frequent site of recurrence is typically at the primary site, adjuvant RT is typically administered locally to increase local control.

### Familial syndromes involving meningiomas provide mechanistic insight into sporadic disease [^bf0f8a6d]. Neurosurgery (2018). Low credibility.

FIGURE 4.
Meningioma-associated mutations in genes involving chromatin structure and the DNA damage response. WRN codes for a protein that is a member of the RecQ family. Its helicase function serves broad functional roles in normal DNA metabolism as well as DNA repair. The BAP1 protein is involved in the DNA damage response, specifically functioning in double-stranded break repair. The SMARCB1 and SMARCE1 genes code for components of the SWI/SNF complex, which participates in chromatin remodeling to regulate transcription.

This work supports the strategy of examining familial syndromes to identify candidate genes and pathways for further study in sporadic cases. The relationship of SMARCE1 mutations to the clear cell subtype and BAP1 mutations to the rhabdoid subtype demonstrate how familial studies also provide insight into the specific histopathologic subtypes of meningioma. The histologic grading of meningiomas is challenging given the multitude of types, and the discordance between histology and clinical behavior lessens its utility. Studies in which specific genetic mutations are associated with specific histologies are the beginning of a potential molecular classification of these tumors that could be used to better predict patient outcomes. Epigenetic classification schemes are also a potential method for classification, with a recently proposed scheme based on DNA methylation for meningiomas being an example. The authors found that methylation patterns profiled meningiomas into 2 major groups with several subclasses and that this profiling better predicted recurrence and prognosis than the current WHO classification. The authors included the familial genes SMARCE1, SMARCB1, PTEN, SUFU, and NF2 in their analysis of the subtypes of their classification scheme, with NF2 and SUFU being the only genes that segregated significantly. Investigating the other familial genes discussed in this review could have provided the authors further information. We agree with the authors and WHO that given the complex nature of these tumors, an amalgamated approach combining histology, genetics, epigenetics, and clinical findings will provide the best system for classification. The results of studies on familial syndromes combined with large-scale genetic studies on sporadic meningioma leave up to 20% of meningiomas without a genetic basis. Given the comprehensive examination of the genetic landscape of meningioma that these studies provide, one hypothesis that could be derived is that the remaining causes of meningioma lay outside of genetic mutations. Studies examining gene expression profiles, epigenetic regulation, microRNA, and long noncoding RNA will be important to gain a better understanding of meningioma pathogenesis.

### Molecular profiling of pediatric meningiomas shows tumor characteristics distinct from adult meningiomas [^9ed63b02]. Acta Neuropathologica (2021). Medium credibility.

The remaining 31 pediatric meningiomas formed a large group which could be separated into two distinct subgroups designated as group 2A and 2B. Group 2A was dominated by atypical meningiomas WHO grade II. Interestingly, in this group 100% of cases showed chromosome 22 loss, as well as the highest frequency of clinically diagnosed NF2. Thus, this group can be described as the NF2 -driven subgroup of pediatric meningiomas.

The third group, designated group 2B, was characterized by a mixture of histological variants but included all rhabdoid meningiomas WHO grade III. Moreover, only in this group allelic loss of chromosome 11 were observed, while loss of chromosome 22 was rare and clinical signs of NF2 were absent. Meningiomas with rhabdoid features were initially thought to be characterized by aggressive biology. Recently it could be shown that the clinical course of rhabdoid meningiomas largely depends on the loss of the tumor suppressor BAP1, irrespective of the underlying rhabdoid phenotype.

YAP1 fusions have been recently reported among pediatric meningiomas. However, chromosomal rearrangement around the YAP1 locus serving as a surrogate for YAP1 alterations were not detected in our cohort, while RNA sequening would be required to address this question appropriately.

Another striking observation is that the methylation profile of pediatric meningiomas differs clearly from the one observed in adult meningioma patients. By analyzing pediatric and adult tumors together the pediatric group still was clearly separated. Despite the high frequency of NF2 alterations in the pediatric group, the tumors did not fall into the cluster of NF2 -altered adult meningiomas. This indicates that the underlying biology is substantially different between pediatric and adult meningiomas.

The lack of NF2 patients being represented in the 2B methylation cluster could have clinical implications. While approximately 40% of young patients presenting with a solitary meningioma have an underlying germline NF2 mutation, the diagnosis can be difficult to ascertain genetically due to mosaic status and may require years to confirm clinically. Moreover, in our retrospective series it appeared difficult to trace back clinical features according to the consensus criteria. If our findings can be confirmed in a larger cohort of NF2 meningioma patients, methylation profiling could provide a valuable diagnostic adjunct.

KF-PRO serial scanner was used, and pathological assessment was performed using K-Viewer software. Pathologically, the tumor cells manifested nested, sheet-like or whorled aggregates of spindle to epithelioid cells prominently with indistinct cell borders. Mitotic count was less than 1 per 10 high-power fields. Focally, rhabdoid cells were identified, accounting for 10% of the tumor (Fig. 3). Rhabdoid morphology was characterized by incomplete differentiation and intercellular adhesion, not accompanied by paranuclear inclusion body. Atypical features including brain invasion, hypercellularity, small cell formation, macronucleoli, sheeting architecture and spontaneous necrosis, were not identified in this tumor. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed as WHO grade I meningioma with focal rhabdoid features. The tumor cells showed diffuse and strong EMA and SSTR2 immunoreactivity. Immunohistochemistry for CD34, S100, STAT6, CK and SOX10 were negative in all tumor cells. Most tumor cells showed diffuse expression for SMARCB1/INI-1. The Ki-67 index was less than 1%.

To determine molecular features and seek potential treatments, a next-generation sequencing-based gene panel (Simceredx, Nanjing, China) was used for genomic profiling in primary tumor tissue and matched blood. Except for a novel MAML2-YAP1 fusion break point (5' MAML2 exon 1 fused to 3' YAP1 exons 7–9) identified (Fig. 4), no other mutations like single nucleotide polymorphism, InDel and copy number variations were detected.

### TERT promoter mutations in primary and secondary WHO grade III meningioma [^cc81876d]. Brain Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

The diagnoses of 40 consecutive grade III meningiomas during 18 years in a catchment area of 2.2 million inhabitants correspond to an incidence of 10.1/100.000/year. Among our 40 patients with WHO grade III meningiomas, we found TERT p Mut in seven patients (17.5%): 2/20 (10%) primary grade III meningiomas and 5/20 (25%) secondary grade III meningiomas. The patient and treatment characteristics of the TERTp Mut and the TERTp wt groups are shown in Table 1. There was no significant difference in age (TERT p Mut: mean 62 years, TERT p wt: mean 59, t ‐test P = 0.68). Only one female belonged to the TERT p Mut group (1/7 14.3%) compared to 19 in the TERT p wt group (19/33, 57.6%). The difference was not statistically significant (Fisher test; P = 0.09). Twenty patients (50%) had a primary malignant meningioma and 20 a secondary. Of the 40 WHO grade III meningiomas, four tumors were papillary (two primary and two secondary), four were rhabdoid (three primary and one secondary) and 32 were anaplastic (15 primary and 17 secondary). TERT p Mut tumors of all grades did not show any distinctive histopathological features compared to the TERTp wt group, apart from TERT p Mut being found solely in patients whose tumors were classified as anaplastic meningiomas.

The two patients with papillary and three patients with rhabdoid histology all had meningiomas containing TERTp wt. Two patients with primary anaplastic meningiomas (patient #1 and #7) had TERT p Mut. Both had a C228T TERT p Mut and none had the C250T mutation (Figure 1). Patient #1 was only operated once for the WHO grade III meningioma while patient #7 was operated for a grade III recurrence that retained the C228T TERT p Mut (Figure 1).

Spinal Meningiomas

Although rarer than their intracranial counterparts (with an incidence of approximately 0.193–0.33 cases per 100 000), spinal meningiomas are the most common intradural spinal tumors, representing 25–45% of these cases.CNS WHO grades 2 and 3 cases are also comparatively less common in the spine. Spinal meningiomas also appear to differ from intracranial meningiomas on a molecular basis and are generally more biologically benign. A novel molecular classification was recently proposed for spinal meningiomas with 2 major subgroups: one with predominantly NF2 mutations and the other with AKT1 mutations (mutually exclusive to NF2 mutations). While both subgroups were predominantly comprised of meningiomas from benign methylation subclasses, the NF2 -mutated subgroup was associated with intermediate outcomes and were more strongly associated with female sex, thoracic spine location, and frequent tumor calcification. AKT1 -mutated spinal meningiomas had no sex predilection and were associated with meningothelial subtype, cervical spine location, and the absence of tumor calcification. Interestingly, there was a small subset of spinal meningiomas with a much higher degree of cytogenetic changes that did not show a clear association with either of the above subgroups and instead more closely resembled intermediate and malignant methylation subclasses of intracranial meningiomas. This suggests that as more clinically aggressive spinal meningiomas are profiled, additional molecular subgroups may be elucidated, potentially mirroring those that have been discovered for intracranial cases.

Treatment guidelines for spinal meningiomas are the same as for intracranial meningiomas, with GTR as the usual goal of surgery. In cases where a Simpson grade 1 resection (including dural resection with patch reconstruction) may not be feasible such as for tumors with a ventral origin, a Simpson grade 2 resection with extensive dural coagulation may have comparable outcomes. Careful anatomic planning of surgical corridors may avoid the need for instrumentation in many of these cases. The role of RT for spinal meningiomas is unclear, particularly given their largely benign behavior. A review of the National Cancer Database showed that only 2.5% of 10 458 patients with spinal meningiomas received RT. Older patients with higher WHO grade tumors, larger tumors, and recurrent cases were more likely to receive RT. Interestingly, this study also reported an increase in mortality risk among "borderline" (CNS WHO grade 2) and malignant (CNS WHO grade 3) tumors that received RT following surgery compared to those that did not. Further study is needed in order to fully resolve the role of adjuvant RT or primary stereotactic body RT for spinal meningiomas.

### Favorable long-term outcomes of chordoid meningioma compared with the other WHO grade 2 meningioma subtypes [^76410e88]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Clinical management of WHO grade 2 meningioma is challenging and lacks consensus mostly because of heterogenous clinical behaviors.CM is a distinct subtype classified as WHO grade 2 meningiomas. First reported in 1988 by Kepes et al, CM was graded as WHO grade 2 in 2007based on the reports of high recurrence rate even after GTR. However, the clinicopathological characteristics, molecular genetics, and long-term outcomes of CM are still not clear owing to its small case number.

A key finding of our work was that the PFS and OS of CM were better than those of non-CM. This is consistent with a small case series of CM (N = 12) showing its better prognosis than nonchordoid grade 2 meningiomas. Zhang et alcompared CM with CCM and found CM to have a lower recurrence rate and mortality than CCM. On the other hand, Soni et alreported that CCM portended a worse PFS and OS prognosis than nonCCM grade 2 tumors. However, the reasons for an apparently better prognosis of CM remained unclear because of the low incidence of the disease.

We showed that compared with CCM and AM, CM generally had more benign clinicopathological characteristics, most notably a lower Ki-67 index and higher positive PR expression. The Ki-67 index correlated with the risk of recurrence and malignancy of meningioma. Mirian et alshowed that the Ki-67 index was an important marker for time to recurrence, and Choy et alrevealed that Ki-67 > 5.0% strongly predicted recurrence. Previously, PR was reported to be positive in 39%–88% of meningiomas. Several studies have demonstrated that PR-positive patients had more favorable clinical outcomes. Furthermore, the PR expression level seemed to be associated with NF2 mutations, an important initial event in meningioma development. The lower Ki-67 index and higher rate of positive PR in CM than non-CM might be the tumor intrinsic features that underlie the benign nature and better outcome of CM.

### Pediatric meningiomas: a literature review and diagnostic update [^a7db6363]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Pathogenesis

As in adults, monosomy of chromosome 22 is the most frequently reported genetic abnormality in pediatric meningiomas. Loss of heterozygosity of 22q with bi-allelic inactivation of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene, located at 22q12.2, is recognized as an early tumorigenic event of meningioma. The NF2 gene encodes the protein Merlin which plays a role in regulating cell growth and cell motility as well as binding several transmembrane signaling proteins. NF2 alterations have been more frequently reported in children (49% of cases) than in adults (22% of cases). Whereas TRAF7, AKT1, KLF4, SMO, and PIK3CA alterations have been reported in a large part of adult meningiomas, particularly those located in the skull base, these mutations are rare in the pediatric population. Genetic mutations in these pathways (Hedgehog signaling for SMO- and SUFU-altered meningiomas, PIK3 pathway for PIK3CA- and AKT- altered meningiomas) seem to correlate with the anatomical distribution of meningiomas (anterior and medial skull base, convexity) and embryological origins. This anatomic/genetic correlation suggests different molecular driver events may be present in children. In non- NF2 driven pediatric meningiomas, YAP1 fusions (particularly with the MAML2 gene) as an alternative pathogenic alteration have been reported. YAP1 is a transcriptional co-activator and downstream effector of the HIPPO pathway which regulates the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis. YAP1 fusions have been evidenced in a series of meningiomas, mainly pediatric (one adult case was described), but no clear phenotype (different morphologies of meningiomas have been reported with these fusions, including poorly differentiated forms initially misdiagnoses as gliomas) or grade was found to be associated. A group of rhabdoid and papillary meningiomas share BAP1 (BRCA1- associated protein-1) and PBRM1 alterations. Loss of function mutations in the BAP1 gene is easily detectable immunohistochemically by protein loss. Even though pediatric rhabdoid/papillary meningiomas are exceedingly rare (only one reported case with BAP1 alteration), the clinical implications are important because a subset of meningiomas associated with BAP1 alterations may reveal the presence of the BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome including tumors of different organs and lineage (mesotheliomas, uveal, and cutaneous melanomas, clear cell carcinoma of the kidney). Moreover, loss of BAP1 staining was associated with an aggressive clinical behavior in these subtypes of meningioma. However, only adult cases of these subtypes of meningioma have been reported to date. Bi-allelic alterations in SMARCE1 constitute the sole specific abnormality of a histopathological subtype the clear cell meningioma, which is mostly encountered in children, adolescents, and young adults. The SMARCE1 gene, located on chromosome 17q21, encodes a component of the SWI/SNF (BAF57) protein complex which is a modulator for chromatin remodeling and gene transcription. This loss of function alteration may be easily and specifically evidenced by the loss of SMARCE1 protein expression using immunohistochemistry. Finally, the DNA-methylation profiling of pediatric meningiomas revealed that they represent three different epigenetic subgroups (named as 1, 2a, and 2b), distinct from those described in adults (distributed throughout 6 prognostic subgroups: benign-1, benign-2, benign-3, intermediate-A, intermediate-B, and malignant). Even pediatric meningiomas presenting NF2 alterations did not fall into the cluster of NF2- altered adult meningiomas. These methylation classes include different histopathological subtypes and grades. However, group 1 seems to be largely encompassed by clear cell meningiomas and NF2 alterations seem to be excluded from group 2B. These results (obtained via DNA-methylation profiling) seem to suggest the presence of a NF2 alteration in a pediatric meningioma. However, germline mutation may be difficult to diagnose by classical molecular analyses.

### Clinical implications of the 2021 edition of the WHO classification of central nervous system tumours [^1df4c2cf]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

A new edition of the WHO classification of tumours of the CNS was published in 2021. Although the previous edition of this classification was published just 5 years earlier, in 2016, rapid advances in our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of CNS tumours, including the diversity of clinically relevant molecular types and subtypes, necessitated a new classification system. Compared with the 2016 scheme, the new classification incorporates even more molecular alterations into the diagnosis of many tumours and reorganizes gliomas into adult-type diffuse gliomas, paediatric-type diffuse low-grade and high-grade gliomas, circumscribed astrocytic gliomas, and ependymal tumours. A number of new entities are incorporated into the 2021 classification, especially tumours that preferentially or exclusively arise in the paediatric population. Such a substantial revision of the WHO scheme will have major implications for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with CNS tumours. In this Perspective, we summarize the main changes in the classification of diffuse and circumscribed gliomas, ependymomas, embryonal tumours and meningiomas, and discuss how each change will influence post-surgical treatment, clinical trial enrolment and cooperative studies. Although the 2021 WHO classification of CNS tumours is a major conceptual advance, its implementation on a routine clinical basis presents some challenges that will require innovative solutions.

### Molecular and translational advances in meningiomas [^f176fb9b]. Neuro-Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial neoplasm. The current World Health Organization (WHO) classification categorizes meningiomas based on histopathological features, but emerging molecular data demonstrate the importance of genomic and epigenomic factors in the clinical behavior of these tumors. Treatment options for symptomatic meningiomas are limited to surgical resection where possible and adjuvant radiation therapy for tumors with concerning histopathological features or recurrent disease. At present, alternative adjuvant treatment options are not available in part due to limited historical biological analysis and clinical trial investigation on meningiomas. With advances in molecular and genomic techniques in the last decade, we have witnessed a surge of interest in understanding the genomic and epigenomic landscape of meningiomas. The field is now at the stage to adopt this molecular knowledge to refine meningioma classification and introduce molecular algorithms that can guide prediction and therapeutics for this tumor type. Animal models that recapitulate meningiomas faithfully are in critical need to test new therapeutics to facilitate rapid-cycle translation to clinical trials. Here we review the most up-to-date knowledge of molecular alterations that provide insight into meningioma behavior and are ready for application to clinical trial investigation, and highlight the landscape of available preclinical models in meningiomas.
