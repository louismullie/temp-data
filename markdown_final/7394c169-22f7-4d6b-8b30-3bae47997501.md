## Question

Is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) contraindicated following a stroke?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is contraindicated after a stroke, and if not, what safety considerations apply and how to contextualize the evidence and guidelines, especially around relative contraindications and protocol selection.

> Let me first confirm the core point: stroke itself is not listed as an absolute contraindication to TMS in the trials and reviews available, and multiple post-stroke studies have delivered both single-pulse TMS and repetitive TMS (rTMS) without reporting excess seizures or consistent neurological worsening when standard safety parameters are followed, which argues against "stroke per se" being a contraindication [^111ju2co] [^notfound] [^11177n5i] [^116vrifA].

> Wait, let me verify the safety signal across phases of recovery, because acute and subacute periods could differ; in a prospective subacute cohort initiated around day 9 post-onset, lesion-side high-frequency rTMS was associated with more favorable 3‑month outcomes and no observed epilepsy or NIHSS exacerbation, which supports feasibility and safety early after ischemic stroke when carefully selected patients and parameters are used [^111ju2co].

> I will now examine safety in chronic stroke and across stimulation frequencies; single and short-course low-frequency contralesional protocols and ipsilesional higher-frequency protocols have repeatedly been reported as well tolerated, with transient minor effects like scalp discomfort or headache, small blood pressure rises, and no consistent EEG or cognitive deterioration, while serious adverse events have been uncommon and not clearly attributable to rTMS in controlled trials [^113yrmMi] [^11177n5i] [^114aiCYz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about efficacy equaling safety; at first glance, I was inclined to say rTMS clearly improves motor outcomes, but I should double-check the highest-quality trials, and indeed the NICHE and E-FIT programs show no superiority of 1 Hz contralesional rTMS over sham on the primary motor endpoint despite similar safety profiles, so the clinical decision should separate the question of "is it safe" from "is it effective for this outcome" in a given patient [^114aiCYz] [^113DLz4z] [^116vrifA].

> Next, I should review relative contraindications and precautionary factors that emerge from stroke studies' exclusion criteria and from safety guidance; history of seizures or medications that lower seizure threshold, age over 80, disturbed consciousness, large cortical infarctions, and inability to determine resting motor threshold for dosing recur as reasons for caution rather than absolute prohibitions, and seizure risk is minimized by adhering to IFCN-referenced dosing with first exposures performed under observation because most TMS-associated seizures occur in the initial sessions [^111ju2co] [^111J3kXg] [^116uMW77].

> Let me think about the guideline context, because a formal contraindication would ordinarily be codified; major AHA/ASA acute ischemic stroke guidelines are silent on TMS altogether, focusing on reperfusion and hemodynamic management, which implies TMS is neither a standard acute therapy nor a listed contraindicated intervention in stroke care pathways, consistent with its current adjunctive or investigational status in rehabilitation domains [^113bewa1] [^112qzPr2] [^113jKNK7] [^1136FyHC].

> But wait, what if use outside motor recovery domains is considered a red flag; I need to check cross-domain rehabilitation data, and in fact rTMS has been studied for post-stroke aphasia, dysphagia, gait and balance, and post-stroke depression or PTSD, further supporting that stroke by itself has not precluded rTMS exposure across indications when protocols and safety screening are appropriate, though effect sizes and certainty vary by domain [^111KjUUU] [^113CVcsD] [^114rQmpw] [^1161s9fm].

> I should confirm practical risk stratification and parameter choices; for low-risk, medically stable post-stroke patients without seizure history and with a measurable motor threshold, standard low-frequency contralesional (1 Hz) or carefully titrated ipsilesional higher-frequency protocols can be considered with monitoring, whereas for moderate-risk patients it is prudent to favor low-frequency approaches, navigation, and conservative dosing with in-clinic first exposures, and for high-risk profiles such as recent seizures or unstable comorbidity, deferral or use only in closely monitored research settings is reasonable, always anchoring intensity to the resting motor threshold and respecting IFCN-aligned limits to minimize seizure risk [^116XpMuB] [^113yrmMi] [^114aiCYz] [^116uMW77].

> Bottom line, after double-checking the trials and guidelines, TMS is not contraindicated solely on the basis of a prior ischemic stroke, but its use should be individualized with explicit attention to seizure risk factors, careful protocol selection and dosing, and early-session observation, recognizing that evidence for efficacy is mixed across outcomes while the safety profile under guideline-concordant parameters is generally acceptable in appropriately selected stroke survivors [^111ju2co] [^114aiCYz] [^113DLz4z] [^116uMW77].

No, TMS is **not absolutely contraindicated after stroke**, but it should be used with caution and only after careful screening for seizure risk, unstable medical conditions, or intracranial metal. The main concern is **seizure risk**, which is low but higher in stroke patients than the general population. TMS is generally safe and well tolerated in stroke rehabilitation, with most adverse events being mild and transient; however, it should be avoided in patients with a history of seizures, unstable cardiovascular status, or intracranial metal implants [^114aiCYz]. Clinical judgment and individualized risk assessment are essential before initiating TMS in stroke patients.

---

## Safety considerations and potential risks

TMS is generally considered safe for stroke patients, but certain **risks and adverse events** have been reported:

- **Seizures**: The most significant risk associated with TMS is seizure induction. Although rare, the risk is slightly elevated in stroke patients due to underlying brain injury and potential cortical hyperexcitability [^116uMW77].

- **Headaches and scalp discomfort**: Mild headaches and scalp discomfort are common but typically transient and manageable.

- **Transient neurological symptoms**: Temporary neurological symptoms, such as mild cognitive or motor disturbances, have been reported but are generally short-lived.

- **Cardiovascular considerations**: Stroke patients with unstable cardiovascular conditions may be at increased risk during TMS sessions due to potential autonomic fluctuations [^11177n5i].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

While TMS is not absolutely contraindicated after stroke, certain conditions require caution or may preclude its use [^112YEoHX]. A history of seizures or epilepsy is a **relative contraindication** requiring careful risk assessment; unstable cardiovascular conditions are contraindications until stabilized. Intracranial metal implants are contraindicated due to the risk of heating or movement. Severe cognitive impairment warrants caution, as symptoms may be exacerbated. In the acute phase of stroke (within 48 hours), TMS is generally avoided until the patient is stabilized.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus statements provide the following **recommendations** for TMS after stroke:

- **Patient selection**: Careful patient selection and individualized risk assessment are essential before initiating TMS therapy [^115gJTY7].

- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of neurological and cardiovascular status during TMS sessions is recommended.

- **Protocol selection**: Low-frequency TMS protocols (≤ 1 Hz) are generally considered safer and may be preferred in stroke patients, particularly in the subacute phase.

- **Combination with rehabilitation**: TMS is often combined with conventional rehabilitation therapies to enhance functional recovery [^114aiCYz].

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

Several clinical studies have investigated the **safety and efficacy** of TMS in stroke patients:

- **Motor recovery**: TMS has been shown to improve motor function and reduce disability in stroke patients, with minimal adverse events reported [^117LCCD3] [^114rQmpw].

- **Aphasia**: TMS has demonstrated beneficial effects in improving language function in post-stroke aphasia patients, with no significant adverse events reported [^111KjUUU] [^112wu3j1].

- **Depression**: TMS has been effective in treating post-stroke depression, with transient and minor adverse events reported [^113KSEhf] [^1161s9fm].

---

## Summary of evidence

TMS demonstrates **favorable safety and efficacy** across applications, including motor recovery, aphasia, and depression [^113dVZgo] [^115gJTY7].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

TMS is **not absolutely contraindicated** after stroke, but **careful patient selection, an individualized risk assessment, and adherence to clinical guidelines** are essential [^115gJTY7]. The primary concern is **seizure risk**, which is low but slightly higher in stroke patients than in the general population. TMS is generally safe and well tolerated, with most adverse events being mild and transient [^113DLz4z]. Clinicians should exercise caution in patients with a history of seizures, unstable cardiovascular conditions, or intracranial metal implants.

### Safety and behavioral effects of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in stroke [^11177n5i]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

Electromagnetic brain stimulation might have value to reduce motor deficits after stroke. The safety and behavioral effects of higher frequencies of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) require detailed assessment.

- **Methods**: Using an active treatment-only, unblinded, 2-center study design, patients with chronic stroke received 20 minutes of 20 Hz rTMS to the ipsilesional primary motor cortex hand area. Patients were assessed before, during the hour after, and 1 week after rTMS.

- **Results**: The 12 patients were 4.7 ± 4.9 years poststroke (mean ± SD) with moderate-severe arm motor deficits. In terms of safety, rTMS was well tolerated and did not cause new symptoms; systolic blood pressure increased from pre- to immediately post-rTMS by 7 mm Hg (P = 0.043). None of the behavioral measures showed a decrement. In terms of behavioral effects, modest improvements were seen, for example, in grip strength, range of motion, and pegboard performance, up to 1 week after rTMS. The strongest predictor of these motor gains was lower patient age.

- **Conclusions**: A single session of high-frequency rTMS to the motor cortex was safe. These results require verification with the addition of a placebo group and thus blinded assessments across a wide spectrum of poststroke deficits and with larger doses of 20 Hz rTMS.

### Effects and safety of high-frequency rTMS in subacute ischemic stroke patients [^111ju2co]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2024). High credibility.

Although high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) has shown benefits in chronic stroke, its application in subacute ischemic stroke remains underexplored. This study aims to investigate the effects and safety of lesion-side HF-rTMS in subacute ischemic stroke.

- **Methods**: Prospective lesion-side HF-rTMS was conducted on consecutive ischemic stroke patients within 3 days of onset from February 2019 to June 2022. Inclusion criteria required persistent paralysis (NIHSS score ≥ 1 for at least 7 days). Exclusion criteria comprised cortical infarction, disturbance of consciousness, and age over 80 years. A conventional rehabilitation group meeting the same criteria from June 2015 to January 2019 served as a comparison. We compared the two groups regarding clinical background and outcome. We also evaluated the incidence of epilepsy and exacerbation of the NIHSS score in the rTMS group.

- **Results**: Seventy-eight patients participated, with 50% in the HF-rTMS group. Median time from onset to HF-rTMS initiation was 9 (IQR 7–12) days. A favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0–2) at 3 months was more frequent in the rTMS group (80% vs. 44%, p = 0.002). HF-rTMS was independently associated with a favorable outcome at 3 months (OR = 5.60, 95% CI = 1.53–20.50, p = 0.009). No cases of epilepsy or exacerbation of NIHSS score were observed.

HF-rTMS demonstrates potential effectiveness and safety in subacute ischemic stroke patients.

### Randomized sham-controlled trial of navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for motor recovery in stroke [^114aiCYz]. Stroke (2018). High credibility.

We aimed to determine whether low-frequency electric field navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the noninjured motor cortex, versus sham rTMS avoiding the motor cortex, could improve arm motor function in hemiplegic stroke patients when combined with motor training.

Twelve outpatient US rehabilitation centers enrolled participants between May 2014 and December 2015. We delivered 1 Hz active or sham rTMS to the noninjured motor cortex before each of eighteen 60-minute therapy sessions over a 6-week period, with outcomes measured at 1 week, and at 1, 3, and 6 months after the end of treatment.

- **Primary end point**: The percentage of participants improving ≥ 5 points on the upper extremity Fugl-Meyer score 6 months after the end of treatment.
- **Secondary analyses**: Changes on the upper extremity Fugl-Meyer, Action Research Arm Test, Wolf Motor Function Test, and safety.

Results showed that of the 199 participants, 167 completed treatment and follow-up due to early discontinuation of data collection. Upper extremity Fugl-Meyer gains were significant for both the experimental group (P < 0.001) and the sham group (P < 0.001). Sixty-seven percent of the experimental group (95% CI, 58%-75%) and 65% of the sham group (95% CI, 52%-76%) improved ≥ 5 points on the 6-month upper extremity Fugl-Meyer score (P = 0.76). There was also no difference between the experimental and sham groups in the Action Research Arm Test (P = 0.80) or the Wolf Motor Function Test (P = 0.55). A total of 26 serious adverse events occurred in 18 patients.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for improving function after stroke [^116vrifA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

It had been assumed that suppressing the undamaged contralesional motor cortex by repetitive low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or increasing the excitability of the damaged hemisphere cortex by high-frequency rTMS will promote function recovery after stroke.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and safety of rTMS for improving function in people with stroke.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (April 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 4), the Chinese Stroke Trials Register (April 2012), MEDLINE (1950 to May 2012), EMBASE (1980 to May 2012), Science Citation Index (1981 to April 2012), Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (1990 to April 2012), CINAHL (1982 to May 2012), AMED (1985 to May 2012), PEDro (April 2012), REHABDATA (April 2012), and CIRRIE Database of International Rehabilitation Research (April 2012). In addition, we searched five Chinese databases, ongoing trials registers, and relevant reference lists.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials comparing rTMS therapy with sham therapy or no therapy. We excluded trials that reported only laboratory parameters.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality, and extracted the data. We resolved disagreements by discussion.

- **Main results**: We included 19 trials involving a total of 588 participants in this review. Two heterogeneous trials with a total of 183 participants showed that rTMS treatment was not effective.

### Can transcranial direct current stimulation enhance poststroke motor recovery? Development of a theoretical patient-tailored model [^115UG7go]. Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

New treatments that can facilitate neural repair and reduce persistent impairments hold significant value in promoting recovery following a stroke. One technique that has gained interest is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), as early research suggested it could enhance plasticity and enable greater behavioral recovery. However, several studies have identified substantial intersubject variability in response to tDCS, and clinical trials revealed insufficient evidence of treatment effectiveness.

A possible explanation for the varied and negative findings is that the physiologic model of stroke recovery used to guide the application of tDCS-based treatments is overly simplistic. It does not account for stroke heterogeneity or known determinants affecting the tDCS response. Here, we propose that tDCS could have a more clearly beneficial role in enhancing stroke recovery if greater consideration is given to individualizing treatment. By critically reviewing the proposed mechanisms of tDCS, stroke physiology across the recovery continuum, and known determinants of the tDCS response, we propose a new, theoretical, patient-tailored approach to delivering tDCS following a stroke.

The proposed model includes a step-by-step principled selection strategy for identifying optimal neuromodulation targets and outlines key areas for further investigation. Tailoring tDCS treatment to individual neuroanatomy and physiology is likely our best chance at producing robust and meaningful clinical benefits for people with strokes, thereby accelerating opportunities for recovery.

### Electric field navigated 1-Hz rTMS for poststroke motor recovery: The E-FIT randomized controlled trial [^113DLz4z]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

To determine if low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation targeting the primary motor cortex contralateral (M1 CL) to the affected corticospinal tract in patients with hemiparetic stroke augments intensive training-related clinical improvement, an extension of the NICHE trial (navigated inhibitory rTMS to contralesional hemisphere trial) using an alternative sham coil was conducted.

- **Methods**: The present E-FIT trial (electric field navigated 1Hz rTMS for post-stroke motor recovery trial) included 5 of 12 NICHE trial outpatient US rehabilitation centers. The stimulation protocol remained identical (1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, M1 CL, preceding 60-minute therapy, 18 sessions/6 weeks; parallel arm randomized clinical trial). The sham coil appearance mimicked the active coil but without the weak electric field in the NICHE trial sham coil. Outcomes measured 1 week, and 1, 3, and 6 months after the end of treatment included upper extremity Fugl-Meyer (primary, 6 months after end of treatment), Action Research Arm Test, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, quality of life (EQ-5D), and safety.

- **Results**: Of 60 participants randomized, 58 completed treatment and were included for analysis. Bayesian analysis of combined data from the E-FIT and the NICHE trials indicated that active treatment was not superior to sham at the primary end point (posterior mean odds ratio of 1.94 [96% credible interval of 0.61–4.80]). For the E-FIT intent-to-treat population, upper extremity Fugl-Meyer improvement ≥ 5 pts occurred in 60% (18/30).

### Evidence of rTMS for motor or cognitive stroke recovery: Hype or hope [^113dVZgo]. Stroke (2023). Low credibility.

Evidence of the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for stroke recovery is hampered by an unexplained variability of reported effect sizes and an insufficient understanding of mechanisms of action. We aimed to (1) briefly summarize evidence of efficacy, (2) identify critical factors to explain the reported variation in effects, and (3) provide mechanism-based recommendations for future trials.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic review of the literature according to Cochrane and PRISMA protocols. We included trials with ≥ 10 patients per treatment group and classified outcome measures according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health. Meta-analysis was conducted when at least three trials were reported on the same construct. In cases of significant summary effect sizes with significant heterogeneity, we used sensitivity analyses to test for correlations and differences between found individual effect sizes and possible effect modifiers, such as patient characteristics, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation attributes, and trial characteristics.

- **Results**: We included 57 articles (N = 2595). Funnel plots showed no publication bias. We found significant effect sizes at the level of body function (upper limb synergies, muscle strength, language functioning, global cognitive functioning, visual/spatial inattention) with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation within or beyond three months after stroke. We also found significant effect sizes at the level of activities. We found no subgroup differences or significant correlations between individual effect sizes and potential effect modifiers.

### A wearable repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation device [^116uMW77]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

For medical safety, we have taken the following measures:

1. The patients are not allowed to change the stimulation parameters of the rTMS-tiny by themselves. These parameters, including pulse intensity, pulse frequency, and number of pulses, are set through software permission settings, and one device is bound to one patient (via fingerprint, password, etc), allowing only the physician to set it based on that patient's resting state motor threshold (RMT), according to the latest IFCN rTMS safety guidelines.

2. For patients without a history of epilepsy, the probability of seizures is extremely low when rTMS is modulated using the IFCN-recommended dosages, and the technology can largely be considered safe. Over 62% of seizures occurred on the first exposure to TMS, and 75% occurred within the first three exposures. Therefore, we will set the parameters in-hospital and perform the first treatment to expose seizure-prone patients, dramatically reducing the probability of developing seizures outside the hospital.

3. An adult with proper training must be present for rTMS treatment, and to avert emergencies, we have incorporated a "one-button alarm" feature in the device's companion software, enabling patients to swiftly reach the local emergency medical service team via a single action.

The future success of wearable rTMS devices will depend on collaborative efforts between clinicians, engineers, and regulatory agencies to establish standardized protocols and ensure safe, effective, and user-friendly designs. These considerations underscore the importance of balancing technology development with patient safety and regulatory compliance.

### Using transcranial magnetic stimulation of the undamaged brain to identify lesion sites that predict language outcome after stroke [^111JEsMD]. Brain (2017). Low credibility.

Regions of interest from data-driven analyses were defined to account for phonological impairments based on whether there was damage to specific areas. Four types of regions were generated:

- **TMS-guided regions**: These were based on two different loci of maximal overlap (LOMs) from patients in Sample 1. One region was for patients with phonological impairments following above-threshold damage to the 0.5 cm³ TMS supramarginal gyrus (SMG) region, and another for those with impairments following damage to the 0.5 cm³ TMS pars opercularis (pOp) region. The new TMS-guided regions included both grey and white matter around the original TMS sites that were consistently damaged in the LOMs. For the pOp region, the new area extended to 20.6 cm³ and was 100% damaged in 12 out of 13 patients with lesions to the original TMS pOp region and phonological impairments. For the SMG region, the new area extended to 24.9 cm³ and was at least 85% damaged in 11 out of 12 patients with lesions to the original TMS SMG region and phonological impairments.

- **Functional MRI-guided regions**: These were identified similarly to the TMS-guided regions. The only difference was that the regions were based on patients with damage to spherical regions of interest centered on the mean functional MRI coordinates (−52, 6, 20 for pOp and −51, −32, 42 for SMG) from Sample 1.

### Evidence for interhemispheric imbalance in stroke patients as revealed by combining transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography [^112qNfpj]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Low credibility.

So far, TMS studies investigating interhemispheric dynamics following a stroke event have succeeded in testing only a minority of patients with recordable MEPs, leading to variable results. In our corticospinal evaluation, more than 70% of our sample of patients did not show a stable and sufficiently large MEP for the evaluation of IHI nor for the intracortical circuits from the AH. Although this might seem surprising, such a high percentage of cases with no recordable MEPs is due to recruiting patients with hemiparesis caused by subcortical or cortical lesions in the territory of the middle cerebral artery. Previously, TMS studies had to focus mostly on milder subcortical stroke patients with a recordable MEP. On the other hand, by using TMS-EEG, we were able to collect stable measures from both hemispheres of all patients. Importantly, although a statistical trend can be observed (p = 0.07), the cortical activation of the AH and UH, when directly stimulated, did not differ, aligning with previous studies. On the other hand, as previously observed, cortical activity of both hemispheres in stroke patients was generally lower compared to HC, likely due to altered excitability in the stimulated neuronal populations and in their cortico-cortical connections.

### Cortical activation changes underlying stimulation-induced behavioural gains in chronic stroke [^111fpenF]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Transcranial direct stimulation, a form of non-invasive brain stimulation, is showing increasing promise as an adjunct therapy in rehabilitation following stroke. However, although significant behavioural improvements have been reported in proof-of-principle studies, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. The rationale for transcranial direct stimulation as therapy for stroke is that therapeutic stimulation paradigms increase activity in ipsilesional motor cortical areas, but this has not previously been directly tested for conventional electrode placements. This study was performed to test directly whether increases in ipsilesional cortical activation with transcranial direct stimulation are associated with behavioural improvements in chronic stroke patients.

Patients at least 6 months post-first stroke participated in a behavioural experiment (n = 13) or a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment (n = 11), each investigating the effects of three stimulation conditions in separate sessions: anodal stimulation to the ipsilesional hemisphere; cathodal stimulation to the contralesional hemisphere; and sham stimulation. Anodal (facilitatory) stimulation to the ipsilesional hemisphere led to significant improvements (5–10%) in response times with the affected hand in both experiments. This improvement was associated with an increase in movement-related cortical activity in the stimulated primary motor cortex and functionally interconnected regions. Cathodal (inhibitory) stimulation to the contralesional hemisphere led to a functional im.

### Evidence for interhemispheric imbalance in stroke patients as revealed by combining transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography [^116d1Ps7]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Low credibility.

Local and global transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked cortical response was studied after stimulation of both the affected hemisphere (AH) and unaffected hemisphere (UH) in stroke patients, as well as in healthy controls (HC).

- **Stroke patients**:
	- **Local cortical response**: Displayed in terms of TMS-evoked activity and cortical oscillations evoked over primary motor cortices (M1).
	- **Global cortical response**: Displayed in terms of TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) recorded over the entire scalp, with scalp voltage distribution at three main peaks of activity (20–40 ms, 40–70 ms, and 70–150 ms).

- **Healthy controls**:
	- **Local cortical response**: Displayed in terms of TMS-evoked activity and cortical oscillations evoked over M1.
	- **Global cortical response**: Displayed similarly, with TEPs recorded over the entire scalp and corresponding voltage distribution at the same peaks of activity (20–40 ms, 40–70 ms, and 70–150 ms).

These observations provide insights into interhemispheric imbalance in stroke patients as revealed by TMS combined with electroencephalography (EEG).

### Hand function improvement with low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the unaffected hemisphere in a severe case of stroke [^1177QHXn]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

Previous research has shown that low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the unaffected hemisphere can improve motor function in acute and chronic stroke patients. However, these studies only investigated patients with mild or moderate motor deficits.

We report a case of a stroke patient with severe motor impairment who underwent sham and active rTMS of the unaffected hemisphere and had significantly improved motor function after active, but not after sham, stimulation of the unaffected primary motor cortex. In an additional session of active rTMS, this patient maintained and further enhanced the initial motor improvement.

This case report shows that inhibitory rTMS of the unaffected hemisphere can also be beneficial for stroke patients with severe motor deficits and suggests that this approach of noninvasive brain stimulation should be further investigated in this population of patients.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for acute ischemic stroke, particularly concerning indications for thrombectomy (0–6 hours from onset), the AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend performing direct aspiration thrombectomy as first-pass mechanical thrombectomy. This approach is considered noninferior to using a stent retriever in patients meeting all the outlined criteria.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation as a therapy for post-stroke dysphagia: An overview of systematic reviews and meta-analysis [^113CVcsD]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2024). Low credibility.

Post-stroke dysphagia is a common swallowing disorder that occurs following a stroke, leading to an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia and malnutrition. There is a pressing need for effective and safe interventions for its rehabilitation. This review aims to answer two key scientific questions: (1) What is the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the rehabilitation of post-stroke dysphagia? (2) Is repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation a safe intervention for post-stroke dysphagia?

A comprehensive search was conducted across four electronic databases: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase. The search aimed to identify relevant studies concerning our topic of interest and was completed on 28 May 2024.

In accordance with the PRISMA checklist, a comprehensive search of four databases was conducted, which identified 13 relevant systematic reviews. The inclusion criteria were systematic reviews that evaluated the efficacy and safety of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for post-stroke dysphagia. Exclusion criteria were reviews that did not focus on post-stroke dysphagia or did not evaluate repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation as a therapeutic intervention. The quality, bias, reporting, and overall evidence quality of these reviews were assessed using validated tools, including the AMSTAR 2 tool for assessing the methodological quality of systematic reviews, the ROBIS tool for assessing the risk of bias, and the GRADE approach for evaluating the overall quality of evidence.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

The American Heart Association and American Stroke Association 2019 guidelines offer specific recommendations regarding therapeutic procedures for acute ischemic stroke, particularly focusing on technical considerations for thrombectomy. They advise maintaining blood pressure at ≤ 180/105 mmHg during mechanical thrombectomy and for 24 hours afterward. Additionally, for patients who achieve successful reperfusion through mechanical thrombectomy, it is recommended to maintain blood pressure at < 180/105 mmHg.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with multimodality aphasia therapy for chronic poststroke aphasia: A randomized clinical trial [^112wu3j1]. Neurology (2025). High credibility.

- **Results**:

- **Recruitment and retention**: We screened 97 potential participants for eligibility between May 2021 and May 2023, with follow-up completed in August 2023. Of those, 44 eligible participants consented to the trial and were randomized (Figure 1). One participant in the rTMS group withdrew before starting the intervention, and one participant from each group was lost to follow-up at the 15-week interval. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The average age at intervention was 63.4 years (SD = 12.3), and the mean time since stroke was 4.0 years (SD = 3.7). Groups were broadly similar at baseline, although the rTMS group was more fluent compared to the sham, as measured by the WAB bedside test. In addition, lesion volumes and locations were similar between groups (Figure 2).

### Transcranial direct current stimulation facilitates motor learning post-stroke: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1154dp4c]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS) is an attractive protocol for stroke motor recovery. The systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the effects of tDCS on motor learning post-stroke. Specifically, we determined long-term learning effects by examining motor improvements from baseline to at least five days after tDCS intervention and motor practice. Seventeen studies reported long-term retention testing (mean retention interval = 43.8 days; SD = 56.6 days) and qualified for inclusion in our meta-analysis.

Assessing primary outcome measures for groups that received tDCS and motor practice versus sham control groups created 21 valid comparisons:

- **Clinical assessments**: Sixteen clinical assessments were analyzed.
- **Motor skill acquisition tests**: Five motor skill acquisition tests were conducted.

A random effects model meta-analysis showed a significant overall effect size of 0.59 (p < 0.0001; low heterogeneity, T(2) = 0.04; I(2) = 22.75%; and high classic fail-safe N = 240).

Four moderator variable analyses revealed beneficial effects of tDCS on long-term motor learning:

- **Stimulation protocols**: Anodal on the ipsilesional hemisphere, cathodal on the contralesional hemisphere, or bilateral.
- **Recovery stage**: Subacute or chronic stroke.
- **Stimulation timing**: tDCS before or during motor practice.
- **Training protocols**: Task-specific training or conventional rehabilitation protocols.

This robust meta-analysis identified novel long-term motor learning effects with tDCS and motor practice post-stroke.

### Brain responsivity provides an individual readout for motor recovery after stroke [^111Cjyyi]. Brain (2020). Low credibility.

Evaluating transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked electroencephalography (EEG) responses in stroke patients within the first two weeks post-stroke revealed mainly two starkly different natures of response morphologies triggered by TMS (Figure 1). In the majority of patients, i.e. 21, TMS elicited a differentiated and sustained EEG response with a sequence of positive and negative deflections in both hemispheres. This persisted up to 300 ms post-stimulus and was associated with rapidly changing patterns of bi-hemispheric activation, comparable to the response observed in the healthy comparison group. By contrast, in a subgroup of seven severely affected patients, TMS over the affected M1 evoked a slow, strongly simplified, and biphasic response with high amplitudes. This large wave lasted approximately 100 ms, and further TMS-locked activity was almost absent. In addition, evoked activity remained localized under the site of stimulation over ipsilesional M1. The complete elimination of the characteristic transcranial evoked potentials (TEP) components of healthy subjects hindered the classification of specific components. Henceforth, we refer to an early response lasting 100 ms and a later response phase.

These different patterns of TMS-EEG responses, i.e. simple biphasic and more differentiated patterns, could also be identified in the subgroup of patients with no evocable motor evoked potentials (MEPs) (Figure 2). Thus, TMS-EEG is capable of disclosing differential motor cortex properties in patients with no residual motor function and severely disrupted corticospinal integrity.

### Reliability of TMS motor evoked potentials in quadriceps of subjects with chronic hemiparesis after stroke [^1149V35c]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) non-invasively measures the excitability of central motor pathways in humans and is used to characterize neuroplasticity after stroke. Using TMS to index lower extremity neuroplasticity after gait rehabilitation requires test-retest reliability. This study assesses the reliability of TMS-derived variables measured at the bilateral quadriceps of chronic hemiparetic stroke survivors. Results support using measures of both paretic and nonparetic motor threshold and motor evoked potential (MEP) latencies, as well as nonparetic MEP amplitudes. Implications for longitudinal research are discussed.

### A sham-controlled trial of a 5-day course of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of the unaffected hemisphere in stroke patients [^113yrmMi]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

It has been recently shown that a single session of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the unaffected hemisphere can improve motor function in stroke patients; however, this improvement is short-lasting. We therefore conducted a randomized, sham-controlled, phase II trial to evaluate whether five sessions of low-frequency rTMS can increase the magnitude and duration of these effects and whether this approach is safe.

- **Methods**: Fifteen patients with chronic stroke were randomized to receive active or sham rTMS of the unaffected hemisphere. A blinded rater assessed motor function and corticospinal excitability at baseline, during, and after 2 weeks of treatment. Safety was assessed using a neuropsychological battery and electroencephalogram.

- **Results**: Active rTMS resulted in a significant improvement in the motor function performance of the affected hand that lasted for 2 weeks. These effects were not observed in the sham rTMS group (affected and unaffected hand) and in the unaffected hand in the active rTMS group. Corticospinal excitability decreased in the stimulated, unaffected hemisphere and increased in the affected hemisphere. There was a significant correlation between motor function improvement and corticospinal excitability change in the affected hemisphere. Cognitive performance and electroencephalogram were not changed significantly throughout the trial in both groups of treatment.

- **Conclusions**: These results support and extend the findings of previous studies on rTMS in stroke patients because five consecutive sessions of rTMS have shown a sustained improvement in motor function.

### Neurostimulation for treatment of post-stroke impairments [^115gJTY7]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Neurostimulation, the use of electrical stimulation to modulate the activity of the nervous system, is now commonly used for the treatment of chronic pain, movement disorders, and epilepsy. Many neurostimulation techniques have shown promise for treating physical impairments in people with stroke. In 2021, vagus nerve stimulation was approved by the FDA as an adjunct to intensive rehabilitation therapy for chronic upper extremity deficits after ischemic stroke. In 2024, pharyngeal electrical stimulation was conditionally approved by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for neurogenic dysphagia in people with stroke who have a tracheostomy. Many other approaches have been tested in pivotal device trials, and a number of methods are in early-phase study.

Typically, neurostimulation techniques aim to increase neuroplasticity in response to training and rehabilitation, although the putative mechanisms of action differ and are not fully understood. Neurostimulation techniques offer practical advantages for use after stroke, such as precise dosing and timing, but can be invasive and costly to implement. This review focuses on neurostimulation techniques that are now in clinical use or have reached the stage of pivotal trials, showing significant promise for the treatment of post-stroke impairments.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation in mild to severe hemiparesis early after stroke: a proof of principle and novel approach to improve motor function [^112qxk8h]. Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the unaffected hemisphere can enhance the function of the paretic hand in patients with mild motor impairment. However, the effects of low-frequency rTMS applied to the contralesional motor cortex at an early stage of mild to severe hemiparesis after stroke remain unknown. In this pilot, randomized, double-blind clinical trial, we compared the effects of low-frequency rTMS or sham rTMS as add-on therapies to outpatient customary rehabilitation in 30 patients with mild to severe hand paresis, within 5–45 days after ischemic stroke.

The primary feasibility outcome was compliance with the interventions, while the primary safety outcome was the proportion of intervention-related adverse events. Performance of the paretic hand in the Jebsen-Taylor test and pinch strength were secondary outcomes. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, after ten treatment sessions administered over two weeks, and at one month post-treatment.

Baseline clinical features were comparable across groups. Regarding the primary feasibility outcome, compliance with treatment was 100% in the active group and 94% in the sham group. No serious intervention-related adverse events were reported. There were significant improvements in performance in the Jebsen-Taylor test (mean, 12.3% increase one month after treatment) and pinch force (mean improvement of 0.5 Newtons) in the active group, but not in the sham group. Thus, low-frequency rTMS to the contralesional motor cortex early after stroke appears feasible, safe, and potentially effective in improving the function of the paretic hand in patients with mild to severe hemiparesis.

### Early intervention with electrical stimulation reduces neural damage after stroke in non-human primates [^1178TUH9]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Mechanisms of stimulation-induced neuroprotection

An hour following stroke induction, we applied repeated electrical stimulation directly adjacent to the lesion on the ipsilesional cortex. The stimulation train consists of 5 Hz bursts of biphasic pulses, similar to the theta burst stimulation (TBS) pattern of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols that are widely adopted in the clinic. However, one major difference is that our stimulation paradigm used five pulses at 1 kHz, in contrast to the three 50–100 Hz pulses per burst used in traditional TBS protocol. Stimulation via high-frequency pulses greater than about 200 Hz has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on neuronal firing rates.

While there are many possible mechanisms of action underlying this inhibitory effect, it is likely that these high-frequency pulses contribute to re-hyperpolarization or generate a transient reduction of excitatory currents in the stimulated neurons, thereby decreasing the excitability and firing rates of postsynaptic cells. Given that our ECoG recordings showed decreasing gamma power during and after stimulation, and that gamma activity in ECoG has been shown to correlate with neuronal firing, it is likely that applying theta bursts of electrical stimulation on the cortex suppressed peri-infarct neural activity and network excitability through similar mechanisms. It is important to note that high-frequency band power reflects synchronized firing of neuronal populations and has been associated with both synaptic activity and action potential generation.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on motor recovery for patients with stroke: A PRISMA compliant systematic review and meta-analysis [^117LCCD3]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2020). Low credibility.

A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to determine the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in recovering motor function in patients with stroke.

- **Design**: A comprehensive literature search was performed to identify studies published before September 20, 2018. Electronic databases were searched. Standard mean differences and 95% confidence intervals were used to evaluate the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. The stability and sensitivity of the results and sources of heterogeneity were also analyzed. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was used to determine the quality of the studies.

- **Results**: Twenty randomized controlled trials (N = 841 patients) were included. The results showed that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is beneficial to patients with post-stroke hemiplegia, as demonstrated by the following four scales: the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (standard mean difference = 0.635, 95% confidence interval = 0.421 to 0.848); grip strength (standard mean difference = 1.147, 95% confidence interval = 0.761 to 1.534); Barthel Index (standard mean difference = 0.580, 95% confidence interval = 0.377 to 0.783); and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (standard mean difference = -0.555, 95% confidence interval = -0.813 to -0.298). Few adverse events were observed.

- **Conclusions**: The analysis showed that low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has a positive effect on grip strength and lower limb function as assessed by FMA.

### Electric field navigated 1-Hz rTMS for poststroke motor recovery: The E-FIT randomized controlled trial [^117JkEZP]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

To determine if low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation targeting the primary motor cortex contralateral (M1 CL) to the affected corticospinal tract in patients with hemiparetic stroke augments intensive training-related clinical improvement, the E-FIT trial serves as an extension of the NICHE trial (Navigated Inhibitory rTMS to Contralesional Hemisphere Trial) using an alternative sham coil.

- **Methods**: The present E-FIT trial (Electric Field Navigated 1Hz rTMS for Post-stroke Motor Recovery Trial) included 5 of 12 NICHE trial outpatient US rehabilitation centers. The stimulation protocol remained identical (1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, M1 CL, preceding 60-minute therapy, 18 sessions/6 weeks), and it was a parallel arm randomized clinical trial. The sham coil appearance mimicked the active coil but without the weak electric field in the NICHE trial sham coil. Outcomes were measured 1 week, and 1, 3, and 6 months after the end of treatment and included the following: upper extremity Fugl-Meyer (primary, 6 months after end of treatment), Action Research Arm Test, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, quality of life (EQ-5D), and safety.

- **Results**: Of 60 participants randomized, 58 completed treatment and were included for analysis. Bayesian analysis of combined data from the E-FIT and the NICHE trials indicated that active treatment was not superior to sham at the primary endpoint (posterior mean odds ratio of 1.94 [96% credible interval of 0.61–4.80]). For the E-FIT intent-to-treat population, upper extremity Fugl-Meyer improvement ≥ 5 points occurred in 60% (18/30).

### Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for improving activities of daily living, and physical and cognitive functioning, in people after stroke [^116p3Xdu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Functional impairment, resulting in poor performance in activities of daily living (ADL) among stroke survivors, is common. Rehabilitation approaches have limited effectiveness in improving ADL performance, function, muscle strength, and cognitive abilities, including spatial neglect, after stroke, with improving cognition being the number one research priority in this field. A possible adjunct to stroke rehabilitation might be non-invasive brain stimulation by transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS) to modulate cortical excitability and, hence, to improve these outcomes in people after stroke.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of tDCS on ADL, arm and leg function, muscle strength, and cognitive abilities (including spatial neglect), as well as dropouts and adverse events in people after stroke.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and seven other databases in January 2019. In an effort to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing trials, we also searched trials registers and reference lists, hand-searched conference proceedings, and contacted authors and equipment manufacturers.

- **Selection criteria**: This is the update of an existing review. In the previous version of this review, we focused on the effects of tDCS on ADL and function. In this update, we broadened our inclusion criteria to compare any kind of active tDCS for improving ADL, function, muscle strength, and cognitive abilities (including spatial neglect) versus any kind.

### Safety and efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation in addition to constraint-induced movement therapy for post-stroke motor recovery (TRANSPORT2): a phase 2, multicentre, randomised, sham-controlled triple-blind trial [^117Pv35L]. The Lancet. Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Motor impairments contribute substantially to long-term disability following stroke. Studies of transcranial direct stimulation (tDCS), combined with various rehabilitation therapies, have shown promising results in reducing motor impairment. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three doses of tDCS in combination with modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT) in individuals who experienced their first ischemic stroke in the preceding 1–6 months.

- **Methods**: We conducted a phase 2, multicentre, randomised, triple-blind, sham-controlled study with a blinded centrally scored primary outcome. The trial was conducted at 15 medical centres in the United States. Eligible participants were enrolled between 1 month and 6 months after their first ischemic stroke. Inclusion criteria required participants to have a persistent motor deficit, defined as a Fugl-Meyer Upper-Extremity (FM-UE) score of 54 or lower (out of 66), and two consecutive baseline visits (separated by 7–14 days) with an absolute difference of 2 or fewer points on the FM-UE scale. Participants were randomly assigned to treatment groups by an adaptive randomisation algorithm hosted on the TRANSPORT2 WebDCU study website. Participants received either sham, 2 mA, or 4 mA of bi-hemispheric tDCS for the first 30 minutes and mCIMT with 120 minutes of active therapy time per session, administered over ten sessions during a 2-week period. The primary endpoint was the change in FM-UE score from baseline to day 15, which was analysed in all participants who have data both at baseline and post-baseline.

### Noninvasive neuromodulation combined with rehabilitation therapy improves balance and gait speed in patients with stroke: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114rQmpw]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2024). High credibility.

This study aimed to determine how repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct stimulation, and cranial nerve noninvasive neuromodulation affect functional balance, gait speed, and walking cadence in stroke patients.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Scopus (June 22, 2022) for randomized controlled trials. Three reviewers independently performed data extraction and assessed the risk of bias. Network and pairwise meta-analyses were conducted to assess indirect and direct comparisons.

- **Results**: We included 34 studies (N = 915 patients). Sixty percent had moderate-to-high methodological quality. The meta-analyses showed positive effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with rehabilitation therapy compared with sham on gait speed, walking cadence, and balance function with weighted mean differences and 95% confidence intervals of 0.08 (0.03 to 0.13), 7.16 (3.217 to 11.103), and 3.05 (0.52 to 5.57), respectively. Transcranial direct stimulation showed improvement on the time up and go test (-0.88 [-1.68 to -0.08]). From the surface under the cumulative ranking analyses, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is the best-ranked treatment for gait speed and functional balance improvement compared with transcranial direct stimulation and sham interventions. There were not enough studies to include cranial nerve noninvasive neuromodulation in the meta-analysis.

- **Conclusions**: Walking cadence and speed, as well as functional balance, significantly improved after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation.

### The test-retest reliability of non-navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measures of corticospinal pathway excitability early after stroke [^1173FcBY]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2024). Low credibility.

Motor evoked potential (MEP) characteristics are potential biomarkers of whether rehabilitation interventions drive motor recovery after stroke. However, the test-retest reliability of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measurements in sub-acute stroke remains unclear. This study aims to determine the test-retest reliability of upper limb MEP measures elicited by non-neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation in sub-acute stroke.

In two identical data collection sessions, 1–3 days apart, TMS measures assessed motor threshold (MT), amplitude, latency (MEP-L), silent period (SP), and recruitment curve slope in the biceps brachii (BB), extensor carpi radialis (ECR), and abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscles of paretic and non-paretic upper limbs. Test-retest reliability was calculated using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Acceptable reliability was set at a lower 95% CI of 0.70 or above. The limits of agreement (LOA) and smallest detectable change (SDC) were calculated.

Thirty participants with sub-acute stroke were included (average 36 days post-stroke). Reliability was variable, ranging from poor to good for different MEP characteristics. The SDC values differed across muscles and MEP characteristics in both paretic and less paretic limbs.

The present findings indicate there is limited evidence for acceptable test-retest reliability of non-navigated TMS outcomes when using the appropriate 95% CI for ICC, SDC, and LOA values.

Controlled Trials: ISRCTN 19090862.

### Does repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation have a beneficial effect on improving unilateral spatial neglect caused by stroke? A meta-analysis [^111s56rG]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Data extraction

Endnote version 21 was used to manage the citations. The extracted data included the first author, publication year, number of participants, mean age, sex, nature of lesion, stroke duration, treatment protocol, combined intervention, class of studies, outcome measures, pre- and post-treatment means, mean change score, and standard deviations for outcome measures.

All included studies were classified into four classes based on the criteria used in the clinical guideline by Lefaucheur et al. If the mean and SD were not provided in the study but the median and range of the score were available, this formulation was used: mean = (a + 2m + b)/4 (where a is the smallest value, b is the largest value, and m is the median); the standard deviation was calculated using the interquartile range/4.

Quality and risk-of-bias assessment

The PEDro scale was used to evaluate the reporting quality of the methodology. The scale consists of 11 items, with the first item assessing the external validity of a study and the remaining items assessing internal validity. The PEDro scale was scored from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating higher research quality. A total score falling within the range of zero to three indicates low methodological quality, while a score of four to five accounts for moderate quality. When the score is between six and eight, the quality is considered good. A score of nine or ten suggests excellent quality. Two authors (RL and LZ) independently rated the PEDro scores for each study, and any disagreements were resolved through discussion with a senior reviewer.

Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Functional impairment, resulting in poor performance in activities of daily living (ADLs) among stroke survivors, is common.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation for post-operative neurorehabilitation in neuro-oncology: A review of the literature and future directions [^117EdfKn]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a neuromodulation technology capable of targeted stimulation and inhibition of cortical areas. Repetitive TMS (rTMS) has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of several neuropsychiatric disorders, and novel uses of rTMS for neurorehabilitation in patients with acute and chronic neurologic deficits are being investigated. However, studies at the time of writing have primarily focused on neurorehabilitation in stroke patients, with little data supporting its use for neurorehabilitation in brain tumor patients.

- **Methods**: We performed a review of the available literature regarding uses of rTMS for neurorehabilitation in post-operative neuro-oncologic patients.

- **Results**: Data have demonstrated that rTMS is safe in the post-operative neuro-oncologic patient population, with minimal adverse effects and no documented seizures. The evidence also demonstrates potential effectiveness in terms of neurorehabilitation of motor and language deficits.

- **Conclusions**: Although data are overall limited, both safety and effectiveness have been demonstrated for the use of rTMS for neurorehabilitation in the neuro-oncologic population. More randomized controlled trials and specific comparisons of contralateral versus ipsilateral rTMS protocols should be explored. Further work may also focus on individualized, patient-specific TMS treatment protocols for optimal functional recovery.

### Brain responsivity provides an individual readout for motor recovery after stroke [^113AjnyH]. Brain (2020). Low credibility.

Finally, TMS-EEG enriches the methodological repertoire in the assessment of stroke patients as it relies less on the participant's ability to understand and comply with instructions, nor does it involve the processing of sensory stimuli or performing an action, which is needed in particular for task functional MRI studies. TMS-EEG, therefore, allows for a standardized assessment of stroke patients and holds the potential to provide novel markers of stroke pathophysiology with practical implications concerning the assessment, monitoring, and potentially also the enhancement of rehabilitation. In this vein, it may also offer a personalized readout for targeting and titrating interventions such as neuromodulation that aim at restoring connectivity and complex patterns of activity.

### Brain responsivity provides an individual readout for motor recovery after stroke [^112FLTYH]. Brain (2020). Low credibility.

An innovative approach assessing motor system integrity combines transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG). This combination enables researchers not only to study the immediate TMS-induced neural response at the stimulation site but also to characterize network effects due to the propagation of induced activity to distant brain regions functionally connected to the stimulation site. TMS-evoked EEG potentials (TEPs), the cortical response to TMS, provide a read-out of neuronal properties in lesioned motor regions while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the entire functional system.

TMS-EEG additionally holds a range of advantages compared to conventional methods of TMS or functional MRI. By transcranially exciting a cortical region and directly recording its response, TMS-EEG neither relies on the integrity of peripheral pathways nor on the ability to perform a behavioral response. These properties render TMS-EEG particularly useful in stroke patients, especially in severely affected or plegic patients.

To elucidate the potential of TMS-EEG in the recovery of motor function after stroke, we used neuronavigated TMS in combination with high-density EEG to measure the brain responses of the ipsilesional M1 in 28 first-ever ischemic stroke patients with unilateral mild-to-severe motor deficits in the early subacute stage (< 2 weeks post-stroke). Furthermore, we reassessed 25 patients between more than 3 and 6 months post-stroke. Importantly, concerning translation, patients presented with a broad spectrum of different lesion locations, ranging from the brainstem to cortical areas.

### Brain responsivity provides an individual readout for motor recovery after stroke [^111pHLW6]. Brain (2020). Low credibility.

Stroke is associated with a large and simple early TMS-EEG response. To quantify the differences between healthy participants and patients, as well as within patient subgroups (mild, moderate, severe), we first compared the LMFP of the TMS-EEG response for the stimulated ipsilesional motor region addressing the characteristics of high amplitudes. We found a statistically significant difference with larger EEG responses in stroke patients compared to healthy controls [main effect Group: F (1,38) = 6.64, P = 0.014]. Moreover, repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant interaction effect involving the factor time period (two levels: 10–100 ms, 100–200 ms) × group (two levels: patients, controls) [F (1,76) = 7.01, P = 0.002]. Post hoc t-tests disclosed a between-group difference with higher TMS-evoked responses in stroke patients in the early period lasting until 100 ms (P = 0.002), but not for the later period post-stimulus (P = 0.57). This finding was also evident when patients were clustered according to their initial motor impairment into severely, moderately, and mildly affected groups [F (3,42) = 3.79, P = 0.018]. Especially severely and moderately affected stroke patients featured increased TMS-evoked activity in the early phase post-stimulus compared to healthy controls (severely affected: P = 0.015, moderately affected: P = 0.006, mildly affected: P = 0.26).

### Pharmacological, psychological, and non-invasive brain stimulation interventions for treating depression after stroke [^1161s9fm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Depression is an important morbidity associated with stroke that impacts recovery, yet it is often undetected or inadequately treated. This document is an update and expansion of a Cochrane Review first published in 2004 and updated in 2008.

- **Objectives**:
	- The primary objective is to determine whether pharmacological therapy, non-invasive brain stimulation, psychological therapy, or combinations of these interventions reduce the prevalence of diagnosable depression after stroke. Secondary objectives include determining whether these interventions reduce levels of depressive symptoms, improve physical and neurological function and health-related quality of life, and reduce dependency after stroke. Additionally, this study assesses the safety of and adherence to such treatments.

- **Search methods**:
	- We searched the Specialised Registers of Cochrane Stroke and Cochrane Depression Anxiety and Neurosis (last searched August 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (1966 to August 2018), Embase (1980 to August 2018), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982 to August 2018), PsycINFO (1967 to August 2018), and Web of Science (2002 to August 2018). We also examined reference lists, clinical trial registers (World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) to August 2018; ClinicalTrials.gov to August 2018), and conference proceedings, and we contacted study authors.

### Transcranial magnetic stimulation in neurology [^112YEoHX]. The Lancet Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive tool for the electrical stimulation of neural tissue, including the cerebral cortex, spinal roots, and cranial and peripheral nerves. TMS can be applied as single pulses of stimulation, pairs of stimuli separated by variable intervals to the same or different brain areas, or as trains of repetitive stimuli at various frequencies.

Single stimuli can depolarize neurons and evoke measurable effects. Trains of stimuli, known as repetitive TMS, can modify the excitability of the cerebral cortex at the stimulated site and also at remote areas along functional anatomical connections. TMS might provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of the neural circuitry underlying neurological and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, it may be developed into clinically useful diagnostic and prognostic tests, as well as have therapeutic uses in various diseases. This potential is supported by the available studies, yet more work is needed to establish the role of TMS in clinical neurology.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or sham stimulation was administered over the motor cortex daily for 10 days to two randomly assigned groups of 26 patients with acute ischemic stroke. Patients continued their normal treatment alongside the trial. Disability scales measured before rTMS, at the end of the last rTMS session, and 10 days afterwards demonstrated that real rTMS improved patients' scores more than the sham treatment.

### Preliminary guidelines for safe and effective use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in moderate to severe traumatic brain injury [^111PTY8N]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation has generated extensive interest within the traumatic brain injury (TBI) rehabilitation community, but little work has been done with repetitive protocols, which can produce prolonged changes in behavior. This is partly because of concerns about the safety of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in subjects with TBI, particularly the risk of seizures. These risks can be minimized by careful selection of the rTMS protocol and exclusion criteria. In this article, we identify guidelines for safe use of rTMS in subjects with TBI based on a review of the literature and illustrate their application with a case study.

Our subject is a 48-year-old man who sustained a severe TBI 5 years prior to beginning rTMS for the treatment of post-TBI depression. After a 4-week baseline period, we administered daily sessions of low-frequency stimulation to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 6 weeks. After stimulation, we performed monthly assessments for 3 months. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) was our primary outcome measure. The stimulation was well tolerated, and the patient reported no side effects. After 6 weeks of stimulation, the patient's depression was slightly improved, and these improvements continued through follow-up. At the end of follow-up, the patient's HAMD score was 49% of the average baseline score.

### Neurotechnology-aided interventions for upper limb motor rehabilitation in severe chronic stroke [^111pK1dr]. Brain (2019). Low credibility.

Brain stimulation uses local magnetic fields or electric currents to facilitate or inhibit targeted brain areas. Among non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) are the most adopted. Non-invasive brain stimulation is used to modulate the excitability of the stimulated neuropil. The mentioned techniques act on different specific central mechanisms: TMS most likely stimulates axons at their bends and can induce action potentials, while tDCS polarizes neuronal elements (somas, dendrites, axons) based on their orientation and the polarity of the induced electric field.

Both TMS and tDCS can produce changes in cortical excitability in healthy subjects and stroke patients. They can stimulate or inhibit according to the applied parameters, for instance, pulse frequency, stimulation-train timing, or stimulus intensity for TMS, and polarity, intensity, and stimulation duration for tDCS. When net effects are measured via TMS-induced motor-evoked potentials, anodal tDCS increases cortical excitability, whereas cathodal tDCS decreases it. It is important to note that this simple dichotomy oversimplifies the complex interactions within the brain, especially of non-motor areas. More complex inhibition and excitation patterns have been identified via investigations of cortical gyration, microstructural properties of neurons (e.g. orientation of the somato-dendritic axis), or higher-order behavioral functions.

### Guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke: 2019 update to the 2018 guidelines for the early management of acute ischemic stroke: A guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association [^1136FyHC]. Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to indications for thrombectomy (0–6 hours from onset), the AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend considering performing mechanical thrombectomy with a stent retriever in carefully selected patients with AIS with causative occlusion of the middle cerebral artery segment 2 (M2) or middle cerebral artery segment 3 (M3), if treatment can be initiated (groin puncture) within 6 hours of symptom onset.

### Evidence for interhemispheric imbalance in stroke patients as revealed by combining transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography [^111J3kXg]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: Fifty-six patients with a history of first-ever unilateral ischemic stroke, admitted to the Santa Lucia Foundation for standard rehabilitation, were screened for inclusion in this study. Nineteen patients (7 females; mean age 61.26 ± 9.8 years) were enrolled in the study.

	- **Inclusion criteria**:
		- First-ever chronic ischemic stroke, at least 6 months post-stroke.
		- Presence of hemiparesis due to an ischemic left or right subcortical or cortical lesion in the territory of the middle cerebral artery.

	- **Exclusion criteria**:
		- History of seizures.
		- Severe general impairment or concomitant disease.
		- Patients older than 80 years.
		- Treatment with benzodiazepines, baclofen, and antidepressants.

Each patient underwent two experimental sessions, each comprising:
(a) a clinical evaluation,
(b) a corticospinal evaluation using TMS–EMG,
(c) a cortical evaluation utilizing TMS–EEG, and
(d) a structural evaluation with an MRI scan.

These evaluations were performed at baseline and after three weeks to assess the reliability of our measures. Fourteen right-handed healthy controls (HC) were recruited to be compared with the stroke patients in the cortical evaluation (8 females; mean age 63.79 ± 12.87 years). The study received approval from the local ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation at 1Hz and 5Hz produces sustained improvement in motor function and disability after ischaemic stroke [^116XpMuB]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a simple and non-invasive method of augmenting motor recovery after stroke, likely mediated by restoring inter-hemispheric activation balance. This placebo-controlled pilot study examined the possible benefit of stimulating the lesioned hemisphere (5-Hz rTMS) or inhibiting the contra-lesional hemisphere (1-Hz rTMS) on clinical recovery of motor function in patients with ischaemic stroke and assessed the sustainability of the response.

- **Methods**: Sixty patients with ischaemic stroke (more than one month from onset) with mild-to-moderate hemiparesis were randomized to receive 10 daily sessions of either sham rTMS, 5-Hz ipsi-lesional rTMS, or 1-Hz contra-lesional rTMS, in addition to a standard physical therapy protocol. Serial assessments were made over a period of 12 weeks using the thumb-index finger tapping test (FT), Activity Index (AI) score, and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).

- **Results**: In contrast to control patients, those receiving active rTMS as ipsi-lesional 5-Hz stimulation or 1-Hz contra-lesional stimulation showed statistically significant improvement on the FT test, AI scores, and mRS score at 2 weeks, with the effect sustained over the 12-week observation period. No significant adverse events were observed during treatment in either group.

- **Conclusions**: Repetitive TMS has beneficial effects on motor recovery that can be translated to clinically meaningful improvement in disability in patients with post-stroke hemiparesis, with a well-sustained effect.

### Inhibition of ipsilesional M1 β oscillations by contralesional M1 following acute ischemic stroke: A TMS-EEG study [^113pu5f7]. Stroke (2025). High credibility.

This study aimed to investigate neurophysiological mechanisms underlying functional impairment and recovery after acute ischemic stroke using transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography, focusing on interhemispheric interactions and oscillatory dynamics.

- **Methods**: This single-center case-control study (December 2022 to May 2024) included 19 ischemic stroke patients within 14 days of symptom onset (mean age, 47.95 ± 12.41 years; 15 [79%] men) with 3-month post-stroke follow-up. Sixteen age-matched healthy controls (53.56 ± 9.83 years; 12 [80%] men) were included. Transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked electroencephalography potentials, local mean field power during 25 ms and 35 ms (local mean field power 25–35 ms), and power spectral density of the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (ilM1) were calculated when single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation was sequentially applied to the contralesional M1 (clM1) and ilM1. Spearman correlation analysis evaluated associations between transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography parameters and clinical outcomes: Fugl-Meyer assessment, Fugl-Meyer assessment-upper extremity subscale, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale changes from baseline to 3 months post-stroke.

- **Results**: Stroke patients exhibited simplified transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked electroencephalography potential waveforms with reduced amplitudes compared with healthy controls. The contralesional resting motor threshold of stroke patients was significantly altered.

### Effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with a brief exposure procedure for post-stroke posttraumatic stress disorder [^1179zU2x]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2023). High credibility.

The incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following stroke ranges from 6.5% to 25%. Presently, few studies have focused on its treatment. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is often applied as a rehabilitation method after stroke, and it also represents a novel approach to PTSD. This study aimed to explore the effect of rTMS, alone or combined with a brief stroke re-exposure, on treating post-stroke PTSD. Sixty participants with post-stroke PTSD were randomly assigned into three groups: the rTMS + brief exposure group (TMS + BE), the rTMS alone group (TMS), and the sham treatment group (ST). They received 10 sessions of treatment accordingly over two weeks. Changes in PTSD symptoms were evaluated using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) at pre-treatment (T1), at the end of the first week (T2), and at the end of the second treatment week (T3). A PTSD interview and IES-R assessment were conducted at the three-month follow-up (T4).

Results showed significant decreases in IES-R scores, including its intrusion subscale, for the TMS + BE and TMS groups compared to the ST group from T1 to T3. The effect remained at the three-month follow-up. The treatment effect was comparable between the TMS + BE group and TMS group at T3; however, it was superior for the TMS + BE group compared to the TMS group at T2, indicating that a brief exposure enhances the effect of rTMS. At follow-up, the rates of PTSD were lower in the TMS + BE and TMS groups than in the ST group. In conclusion, rTMS can effectively treat post-stroke PTSD, and the effects may be accelerated by combining a brief exposure procedure.

### Invasive cortical stimulation to promote recovery of function after stroke: A critical appraisal [^112GvsmZ]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

Residual motor deficits frequently linger following a stroke. The search for newer effective strategies to promote functional recovery is ongoing. Brain stimulation, as a means of directing adaptive plasticity, is appealing. Animal studies and Phase I and II trials in humans have indicated the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of combining rehabilitation and invasive cortical stimulation. However, a recent Phase III trial showed no advantage of the combination. We critically review the results of various trials and discuss the factors that contributed to the distinctive result.

- **Summary of review**: Regarding cortical stimulation, it is important to determine the (1) location of peri-infarct representations by integrating multiple neuroanatomical and physiological techniques; (2) role of other mechanisms of stroke recovery; (3) viability of peri-infarct tissue and descending pathways; (4) lesion geometry to ensure no alteration/displacement of density; and (5) applicability of lessons generated from noninvasive brain stimulation studies in humans. In terms of combining stimulation with rehabilitation, we should understand (1) the principle of homeostatic plasticity; (2) the effect of ongoing cortical activity and phases of learning; and (3) that subject-specific intervention may be necessary.

- **Conclusions**: Future cortical stimulation trials should consider the factors that may have contributed to the peculiar results of the Phase III trial and address those in future study designs.

### Evidence for interhemispheric imbalance in stroke patients as revealed by combining transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography [^11613JyF]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Low credibility.

Figure 3 depicts the analysis of local TMS-evoked cortical activity in the two groups. The first analysis aimed at testing differences between the cortical activation of the two hemispheres when directly stimulated, revealed a group × stimulation interaction (F (1,31) = 5.855; p = .022; ε = .159). Post hoc analysis revealed no differences between the activation of the two hemispheres in stroke patients (p = .073) nor in healthy controls (HC) (p = .131).

The second analysis aimed at testing differences in interhemispheric dynamics and revealed a group × stimulation × hemisphere interaction (F (1,31) = 14.009; p = .001; ε = .318). No main effect was observable for the MEP factor (p = .947) nor in interaction with other factors (all ps > .2). Post hoc analysis comparing the two groups revealed a lower excitability in stroke patients compared to HC, both when stimulating the affected hemisphere (AH) (1.25 ± 0.59 μV vs. 2.79 ± 1.25 μV; p < 0.001) and when stimulating the unaffected hemisphere (UH) (1.51 ± 0.59 μV vs. 2.32 ± 1.09 μV; p = .027).

Post hoc analysis comparing the two hemispheres' reactivity in HC revealed a higher excitability over the stimulated hemisphere compared to the contralateral one, as expected (left hemisphere (LH) stimulation: 2.79 ± 1.25 vs. 1.18 ± 0.40 μV, p < 0.001; right hemisphere (RH) stimulation: 2.32 ± 1.09 vs. 1.06 ± 0.41 μV; p < 0.001). In stroke patients, this difference was significant only when stimulating the UH (1.51 ± 0.59 vs. 0.74 ± 0.30 μV; p = .001) but not when stimulating the AH (1.25 ± 1.09 vs. 1.10 ± 0.50 μV; p = .39). When we considered only the patients with a clearly MEP evocable from the AH, the analysis confirmed the significant group×stimul…

### Priming with 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over contralesional leg motor cortex does not increase the rate of regaining ambulation within 3 months of stroke: A randomized controlled trial [^111PA6mL]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

The potential benefits of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), applied either alone or as a combination treatment, on recovery of lower limbs after stroke have been insufficiently studied.

- **Objective**: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of priming with 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the contralesional leg motor area with a double-cone coil before physical therapy on regaining ambulation.

- **Methods**: Thirty-eight subacute stroke patients with significant leg disabilities were randomly assigned into the experimental group or control group to receive a 15-minute real or sham 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, respectively, over the contralesional motor cortex representing the quadriceps muscle followed by 45-minute physical therapy for 15 sessions over 3 weeks. Functional measures, motor evoked potentials, and quality of life were assessed.

- **Results**: There was no significant difference between the experimental and control groups regarding the recovery in ambulation, balance, motor functions, and activity of daily living. No significant difference was found in other functional measures and the quality of life. Only the control group displayed significantly increased cortical excitability of the contralesional hemisphere after the intervention.

- **Conclusions**: The present study found insufficient evidence that contralesional priming with 1-Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation improves ambulatory and other motor functions among patients with severe leg dysfunction in subacute stroke.

### Therapies to restore consciousness in patients with severe brain injuries: A gap analysis and future directions [^117VoQEd]. Neurocritical Care (2021). Low credibility.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) involves an oscillating current passed through a metal coil, which creates a fluctuating magnetic field at the surface of the skull, inducing an electric current in a volume of brain tissue. A wide range of stimulation parameters can be adjusted, with some patterns modeled after neural oscillations, such as theta burst stimulation. TMS has been applied over multiple cortical regions, including the prefrontal, parietal, motor, and occipital cortices. Evidence of repetitive TMS (rTMS) efficacy has been demonstrated for disorders such as neuropathic pain, depression, stroke, fibromyalgia, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and posttraumatic stress disorder.

For patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC), a few randomized controlled trials using 20-Hz stimulation over the motor cortex have been conducted, without significant evidence of neurobehavioral improvements. Other stimulation sites, including the prefrontal cortex and angular gyrus, have not yet been tested with control groups. TMS can also be used in conjunction with EEG as a diagnostic tool to measure brain complexity, an approach that holds potential as a neurophysiologic biomarker of treatment effect in patients with DoC.

The most common adverse effects of rTMS are transient headaches, local discomfort in the targeted area, dizziness, and, very rarely, seizures. It is important to screen for potential (subclinical) seizures in patients with DoC prior to rTMS treatment.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of motor cortex after stroke: A focused review [^1155cQ7B]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2012). Low credibility.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is known to modulate cortical excitability and has been suggested as a therapeutic approach to enhance the efficacy of rehabilitation for motor recovery after stroke. Stroke can affect the balance of transcallosal inhibitory pathways between motor primary areas in both hemispheres. Specifically, the affected hemisphere (AH) may be disrupted not only by the infarct itself but also by the resulting asymmetric inhibition from the unaffected hemisphere, which further reduces the excitability of the AH. Conceptually, rTMS could be used therapeutically to restore the balance of interhemispheric inhibition after stroke.

rTMS has been used in two ways: low-frequency stimulation (≤ 1 Hz) to the motor cortex of the unaffected hemisphere to reduce the excitability of the contralesional hemisphere, or high-frequency stimulation (> 1 Hz) to the motor cortex of the AH to increase the excitability of the ipsilesional hemisphere. The purpose of this systematic review is to collate evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of high-frequency rTMS applied to the motor cortex of the AH. The studies included investigated the effects of rTMS on the excitability of corticospinal pathways and upper-limb motor function in adults after stroke. This review suggests that rTMS applied to the AH is a safe technique and could be considered an effective approach for modulating brain function and contributing to motor recovery after stroke.

### The therapeutic effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation on post-stroke aphasia and the optimal treatment parameters: A meta-analysis [^111KjUUU]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2024). High credibility.

This meta-analysis aimed to examine the overall effectiveness of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on post-stroke aphasia using a meta-analysis approach, as well as assess the impact of moderating variables, such as study design and TMS protocol, on the effectiveness of TMS.

A keyword search was conducted in five databases: ERIC, Google Scholar, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and ProQuest, covering the period from January 1985 to December 2022. The search algorithm included all possible combinations of relevant keywords. Full-text articles were thoroughly examined using forward and backward search methods.

Studies were meticulously screened based on the following inclusion criteria: patients diagnosed with post-stroke aphasia; studies focused on the effect of TMS on post-stroke aphasia; language assessments conducted at both pretest and posttest for TMS treatment with reported data; and studies included both an experimental group (receiving TMS treatment) and a control group (without TMS treatment).

Information was extracted from each study, including authors, publication year, first language of participants, study design, stroke duration, demographics of participants, TMS protocol, stimulation site, targeting, and statistical data of language performance pre- and post-TMS treatment.

A total of 17 studies were included in the final review, involving 682 patients with post-stroke aphasia (348 in the experimental group and 334 in the control group). The results demonstrated that TMS treatment had significant immediate (Hedges' g = 0.37) and maintenance (Hedges' g = 0.34) effects on patients.

### Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for post-stroke depression: a randomised trial with neurophysiological insight [^113KSEhf]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical benefit of delivering a higher dose of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) compared to previous stroke trials. Despite the high incidence of depression after strokes, few trials have investigated the therapeutic efficacy of rTMS. The study also aimed to document adverse effects and investigate the role of functional connectivity as a potential mechanism for clinical response to rTMS treatment.

- **Methods**: Eleven chronic stroke survivors were recruited for a double-blind, sham-controlled, randomized trial to investigate 10 sessions of high-frequency rTMS for depression. Clinical assessments were obtained at baseline, after treatment, and at a 1-month follow-up. Adverse events were documented upon completion of the treatment. Resting electroencephalography recordings were done at baseline and after treatment to estimate functional connectivity.

- **Results**: There were no differences in baseline characteristics between groups (all p ≥ 0.42). Beck Depression Inventory scores decreased for the active rTMS group from baseline to the 1-month follow-up (p = 0.04) but did not change for the sham group at post-treatment or follow-up (p ≥ 0.17). Stronger theta frequency functional connectivity between the left frontal cortex and right parietal cortex was associated with lower baseline depression (r = -0.71, p = 0.05). This network strength increased following active rTMS, with changes in connectivity associated with improvements in BDI scores (r = 0.98, p = 0.001). Adverse events were transient and minor, and were not statistically different between the groups.
