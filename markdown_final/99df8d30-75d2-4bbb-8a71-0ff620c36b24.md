## Question

differential diagnosis in a 72 year old man with long smoking history presenting with difficulty swallowing solids, without pain and mostly with spicy foods, and a metallic taste in the mouth most mornings

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step differential diagnosis and diagnostic/management plan for a 72-year-old male smoker with intermittent, painless, solids-only dysphagia, occasionally triggered by spicy foods and accompanied by a morning metallic taste. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this is oropharyngeal versus esophageal dysphagia. Then, I should verify if the pattern points to mechanical obstruction versus motility disorder. Next, I will prioritize the differential by malignancy risk and prevalence, identify alarm features that mandate urgent endoscopy, and outline a staged diagnostic algorithm. Finally, I will map management contingencies to each likely diagnosis, including red flags that require immediate intervention and counseling points while awaiting work-up [^114dCSRZ] [^111hmvik].

> Let me first confirm the symptom localization and pattern. Solids-only dysphagia without difficulty initiating the swallow or aspiration strongly localizes to the esophagus and favors a structural/mechanical cause over a primary motility disorder, whereas oropharyngeal dysphagia would feature coughing or choking with initiation of swallowing and commonly involves liquids as well [^114dCSRZ] [^111hmvik]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — painlessness does not exclude malignancy or benign strictures, and intermittent triggers like poorly chewed foods or food characteristics can still reflect fixed but narrow luminal disease such as rings, webs, or peptic strictures, while a metallic taste in the morning nudges me to consider nocturnal reflux contributing to peptic remodeling of the distal esophagus [^111hmvik] [^114dCSRZ].

> Next, I should review alarm features that dictate urgency. I need to ensure I do not miss the high-risk triad here: older age, male sex, and tobacco exposure, which together increase pretest probability for esophageal cancer, particularly squamous cell carcinoma in smokers, although adenocarcinoma remains common in Western settings as well [^114CcqpF] [^114ESNsz]. Given age greater than 50 years with new-onset dysphagia, urgent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is indicated as the initial test, and in this risk context the threshold for expedited endoscopy is very low even if symptoms are intermittent and painless [^115mCyNG] [^113hPyoH] [^111hmvik].

> I will now examine malignant causes first because missing them carries the greatest harm. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is tightly linked to tobacco exposure and often presents initially as progressive solids dysphagia that is painless until late, with weight loss and anorexia, though early disease can be subtle and intermittent when luminal compromise is incomplete; I should confirm that ESCC risk is indeed heightened here, which it is, given the smoking history and age [^114CcqpF] [^114ESNsz]. But wait, what if this is esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC)? Chronic reflux and Barrett's metaplasia predispose to EAC, and the metallic taste could reflect reflux; however, in the absence of known Barrett's, the stronger immediate epidemiologic signal in a long-time smoker is ESCC, though EAC remains on the list and will be addressed by systematic endoscopic evaluation and biopsy [^114CcqpF] [^114ESNsz].

> Let me consider common benign structural etiologies next. Peptic strictures from long-standing GERD can cause progressive solids dysphagia and may be associated with nocturnal reflux symptoms such as a metallic or sour taste; dilation plus PPI therapy often helps, but I should verify endoscopic appearance and exclude malignancy first [^111hmvik] [^114dCSRZ]. Hold on, I should also think about a Schatzki ring or cervical/web lesions — intermittent solids dysphagia, especially with certain foods, fits; barium swallow can outperform endoscopy for subtle rings if initial EGD is nondiagnostic [^115wugNb] [^111hmvik]. Wait, let me verify EoE, too: eosinophilic esophagitis can present with intermittent solids dysphagia and food triggers, and diagnosis hinges on obtaining multiple biopsies even from normal-appearing mucosa; I need to ensure at least 6 biopsies across proximal and distal esophagus are obtained and placed in separate jars to avoid a missed diagnosis [^116bvm6c] [^111hmvik].

> Hmm, wait a minute — could this be a primary motility disorder? Achalasia typically involves both solids and liquids from the outset, with retained food/regurgitation; that pattern is not described here, lowering pretest probability, but if endoscopy and barium are unrevealing, high-resolution manometry is the next step to exclude subtle esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction or early achalasia [^116qiid3] [^1124EueE]. I should double-check that evaluation for motility disorders comes after structural/inflammatory causes are excluded; contemporary guidance emphasizes not overdiagnosing motility disease before optimizing GERD/EoE evaluation and therapy [^1111PwNm] [^1124EueE].

> I need to synthesize these clues into a working rank order. Initially, I almost said the spicy trigger makes EoE the top diagnosis, but wait, let me reconsider — spicy foods can transiently worsen symptoms in fixed narrowings from rings or strictures and can irritate reflux-sensitive mucosa, so that trigger is not specific to EoE; with age and smoking, ESCC must be excluded first despite benign possibilities being common [^111hmvik] [^114CcqpF]. Therefore, my prioritized list is: ESCC to rule out urgently, peptic stricture, Schatzki ring, EoE, and EAC depending on reflux/Barrett's context; motility disorders trail given the solids-only pattern, but I will keep pseudoachalasia from malignancy in mind during endoscopy [^114dCSRZ] [^111KKpPx].

> Let me outline the diagnostic algorithm step-by-step. First-line is expedited EGD to directly visualize the lumen, treat food impaction if present, and obtain mucosal samples; any mass or irregular mucosa requires multiple biopsies for histology, while EoE evaluation requires at least six biopsies from proximal and distal esophagus including normal-appearing mucosa to maximize sensitivity [^115mCyNG] [^116bvm6c]. If EGD is negative or suggests a subtle ring/web or complex stricture anatomy, a barium esophagram can delineate caliber and reveal classic appearances such as a Schatzki ring or shouldered malignant strictures; if achalasia is suspected later, I should look for bird-beak taper, aperistalsis, and delayed emptying on esophagram [^115wugNb] [^111KQZAT]. When no structural/inflammatory cause is found, I should confirm with high-resolution manometry to evaluate motility, reserving pH-impedance testing for persistent reflux correlation questions after appropriate empiric therapy or to support peptic stricture mechanisms if endoscopy is unrevealing [^1124EueE] [^111hmvik].

> If cancer is confirmed, I should confirm the staging sequence. Integrated PET-CT for distant disease assessment followed by endoscopic ultrasound for locoregional depth and nodal evaluation guides multidisciplinary planning; early mucosal T1a lesions can be treated with endoscopic resection, whereas locally advanced disease often requires multimodality therapy including chemoradiation and surgery in appropriate candidates [^114ESNsz] [^111FJYMG]. I need to check contemporary practice parameters for definitive chemoradiation dosing and surgical approach; current thoracic and radiation oncology guidance supports 50–50.4 Gy in 25–28 fractions for definitive CRT and favors minimally invasive esophagectomy in experienced centers when surgery is pursued after neoadjuvant therapy [^117Xd5RQ] [^114Vfv2o].

> For palliation of malignant dysphagia or non-operative scenarios, I should verify the preferred modality. Self-expanding esophageal stents provide immediate relief and are recommended for most patients with malignant dysphagia; brachytherapy can be considered in selected individuals with longer expected survival and may be combined with stenting in specialized settings alongside early palliative care and nutritional support [^111KsqSG] [^116e7TXi] [^116ifjKt]. Hold on, I should ensure multidisciplinary supportive care is arranged early because symptom burden and nutritional compromise are common and adversely affect outcomes in advanced disease [^116ifjKt].

> If endoscopy shows a benign peptic stricture, I should confirm the standard approach. Endoscopic dilation combined with high-dose PPI therapy and reflux lifestyle measures is first-line, with maintenance acid suppression to reduce recurrence; for a Schatzki ring, dilation plus ongoing PPI reduces symptom relapse as well [^111hmvik] [^114dCSRZ]. If EoE is diagnosed histologically, therapy includes swallowed topical steroids, a PPI trial given frequent benefit, and a structured elimination diet as appropriate, with follow-up endoscopy to document histologic remission and dilation reserved for fibrostenotic disease while continuing anti-inflammatory therapy [^111hmvik] [^116bvm6c]. I need to ensure I differentiate EoE from other immune/infectious esophagitides and reassess for occult immunologic or infectious drivers if symptoms persist despite targeted therapy [^112Jv4bF] [^114q2XBF].

> I should double-check red flags that mandate immediate escalation. These include complete obstruction with inability to handle secretions, rapidly progressive dysphagia extending to liquids, significant weight loss, hematemesis, or chest pain with fever suggesting perforation or mediastinitis; such features warrant emergent endoscopic or inpatient evaluation rather than routine scheduling [^111hmvik] [^114dCSRZ]. But wait, what if initial symptoms seem oropharyngeal yet laryngoscopy is unrevealing? I should remember that distal esophageal disease can be perceived in the throat, and EGD remains warranted when oropharyngeal work-up is negative but dysphagia persists [^117EBUvH].

> Finalizing the plan, I recommend urgent EGD within about 1–2 weeks given age and smoking risk, with explicit requests for systematic biopsies of any abnormal areas, plus at least six esophageal biopsies for EoE even if mucosa looks normal, and readiness for dilation if a benign ring/stricture is confirmed; based on EGD findings, I would add barium esophagram, manometry, and pH-impedance selectively, while counseling the patient to avoid precipitants, chew carefully, seek immediate care if symptoms progress to liquids or cause choking, and to stop tobacco use given its malignancy risk [^115mCyNG] [^116bvm6c] [^113hPyoH]. I should confirm that staging, oncologic referral, and supportive care are arranged without delay if malignancy is found to avoid loss of performance status while preserving curative or effective palliative options [^114ESNsz] [^116ifjKt].

In a 72-year-old man with a long smoking history, **progressive solid-food dysphagia** and a **metallic morning taste** strongly suggest esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or adenocarcinoma, given the high-risk profile and classic alarm features. Other considerations include peptic stricture, eosinophilic esophagitis, and motility disorders such as achalasia or spasm [^114dCSRZ]. However, **malignancy must be excluded first** [^113hPyoH]. Immediate **upper endoscopy with biopsy** is essential [^115mCyNG] [^115mCAiQ]; barium esophagram [^113LqLSq] [^115wugNb] and manometry [^1124EueE] are adjuncts if needed. GERD-related metallic taste is possible, but the priority is to rule out cancer.

## Differential diagnosis

### Malignant causes

- **Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)**: Strongly associated with smoking; typically presents with progressive solid-food dysphagia, weight loss, and sometimes a metallic taste from tumor necrosis or bleeding.

- **Esophageal adenocarcinoma**: Linked to chronic GERD and Barrett's [^1143LZif]; presents similarly to SCC and is increasingly common in older men [^114CcqpF] [^114ESNsz].

- **Head and neck cancers**: Oropharyngeal or laryngeal tumors can cause dysphagia and metallic taste via local invasion or bleeding [^116GhMF3].

---

### Benign structural causes

- **Peptic stricture**: Chronic GERD can cause strictures, leading to progressive solid-food dysphagia and metallic taste from refluxed acid or minor bleeding [^114dCSRZ].

- **Esophageal rings/webs**: Intermittent solid-food dysphagia, often with specific triggers like spicy foods [^113LqLSq].

- **Zenker's diverticulum**: Pharyngeal pouch causing dysphagia, regurgitation, and halitosis; less likely without regurgitation [^115R7vJQ].

---

### Inflammatory and infectious causes

Among inflammatory and infectious etiologies, **eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)** is an allergic condition causing solid-food dysphagia, often triggered by specific foods, including spicy items. **Infectious esophagitis** (commonly due to Candida or HSV, especially in immunocompromised patients) can also cause dysphagia; a metallic taste may occur with fungal infection.

---

### Motility disorders

Among motility disorders, **achalasia** causes dysphagia to solids and liquids with regurgitation and weight loss; metallic taste is uncommon [^116qiid3] [^1111PwNm]. **Diffuse esophageal spasm** presents with intermittent dysphagia and chest pain, and metallic taste is also uncommon [^114f4Msz].

---

### Neurological disorders

In neurological disorders, **Parkinson's disease** can cause dysphagia, but metallic taste is uncommon [^112KUEK4]. **Stroke** can also cause dysphagia, with metallic taste similarly uncommon [^1153PJYZ].

---

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common cause of **dysphagia** and a **metallic taste**, particularly in the morning due to nocturnal reflux [^113LqLSq].

---

## Diagnostic approach

Given the patient's age, smoking history, and symptoms, **malignancy must be excluded first** [^113hPyoH]. The recommended diagnostic approach includes:

- **Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD)**: Initial test to evaluate esophageal pathology [^115mCyNG]; allows direct visualization and biopsy of suspicious lesions [^115mCAiQ].

- **Barium esophagram**: Useful adjunct to assess strictures, rings, webs, or motility disorders [^115wugNb].

- **Esophageal manometry**: Indicated if motility disorder is suspected after structural causes are excluded [^111KQZAT] [^1124EueE].

- **CT scan of chest and abdomen**: For staging if malignancy is confirmed [^117DM9Xo].

## Clinical features differentiating malignant from benign causes

| **Feature** | **Malignant causes** | **Benign causes** |
|-|-|-|
| Dysphagia progression | Progressive | Intermittent or stable |
| Weight loss | Common | Uncommon |
| Metallic taste | Common (necrosis/bleeding) | Less common |
| Age | Older patients | Any age |
| Smoking history | Strong association | Weak association |

---

## Management strategies

Management addresses both malignant and benign etiologies. Malignant causes are treated with **multimodal therapy** — including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy — with **palliative care** for advanced disease [^114CcqpF] [^114ESNsz] [^116ifjKt], while **benign causes** are managed with medical therapy (PPIs, corticosteroids), endoscopic dilation, dietary modifications, and surgical intervention if refractory [^113keR1E] [^115wugNb].

---

In a 72-year-old man with a long smoking history, progressive solid-food dysphagia and a metallic morning taste strongly suggest esophageal SCC or adenocarcinoma. Immediate **endoscopy with biopsy** is essential [^113hPyoH] [^115mCAiQ]; barium esophagram and manometry are adjuncts if needed [^1124EueE]. GERD-related metallic taste is possible, but **malignancy must be excluded first** [^113w9xGR].

### Dysphagia: Evaluation and collaborative management [^113LqLSq]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is common but may be underreported. Specific symptoms, rather than their perceived location, should guide the initial evaluation and imaging. Obstructive symptoms that seem to originate in the throat or neck may actually be caused by distal esophageal lesions. Oropharyngeal dysphagia manifests as difficulty initiating swallowing, coughing, choking, or aspiration, and it is most commonly caused by chronic neurologic conditions such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, or dementia. Symptoms should be thoroughly evaluated because of the risk of aspiration. Patients with esophageal dysphagia may report a sensation of food getting stuck after swallowing. This condition is most commonly caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease and functional esophageal disorders. Eosinophilic esophagitis, triggered by food allergens, is increasingly prevalent; esophageal biopsies should be performed to make the diagnosis. Esophageal motility disorders such as achalasia are relatively rare and may be overdiagnosed. Opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction is becoming more common.

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is recommended for the initial evaluation of esophageal dysphagia, with barium esophagography as an adjunct. Esophageal cancer and other serious conditions have a low prevalence, and testing in low-risk patients may be deferred while a four-week trial of acid-suppressing therapy is undertaken. Many frail older adults with progressive neurologic disease have significant but unrecognized dysphagia, which significantly increases their risk of aspiration pneumonia and malnourishment.

### Esophageal cancer [^114ESNsz]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Esophageal cancer has a poor prognosis and high mortality rate, with an estimated 16,910 new cases and 15,910 deaths projected in 2016 in the United States. Squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma account for more than 95% of esophageal cancers. Squamous cell carcinoma is more common in nonindustrialized countries, with important risk factors including smoking, alcohol use, and achalasia. Adenocarcinoma is the predominant esophageal cancer in developed nations, with important risk factors including chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease, obesity, and smoking.

Dysphagia, alone or with unintentional weight loss, is the most common presenting symptom, although esophageal cancer is often asymptomatic in its early stages. Physicians should have a low threshold for evaluation with endoscopy if any symptoms are present. If cancer is confirmed, integrated positron emission tomography and computed tomography should be used for initial staging. If no distant metastases are found, endoscopic ultrasonography should be performed to determine tumor depth and evaluate for nodal involvement.

Localized tumors can be treated with endoscopic mucosal resection, whereas regional tumors are treated with esophagectomy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, chemoradiotherapy, or a combination of modalities. Nonresectable tumors or tumors with distant metastases are treated with palliative interventions. Specific prevention strategies have not been proven, and there are no recommendations for esophageal cancer screening.

The following constitutes key background information on esophageal dysphagia:

- **Definition**: Esophageal dysphagia is characterized by difficulty transporting food down the esophagus due to involvement of the esophageal body and esophagogastric junction.

- **Pathophysiology**: Esophageal dysphagia is caused by structural or inflammatory abnormalities, including strictures, rings, webs, malignancy, reflux esophagitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, and motility disorders such as achalasia, ineffective esophageal motility, esophageal spasm, and esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of esophageal dysphagia include difficulty swallowing solids and liquids, intermittent or progressive dysphagia, food bolus impaction, food regurgitation, heartburn, weight loss, anorexia, respiratory distress, hypotension, and atypical chest pain.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Annual mortality associated with GERD is 0.46 per 100,000 individuals.

### Oesophageal cancer [^114CcqpF]. Lancet (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on esophageal cancer:

- **Definition**: Esophageal cancer refers to malignant disease arising from the esophageal epithelium and principally comprises squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma.

- **Pathophysiology**: Exposure to various carcinogens, genetic susceptibility, and repeated insults to the esophageal mucosa increase the risk of malignant transformation of esophageal epithelial cells, with the subsequent development of esophageal cancer.

- **Epidemiology**: The overall annual incidence of esophageal cancer in the US is 4.7 cases per 100,000 person-years.

- **Disease course**: Predominant changes in the squamous mucosa of the proximal esophagus predispose to esophageal SCC, while intestinal metaplasia of the mucosa of the distal esophagus predisposes to esophageal adenocarcinoma.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The overall 5-year survival rate of patients with esophageal cancer is estimated at 15–20%.

### Esophageal cancer: Epidemiology, pathogenesis and prevention [^112S1rEz]. Nature Clinical Practice. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Esophageal cancer is highly aggressive and is a common cancer both worldwide and in the US. In the past two decades, the incidence and mortality of esophageal cancer in the US have both increased, whereas the incidence and mortality of other cancers have decreased. Although esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and esophageal adenocarcinoma differ in their histology and epidemiologic distribution, some of their risk factors, such as dietary deficiencies and tobacco use, and underlying mechanisms of carcinogenesis are the same.

Intensive research into risk factors combined with the ability to identify precursor lesions, such as squamous dysplasia in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and Barrett's esophagus in esophageal adenocarcinoma, has paved the way for studies of chemoprevention for esophageal cancer, some of which have shown promising results.

### Approach to the patient with dysphagia [^114VKEvY]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is a fascinating symptom. It is ostensibly simple when defined by trouble swallowing, yet its subtleties in deciphering and its variations in pathophysiology almost mandate a thorough knowledge of medicine itself. With patience and careful questioning, a multitude of various disorders may be suggested before an objective test is performed. Indeed, the ability to diligently and comprehensively explore the symptom of dysphagia is not only rewarding but also a real test for a physician who prides himself or herself on good history-taking.

### Management of acid-related disorders in patients with dysphagia [^1113sJ2o]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Dysphagia affects a large and growing number of individuals in the United States, particularly the elderly and those who are neurologically impaired. Swallowing difficulties may stem from age-related changes in oropharyngeal and esophageal functioning, as well as central nervous system diseases such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, and dementia. Among institutionalized individuals, dysphagia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Understanding the physiology of swallowing and the pathophysiology of dysphagia is crucial for proper patient management.

Careful history, physical examination, and evaluation of radiologic and endoscopic studies should be conducted to differentiate between oropharyngeal and esophageal etiologies of dysphagia, and to distinguish mechanical (anatomic) disorders from functional (motor) disorders. A significant percentage of patients with dysphagia have concomitant acid-related disorders, which are managed best with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy.

Three of the currently available PPIs are manufactured as capsules containing enteric-coated granules that may be mixed with soft foods or fruit juices before oral administration to individuals with swallowing difficulties. Additionally, omeprazole and lansoprazole may be administered via gastrostomy or nasogastric feeding tubes as suspensions in sodium bicarbonate. Novel dosage formulations of lansoprazole that may be appropriate for patients with dysphagia include the commercially manufactured lansoprazole strawberry-flavored enteric-coated granules for suspension and lansoprazole orally disintegrating tablets.

A 69-year-old man presented with dysphagia for 6 months. An endoscopic biopsy showed no sign of malignancy, but an enhanced chest CT revealed thickening of the esophageal wall, which was considered likely a potential malignancy. The patient subsequently was enrolled in our clinical trial of the 68Ga-FAPI study in tumors. Intense 68Ga-FAPI activity was noted in the thickened esophagus; however, repeated endoscopic biopsies and relief of symptoms after drug treatment rendered a diagnosis of Candida albicans esophagitis.

### Survival after diagnosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in Malawi [^112pq9Y1]. JCO Global Oncology (2023). High credibility.

We enrolled ESCC cases from participants with dysphagia attending endoscopy at KCH or SGH. Evidence of an esophageal tumor on endoscopy was required to be enrolled in this study. ESCC diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology of tumor biopsies obtained during endoscopy. Detailed methods are described elsewhere. To summarize, all adults aged 18 years or older presenting to the KCH and SGH endoscopy units with symptoms suggestive of ESCC were screened for this study. Patients were enrolled before endoscopy to facilitate consent for research specimen collections during the procedure. Owing to the scope of our project, we only included patients with ESCC in this study, and all other histological types were excluded.

In our hospital, most patients had squamous cell carcinomas, which is consistent with published data. There were no pediatric patients, and all eligible patients consented to participate. Furthermore, on enrollment, there were no patients eligible for esophagectomy; therefore, no participants were referred to another center for treatment. Enrolled participants had demographic information recorded in an electronic database, and a paper-based physical location map was also recorded. We collected data on demographic characteristics and relevant health behaviors using a computerized interviewer-administered questionnaire to assess age, sex, tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, HIV status, and dysphagia score. Smoking was defined as the total lifetime use of tobacco products for ≥ 6 months. Alcohol consumption was defined as the total lifetime consumption.

### Palliation of malignant esophageal dysphagia: Would you like plastic or metal [^115kPWzz]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Advanced esophageal carcinoma has a rather dismal prognosis, with dysphagia to solids and liquids as a common symptom. Self-expanding metal stents provide immediate and durable relief of dysphagia. Recently, self-expanding plastic stents have been developed for refractory benign esophageal strictures but may have applications in malignant strictures as well. In this issue of The American Journal of Gastroenterology, a multicenter, prospective, randomized, comparative trial evaluates the safety and efficacy of self-expanding metal versus plastic stents for the palliation of dysphagia due to esophageal cancer. While the stents compared equivalently for symptom relief, complications were observed more commonly in the plastic stent group.

### Esophageal cancer: challenges, concerns, and recommendations for management amidst the COVID-19 pandemic [^1152QfVK]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

It has become increasingly important for healthcare systems and clinicians to adopt a universal, consolidated approach to patient care amidst the ongoing viral pandemic, particularly for vulnerable populations. Cancer patients, more precisely, immunocompromised patients, may be susceptible to severe illness with potentially fatal consequences. However, existing data on the association between cancer and COVID-19 remain insufficient because of the small numbers of cancer patients that have been investigated, mainly in Eastern countries. The true burden on patients receiving chemo(radio)therapies, medical immunosuppression, transplant recipients, and select surgical patients is yet to be quantified. A recent nationwide study from China revealed an increased risk of severe symptom presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection among cancer patients.

Esophageal cancer (EC), in particular, is one of the deadliest types of malignancy worldwide, reflecting both aggressive biology and a lack of adequate treatment. As oncologic and gastrointestinal surgeons face the outbreak of COVID-19, the optimal management of these patients may be even more controversial and problematic than before. Unique considerations may be necessary for:

- **Patients newly diagnosed with EC**: Without any previous treatment.
- **Non-responding or partial-responding patients**: Once re-staged after neoadjuvant therapy.
- **Complete responding patients**: After neoadjuvant therapy.
- **Patients after esophagectomy**: Whether hospitalized or not.
- **Patients in need of palliative care**: Special considerations for end-of-life management.

These subgroups should be evaluated carefully to ensure effective treatment amidst the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Esophageal cancer [^116wcew4]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Despite advances in our knowledge of esophageal cancer, 50% of patients present with incurable disease, and the overall survival after diagnosis is poor. The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus is rising at a rapid rate in developed countries. Recent advances in the epidemiology of esophageal cancer offer insights into preventive strategies for patients who are at risk.

New developments in diagnosis may help detect the disease at an early stage. New diagnostic modalities permit more accurate staging procedures and allow appropriate selection of therapy. Additionally, recent studies provide more information on multimodality therapy for esophageal cancer, and new endoscopic techniques allow resection of small lesions without surgery. Furthermore, new stent designs provide better palliation by preventing tumor ingrowth.

These developments in the treatment of esophageal cancer are the focus of this review.

### Oesophageal dysphagia: manifestations and diagnosis [^113w9xGR]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Oesophageal dysphagia is a common symptom, often associated with severe oesophageal diseases such as carcinomas. Therefore, an organic process must be ruled out initially by performing an endoscopy on all patients presenting with dysphagia symptoms. The most prevalent obstructive aetiologies include oesophageal cancer, peptic strictures, and eosinophilic oesophagitis. Notably, eosinophilic oesophagitis is one of the most common causes of dysphagia in both adults and children, thereby justifying the need to obtain oesophageal biopsy samples from all patients presenting with unexplained dysphagia.

With the advancement of standardized high-resolution manometry and specific metrics to characterize oesophageal motility, the Chicago classification has become a gold-standard algorithm for manometric diagnosis of oesophageal motor disorders. Moreover, sophisticated investigations and analysis methods that integrate pressure and impedance measurements are currently in development. In the future, these techniques might be able to detect subtle pressure abnormalities during bolus transport, potentially enhancing the understanding of pathophysiology and symptoms. However, the degree to which these novel approaches will help distinguish dysphagia caused by motor abnormalities from functional dysphagia remains to be determined.

### Gastroesophageal reflux, Barrett esophagus, and esophageal cancer: Clinical applications [^1143LZif]. JAMA (2002). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition commonly encountered in the primary care setting, is a risk factor for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Despite the ubiquity of the complaint, considerable uncertainty exists regarding several basic questions, including when to perform endoscopy in patients with chronic reflux symptoms and how to address the cancer risk associated with GERD. These clinical vignettes illustrate common clinical questions encountered in caring for patients with GERD, especially as they relate to the issue of cancer risk. Applying data reviewed in the companion article, we propose practical answers to common clinical situations regarding the care of patients with reflux. We also present an algorithm for the treatment of patients with chronic GERD symptoms.

### Multiple management modalities in esophageal cancer: Epidemiology, presentation and progression, work-up, and surgical approaches [^114ayo26]. The Oncologist (2004). Low credibility.

Annually, approximately 13,200 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with esophageal cancer, and 12,500 die of this malignancy. Of the new cases, 9,900 occur in men and 3,300 occur in women. In part I of this two-part series, we explore the epidemiology, presentation and progression, work-up, and surgical approaches for esophageal cancer. In the 1960s, squamous cell cancers made up more than 90% of all esophageal tumors. The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinomas has risen considerably over the past two decades, making them more prevalent than squamous cell cancer in the Western Hemisphere. Despite advances in therapeutic modalities for this disease, half of the patients are incurable at presentation, and overall survival after diagnosis is grim. Evolving knowledge regarding the etiology of esophageal carcinoma may lead to better preventive methods and treatment options for early-stage superficial cancers of the esophagus. The use of endoscopic ultrasound and the developing role of positron emission tomography have led to better diagnostic accuracy in this disease. For years, the standard of care for esophageal cancer has been surgery; there are several variants of the surgical approach. We will discuss combined modality approaches in part II of this series.

### Diagnosis and treatment of superficial esophageal cancer [^116pWGU9]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Esophageal cancer is the eighth most common cancer and the sixth leading cause of cancer death, with estimations of 456,000 new cases and 400,000 deaths in 2012. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most frequent histological subtype due to its high prevalence in Asia, where up to 95% of esophageal neoplasia cases occur in China. Persistent alcohol and tobacco consumption contribute to this prevalence in Western countries. In America and Northern Europe, however, esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) arising from Barrett's esophagus has recently become the most prevalent type.

Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy screening programs in Asia and surveillance protocols for Barrett's esophagus have facilitated the diagnosis of early-stage, T1 — so-called "superficial" or "early" esophageal cancers. Mucosal (T1a) cancers include high-grade dysplasia (HGD), in situ carcinoma (T1am1), and tumors infiltrating the lamina propria (T1am2) or the muscularis mucosae (T1am3). Submucosal cancers (T1b) are classified as T1bsm 1, 2, or 3, depending on the invasion depth into the upper, middle, or deepest third of the submucosa on surgical specimens, or as superficial submucosal invasion (less than 200 µm from the muscularis mucosae for SCC and less than 500 µm for EAC).

All T1 lesions are technically amenable to endoscopic resection (ER). However, two caveats should be noted: first, there is a risk of severe, refractory esophageal stricture following resections exceeding three-fourths of the circumference, which may require repeated dilations with a significant risk of perforation.

### Dysphagia: A review [^114rYBVu]. The Nurse Practitioner (2020). High credibility.

Esophageal dysphagia can be attributed to a wide range of potential causes, such as eosinophilic esophagitis, left atrial enlargement, and Candida esophagitis. Other contributing factors include esophageal cancer, acute pharyngitis, Chagas disease, and achalasia. Conditions like mediastinitis, esophageal foreign body, central pontine myelinosis, globus pharyngis, and carotid body tumor are also implicated. Additionally, systemic diseases such as systemic sclerosis, polymyositis, myasthenia gravis, and Gaucher disease play a role. Neuromuscular disorders, including myotonic dystrophy and vagus nerve palsy, further complicate the clinical picture. Congenital or structural anomalies such as a vascular ring with right aortic arch and esophageal cyst or atresia are possible causes. Furthermore, goiter, bulbar palsy, Zenker's diverticulum, and Riedel's thyroiditis can lead to dysphagia. Structural obstructions, such as an esophageal pouch, Eagle's syndrome, and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, may also be involved. Functional disorders such as diffuse esophageal spasm and cricopharyngeal spasm contribute as well. Lastly, conditions like paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis, esophageal web, Barrett's esophagus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and esophageal stricture must be considered.

### Oesophageal carcinoma [^117WJ7Zg]. Lancet (2013). Low credibility.

Oesophageal carcinoma affects more than 450,000 people worldwide, and its incidence is rapidly increasing. Squamous-cell carcinoma is the predominant form globally, but a shift in epidemiology has been observed in Australia, the UK, the United States, and some Western European countries (e.g. Finland, France, and the Netherlands), where the incidence of adenocarcinoma now exceeds that of squamous-cell types. The overall 5-year survival rate for patients with oesophageal carcinoma ranges from 15% to 25%. Diagnoses made at earlier stages are associated with better outcomes than those made at later stages.

In this seminar, we discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and staging, management, prevention, and advances in the treatment of oesophageal carcinoma.

### Small cell carcinoma of the oesophagus: A rare cause of dysphagia [^1173iQxv]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Primary small cell carcinoma of the oesophagus is a rare, highly aggressive malignancy with diagnosis usually occurring at the most advanced stages. We report a case of small cell carcinoma of the oesophagus presenting with dysphagia and melena. A 79-year-old Caucasian man presented to an outside hospital with dizziness, light-headedness, chest pain, and melena for 3 days. He had a history of intermittent dysphagia for solids and a 25-pound weight loss in the past 2 months. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a large polypoid, well-circumscribed friable oesophageal mass causing near complete obstruction of the lumen, which extended into the gastric cardia. Oesophageal biopsies were consistent with small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. The patient underwent chemotherapy, achieved remission, but experienced recurrence of the disease in the oesophagus 2 years later. Overall, he has had two recurrences but has survived for more than 2 years with chemotherapy alone.

### Patients' preferences for surgical management of esophageal cancer: A discrete choice experiment [^111cj8Rm]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Risk of in-hospital mortality, risk of persistent GI symptoms, chance of 5-year survival, risk of surgical and non-surgical complications, and hospital volume of esophageal cancer surgery all influenced patients' preferences for surgical management of esophageal cancer. Patients accepted a less effective surgical treatment or a higher risk of persistent GI symptoms if esophagectomy took place in a higher-volume hospital with a lower risk of in-hospital mortality and morbidity. Patients were willing to trade off 9.5% (CI 2.4–16.6%) of their 5-year survival chance to obtain a surgical treatment with 30% lower long-term absolute risk of GI symptoms.

Another discrete choice experiment (DCE) investigated preferences of patients towards surgery for esophagogastric cancer in the UK and found that long-term treatment outcomes (i.e. quality of life and cure rate) outweighed attributes such as hospital type and a surgeon's reputation. These results are in line with our findings, which showed that especially persistent GI symptoms and 5-year survival had a relatively large impact on patients' preferences for surgical management of esophageal cancer. Our finding that patients were prepared to give up life expectancy to avoid side effects of medical intervention was also found by a DCE which focused on patients' preferences for the management of non-metastatic prostate cancer.

### A very unusual cause of dysphagia: mantle cell lymphoma [^112L8GYk]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is considered an alarm symptom that warrants prompt investigation. This symptom may occur in various benign and malignant diseases, including reflux esophagitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, achalasia, as well as esophageal and cardia cancer. While lymphomas may involve the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, esophageal localization is extremely rare. We report a case of primary mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) involving the esophagus and stomach, presenting with dysphagia.

### Dysphagia in aging [^115R7vJQ]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is a common problem in older patients and is becoming a significant healthcare issue as the populations of the United States and other developed countries rapidly age. Changes in physiology with aging are observed in the upper esophageal sphincter and pharyngeal region in both symptomatic and asymptomatic older individuals. Age-related changes in the esophageal body and lower esophageal sphincter are more difficult to identify, while esophageal sensation is certainly blunted with age.

- **Causes of oropharyngeal dysphagia**: Stroke, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Zenker's diverticula, and several other motility and structural disorders may affect older patients.
- **Causes of esophageal dysphagia**: This can also be caused by motility disorders (achalasia, diffuse esophageal spasm, scleroderma, and others) and structural issues (malignancy, strictures, rings, external compression, and others). Many of these disorders have an increased prevalence in older patients and should be sought with an appropriate diagnostic evaluation.

The treatment of dysphagia in older patients is similar to that in younger patients. However, more invasive therapies, such as surgery, may not be feasible in some older patients, making less aggressive medical and endoscopic therapies more attractive.

### Esophageal dysfunction in different stages of Parkinson's disease [^115FpQA9]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is a clinically relevant symptom in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), leading to a pronounced reduction in quality of life and other severe complications. Parkinson's disease-related dysphagia may affect the oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal phases of swallowing.

- **Methods**: To examine the nature and extent of esophageal dysphagia in different stages of PD and its relation to oropharyngeal dysfunction, we examined 65 PD patients (mean age 66.3 ± 9.7 years, mean disease duration 7.9 ± 5.8 years, mean Hoehn & Yahr [H&Y] stage 2.89 ± 0.91) and divided them into three groups: early (H&Y I+II; n = 21), intermediate (H&Y III; n = 25), and advanced stadium (H&Y IV+V; n = 19). Esophageal high-resolution manometry (HRM) was used to detect esophageal motor disorders. Oropharyngeal impairment was assessed using fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing.

- **Key results**: Major esophageal motor disorders were detected in nearly one-third of the PD patients. Minor impairment of the esophageal body was present in 95% of participants and throughout all disease stages, with pathological findings especially in peristalsis and intrabolus pressure (IBP). The IBP was found to significantly increase in the advanced stadium. Although dysfunction of the upper and lower esophageal sphincters was observed in individual patients, alterations in these esophageal segments revealed no statistical significance compared with normative data. No clear association was found between the occurrence of oropharyngeal dysphagia and esophageal impairment.

### Role of photodynamic therapy in unresectable esophageal and lung cancer [^116MKqHF]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The incidence of esophageal cancer has increased dramatically in the Western population over the last two decades. Many patients tend to present late in the disease course with symptoms of dysphagia and malnutrition. As a result, a majority of patients at presentation may require palliation of their symptoms. Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. Similar to esophageal cancer, many patients present in advanced stages, where surgical resection for cure may not be an option. Endobronchial obstruction from both primary and metastatic neoplasms causes significant morbidity.

The modalities currently available for palliation of symptoms include surgery, photodynamic therapy, dilation, external beam radiation, stents, Nd:YAG laser therapy, and brachytherapy. Each of these modalities has specific advantages and drawbacks. In this article, we discuss the role of photodynamic therapy in the palliation of esophageal and lung cancer.

### Swallowing dysfunction in cancer patients [^115PUjDa]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Acute as well as chronic dysphagia may develop in any cancer patient with oropharyngeal mucositis as a result of treatment toxicity to the esophagus or secondary infection. Acute dysphagia is estimated to occur in up to 20% of patients after high-dose radiation therapy (RT) and in up to 40% of patients treated with concurrent chemotherapy for lung cancer. Dysphagia may also develop in patients with a wide variety of malignancies treated with targeted therapies. For example, Sonis and coworkers reported dysphagia in 8.5% of patients who developed mammalian target of rapamycin-associated stomatitis. In selected cases, swallowing may be affected by the tumor itself. This is reported to occur in a small percentage of patients with lung cancer but, due to the frequency of this cancer, a large number may be affected. The most common cause of lung cancer-related dysphagia is mediastinal disease compressing the esophagus.

Metastatic breast cancer may occasionally involve the gastrointestinal tract and cause swallowing problems. Lobular breast carcinoma is most likely to metastasize into the oropharynx or the esophagus. Dysphagia has also been described as a presenting symptom of thyroid cancer or as a late side effect of treatment with radioactive iodine.

Swallowing may be impaired in patients with acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) as a result of bullous esophagitis. Additionally, chronic GVHD may result in submucosal fibrosis and occasionally in esophageal strictures. There may be fibrotic perioral skin changes, and muscles may be involved.

### Swallowing dysfunction in cancer patients [^116RAbmv]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Swallowing of food and liquids, including saliva, is a complex biomechanical interaction of physiology and anatomy that occurs in four stages: oral preparatory, oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal. The oral phases of swallowing are voluntary, followed by an involuntary reflex, requiring fast and precise coordination between sensory input and motor function controlled by the medulla in the brain stem and by the cerebral cortex. The material being swallowed is a critical factor in determining the type of swallow. For example, as the volume increases, the duration and width of opening of the upper esopharyngeal sphincter, as well as the duration of airway closure, increase. Similarly, the viscosity of the bolus affects the swallowing process. Six cranial nerves and over 25 muscles are involved, and any neurological or structural defect affects swallowing. This may result in dysphagia (swallowing dysfunction), a symptom indicating a delay in the passage of solids or liquids from the oral cavity to the stomach.

Dysphagia and odynophagia (painful swallowing) are common in cancer patients. Most studies on this complication are performed in patients with head and neck cancers (HNC), but swallowing disorders may also develop in patients with other malignancies. This narrative review will summarize literature on dysphagia in cancer aimed to inform healthcare professionals on this debilitating and potentially life-threatening complication. We focus on assessment tools, prevalence, complications, and impact on quality of life in patients with a variety of different cancers.

### Expert consensus statement: Management of dysphagia in head and neck cancer patients [^116GhMF3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). High credibility.

To develop an expert consensus statement (ECS) on the management of dysphagia in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients, experts aimed to address controversies and offer opportunities for quality improvement. Dysphagia in HNC is defined as a swallowing impairment in patients with cancers of the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, nasopharynx, oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx.

Development group members with expertise in dysphagia followed established guidelines to develop the ECS. A professional search strategist systematically reviewed the literature, utilizing the best available evidence to compose consensus statements targeted at providers managing dysphagia in adult HNC populations. The development group prioritized topics with significant practice variation and those that would enhance the quality of care for HNC patients if consensus could be reached.

The development group identified 60 candidate consensus statements based on 75 initial proposed topics and questions. These focused on addressing the following high-yield topics: risk factors, screening, evaluation, prevention, interventions, and surveillance. After two iterations of the Delphi survey and the removal of duplicative statements, 48 statements met the standardized definition for consensus, while 12 were designated as having no consensus.

Expert consensus was achieved for 48 statements pertaining to risk factors, screening, evaluation, prevention, intervention, and surveillance for dysphagia in HNC patients. Clinicians can use these statements to guide their practice effectively.

### Diagnostic evaluation of dysphagia [^1153PJYZ]. Nature Clinical Practice. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Taking a careful history is vital for the evaluation of dysphagia. The history will yield the likely underlying pathophysiologic process and anatomic site of the problem in most patients, and is crucial for determining whether subsequently detected radiographic or endoscopic 'anomalies' are relevant or incidental. Although the symptoms of pharyngeal dysphagia can be multiple and varied, the typical features of neurogenic pharyngeal dysphagia are highly specific and can accurately distinguish pharyngeal from esophageal disorders. The history will also dictate whether the next diagnostic procedure should be endoscopy, a barium swallow, or esophageal manometry. In some difficult cases, all three diagnostic techniques may need to be performed to establish an accurate diagnosis. Stroke is the most common cause of pharyngeal dysphagia. A videoradiographic swallow study is vital in such cases to determine the extent and timing of aspiration and the severity and mechanics of dysfunction as a prelude to therapy.

### Management of gastrointestinal symptoms in Parkinson's disease: A comprehensive review of clinical presentation, workup, and treatment [^112KUEK4]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

Esophageal dysphagia is among the most common gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies of dysphagia prevalence in this population have largely focused on oropharyngeal dysphagia, the management of which has been thoroughly reviewed elsewhere. The etiology of esophageal dysphagia is not yet well understood but has long been thought to involve defective coordination of the esophageal musculature due to the involvement of the dorsal nuclear vagus of the brainstem. However, like other GI symptoms, dysphagia has been known to occur before motor manifestations of PD, and patients with PD demonstrate marked histopathologic abnormalities of the esophageal enteric nervous system (ENS).

Postmortem studies of patients with PD have revealed increased Lewy bodies in the mid- and especially distal esophagus at the level of the myenteric plexus, but the correlation of esophageal Lewy pathology with dysphagia symptom severity or with esophageal manometric pattern has not been established. Regardless, esophageal dysphagia remains an important entity to address both in terms of the nutritional and symptomatic needs of patients, but also to reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia, a common cause of death in PD. Dysphagia is also associated with an increased risk of malnutrition among patients with PD and accounts for about 50% of referrals for percutaneous gastrostomy tube placements in this population. In addition, dysphagia is associated with higher levels of depression and lower quality of life.

Esophageal motility disorders per Chicago classification criteria are present in about one-third of patients with PD, although.

### Oesophageal dysphagia: A stepwise approach to diagnosis and management [^115yiHSc]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Dysphagia is a common symptom in the general population, with incidence varying depending on the specific definition used. A thorough medical history is crucial for distinguishing true oesophageal dysphagia from oropharyngeal dysphagia or other causes. Oesophageal dysphagia is considered a red flag alarm symptom that necessitates an oesophagogastroduodenoscopy.

However, even after investigations, including oesophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy, barium swallow, and oesophageal manometry, no obstructive cause may be found. This review proposes an algorithm of history-taking and investigation to identify the causes of non-obstructive dysphagia, including functional dysphagia. It then discusses management strategies and outcomes for functional dysphagia.

### Modern approaches to localized cancer of the esophagus [^114UATA5]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical spectrum of esophageal cancer has changed dramatically over the past couple of decades. Most notably, there has been a profound rise in esophageal adenocarcinoma and a decrease in the incidence of squamous carcinomas. An understanding of the factors that influence survival for patients with localized esophageal cancer has evolved concomitantly with these changes in epidemiology. Significant advancements in endoscopic and radiographic staging allow for more selective use of treatment modalities. The treatment of localized esophageal cancer mandates a multidisciplinary approach, with treatment tailored to disease extent, location, histology, and an accurate assessment of pretreatment staging. Despite these improvements in staging and the use of multimodality therapy, only modest improvements in patient survival have been observed. This article summarizes these modern approaches to localized cancer of the esophagus.

### Advances in diagnosis and management of cancer of the esophagus [^116Gmd4u]. BMJ (2024). Low credibility.

Esophageal cancer is the seventh most common malignancy worldwide, with over 470,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Two distinct histological subtypes predominate and should be considered biologically separate disease entities: esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Outcomes remain poor regardless of subtype, with most patients presenting with late-stage disease. Novel strategies to improve early detection of the respective precursor lesions, squamous dysplasia and Barrett's esophagus, offer the potential to enhance outcomes. The introduction of a limited number of biologic agents, as well as immune checkpoint inhibitors, is resulting in improvements in the systemic treatment of locally advanced and metastatic esophageal cancer. These developments, coupled with improvements in minimally invasive surgical and endoscopic treatment approaches, as well as adaptive and precision radiotherapy technologies, offer the potential to further improve outcomes. This review summarizes the latest advances in the diagnosis and management of esophageal cancer and the developments in understanding the biology of this disease.

### Esophageal stenting and radiotherapy: A multimodal approach for the palliation of symptomatic malignant dysphagia [^112hg8qx]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Esophageal stents provide immediate palliation of malignant dysphagia; however, radiotherapy (RT) is a superior long-term option. We review the outcomes of combined esophageal stenting and RT for patients with malignant dysphagia.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed patients with esophageal stents placed for palliation of malignant dysphagia due to esophageal stricture, esophageal extrinsic compression, or malignant tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). We excluded patients with radiation-induced TEF in the absence of a tumor. We analyzed and compared outcomes between patients with no RT, RT before stent placement, and RT after stent placement.

- **Results**: We placed stents in 45 patients for esophageal stricture from esophageal cancer (n = 30; 66.7%), malignant TEF (n = 8; 17.7%), and esophageal compression from airway, mediastinal, or metastatic malignancies (n = 7; 15.6%). Twenty patients (44.4%) had no RT; 25 patients had RT before stent placement (n = 16; 35.6%), RT after stent placement (n = 8; 17.8%), or both (n = 1; 2.2%). Median follow-up was 30 days. Complications requiring stent revision were similar with or without RT. Subjective symptom relief was achieved in 68.9% of all patients, with no differences noted between groups (p = 0.99). The 30-day mortality was 15.6%. Patients with RT after stent placement had a longer median survival compared to those without RT (98 vs. 38 days).

- **Conclusions**: Esophageal stent placement with RT is a safe approach for malignant dysphagia.

### Esophageal cancer: A review and update [^113E1QR8]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Although significant advancements have been made in the treatment of esophageal cancer, this aggressive malignancy commonly presents as locally advanced disease with a poor prognosis. Despite improvements in the detection of premalignant pathology, newer preventative strategies, and the development of more effective combination therapies, the overall incidence of esophageal carcinomas has risen. A clear association has been established between the development of esophageal cancer and Helicobacter pylori infection, gastroesophageal reflux disease, smoking, and heavy alcohol use.

However, the growing number of newly diagnosed esophageal adenocarcinomas, despite widespread treatments with proton pump inhibitors and the eradication of H. pylori, leaves the medical community searching for more answers. There is a potential link between esophageal adenocarcinoma and obesity.

Common presenting symptoms of esophageal cancer are dysphagia, odynophagia, and progressive weight loss. The initial assessment for patients with these symptoms is made with double-contrast barium esophagraphy. Treatment modalities include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of modalities. Prevention strategies include smoking and alcohol cessation.

### The dysphagia stress test for rapid assessment of swallowing difficulties in esophageal conditions [^115XqLpL]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

Esophageal dysphagia is a common symptom in gastroenterology practice. Existing rapid assessment tools are limited to oropharyngeal dysphagia and do not translate well to esophageal conditions. We aim to create a novel tool, the dysphagia stress test (DST), to evaluate swallowing in patients with esophageal disease characterized by dysphagia.

- **Methods**: Adults with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), achalasia, and dysphagia not otherwise specified (NOS) participated. Patient controls with non-esophageal diagnoses and healthy controls were also recruited. Participants completed the DST with five bolus challenges: water, applesauce, rice, bread, and barium tablet, and rated their swallowing difficulty and pain. A study clinician observed and documented water use and any refusal of challenges. Participants also completed measures of esophageal symptoms, hypersensitivity, and symptom anxiety to evaluate the DST's validity. Collinearity of bolus challenges guided item reduction.

- **Key results**: A total of 132 subjects participated. Both control groups and GERD patients had the best swallowing ability, while achalasia, EOE, and dysphagia NOS scored poorer. About 90% of patients were able to attempt or pass each of the bolus challenges, suggesting high acceptability. Construct validity of the DST is evidenced by modest negative correlations with symptom severity, hypersensitivity, and anxiety. The DST does not appear to be influenced by brain-gut processes. Applesauce, rice, and bread demonstrated collinearity; thus, the DST was reduced accordingly.

### Swallowing dysfunction in cancer patients [^113UJuM3]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

A research librarian conducted literature searches using MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE. The search terms included dysphagia, odynophagia, aspiration, swallowing dysfunction, esophagitis, cancer, head and neck neoplasms, chemoradiation, targeted therapies, deglutition, and deglutition disorders. The search period spanned from 1990 to 2008, with an updated search carried out by the Section Head (JRD) from 2008 to 2010, which involved MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS databases, and a reference search of relevant articles. The focus was on studies reporting dysphagia as a side effect of cancer and cancer therapy, limited to studies involving human subjects and published in English. Both original research and review articles were considered for inclusion in this narrative review. The majority of the papers involved patients with head and neck cancer (HNC), although a limited number of papers dealing with other cancers were identified. Papers were categorized into the following areas:

- **Dysphagia assessment**: The assessment methods and tools used in evaluating dysphagia were explored.
- **Dysphagia in HNC and non-HNC**: This category examined the occurrence and characteristics of dysphagia in patients with head and neck cancer compared to other cancer types.
- **Complications**: The complications arising from swallowing dysfunction as a side effect of cancer and its treatment were discussed.
- **Impact on quality of life**: The effect of swallowing dysfunction on patients' quality of life was analyzed.

### Individualized prediction of late-onset dysphagia in head and neck cancer survivors [^114C71jG]. Head & Neck (2020). Low credibility.

Limited data exist regarding which head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors will suffer from long-term dysphagia.

- **Methods**: From a population-based cohort of 1,901 Utah residents with HNC and ≥ 3 years follow-up, we determined the hazard ratio for dysphagia, aspiration pneumonia, or gastrostomy associated with various risk factors. We tested prediction models with combinations of factors and then assessed the discrimination of our final model.

- **Results**: Cancer site in the hypopharynx, advanced tumor classification, chemoradiation, preexisting dysphagia, stroke, dementia, esophagitis, esophageal spasm, esophageal stricture, gastroesophageal reflux, thrush, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were associated with an increased risk of long-term dysphagia. Our final prediction tool provides a personalized risk calculation for the diagnosis of dysphagia, aspiration pneumonia, or gastrostomy tube placement at 5, 10, and 15 years after HNC based on 18 factors.

- **Conclusion**: We developed a clinically useful risk prediction tool to identify HNC survivors most at risk for dysphagia.

### Oxaliplatin-related dysphagia: Mixed-methods study [^1157Vyvb]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2024). Low credibility.

To evaluate participant-reported atypical dysphagia symptoms and their association with oxaliplatin treatment, this observational study recruited 73 adults with solid tumors outside the head, neck, or upper gastrointestinal tract. All participants had dysphagia, were in a hospital or hospice, and were treated by Medical Oncology, Radiation Oncology, or Palliative Care. Participants reported their experiences of swallowing difficulties through semi-structured interviews. The Oral Health Assessment Tool was used to ensure swallowing difficulties were not due to mucositis. Responses were transcribed and analyzed by content analysis, and atypical difficulties were examined for association with oxaliplatin treatment using Fischer's Exact test.

Oxaliplatin treatment was found to be associated with three unusual dysphagia symptoms: problems with cold or hot bolus (p = 0.01), pins and needles (p = 0.001), and throat spasm (p = 0.035). Carbonation was problematic for one participant. For 67% of participants, the commencement of chemotherapy coincided with the onset of swallowing problems. Dysphagia symptoms were unrelated to mucositis (p = 0.165).

Swallowing difficulties in oxaliplatin-treated patients are atypical and attributable to chemotherapy commencement. Previous research suggests that dysphagia is triggered by cold exposure, but in this study, hot and carbonated boluses also caused problems. Dysphagia symptoms and triggers should be studied more fully to help patients safely enjoy their meals and prevent food avoidance, which could exacerbate malnutrition.

### Atypical dysphagia with end-stage oesophageal disease 30 years post Angelchik device placement in a 72-year-old man [^111ae3ds]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Early and definitive diagnosis of oesophageal pathology is critical to avoid long-term consequences, including oesophageal cancer and progression to end-stage oesophageal disease. In the presented case, there was no definitive diagnosis for the patient's original dysphagia. He underwent Angelchik device (AD) placement in 1983 to treat his symptoms, which were consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

The early stages of achalasia, however, are easily confused with GERD, mainly due to misinterpretation of typical clinical features such as dysphagia, heartburn, and regurgitation. This is complicated by the fact that endoscopy and radiology are frequently normal. Hence, patients are often treated for other disorders, including GERD, before the diagnosis of achalasia is established. Therefore, patients with refractory GERD should undergo oesophageal manometry to exclude motility disorders such as achalasia, which is managed differently from reflux disease.

In a recent 2-hour interview with the patient, he described frequent episodes of intermittent, severe coughing spells that regularly induced vomiting and occasional haematemesis in the few years prior to his AD placement. He also mentioned a need to artificially induce vomiting after meals. Moreover, in 1992, almost 10 years post-AD placement, he had completed a barium swallow study in Israel. The results showed slow passage of a sandwich (food bolus) which eventually stopped for more than 10 minutes mid-esophagus. In the same study, liquid passage was noted as slow, but it eventually passed.

### Esophageal cancer: Challenges, concerns, and recommendations for management amidst the COVID-19 pandemic [^112o5DiD]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Healthcare officials and international organizations have extrapolated recommendations regarding clinical practice in support of patients and healthcare providers worldwide. Updated protocols are being published in an effort to guide physicians and multidisciplinary teams responsible for the treatment of the cancer patient during the COVID-19 pandemic. Comprehensive management of esophageal cancer should emphasize carefully-designed therapeutic strategies tailored to the patient, considering the aggressive nature of the malignancy and the evolving limitations and concerns of the healthcare infrastructure. These recommendations for managing the care of esophageal cancer patients are likely to be adapted according to the rapidly changing circumstances of the ongoing pandemic.

### Esophageal cancer: Challenges, concerns, and recommendations for management amidst the COVID-19 pandemic [^111iiZSn]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

An acute respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has gripped the world in a pandemic and challenged global culture, economy, and healthcare infrastructure. The outbreak of COVID-19 initially developed in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province of China, in early December 2019. Molecular techniques and unbiased DNA sequencing led to the discovery of SARS-CoV-2, indicating a novel betacoronavirus belonging to the Sarbecovirus subgenus of the Coronaviridae family. According to the most recently reported data by international authorities on June 1, 2020, COVID-19 has been confirmed in more than 6 million cases globally, spreading at a rapid rate, with little indication of slowing despite best efforts to mitigate transmission. This seventh member of the family of coronaviruses has presently resulted in the deaths of more than 370,000 patients worldwide.

The prodromal symptoms are non-specific and mainly include fever, dry cough, and malaise, while the advanced clinical syndrome is characterized by severe pneumonia. Its clinicopathologic characteristics mimic the other well-known coronavirus strains: SARS-CoV originating from China and MERS-CoV from Saudi Arabia, both related to a fatal illness. Beyond evidence-based supportive care, the cornerstone in the management of severe respiratory viral infections, no coronavirus antiviral medications or vaccines of proven efficacy have been established for treatment. COVID-19 continues to raise considerable challenges worldwide, and it has been pronounced a public health emergency.

Regarding medical management for esophageal cancer, specifically the management of locally advanced disease, the ASTRO/STS 2024 guidelines recommend considering either a transhiatal or transthoracic approach for esophagectomy after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. It is suggested to perform a minimally invasive esophagectomy to reduce perioperative pulmonary complications and improve short-term quality of life.

### Oesophageal cancer — an overview [^114XTLZj]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Oesophageal carcinoma is one of the most virulent malignant diseases and a major cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The diagnosis and accuracy of pretreatment staging have substantially improved throughout the past three decades. Therapy is challenging, and the optimal approach is still debated. Oesophagectomy is considered the procedure of choice in patients with operable oesophageal cancer. Endoscopic measures and limited surgical procedures provide an alternative in patients with early carcinomas confined to the oesophageal mucosa. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy, are also frequently applied, either as definitive treatments or as neoadjuvant therapies within multimodal approaches.

The question of whether multimodal treatment offers improved results has been the focus of many studies since the 1990s. Although results are discordant, and even some meta-analyses remain inconclusive, it is now widely accepted that multimodal therapy leads to a modest survival benefit. The role of minimally invasive oesophagectomy is not yet defined. Endoscopic stent insertion, radiotherapy, and other palliative measures provide relief of tumour-related symptoms in advanced, unresectable tumour stages.

### Oropharyngeal dysphagia: Manifestations and diagnosis [^115g3c5M]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Swallowing disorders (dysphagia) have been recognized by the WHO as a medical disability associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and costs of care. With increasing survival rates and the aging of the population, swallowing disorders and their role in causing pulmonary and nutritional pathologies are becoming exceedingly important. Over the past two decades, the study of oropharyngeal dysphagia has been approached from various disciplines, resulting in considerable progress in understanding its pathophysiology.

This review describes the most frequent manifestations of oropharyngeal dysphagia and the clinical, as well as instrumental, techniques available to diagnose patients with dysphagia. However, the clinical value of these diagnostic tests and their sensitivity in predicting outcomes is limited. Despite substantial clinical research efforts, conventional diagnostic methods for oropharyngeal dysphagia have limited proven accuracy in predicting aspiration and respiratory disease. It is contended that incorporating measurable objective assessments into clinical diagnosis is needed and might be key in developing novel therapeutic strategies.

### Esophageal cancer: Challenges, concerns, and recommendations for management amidst the COVID-19 pandemic [^113xtAHb]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

When esophageal cancer (EC) is newly diagnosed, the decision for the most appropriate treatment strategy normally falls upon a multidisciplinary care team who remain responsible for the patient. In a viral pandemic, clinicians should balance the need to perform life-prolonging surgery and offer perioperative therapies with a patient's risk of contracting severe pneumonia if infected with SARS-CoV-2. Treatment strategies may need to be based on the pathophysiology of two major variants, squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma, and recommendations may thus differ.

Patients diagnosed with early EC cT1aN0M0 (UICC classification 7th edition), regardless of the histologic subtype, will benefit from an endoscopic resection with a same-day discharge if the procedure is uneventful, since endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection are considered minimally invasive techniques. Whether endoscopic therapy for this indication should be postponed, given the risk of progression to a more advanced stage during the pandemic, remains unclear.

In patients with lesions limited to the submucosa (cT1b), an esophagectomy remains ideal. While most patients who get infected remain asymptomatic carriers or develop only mild flu symptoms, the high morbidity and mortality in severe cases should dictate a highly cautious approach with a significant index of suspicion. It is highly imperative that an alternative "rescue" approach might be considered. Endoscopic resection with intense endoscopic imaging follow-up based on the risk of the involved lymph node disease (e.g. up to 50%).

### The influence of surgical factors on persisting symptoms 3 years after esophageal cancer surgery: A population-based study in Sweden [^115YDm77]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Little is known about the long-term effects of surgical approach and type of anastomosis in the surgical treatment of esophageal cancer on patient-reported outcomes.

- **Methods**: A Swedish nationwide, population-based cohort study included patients undergoing esophagectomy for esophageal cancer in 2001–2005. The predefined exposures included surgical approach (transhiatal or transthoracic) and anastomotic technique (hand-sewn or mechanical). The outcomes were esophageal-specific symptoms 3 years after the surgery. Symptoms were measured using the cancer-specific quality of life questionnaire, the QLQ-C30, supplemented by an esophageal cancer-specific module (QLQ-OES18), both developed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer. Logistic regression models were used to estimate relative risk, expressed as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), of experiencing symptoms as assessed by the questionnaires.

- **Results**: Among the 178 included patients, there was an 84% participation rate. No statistically significant differences were found regarding surgical approach. However, point estimates indicate that patients operated on with a transhiatal approach had a lower risk for symptoms of nausea and vomiting (OR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.1–1.9), diarrhea (OR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.2–1.8), and trouble swallowing (OR = 0.4, 95% CI 0–3), and a slightly higher risk for loss of appetite (OR = 2, 95% CI 0.7–5.6) compared with patients operated on with a transthoracic approach. Anastomotic technique did not seem to influence the risk for any of the selected.
